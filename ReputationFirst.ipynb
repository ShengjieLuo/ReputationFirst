    "In this project, we designed, implemented ReputationFirst, a public opinion research system based on public media. Our goal is to build a useful system that can collect, process and analyse public opinions about companies based on public media efficiently, and calculate these companies' reputation based on NLP techniques.\n",

    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "There's many important factors that a technique compnay should care about. Such as human resource, the technique trend, management, operations and so on. As a manager of a company, one should take all those factor into consideration to make money, and these factors should be studied by the manager. Among all these factors, there's one very important one but has rarely been researched, that is the **public report and reputation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why public report can impact a company so much. The reason is easy, as the developement of communication tools and the media techniques. Every one can be exported to a lot of pubilc information from Internet, newspapers and even self-media such as Facebook and Twitter poster, which means once a event has been public or reported, it will spread all over the world in few seconds. As people receives these information, they will read and think about the news and make their own judgement, investment decision, and emotion to these news and the companies involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opinions from all readers make a general response to a news, and this response will impact the company, a famous example is that Facebook admitted data leak hits 87 million users, widening privacy scandal. When this event is public, people's trust in Facebook is badly hurt and many people started to delete Facebook application from their cell phone, which further cause the stock price of Facebook decrease a lot. Another positive example is also about Facebook, when Facebook admitted its own fault and announced that it will cooperate with British government to protect users' data from third-party companies, this operation has been reported positively and the readers start to forgive and trust Facebook again, therefore, their stock price start to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShengjieLuo/ReputationFirst/master/image/motivation.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From these examples we can see that when people do not know that Facebook was leaking their information, their's nothing special happened although actually Facebook was doing bad things. People started to give response when this event has been public and reported by media. We can make this judgement that **the reputation of a company is deeply related to the news about this company**. If there's always good news from all media about one company, it's impossible that this company has a bad reputation, vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this assumption, we think it would be quite interesting to collect and analyze the news of every company in this world, and conclude their reputation from these news. If we can do that automatically, from a manager's aspect, one can just **use the news as the input, get their reputation today, and make decisions according to it**. From a investor's aspect, one can make investment decision according to this company's reputation by simply use our tool to analyse news about one company. For a normal user, well, one can still know what others and public media thinks about one company. It's a very useful and excited way to build a bridge from public news and the company's reputation, and this idea motivates us to dive deeply into this interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, our contributions is \n",
    "1. We collect **multiple sources** of news and extract news about technique companies efficiently by **distributed internet crawler**.\n",
    "2. We take advantage of Google Cloud Platform and **Spark** to speed up ETL and NLP data anlysis.\n",
    "2. We use **TextRank** algorithm and NLTK **sentiment analysis** tools to calculate the reputation score of each technique company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there's no ground truth for reputation, we evaluate our system by multiple factors such as significant change of stock price and big event/news happend.\n"

    "# 3. Architecture\n",
    "<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShengjieLuo/ReputationFirst/master/image/arch.jpg width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We use distributed internet spider to crawl articles from Reuters, NewYork Times and Wall Street Journals, after which we use Spark to clean data and apply textrank algorithm to extract the summary from original text. In the next step, python NLTK is a good solution to handle sentiment analysis and extract media attitude. Finally, these messages are combined to predict the reputation score.\n",

    "<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShengjieLuo/ReputationFirst/master/image/analysis.jpg width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the largest challenges is how to process 2GB data and 600 Million tokens efficiently in 3 different tasks, including *ETL* task, *textrank* task and *sentiment analysis* task. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a typical **Iterative Machine Learning** workload, in which the intermediate result of previous stages would then be used in the next stage. And one of the best method to accelerate the Iterative Machine Learning is to use the **Spark+Yarn+CloudCluster** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we use a spark cluster with 8 cores to accelerate the workload from 73.9 hours to 9.8 hours.\n"

    "# 4. Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we would introduce the implementation of this project.\n",
    "## 4.1 Distributed Internet Crawler\n",
    "In this project, we use distributed Internet Spider to crawl media articles from different sources. However, it is not easy to crawl the history data from media website directly for following reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Not only article links are listed in the website, also you could find the advertisement links, recommendation links and so on.\n",
    "+ The website content is customized based on user’s habit and varies from different users in each single view.\n",
    "+ The anti-crawler is setup for these popular websites to avoid an overflow network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the observation above, we have to give up the attempts of fetching contents from the original websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that saome popular newspapers and magazines provide the **archive database** for users publicly, which is usually the printable and readable version of articles. Compared with the website content, it provides following features:\n",
    "+ It provides all articles published without customer bias.\n",
    "+ There is no or much less advertisement and other links.\n",
    "+ The content could be fetched from the html webpage directly by beautiful soup\n",
    "+ Usually, the content is marked with clear timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the archives for popular medias, we take the content from May.01 as an example here. Note that usually only the traditional media provides the archive as a summarization of past articles, while internet media or web media does not provide similar service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TypeA: Newspaper & Maganizes**\n",

    "*Newyork Times*\n",

    "As described in the design part above, the overall idea is to first preprocess raw dataset we get to produce their abstract or simply original text. Then the problem becomes how to use these texts to reflect companies' reputation. One straight forward idea is to use sentiment analysis. However, we met several practical problems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).\n",

    "In our application, we use attitude as our main target of sentiment analysis. This is because we want to know attitudes that general trend of popular media holds toward certain company, which helps to reflect the overall reputation.\n",

    "### Details with attitude analysis\n",
    "There are several different component when analyzing the attitude in each articles. We need to determine: 1) The holder (source) of the attitude. 2) The aspect (target) of the attitude. 3) The detailed type of attitude, including different positive and negtive words and weighting between them. 4) The scope of certain type attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of words --- Input of Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "We use the simplest model to do sentiment analysis, which is just input the adjecent words with the company name. We have also tried to use EM model to refine this input model. However, one problem is that in each article, the words that appears in the bag is very sparse. In other words, it's hard to use posterior knowledge to refine this model.\n",

    "Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. It is an important step for a lot of higher level NLP tasks that involve natural language understanding such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why coreferrence resolution\n",
    "When we are exploring news articles we get from various sources, one interesting fact is that most of the time, the company's name may appear only a few times even if it's the main character in the article. And most of other appearance may be 'it', 'the company' and even its CEO or chairman. This lead to the problem that the number of candidates is too small when we use bag of words algorithm to do sentiment analysis of a certain article, if we just use the company name as key word without resolution of these references. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage of coreference resolution\n",
    "Here we uses Stanford Core NLP toolkits to help us pre-process the coreferences. One problem to use the toolkit is that it's written in Java and only has limited support for Python. So we build a local NLP server with following command:\n",
