Though the results are different, the name is the same: androgenetic alopecia. The American Hair Loss Association website says women account for up to 40 percent of hair-loss sufferers. I imagine most of us dislike publicly discussing how emotionally traumatizing it is to lose this signifier of beauty.\n\nI was 26 and studying in Barcelona when I first noticed strands of my hair all over the tiled apartment floor, collecting in the corners and in the shower.

In a study that Rothman carried out in 2016 of 72 high schoolers ages 16 and 17, teenagers reported that porn was their primary source for information about sex \u2014 more than friends, siblings, schools or parents.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to learn about sex,\u201d the suburban boy told me. \u201cAnd porn stars know what they are doing.\u201d His words reflect a paradox about sex and pornography in this country. Even as smartphones have made it easier for teenagers to watch porn, sex education in the United States \u2014 where abstinence-based sex education remains the norm \u2014 is meager. Massachusetts is among 26 states that do not mandate sex ed. And a mere 13 require that the material be medically and scientifically accurate. After some gains by the Obama administration to promote more comprehensive sex ed, which includes pregnancy prevention, discussions of anatomy, birth control, disease prevention, abstinence and healthy relationships, the Trump administration did not include the program in its proposed 2018 budget; it also has requested increased funding for abstinence education. Easy-to-access online porn fills the vacuum, making porn the de facto sex educator for American youth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne Thursday afternoon, about a dozen teenagers sat in a semicircle of North Face zip-ups, Jordans, combat boots, big hoop earrings and the slumped shoulders of late afternoon. It was the third week of Porn Literacy, and everyone already knew the rules: You don\u2019t have to have watched porn to attend; no yucking someone else\u2019s yum \u2014 no disparaging a student\u2019s sexual tastes or sexuality. And avoid sharing personal stories about sex in class. Nicole Daley and Jess Alder, who wrote the curriculum with Emily Rothman and led most of the exercises and discussion, are in their 30s, warm and easygoing. Daley, who until last month was the director of Start Strong, played the slightly more serious favorite-aunt role, while Alder, who runs Start Strong\u2019s classes for teenagers, was the goofier, ask-me-anything big sister. Rothman also attended most of the classes, offering information about pornography studies and explaining to them, for example, that there is no scientific evidence that porn is addictive, but that people can become compulsive about it.\n\nIn the first class, Daley led an exercise in which the group defined porn terms (B.D.S.M., kink, soft-core, hard-core), so that, as she put it, \u201ceveryone is on the same page\u201d and \u201cyou can avoid clicking on things you don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The students also \u201cvalues voted\u201d \u2014 agreeing or disagreeing about whether the legal viewing age of 18 for porn is too high, if working in the porn industry is a good way to make money and if pornography should be illegal. Later, Daley held up images of a 1940s pinup girl, a Japanese geisha and Kim Kardashian, to talk about how cultural values about beauty and bodies change over time. In future classes, they would talk about types of intimacy not depicted in porn and nonsexist pickup lines. Finally, Daley would offer a lesson about sexting and sexting laws and the risks of so-called revenge porn (in which, say, a teenager circulates a naked selfie of an ex without consent). And to the teenagers\u2019 surprise, they learned that receiving or sending consensual naked photos, even to your boyfriend or girlfriend, can be against the law if the person in the photo is a minor.\n\nNow, in the third week of class, Daley\u2019s goal was to undercut porn\u2019s allure for teenagers by exposing the underbelly of the business. \u201cWhen you understand it\u2019s not just two people on the screen but an industry,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s not as sexy.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Daley started class by detailing a midlevel female performer\u2019s salary (taken from the 2008 documentary \u201cThe Price of Pleasure\u201d): \u201cBlow job: $300,\u201d Daley read from a list. \u201cAnal: $1,000. Double penetration: $1,200. Gang bang: $1,300 for three guys. $100 for each additional guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Drew muttered. \u201cThat makes it nasty now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing for being penetrated on camera,\u201d another boy said.\n\nThen, as if they had been given a green light to ask about a world that grown-ups rarely acknowledge, they began peppering Daley, Rothman and Alder with questions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHow much do men get paid?\u201d one girl asked. It is the one of the few professions in which men are paid less, Rothman explained, but they also typically have longer careers. How long do women stay in their jobs? On average, six to 18 months. How do guys get erections if they aren\u2019t turned on? Often Viagra, Rothman offered, and sometimes a \u201cfluffer,\u201d as an offscreen human stimulator is known.\n\nDaley then asked the teenagers to pretend they were contestants on a reality-TV show, in which they had to decide if they were willing to participate in certain challenges (your parents might be watching) and for how much money. In one scenario, she said, you would kneel on the ground while someone poured a goopy substance over your face. In another, you\u2019d lick a spoon that had touched fecal matter. The kids debated the fecal-matter challenge \u2014 most wouldn\u2019t to do it for less than $2 million. One wanted to know if the goop smelled. \u201cCan we find out what it is?\u201d asked another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen Daley explained that each was in fact a simulation of a porn act. The goopy substance was what\u2019s called a \u201cbaker\u2019s dozen,\u201d in which 13 men ejaculate on a woman\u2019s face, breasts and mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d a girl named Tiffany protested.\n\nThe second scenario \u2014 licking the spoon with fecal matter \u2014 was from a porn act known as A.T.M., in which a man puts his penis in a woman\u2019s anus and then immediately follows by sticking it in her mouth.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d a 15-year-old boy said. \u201cCan\u2019t you wash in between?\u201d\n\nNope, Daley said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t question it when we see it in porn, right?\u201d Daley went on. \u201cThere\u2019s no judgment here, but some of you guys are squeamish about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew any of this,\u201d Drew said, sounding a bit glum.\n\nDaley went on to detail a 2010 study that coded incidents of aggression in best-selling 2004 and 2005 porn videos. She noted that 88 percent of scenes showed verbal or physical aggression, mostly spanking, slapping and gagging. (A more recent content analysis of more than 6,000 mainstream online heterosexual porn scenes by Bryant Paul and his colleagues defined aggression specifically as any purposeful action appearing to cause physical or psychological harm to another person and found that 33 percent of scenes met that criteria. In each study, women were on the receiving end of the aggression more than 90 percent of the time.)\n\n\u201cDo you think,\u201d Daley said, standing in front of the students, \u201cwatching porn leads to violence against women? There\u2019s no right or wrong here. It\u2019s a debate.\u201d\n\nKyrah, a 10th-grade feminist with an athlete\u2019s compact body and a tendency to speak her opinions, didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIn porn they glamorize calling women a slut or a whore, and younger kids think this is how it is. Or when they have those weird porn scenes and the woman is saying, \u2018Stop touching me,\u2019 and then she ends up enjoying it!\u201d\n\nTiffany, her best friend, snapped her fingers in approval.\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d one guy interjected. \u201cWhen a man is choking a woman in porn, people know it is not real, and they aren\u2019t supposed to do it, because it\u2019s violence.\u201d He was the same teenager who told me he would just \u201cdo\u201d anal sex without asking a girl, because the women in porn like it.\n\nPornography didn\u2019t create the narrative that male pleasure should be first and foremost. But that idea is certainly reinforced by \u201ca male-dominated porn industry shot through a male lens,\u201d as Cindy Gallop puts it. Gallop is the creator of an online platform called MakeLoveNotPorn, where users can submit videos of their sexual encounters \u2014 which she describes as \u201creal world,\u201d consensual sex with \u201cgood values\u201d \u2014 and pay to watch videos of others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor years, Gallop has been a one-woman laboratory witnessing how easy-to-access mainstream porn influences sex. Now in her 50s, she has spent more than a decade dating 20-something men. She finds them through \u201ccougar\u201d dating sites \u2014 where older women connect with younger men \u2014 and her main criterion is that they are \u201cnice.\u201d Even so, she told me, during sex with these significantly younger nice men, she repeatedly encounters porn memes: facials, \u201cjackhammering\u201d intercourse, more frequent requests for anal sex and men who seem less focused on female orgasms than men were when she was younger. Gallop takes it upon herself to \u201cre-educate,\u201d as she half-jokingly puts it, men raised on porn. Some people, of course, do enjoy these acts. But speaking of teenagers in particular, she told me she worries that hard-core porn leads many girls to think, for example, that \u201call boys love coming on girls\u2019 faces, and all girls love having their faces come on. And therefore, girls feel they must let boys come on their face and pretend to like it.\u201d\n\nThough none of the boys I spoke to at Start Strong told me they had ejaculated on a girl\u2019s face, Gallop\u2019s words reminded me of conversations I had with some older high-schoolers in various cities. One senior said that ejaculating on a woman\u2019s face was in a majority of porn scenes he had watched, and that he had done it with a girlfriend. \u201cI brought it up, or she would say, \u2018Come on my face.\u2019 It was an aspect I liked \u2014 and she did, too.\u201d\n\nAnother noted that the act is \u201ctalked about a lot\u201d among guys, but said that \u201ca girl\u2019s got to be down with it\u201d before he\u2019d ever consider doing it. \u201cThere is something that\u2019s appealing for guys. The dominance and intimacy and that whole opportunity for eye contact. Guys are obsessed with their come displayed on a girl.\u201d\n\nMany girls at Start Strong were decidedly less enthusiastic. One senior told me a boyfriend asked to ejaculate on her face; she said no. And during a conversation I had with three girls, one senior wondered aloud: \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t want a facial? What are you supposed to do? Friends say a boy cleans it with a napkin. A lot of girls my age like facials.\u201d But a few moments later, she reversed course. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think they like it. They do it because their partner likes it.\u201d Next to her, a sophomore added that when older girls talk among themselves, many say it\u2019s gross. \u201cBut they say you gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d And if you don\u2019t, the first girl added, \u201cthen someone else will.\u201d\n\nThese are not new power dynamics between girls and boys. In a 2014 British study about anal sex and teenagers, girls expressed a similar lack of sexual agency and experienced physical pain. In the survey, of 130 heterosexual teenagers age 16 to 18, teenagers often said they believed porn was a motivating factor for why males wanted anal sex. And among the guys who reported trying it, many said friends encouraged them, or they felt competitive with other guys to do it. At the same time, a majority of girls who had tried anal sex said they didn\u2019t actually want to; their partners persuaded or coerced them. Some males took a \u201ctry it and see\u201d approach, as researchers called it, attempting to put their finger or penis in a girl\u2019s anus and hoping she didn\u2019t stop them. Sometimes, one teenager reported, you \u201cjust keep going till they just get fed up and let you do it anyway.\u201d Both boys and girls blamed the girls for pain they felt during anal sex and some told researchers the girls needed to \u201crelax\u201d more or \u201cget used to it.\u201d Only one girl said she enjoyed it, and only a few boys did. Teenagers may not know that even while porn makes it seem commonplace, in the 2009 national survey of American sex habits, most men and women who tried anal sex didn\u2019t make it a regular part of their sex lives. And in another study, by Indiana University\u2019s Debby Herbenick and others in 2015, about 70 percent of women who had anal sex said they experienced pain.\n\nDrew had firsthand experience with what he had seen in porn not translating into actual pleasure. The first time he had sex, he thought he was supposed to exert some physical control over his girlfriend. But the whole thing felt awkward, too rough and not all that fun. And things that looked easy in porn, like sex while taking a shower or mutual oral sex, didn\u2019t go so well.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt one point during sex, Drew\u2019s girlfriend at the time, who was a year older and more experienced, asked him to put his hand around her neck during sex. He did it, without squeezing, and though it didn\u2019t exactly bother him, it felt uncomfortable. Drew never asked if she got the idea from porn, but it made him wonder. Had she also picked up other ways of acting? \u201cLike, how do you really know a girl has had a good time?\u201d he said one afternoon, musing aloud while sitting with some friends before Porn Literacy class. \u201cMy girlfriend said she had a good time,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe was moaning. But that\u2019s the thing: Is it fake moaning?\u201d\n\nEven if you know porn isn\u2019t realistic, it still sets up expectations, one senior told me. In porn, he said, \u201cthe clothes are off, and the girl goes down on the guy, he gets hard and he starts having sex with her. It\u2019s all very simple and well lit.\u201d Before he had sex, porn had supplied his images of oral sex, including scenes in which a woman is on her knees as a man stands over her. At one point, he thought that\u2019s how it might go one day when he had sex. But when he talked with his girlfriend, they realized they didn\u2019t want to re-enact that power dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI spent a couple of hours on a Wednesday afternoon at Start Strong with a senior girl who took the first Porn Literacy class in the summer of 2016. Looking back over the last several years of middle and high school, A., who asked me to identify her by the first initial of her middle name, said she wished she had had someplace \u2014 home, school, a community sex-ed program \u2014 to learn about sex. Instead, she learned about it from porn. She saw it for the first time by accident, after a group of sixth-grade boys cajoled her to look at tube8.com, which she didn\u2019t know was a porn site. She was fascinated. She had never seen a penis before, \u201cnot a drawing of one, nothing.\u201d A few years later, she searched online for porn again after listening to girls in the high school locker room talk about masturbation. A.\u2019s parents, whom she describes as conservative about sex, hadn\u2019t talked to her about female anatomy or sex, and her school didn\u2019t offer any sex education before ninth grade; even then, it focused mostly on the dangers \u2014 sexually transmitted infections and diseases and pregnancy.\n\nAside from some private schools and innovative community programs, relatively few sex-ed classes in middle and high school delve in detail into anatomy (female, especially), intimacy, healthy relationships, sexual diversity. Even more rare are discussions of female desire and pleasure. Porn taught A. the basics of masturbation. And porn served as her study guide when she was 16 and was the first among her friends to have sex. She clicked through videos to watch women giving oral sex. She focused on how they moved during sex and listened to how they moaned. She began shaving her vulva (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone in porn have sex with hair on it\u201d).\n\nPorn is \u201cnot all bad,\u201d said A., who was frank and funny, with a slew of advanced-placement classes on her transcript and a self-assured manner that impresses adults. \u201cI got my sexual ways from porn, and I like the way I am.\u201d But what she learned from porn had downsides too. Because she assumed women\u2019s pleasure in porn was real, when she first had intercourse and didn\u2019t have an orgasm, she figured that was just how it went.\n\nFor A., it wasn\u2019t enough to know that porn was fake sex. She wanted to understand how real sex worked. Rothman and her team did consult a sex educator while they were writing the Porn Literacy curriculum but decided to include only some basic information about safe sex. It came in the form of a \u201cPorn Jeopardy\u201d game during one class. The teenagers, clustered in teams, chose from four categories: S.T.D./S.T.I.s, Birth Control, Teen Violence/Sexual Assault and Porn on the Brain.\n\n\u201cS.T.I.s/S.T.D.s for $300,\u201d one student called out.\n\n\u201cWhy is lubrication important for sex?\u201d Alder asked.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s lubrication?\u201d Drew asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lube,\u201d another teenager said, in an attempt to explain.\n\n\u201cIs lubrication only the little tube-y things?\u201d a girl with long black hair asked. \u201cOr can it be natural?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never learned this before,\u201d Drew announced to the class after it was mentioned that lubrication decreased friction, increased pleasure and could reduce the risk of tearing and therefore of S.T.I.s and S.T.D.s. Drew\u2019s only sliver of sex ed was in sixth grade with the school gym teacher, who sweated as he talked about sex, \u201cand it was all about it being bad and we shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs if to rectify that, Alder offered a quick anatomy lesson, drawing a vulva on the whiteboard and pointing out the clitoris, the vagina, the urethra. \u201cThis is called a vulva,\u201d she said. Alder repeated the word slowly and loudly, as if instructing the students in a foreign language. It was both for humor and to normalize a word that some of them may have been hearing for the first time. \u201cThis is the clitoris,\u201d Alder went on. \u201cThis is where women get most pleasure. Most women do not have a G spot. If you want to know how to give a woman pleasure, it\u2019s the clitoris.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d Rothman said quietly. Alder had just inched across a line in which anatomy rested on one side and female desire and pleasure on the other. It was a reminder that as controversial as it is to teach kids about pornography, it can be more taboo to teach them how their bodies work sexually. \u201cThe class is about critically analyzing sexually explicit media,\u201d Rothman told me later, \u201cnot how to have sex. We want to stay in our narrow lane and not be seen as promoting anything parents are uncomfortable with.\u201d Daley added: \u201cI wish it were different, but we have to be aware of the limitations of where we are as a society.\u201d\n\nPorn education is such new territory that no one knows the best practices, what material should be included and where to teach it. (Few people are optimistic that it will be taught anytime soon in public schools.) Several years ago, L. Kris Gowen, a sexuality educator and author of the 2017 book \u201cSexual Decisions: The Ultimate Teen Guide,\u201d wrote extensive guidelines for teaching teenagers to critique \u201csexually explicit media\u201d (she avoided the more provocative term \u201cporn literacy\u201d). Even though Oregon, where Gowen lives, has one of the most comprehensive sex-ed programs in the country, Gowen said that teachers felt unequipped to talk about porn. And though the guidelines have been circulated at education conferences and made publicly available, Gowen doesn\u2019t know of a single educator who has implemented them. In part, she says, people may be waiting for a better sense of what\u2019s effective. But also, many schools and teachers are nervous about anything that risks them being \u201caccused of promoting porn.\u201d\n\nThe most recent sex-education guidelines from the World Health Organization\u2019s European office note that educators should include discussions about the influence of pornography on sexuality starting with late elementary school and through high school. The guidelines don\u2019t, however, provide specific ideas on how to have those conversations.\n\nIn Britain, nonprofit organizations and a teachers\u2019 union, along with members of Parliament, have recommended that schools include discussions about the influence of porn on how children view sex and relationships. Magdalena Mattebo, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden who studies pornography and adolescents, would like porn literacy mandated in her country. \u201cWe are a little lost in how to handle this,\u201d Mattebo told me.\n\nMore than 300 schools, youth and community groups and government agencies in Australia and New Zealand use components of a porn-education resource called \u201cIn the Picture\u201d that includes statistics, studies and exercises primarily for teenagers. It was created by Maree Crabbe, an expert on sexual violence and pornography education, who lives near Melbourne, Australia. As she put it during a United States training program for educators and social workers that I attended in 2016: \u201cWe want to be positive about sex, positive about masturbation and critical of pornography.\u201d One key component of the program is often neglected in porn literacy: providing training to help parents understand and talk about these issues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

The Porn Conversation links to research and articles and provides practical tips for parents, including talking to kids about the ways mainstream porn doesn\u2019t represent typical bodies or mutually satisfying sex and avoiding accusatory questions about why your kid is watching porn and who showed it to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018I don\u2019t like mainstream porn because it\u2019s chauvinistic,\u2019 \u201d says Lust, whose films feature female-centered pleasure. \u201cWe have given our children technology, so we need to teach them how to handle it.\u201d But she takes it a step further by suggesting that parents of middle- and high-schoolers talk to their teenagers about \u201chealthy porn,\u201d which she says includes showing female desire and pleasure and being made under fair working conditions. I asked Lust if she would steer her daughters in that direction when they are older (they are 7 and 10). \u201cI would recommend good sites to my daughters at age 15, when I think they are mature enough. We are so curious to find out about sex. People have doubts and insecurities about themselves sexually. \u2018Is it O.K. that I like that, or this?\u2019 I think porn can be a good thing to have as an outlet. I\u2019m not scared by explicit sex per se. I\u2019m afraid of the bad values.\u201d\n\nTristan Taormino, another feminist porn filmmaker and author, speaks frequently on college campuses and produces explicit sex-ed videos for adults. \u201cThe party line is we don\u2019t want teenagers watching our videos,\u201d she says, noting they are rated XXX. \u201cBut do I wish teenagers had access to some of the elements of it?\u201d In addition to seeing consent, she said, \u201cthey would see people talking to each other, and they\u2019d see a lot of warm-up. We show lube, we show sex toys.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat may be more than most parents, even of older teenagers, can bear. But even if parents decided to help their teenagers find these sites, not only is it illegal to show any kind of porn \u2014 good or bad \u2014 to anyone under 18, but, really, do teenagers want their parents to do so? And which ones would parents recommend for teenagers? \u201cUnlike organic food, there\u2019s no coding system for ethical or feminist porn,\u201d Crabbe notes. \u201cThey might use condoms and dental dams and still convey the same gender and aggression dynamics.\u201d Also, \u201cgood porn\u201d isn\u2019t typically free or nearly as accessible as the millions of videos streaming on mainstream sites.\n\nAl Vernacchio, a nationally known sexuality educator who teaches progressive sex ed at a private Quaker school outside Philadelphia, believes the better solution is to make porn literacy part of the larger umbrella of comprehensive sex education. Vernacchio, who is the author of the 2014 book \u201cFor Goodness Sex: Changing the Way We Talk to Teens About Sexuality, Values, and Health,\u201d is one of those rare teenage-sex educators who talks directly to his high school students about sexual pleasure and mutuality, along with the ingredients for healthy relationships. The problem with porn \u201cis not just that it often shows misogynistic, unhealthy representations of relationships,\u201d Vernacchio says. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn relationship skills from porn, and if you are looking for pleasure and connection, porn can\u2019t teach you how to have those.\u201d\n\nCrabbe notes one effective way to get young men to take fewer lessons from porn: \u201cTell them if you want to be a lazy, selfish lover, look at porn. If you want to be a lover where your partner says, \u2018That was great,\u2019 you won\u2019t learn it from porn.\u201d And parents should want their teenagers to be generous lovers, Cindy Gallop argues. \u201cOur parents bring us up to have good manners, a work ethic. But nobody brings us up to behave well in bed.\u201d\n\nTo prepare his students to be comfortable and respectful in sexual situations, Vernacchio shows photos, not just drawings, of genitalia to his high-schoolers. \u201cMost people are having sex with real people, not porn stars, and real bodies are highly variable. I would much rather my students have that moment of asking questions or confusion or even laughter in my classroom rather than when they see their partner\u2019s naked body for the first time.\u201d He, along with Debby Herbenick, who is also the author of the 2012 book \u201cSex Made Easy: Your Awkward Questions Answered for Better, Smarter Amazing Sex,\u201d advocate that adolescents should understand that most females don\u2019t have orgasms by penetration alone, and that clitoral stimulation often requires oral sex, fingers and sex toys. As she notes: \u201cIt\u2019s part of human life, and you teach it in smart, sensitive ways.\u201d\n\nAs the students from the first Porn Literacy classes moved through their lives in the year after their courses ended, some things from the discussions stayed with them. In surveys from the first three sets of classes, one-third of the students still said they would agree to do things from porn if their partner asked them to. Several also wanted to try things they saw in porn. They were, after all, normal, sexually curious, experimenting teenagers. But only a tiny number of students agreed in the postclass survey that \u201cmost people like to be slapped, spanked or have their hair pulled during sex,\u201d compared with 27 percent at the start of class. And while at the beginning, 45 percent said that porn was a good way for young people to learn about sex, now only 18 percent agreed. By the end of the class, no one said pornography was realistic; just over one-quarter had believed that at the outset. The survey didn\u2019t reveal the catalyst for the changes. Was it the curriculum itself? Was it something about Daley and Alder\u2019s teaching style? It\u2019s possible the students created the changes themselves, teaching one another through their in-class debates and discussions.\n\nA., the young woman who said she had never seen an image of a penis until she watched porn, resisted the idea that porn was uniformly bad for teenagers. \u201cAt least kids are watching porn and not going out and getting pregnant,\u201d she said. But recently, she told me that she\u2019d given up watching it altogether. She disliked looking at women\u2019s expressions now, believing that they probably weren\u2019t experiencing pleasure and might be in pain. When Drew watched porn, he found himself wondering if women were having sex against their will. As another student said with a sigh: \u201cNicole and Jess ruined porn for us.\u201d\n\nIn the months after the class, A. had created a new mission for herself: She was going to always have orgasms during sex. \u201cAnd I did it!\u201d she told me. It helped that she had been in a relationship with a guy who was open and asked what she liked. But even if Porn Literacy didn\u2019t go into as many details about sex as she would have liked, \u201cin this indirect way, the class shows what you deserve and don\u2019t deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIn porn, the guy cares only about himself. I used to think more about \u2018Am I doing something right or wrong?\u2019 \u201d Porn may neglect women\u2019s orgasms, but A. wasn\u2019t going to anymore.\n\nDrew, who had once used porn as his main sex educator, was now thinking about sex differently. \u201cSome things need to come to us naturally, not by watching it and seeing what turns you on,\u201d he told me. The discussions about anatomy and fake displays of pleasure made him realize that girls didn\u2019t always respond as they did in porn and that they didn\u2019t all want the same things. And guys didn\u2019t, either. Maybe that porn clip in which the nice, tender guy didn\u2019t excite the girl was wrong. What Drew needed was a girl who was open and honest, as he was, and with whom he could start to figure out how to have good sex. It would take some time and most likely involve some fumbling. But Drew was O.K. with that. He was just starting out.", "title": "What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn", "authors": ["Maggie Jones"]}

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "Moreover, the emphasis on \u201cinalienable human rights\u201d\u2014 a phrase, Weil declares, history has shown to be meaningless \u2014 blinds us to the only true good, one rooted in what Weil calls the \u201cimpersonal.\u201d This term, paradoxically, describes what is most essential to our flesh and blood lives: the needs shared by all human beings and the obligations (and not rights) to one another that they entail. These needs, listed in her \u201cDraft for a Statement of Human Obligations,\u201d include nourishment and clothing, medical care and housing, as well as protection against violence. (Though opposed to capital punishment, Weil made an exception for rape.)\n\nWith her knack for striking illustrations, Weil confronts us with the limits of rights claims. \u201cIf someone tries to browbeat a farmer to sell his eggs at a moderate price, the farmer can say: \u2018I have the right to keep my eggs if I don\u2019t get a good enough price.\u2019 But if a young girl is being forced into a brothel she will not talk about her rights. In such a situation, the word would sound ludicrously inadequate.\u201d\n\nThis is why, when we ask why we have less than others, we are getting personal, but when we ask why we are being hurt, we are getting impersonal. And for Weil, the impersonal is good in every sense of the word. In the case of her illustration, Weil finds the notion of rights ludicrous because the girl is not being cheated of a profit. Instead, she is being cheated of her very humanity. There is no true compensation for such acts. And yet, by confusing personal rights with impersonal (or universally shared) needs, we burden ourselves with a language that deflects us from what is truly at stake. As Weil declares: \u201cThere is something sacred in every human being, but it is not their person. It is this human being; no more and no less.\u201d\n\nWhile Weil was responding to the crisis of Western democracies confronting the challenge of fascism, her essays can also help us think about our own crisis of political governance and legitimacy. Take the current debate over the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, or food stamps. Rather than receiving cash installments on their electronic benefit-transfer cards, those enrolled in the program will instead receive boxes of tinned and canned food.\n\nFortunately, the proposal seems fated for the shredding machine, but it still serves as a useful example. Those using rights language would reply that the government hasn\u2019t the right to cut their money payments because they have the right to do their own shopping. But we can also frame the criticism in obligation language: \u201cIt is unjust to replace financial assistance with box meals, which will punish both our physical and emotional well-being.\u201d While the first response would ignite what Weil calls the \u201cspirit of contention,\u201d the latter response might \u201ctouch and awaken at its source the spirit of attention.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | What We Owe to Others: Simone Weil\u2019s Radical Reminder", "authors": []}

By which I mean it was invented by someone from Hawaii. Or at least, by a person who had relocated to Hawaii and later become a cultural figure there. The island never gets credit. People have done research on the sport\u2019s early history, but somehow this all-important first chapter has been lost. The people in Hawaii went through hell a couple of weeks ago, as many readers know. For about 40 minutes they lived with the belief that a ballistic missile was coming to wipe them out. They started calling one another to say goodbye. Hawaii: Accept this small restoration of roots as a gesture of solidarity, an arm around your shoulder on the curb outside the gas station as we say, \u201cWhat happened in there was not cool.\u201d The history of snowboarding, or as it was known then, \u201csnurfing\u201d (i.e., snow-surfing), does not begin in Michigan in the 1960s with boards made by a guy named Sherman Poppen. It does not even begin, as revisionists will tell you, in Colorado in 1939, with a thing called the Bunker Sno-Surf. It happened a full year before, in 1938, in Yosemite National Park. A slight young man named Robert Trumbull, a Honolulu newspaper editor who wrote a weather column under the byline Sol Pluvius (Rainy Sun), was on vacation. Chicago-born, Trumbull had seen plenty of snow, and he had been surfing. That was the all-important crossing of the wires. \u201cYesterday Sol showed the natives a new trick,\u201d reported The Honolulu Advertiser, \u201csnow-surfing, or as Sol called it, \u2018snurfing.\u2019 \u201d He coined the word. That may all be sports trivia, but it\u2019s about to become important trivia, because soon, in this very winter of 2018 \u2014 80 years after Trumbull\u2019s breakthrough \u2014 will occur the Olympic debut of a sport known as \u201cbig-air snowboarding,\u201d which is the snurfing equivalent of big-wave surfing. It is best described as the most beautiful, insane, stupid, dangerous, death-wishing, insane and beautiful sport ever perpetrated on innocent spectators. Big air works like this: You stand at the top of a high, steep slope. You get going down it exceptionally fast. You hit a ramp, the kind of ramp you might use if you needed to jump your motorcycle over a canyon. When you fire off this ramp on your snurfer, having hit the lip of it with tremendous force, you fly into the air very high and far. Big-air boarders routinely find themselves 65 feet above the slope. They spin around and do tricks and flips. Weirdly, the tricks and flips often don\u2019t even seem like that big a deal, the boarders are up so high. Imagine yourself in one of those zero-gravity simulator planes. You would be flipping all around and making cool moves, but you wouldn\u2019t be proud of yourself, because your great-grandmother could do the same thing. Death is always near where big air is getting caught. For that matter, regular old small-air snowboarding can be plenty life-threatening. Granted, most of the deaths are avalanche-related. Some result from helicopter crashes, when riders are searching for untouched snow in the high mountain passes. One biggie that is more clearly attributable to human error: collisions \u2014 most often between a rider and a stationary object, like a tree or a finish-line pillar (the Swiss champion Daniel Loetscher died in the latter way).\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Do you agree that snowboarding should be an Olympic sport?

He is old, he tells us, \u201cin the way that a tree, or a quahog clam, or a Renaissance painting is old.\u201d Born in France in 1581, he is fast approaching his 440th birthday. Not that anyone would know it to look at him, since outwardly he appears to be an ordinary man in his 40s. This is because Tom has a condition, rare but not unique, known as anageria. People with anageria age much more slowly than ordinary people, at a rate of roughly one year for every 15 ordinary human years. Although Tom lives life at the same pace as everyone else, judging by his appearance, it would seem that \u201conly a decade passes between the death of Napoleon and the first man on the moon.\u201d Immune to almost all human diseases, and assuming he avoids a violent death, Tom can expect to live until he is around 950. With four centuries of life under his belt, he is only just approaching middle age. And like many middle-aged men, he appears to be suffering something of a midlife crisis.\n\nThis is not, of course, a new idea. Ever since Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver traveled to the nation of Luggnagg, where the \u201cstruldbrugs\u201d age but never die, writers have used the notion of immortality to examine the possibilities and limits of a human life. In recent years Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s \u201cThe Time Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d and Kate Atkinson\u2019s \u201cLife After Life\u201d have both played inventively with the idea of lives lived outside of ordinary time. Haig himself touched on the idea in his previous novel, \u201cThe Humans,\u201d which saw an eccentric English mathematician unlocking the secret of prime numbers and thereby the means to rid the world of illness and death. Fearful of the power this would give violent and primitive humans, an advanced alien super-race from the planet Vonnadoria hurriedly dispatched one of their kind to extinguish all traces of his theory. \u201cThe Humans\u201d was warmhearted, sharply observed and often laugh-out-loud funny, funny enough to forgive Haig\u2019s alien his regrettable fondness for fortune-cookie philosophy.\n\nImage\n\nIn \u201cHow to Stop Time,\u201d Haig has ditched the comedy for something more melancholic. Others of Tom\u2019s kind \u2014 known as albatrosses (or \u201calbas\u201d), after the bird thought in Victorian times to be exceptionally long-lived \u2014 consider their lives infinitely superior to ordinary humans (or \u201cmayflies\u201d) who live so briefly. Tom fiercely disagrees. To him his longevity is a curse, forcing him from an early age to live alone. His unchanging appearance arouses hostility and suspicion. Superstitious neighbors condemn his mother as a witch. Similar accusations dog his beloved wife, Rose, and daughter, Marion, until he must leave them for their own safety. In the 400 years since Rose\u2019s death he has roamed the world, unwilling to settle, unable to find happiness. The only thing that keeps him from taking his own life is the knowledge that Marion has inherited his condition and is out there somewhere, waiting for him to find her. When he is approached by the Albatross Society, a secret association designed to protect albas from the twin threats of superstition and science, he hopes its mastermind, the hedonistic Hendrich Pietersen, will be able to help him track her down.\n\nThe resulting novel is part love story and part thriller, though not quite enough of either. Almost 500 years is quite something to compress into a conventionally sized novel, and Haig takes us on a whistle-stop tour through the highlights of Tom\u2019s life, playing the lute in Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, voyaging with Captain Cook to the Pacific islands, drinking cocktails in Paris with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. In the rather less star-studded present he is teaching history in a modern London high school, and it is these sections of the novel that are the most convincing. Haig remains a keen-eyed observer of contemporary life \u2014 a plastic bag \u201cfloats far over our heads like a cartoon ghost\u201d \u2014 and his dialogue has snap and charm. In the past, however, he is on shakier ground; his characters seem to exist less in their historical surroundings than to have pushed their faces through the holes in painted carnival cutouts. Shakespeare is a particularly clumsy creation, a man who quotes himself in conversation.", "title": "What Would It Be Like to Be 400 Years Old?", "authors": []}

The cost of housing has priced out teachers and line cooks. Income inequality is among the widest in the nation. The homeless crisis never seems to ebb. Traffic is a mess. On bad days, transit is, too. And local governments are locked in conflict.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "A week into my assignment I learned through the grapevine a terrible truth: Medics in Vietnam were expected to endure six hard months in the field. A battle-tested sergeant advised me: Take good care of us and we\u2019ll take care of you. Other medics confirmed that if I survived six months of gore I might be rotated to a field hospital at a big base \u2014 showers, three hot meals a day, passes to town, tiki bars at China Beach.\n\nUntil then, though, I would be in one of the hottest war zones, supporting troops on search-and-destroy missions, as well as supply convoys along the lethal north-south Colonial Route 1. Long before us, the French military had named it the \u201cStreet Without Joy.\u201d With reason.\n\nIn Chu Lai, a Marine air base on that road that served as our home, I joined three field medics: Wayne Freeman, Eddie Dickson and Simon Britts. We essentially lived inside a medical armored personnel carrier, roaming embattled central Vietnam behind mechanized infantry units, tending and evacuating their wounded and dead.\n\nThe first five weeks were easy, spent guarding the perimeters of hilltop firebases and base camps. It was safe, except for frequent artillery barrages. There were even opportunities to go into villages to offer citizens simple health care, an activity the brass thought might help win hearts and minds. Occasionally we went on long, platoon-size tank patrols in search of guerrilla units hiding in remote villages or secret camps within the jungles of the Annamite Cordillera foothills. We didn\u2019t find many, but it gave us a feel of the land, its odors, sounds and perils.\n\nThe rice paddies reeked of stagnant water, the jungles of humus and raw vegetation. Every now and then a sniper targeted us, or a forward infantry unit fell into a small-arms ambush; we\u2019d patch light wounds from bullets or booby traps. Even so, the jungle\u2019s stillness and the absence of heavy battle lulled us into thinking the war wasn\u2019t as bad as advertised.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut it was. As summer passed, the small guerrilla skirmishes were winding down, but well-trained regular combat veterans of the North Vietnamese Army were secretly infiltrating the central coastlands, preparing for the coming Tet offensive.\n\nBy autumn, heavy fighting was breaking out in Chu Lai and Tam Ky, two key coastal centers of the war. In the First Armored Division, now part of the 23rd Infantry Division, commonly known as the Americal Division, combat medics were called into action every day because the fighting was now constant and bloody, with the enemy firing heavy mortars, rocket grenades and powerful machine guns. When the foot soldiers left their vehicles to fight, we would wait just outside the battle in our personnel carrier until called to scramble in ourselves, under fire, treat the wounded where they\u2019d fallen, then get them the hell out of there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur job now was to tend multiple gunshot wounds, apply tourniquets to the stumps of legs amputated by mines, and bandage shrapnel-mutilated bodies. Mortars fell near our armored personnel carrier. Bullets zinged around us and ricocheted from helicopter fuselages as we loaded the wounded into them. Death became a daily reality, as we zipped our fallen comrades into body bags.\n\nOn two occasions, two of our medics were wounded by shrapnel as we drove close to the big firefights. By October, we had to park so deep in the combat zones that more medics would inevitably become casualties too.\n\nBefore the fighting got really hot, aspects of being a field medic had felt strangely magical. We were our own bosses. We slept in our vehicle on bloodstained stretchers among boxes of medicine and munitions. We listened to rock music on the way to small battles. No haircuts or polished boots. Shave or don\u2019t shave. Bathe in rivers. Just take meticulous care of the grunts.\n\nThey would come to us for a Darvon pain pill or foot rot powder, or simply to share a cigarette or a warm beer with the \u201cdocs.\u201d We gave lidocaine for itching groins, tetanus shots, and emulsions for head lice and crabs. We scolded them for not taking their anti-malaria pills. We reprimanded them for bad hygiene, too much pot smoking, or carelessness at a village brothel. We were their \u201cmale moms.\u201d\n\nThe camaraderie beguiled me, especially as a Hispanic man. Many of the soldiers were from the Deep South and couldn\u2019t understand why a guy from a Caribbean paradise would volunteer for the Army. They laughed at my accented English, but they warmed to the rum I carried in my duffel bag. They gave bro-hugs when I treated them. Sometimes they faked a malady. When we declared them fit for battle, they bore silent grudges \u2014 until the next firefight.\n\nRank mattered little. During and after combat, the officers, sergeants and privates consulted and consoled one another. Of course, with the intimacy came broken rules \u2014 as when an infantry sergeant ordered me into a tunnel hole to see if a guerrilla was lurking. I protested that I was a medic, but he insisted. Luckily, the lair was empty.\n\nAnother time, a green lieutenant saw us giving plasma to a wounded Vietcong suspect. He ordered me not to \u201cwaste\u201d medical supplies on the enemy. But at Fort Sam Houston I had been taught that in combat, a medic could override an officer in any lifesaving situation. I paid no heed to his order. The court-martial he threatened me with never materialized.\n\nWhen I enlisted, I was no peacenik. But what I experienced during those first five months washed away any ignorance about the degradations of war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI cannot forget the many times we would arrive in a village with tanks, shows of force and Zippo lighters with which to torch humble peasants\u2019 homes. I can still see a sad old farmer, kneeling and crying in his trampled rice field, broken seedlings in his hands.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

With time short, we resorted to dragging bodies unceremoniously through the thickening mud \u2014 a scene of horror that disturbs me even now. These had been my brothers in combat. What would their kin have felt, watching this?\n\nI never did get to enjoy the pleasures at the bases in Danang, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Bay or even Saigon.\n\nAbout five months after arriving \u2014 just weeks from the anticipated end of regular combat danger for me \u2014 we were accompanying a sweep against North Vietnamese troops in a thin 43-mile-long strip of land we called Cigar Island, just north of Chu Lai. As fighting grew intense at a remote fishing village called Binh Thinh, a rocket grenade slammed into our waiting armored personnel carrier, splintering its side into shrapnel that tore apart my right leg. All four of us medics were wounded, leaving the entire troop without their \u201cdocs.\u201d Some 25 infantrymen and tankers died that day.\n\nSo that was how I would leave combat duty: in an evac helicopter, stoned out on morphine, bleeding half to death with a shattered leg wrapped in bloodied bandages. My fellow medic Simon Britts had applied them during the battle, even though he was wounded himself and we were still under fire. He was put in for a Silver Star for bravery, but never received it. The paperwork was lost.\n\nLater, as I lay on a gurney in a trauma surgery room, my pistol fell from my pocket to the floor. It shocked the surgeon and nurses, and caught a chaplain\u2019s attention. He came over and prayed with a hand on my head, and I assumed this was last rites. Then he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll be O.K., son. You\u2019re in good hands now.\u201d I could only hope he was referring to my surgeons, not the Almighty.\n\nOne operating room after another followed until I reached Walter Reed Medical Center, for a year of rehabilitation. I was there in 1968 when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and riots broke out in Washington. Soldiers were told to stay on the hospital grounds, because Vietnam vets were not much appreciated by Americans who had turned against the war.\n\nThe war had taught me to despise all firearms. After basic training, the only time I ever pointed and fired one was on a trip back to Vietnam in 2004 to help make a documentary film about a veteran \u2014 me \u2014 returning to the war theater. At a shooting gallery for tourists, I fired an AK-47 into a dirt wall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat journey awoke memories. The film crew rambled in a van from Hanoi south to the Mekong Delta, stopping where I had soldiered. The Vietnamese were friendly and forgiving. The bus driver, a former North Vietnamese artillery colonel, said: \u201cNo one won or lost the American war. We all simply did what was required of us at the time.\u201d\n\nAnd then we reached Binh Thinh. I began narrating the attack in which I was wounded. Suddenly, I began salivating and my mind shut down. I sat on the sand and cried. In a flashback, I conjured the dead and the wounded of that savage day.\n\nUnexpected flashbacks still haunt me. In a restaurant I can go into stress if I smell a rare steak oozing blood. In a movie theater, I can suddenly imagine the stench of gunpowder and cordite in the air.\n\nFifteen Army medics received the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War, most posthumously. According to the website 1st Cav Medic, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall lists 2,096 Army medics and Navy corpsmen, our naval and Marine equivalent, who died or were missing in action. Thousands of others like myself were wounded, all in a war I now consider pointless.\n\nA war that remains with me.", "title": "What a Combat Medic Still Carries", "authors": ["Rafael Matos"]}

Mr. Shah added that the White House does \u201ctake violence against women and these types of allegations very seriously.\u201d\n\nThose are the sorts of sentiments you\u2019d want to hear from the president and his staff after such revelations. Of course, it\u2019d be easier to take them at face value if his chief of staff, John Kelly, hadn\u2019t reportedly known about the allegations against Mr. Porter since the fall, and if Mr. Trump\u2019s first wife hadn\u2019t accused him of rape and if more than a dozen women hadn\u2019t said he sexually molested, assaulted and harassed them. That\u2019s not to mention his own taped admission of grabbing women by the genitals.\n\nIt would be even easier to take seriously the official White House line about Mr. Porter if officials there had shown any appetite to fight violence against women. If they become interested in doing more than talk, here are some ideas:\n\nName a White House adviser on violence against women, a position created during the Obama administration that has gone unfilled for the past year.

The law, passed in 1994, has directed billions of dollars toward policing and prosecuting offenders as well as providing legal and other services to victims. Cases of domestic violence in the United States have dropped precipitously as a result. And yet, since Mr. Trump was elected, its proponents have lived in constant fear of funding cuts.

The Securities and Exchange Commission can seek to bar a person from serving as an officer or a director of a public company, but that requires proving the person engaged in fraud, not just mismanagement of the company.\n\nAn individual who has a controlling interest in a company that is convicted of violating federal health care fraud laws can be excluded from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, effectively requiring that the person be removed from his or her position. But this provision has not been used against corporate executives who did not have any direct involvement in the criminal violations.\n\nWells Fargo was widely admired for how it navigated the financial crisis, coming out of it stronger than most of its competitors even after acquiring a failing bank, Wachovia, at the government\u2019s behest in October 2008.

When you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything wrong, and you believe it was just the other guy who got caught, then any penalty is unlikely to have much of an impact on your future actions.\n\nRather than viewing what happened to Wells Fargo as an instance of \u201cthere but for the grace of God go I,\u201d directors and executives at other banks will more likely see it as a case of an aggressive company that crossed the line too many times.

Putting a roof above the deck on which you cook the pie, Falco said, helps create a kind of oven within your oven, with the surfaces both above and below the pizza holding and radiating heat. This helps cook the top of the pizza considerably.\n\nHave you been having problems getting those beautiful burnt leopard spots on the crust of your pies?

Julien Shapiro, who runs the butcher and charcuterie shop at 8 Hands Farm in Cutchogue, N.Y., got on me the other day about how I call for saut\u00e9ing the onions before I toast the rice, and about how much stirring I do afterward, while adding the stock.\n\nJulien used to make risotto like that, he said, until the chef he was working for called him into the walk-in to tell him to stop. He paused then and looked at the ground and I realized he was telling me to stop, too. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any moisture in the pot when you start,\u201d he said. \u201cJust toast the rice in the oil until it looks like mother-of-pearl, then hit it with the onions, wine and stock. Bare simmer, covered, 10 minutes.\u201d Julien makes the best sausages in Suffolk County, and he displays a quiet authority when he talks. I did what I was told.\n\nAnd, man, that is a good way to cook risotto. You may need a little bit more hot stock at the end of the process, before you add butter and cheese to finish the dish. (Maybe a few handfuls of baby greens as well.) But you\u2019ll cut down on your time at the stove by a considerable amount, with no diminishing of flavor.\n\nSo maybe cook risotto this weekend. Me, I\u2019d also like to take on this recipe for a venison and trotter pie, which Tejal Rao coaxed out of Angie Mar at the Beatrice Inn in New York.

I didn\u2019t think it would be crazily delicious, either. But it was and I was amazed and eventually I interrogated the restaurant\u2019s chef, Ned Baldwin, about how he\u2019d made it.\n\n\u201cDulse butter\u201d was his answer \u2014 he cut a few tablespoons of ground dried sea lettuce into the fat and then patted onto the fish before he wrapped it and put it into the oven to roast. The dulse acts as a kind of flavor enhancer, a natural version of monosodium glutamate. I started to cook with it all the time.\n\nThat, anyway, is the subject of my \u201cEat\u201d column in The Times this week, which serves as introduction to my new recipe for seafood chowder (above).

I cooked all kinds of beans (so. many. beans.); I braised fennel hearts and simmered a big batch of Andrea Nguyen\u2019s fantastic pho broth.\n\nBut not being able to bake for six weeks has put me in such a mood to bake! Now, the oven\u2019s been replaced, and I\u2019ve got the most delicious to-do list for the weekend.

But the realist in me suspects this problem is one of his character traits. Unfortunately, this kind of dynamic can become a vicious cycle. As this guy\u2019s behavior further alienates you and your siblings, he\u2019ll sense your rising disapproval and react by becoming increasingly possessive, further driving a wedge between you and your mother. That\u2019s the underlying risk here, the scenario you want to avoid: a kind of loyalty showdown. I\u2019d do what you can to ease the tension, especially as the wedding approaches. You don\u2019t have to pretend to like this man, or approve of his conduct. But it might help to remind yourself that this man makes your mother happy, by her own account. What\u2019s most important in all of this is that you establish a relationship with your mother that\u2019s independent of your feelings toward her partner.

And for Anglicans, don\u2019t forget synthetic fabrics, wet wipes, and those little boxes that hold dental floss.\n\nThe Church of England has asked people to add a new culprit to the list of ills they forsake for the six weeks of penance that begin on Ash Wednesday: plastics. Specifically, the church wants people to avoid the plastic consumer products and packaging that have become a major environmental problem, polluting oceans and rivers, fouling beaches, killing wildlife and clogging landfills.\n\n\u201cI think it might well be a first for us, to have an entire Lent program on an environmental issue, but it is very much an integral part of what the church is about,\u201d said Ruth Knight, the Church of England\u2019s environmental policy officer.

He will probably be best remembered for his stylish, cleareyed art criticism, which these days appears regularly in The Wall Street Journal. But persistence pays, and Mr. Plagens is now making the best paintings of his career. Like his writing, they are witty and knowing. They are also hard won, the results of more than a decade spent trying out different combinations of three or four specific abstract styles. His latest amalgam \u2014 the simplest and most balanced \u2014 is an eye-teasing sandwich of contrasting formalist strategies.\n\nThe paintings seem to begin with an allover field of semiautomatic drawing: fast and furious squiggles, loops and grids, rendered in graphite and charcoal and annotated with watery color. Most of this activity is then blocked out by a big, squarish expanse of opaque color \u2014 juicy orange, lavender-gray or deep aqua. It\u2019s a failed monochrome with wildly irregular edges and broad bands of drawing left exposed. Plunked into the center of this field is an irregular polygon, built from six or seven shards of bright color. This passing reference to hard-edged geometric abstraction, which the artist calls a badge, also evokes the big resin paintings of Ron Davis, an avatar of the Los Angeles art scene in the 1960s, when Mr. Plagens began his career there. Finally, the borders are gone over with flat white, as if a referee were moving in and out of the action, covering drips and editing down the outlying borders of drawing to blurry skirmishes at the frayed edges of the monochrome.\n\nLike most painters, Mr. Plagens has borrowed more than he has invented, but he\u2019s never done it with such confidence. He is fully present in these smart, glamorous, high-spirited works.

Sam Fogg Ltd. at Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-206-9100, luhringaugustine.com.\n\nSam Fogg, the respected London dealer, has regularly staged exhibitions of medieval art in New York for around a decade, but never before in Chelsea. Unsurprisingly, this year\u2019s show begins with the thrill of simply walking into it, forsaking the neighborhood\u2019s contemporary-art babble for the otherworldly hush imposed by nearly 30 expressions of faith in painting, sculpture and whatnot from the Middle Ages. Here, the whatnot includes enamels, a silver and silver-gilt reliquary in the form of a bishop\u2019s hand; a large stained-glass window and the lavishly illustrated Carpentin Hours, by the artist known as the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book. The most secular item in this group is a two-tier cast-brass chandelier from the Southern Netherlands (1480-1520) that is remarkably like the single-tier one in Jan van Eyck\u2019s \u201cThe Arnolfini Portrait\u201d of 1434.\n\nThe era\u2019s religious faith is especially palpable in two carved softwood sculptures from the 14th century whose colors and gilding remain nearly intact: a pale, life-size Spanish crucifix that is both daunting and slightly comic and a polychrome wood Piet\u00e0 with anguished expressions and with gaping wounds whose red matches that of the Virgin\u2019s robes. The appealing emotionality of these works is countered by a marble of John the Baptist, also from the 14th century. Attributed to Robert de Lannoy of Paris, it is a study in idealization and dignified restraint \u2014 down to the orderly rivuletlike textures of the saint\u2019s camel-hair coat.\n\nAmong many other standouts, a triptych centering on an elaborately ensconced Virgin and Child (1490-1500) reflects the influence of van Eyck\u2019s infinite realism and his banishment of the Gothic gold that is so gloriously evident elsewhere in the show, especially in \u201cSaint Michael Vanquishing the Devil,\u201d an altarpiece panel made in Aragon around 1470.", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": []}

The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | What\u2019s Distinctive About the Mess Jacob Zuma Has Made", "authors": []}

Much like existing credits for wind and solar power, these incentives would phase out starting in 2020.\n\nThe bill also extends an existing production tax credit for nuclear power past 2020, which would benefit a pair of long-delayed reactors being built in Georgia that aren\u2019t expected to come online before 2021.

Industry lobbyists had unsuccessfully fought to get many of these measures included in the tax overhaul bill passed by Congress in December. They could still face resistance in the House.\n\nA tax credit for mining safety.\n\nThe bill extends a tax credit for 20 percent of an employers\u2019 spending on mine rescue team training costs, up to $10,000.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Rosy Assumptions on the Economy\u2019s Growth\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily result in much larger federal deficits.\n\nThe administration made its calculations using assumptions about the nation\u2019s economic trajectory that are more optimistic than the consensus among private-sector forecasters, or the assumptions used by other parts of the government.\n\nThe forecasts in Monday\u2019s plan are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.\n\nMost notably, the administration projected annualized economic growth of 3.1 percent over the next three years. The Federal Reserve in December projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate at about 2.4 percent.\n\nThere is a similar gap in the projections of long-term growth. If the less optimistic forecasts were correct, the government would collect significantly less revenue. By its own estimates, the result would be another $3 trillion in federal debt.\n\nThe administration attributed the difference to the expectation that the president\u2019s policies would significantly increase productivity growth.\n\nJason Furman, the former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, calculated that productivity growth would have to reach the highest level in any decade since the immediate aftermath of the World War II. Productivity growth was 1.1 percent over the last decade; it would have to reach 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to understand where this growth would be coming from,\u201d Mr. Furman tweeted.\n\n\u2014Jim Tankersley\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA 5% Reduction for the Department of Education\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s 2019 budget proposal requests $63.2 billion in discretionary spending at the Education Department, a reduction of $3.6 billion, or 5 percent, from 2017 spending levels.\n\nThe proposal calls for a $1.5 billion \u201cschool choice\u201d program, which includes taxpayer-funded scholarships for private schools and a vast expansion of charter schools. However, the budget would eliminate or cut 39 programs including two staple programs in public schools that provide teacher training and after-school programs to low-income children.\n\nThe Department\u2019s budget also funds initiatives that Mr. Trump has given lip service to in the last year, calling for $43 million in \u201cSchool Climate Transformation\u201d grants to help fight the opioid epidemic in schools, and $200 million in new grants to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics education.\n\n\u2014Erica A. Green\n\nA Hint at the Special Counsel\u2019s Timeline\n\nThe proposal indicates that the work of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could last another year and a half. It allocates $10 million to his office from October 2018 through the end of September 2019.\n\nBut that does not mean the Russia investigation itself will last that long. The office would also oversee a trial of Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, who has pleaded not guilty to charges he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies. No trial date has been set, but the judge in the case has indicated it would not start before the fall.\n\nDocuments released last year by the special counsel\u2019s office, which is part of the Justice Department, provided a view into its expenses. Those documents showed that between the time the office was opened in May and the end of September it racked up $3.2 million in costs. The largest portion of that money \u2014 $1.7 million \u2014 went to personnel, compensation and benefits. The second highest cost was for the \u201cacquisition of equipment\u201d at $733,969.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s $28 billion proposed budget overall is relatively flat from last year, with notable increases in spending to combat violent crime and drug use as well as house more prisoners. The department wants to increase its immigration enforcement efforts and add 75 immigration judges and support staff. The department counts more than 117,000 employees.\n\nTo offset the spending increases, the Justice Department plans to close two of its six Bureau of Prisons regional administrative offices and two of its seven minimum security prisons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014Katie Benner\n\nTargets Planned Parenthood\n\nThe president\u2019s budget singles out abortion providers and would prohibit Health and Human Services funding, including money used for family planning, from going to any clinic or health care facility that also offers abortion services.\n\nThough the language is broadly written, its intended target is Planned Parenthood, which relies on government funding to offer a variety of services to women other than abortion. The budget would help achieve the longstanding goal of social conservatives to cut off Planned Parenthood from federal assistance.\n\n\u2014Jeremy W. Peters\n\nBig Changes for Food Stamps\n\nThe White House is proposing a significant change for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. The White House proposes to cut funding for the program by about $213 billion \u2014 or 30 percent \u2014 over a decade. It also wants to change how SNAP recipients get their food, replacing a portion of the benefits that allow SNAP recipients to go to a grocery store to purchase food with a package of \u201cnutritious\u201d American-grown food delivered to SNAP households.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.\n\nWhile most of the budget increases focus on illegal immigration and border security, the administration also requested funding to hire 450 new agents for the chronically-short staffed Secret Service, $1 billion for the department\u2019s cybersecurity efforts and $71 million for new scanning technology for the Transportation Security Administration. The new budget request would provide $1.9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s grant program to state and local communities, $800 million less than the $2.7 billion funded in 2017.\n\n\u2014Ron Nixon\n\nDeep Cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s second federal spending plan proposes steep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019 rejection of a similar plan last year to dramatically shrink the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 budget blueprint would pare the E.P.A. by $2.8 billion or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs. It also would cut the agency\u2019s Office of Science and Technology nearly in half, to $489 million from its current $762 million.\n\nIn outlining the budget, the administration said the E.P.A. is refocusing on what it called \u201ccore activities\u201d and eliminating \u201clower priority programs.\u201d That list includes a program to promote partnerships with the private sector to tackle climate change; environmental education training; and an effort to protect marine estuaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House estimated cutting those programs and others will save taxpayers $600 million compared to 2017 levels.\n\n\u2014Lisa Friedman\n\nAnother Call to Repeal the Affordable Care Act\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes once again to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act and to eliminate the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. More than 30 states have expanded Medicaid under the law. Republican efforts to dismantle the law failed in Congress last year.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said there would be \u201cno cuts\u201d to Medicare or Medicaid if he won the election. But his 2019 budget request is full of proposals to squeeze savings out of the two programs, which together provide health insurance for more than 100 million Americans.\n\nProposed savings in Medicare total more than $490 billion over 10 years, or about 5 percent of Medicare spending expected under current law.\n\nThe budget would cut $69.5 billion over 10 years in projected Medicare payments to hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care.\u201d It would cut more than $95 billion over 10 years from nursing homes and home health agencies, and $22 billion from Medicare Advantage plans, which manage care for about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nIn addition, the budget would cut $48 billion over 10 years in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education,\n\nThe budget includes several proposals intended to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries by requiring insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to share at least one-third of the discounts and price concessions they receive from drug manufacturers. The budget would also establish a limit on beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered by Medicare.\n\n\u2014Robert Pear\n\nParing Back a Dodd-Frank Watchdog\n\nThe Treasury Department plan calls for continuing to cut the budget of the Office of Financial Research, which was set up in the wake of the financial crisis to help federal agencies stay ahead of financial risks. The office, which provides analysis and research to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has previously been targeted for both funding and personnel cuts. \u201cThe Budget reflects continued reductions in O.F.R. spending commensurate with the renewed fiscal discipline being applied across the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChanging the Role of the A.T.F.\n\nThe budget would allocate $28 billion to the Justice Department \u2014 a 1.2 percent decrease from the department\u2019s 2017 budget. That budget funds agencies like the F.B.I., the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration. The budget proposal would take tobacco and alcohol enforcement authority away from the A.T.F. and move those authorities to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe D.E.A. would receive an addition $41 million to specifically combat the opioid crisis, and the agency would also take over the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which is currently run by the White House drug czar\u2019s office.\n\n\u2014Ali Watkins\n\nState Department Gets Less Funding\n\nAt the State Department and USAID, the president\u2019s budget proposes a base budget of $25.8 billion, a $9 billion decrease in funding from the 2017 enacted budget. This is a 26 percent decrease in funding, similar to the president\u2019s budgetary intentions last year.\n\nNotably, the president\u2019s new budget aims to shift $12 billion from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to the base budget. The OCO is traditionally used for United States presence in turbulent regions like Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe addendum provides an additional $1 billion to USAID\u2019s International Disaster Assistance account for use in humanitarian crises as well as an additional $400 million for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\n\u2014Emily Baumgaertner", "title": "What\u2019s in the White House Budget Request?", "authors": ["The New York Times"]}

Mr. Eastwood mugs and growls through Sergio Leone\u2019s spaghetti western, which arrived on Amazon Prime this month. It depicts a series of brutal skirmishes during the Civil War, as three gunslingers compete to unearth a stash of Confederate gold.

Andrew M. Cuomo has said. \u201cThat is one of the first places I would look to reduce congestion and to raise money.\u201d\n\nEven as President Trump promotes a plan to rebuild the country\u2019s tattered infrastructure, many local governments are not waiting to see what, if any, help Washington provides and are finding novel ways to pay for transportation and other public works projects.\n\nAcross the nation, more than a dozen states and municipalities have imposed fees or taxes on ride-hailing companies or their passengers, or sometimes both, and many more are considering such measures, according to transportation and tax experts. Advocates for the charges contend that the ride-hailing cars should pay for using public streets and resources, contributing to gridlock and pollution, and siphoning passengers and fares from public transit.\n\n\u201cIf they want to share the pie, then they have to pay the price,\u201d said Fayez Khozindar, the executive director of the United Taxidrivers Community Council, an advocacy group for taxi drivers in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s fair because we know the city is short on funds and they want to fill the hole.\u201d\n\nBut some drivers and passengers for the ride-hailing companies say they have been unfairly singled out \u2014 in many places the new fees do not apply to taxis.\n\n\u201cUber and Lyft have always been an easy target for cities looking for new streams of revenue,\u201d said Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft in California who writes a popular blog, The Rideshare Guy.\n\nIn New York and Chicago, Uber and Lyft have said they see their services as complementing the public transit systems and providing another option for riders, especially in transit deserts with few bus routes and train lines. Uber supports a congestion plan for Manhattan \u2014 even running an ad campaign backing the idea \u2014 as long as it does not single out for-hire vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA comprehensive congestion pricing plan that is applied to all vehicles in the central business district is the best way to fully fund mass transit, reduce congestion and improve transportation for outer borough New Yorkers,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Alix Anfang, said. \u201cA surcharge alone will not accomplish these goals.\u201d\n\nLast year, New York State approved a 4 percent assessment on ride-hailing trips that begin outside New York City (rides in the city are already subject to state and local taxes). It is expected to raise $24 million a year for the state\u2019s general fund though one state legislator, Senator John E. Brooks, a Democrat from Long Island, has proposed legislation to direct that revenue to local bus and commuter rail services. \u201cWe need to think creatively and outside of the box in order to improve funding for local transit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new fees and taxes are often part of broader regulatory measures as states and localities scramble to update tax codes and laws that have not kept up with the proliferation of app-based ride services. For instance, a Georgia state tax applies to rides in taxis but not ride-hailing cars even though they essentially do the same thing, said Carl Davis, research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cA lot of tax codes weren\u2019t set up to take them into account,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThey\u2019re so new they didn\u2019t even exist a decade ago. It\u2019s an emerging tax issue, and states and localities are playing catch up.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina added a 1 percent fee to ride-hailing trips in 2015, in part to establish a single regulatory framework and block local efforts to charge prohibitively high fees to keep them out, state officials said. Now that fee has become a source of extra cash. The city of North Charleston, for instance, receives more than $30,000 annually and uses it for municipal operations.\n\nIn Oregon, Portland officials initially barred Uber but eventually agreed to allow it and Lyft to operate through pilot programs. In 2016, the city sought to create a single standard for taxis and ride-hailing cars and assessed a 50-cent ride fee on both of them, which is paid by passengers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe 50-cent fee has added up to more than $8 million to help pay for city enforcement efforts, including spot inspections of cars and incentives to companies and drivers to choose wheelchair accessible cars. The fee \u201chasn\u2019t been a barrier to the riders at all as the ride-hailing services have continued to expand,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Benson, a senior manager for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the top yet.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, many Portland taxi owners and drivers say the fee has hurt them more than their rivals. Noah Ernst, a superintendent for Radio Cab, said many taxi drivers feel the 50-cent fee means a smaller tip because passengers lump everything together when they pay. Taxi companies also face the headache of trying to collect the fee from drivers.\n\nHe added that taxis continued to face more stringent safety, equipment and insurance requirements, and were targeted more often for inspections because their cars were easily identified by company colors and logos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an equal playing field at all and we were trying to tell them this the entire time they were rewriting the code,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, he said, taxi companies are struggling and at least two have gone out of business. His company, Radio Cab, has lost more than a third of its business since 2015.\n\nChicago officials have calculated that ride-hailing companies have cost the city about $40 million a year in lost revenue from transit fares, parking fees, licenses and permits. In 2014, the city imposed a 20-cent fee on ride-hailing trips in response to concerns that taxis were being undercut. Two years later, that fee went up to 50 cents, with an additional two-cent fee paid by the ride-hailing companies themselves. And now, the new 15-cent fee for the transit system brings the total to 65 cents for passengers.\n\nThe city also assessed a separate $5 fee on passengers who were picked up or dropped off by ride-hailing cars at the major airports, the convention center and the Navy Pier, a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe ride-hailing fees produced nearly $39 million for the city\u2019s general fund in 2016, up from about $100,000 in 2014, according to city estimates. Last year\u2019s revenue, which is still being collected, is expected to reach $72 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly new industry and once they actually got settled in the city we saw a lot of growth,\u201d the Chicago budget director, Samantha Fields, said.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has made modernizing the L a priority, said the new 15-cent fee was the first of its kind to raise money solely for public transit from those who might not even use it because they could afford the ride-hailing cars. \u201cI think it\u2019s a progressive transportation tax,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cIt will make public transportation competitive with the rideshare industry.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Mr. Emanuel said, it will serve as a \u201cbackdoor approach\u201d to fighting congestion created by the ride-hailing cars by helping shift more people \u2014 by their own choice \u2014 to the transit system. \u201cThere\u2019s a congestion fee and I would just say the rideshare fee is kind of parallel parking into the same position,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 15-cent fee is projected to bring in $16 million this year, which will be turned over to the Chicago Transit Authority. The money will be used to secure additional funding through bond sales to pay for a total of $179 million in capital improvements, according to city officials.\n\nKyle Whitehead, the government relations director for Active Transportation Alliance, a Chicago advocacy group for biking, walking and transit, said that the transit system contributes to the health of the city by getting more people out of cars, increasing exercise levels and reducing pollution \u2014 and it is now in dire need of money.\n\n\u201cThe public transit system benefits everyone who lives and works in the city, he said, \u201cregardless of whether they\u2019re using it.\u201d", "title": "When Calling an Uber Can Pay Off for Cities and States", "authors": ["Winnie Hu"]}

Peacekeepers also brought cholera to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake there.\n\nBut the Oxfam revelations have focused attention on the instinct of charities to keep quiet about episodes that might undermine their image, mission and morale. Oxfam learned of sexual abuse in Haiti in 2011 and fired those responsible, but never publicly explained why staff members were dismissed. The reason, explains Oxfam Great Britain\u2019s current director, Mark Goldring, was to try to balance being transparent and protecting Oxfam\u2019s work.\n\nThat\u2019s no excuse.

This month, Saudi Arabia sentenced a journalist to five years in prison for \u201ccriticizing the royal court.\u201d In its conflict with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates warned last year that prison terms and hefty fines awaited anyone who showed sympathy to Qatar or opposed the government\u2019s stance against it. Egypt and Syria have locked up countless critics over the years.\n\nLebanon is better off when it comes to free expression. As a fragile democracy where power is shared by a range of political and religious groups, it has no dictator who can impose his will. On the contrary, it hosts an array of newspapers and television channels that cater to different tastes and are funded by political groups and powerful individuals to promote their agendas and undermine their rivals. The Constitution also guarantees freedom of speech.\n\nStill, some of the country\u2019s laws lay down red lines. It is a crime to libel or defame foreign leaders and public officials or to insult the president, the flag, the army or other national symbols. Other laws ban blasphemy and speech deemed insulting to religion.\n\nIn the past, they have been inconsistently enforced, and it is the recent rise in speech-related cases that is worrying journalists and human rights campaigners.\n\nMarcel Ghanem, a popular talk show host, was summoned for questioning in cases against two Saudis who accused the Lebanese president and speaker of Parliament of links to terrorism while appearing as guests on his program. When he refused to show up, in protest of the charges, he was charged with obstruction of justice.\n\nLast month, a military court sentenced the political analyst Hanin Ghaddar in absentia to six months in prison for comments deemed insulting to the Lebanese Army, in a talk in Washington in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHuman Rights Watch documented other cases in a recent report: an activist summoned for questioning and detained over comments he made on Facebook; a man detained for writing a post that was perceived as insulting the Virgin Mary; and an Islamist organizer who was arrested and charged with defaming the president and insulting \u201ca brotherly country.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Salim Jreissati, Lebanon\u2019s justice minister, denied an attack on free speech in Lebanon, comparing those who promoted such an idea to Don Quixote\u2019s attacking windmills.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that in this murky, desert region that surrounds us when it comes to freedoms, we are a country of freedoms par excellence,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That turned into a story on the cost of hosting the game when most of the visitors and activities were in Phoenix, 10 miles away.\n\nToward the end of the regular season, the editors and reporters discuss which features to publish during the playoffs. Once the playoffs begin, we tighten our focus on the remaining teams. A week before the A.F.C. championship game last year, I interviewed Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and asked him about his relationship with President Trump and the suspension of his star quarterback, Tom Brady. A few days later, the Patriots won the A.F.C. title. Other outlets scrambled to get to Kraft, who ended up repeating to them what he had told me.\n\nSometimes I go looking for a story and wind up with an entirely different one instead.

Stock market turbulence typically prompts calls for smart and stringent financial regulation, which is not part of the Trump agenda. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s first acts as president was to fire Mr. Bharara, who made prosecuting Wall Street crime one of his priorities.

Once in office, he abandoned many of those promises. Instead, he has placed the considerations of high finance at the top of his priorities, far exceeding what even his friends at big banks, hedge funds and private equity firms could have hoped for.\n\nThe most potent evidence may be found in the handling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers against unfair practices by banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions. Its first permanent director, the former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray, ran the agency aggressively, to the loud protest of the banking industry and its Republican allies in Congress.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the bureau reported, it had recovered $12 billion for wronged consumers. Most famously, it brought charges over some of the most egregious financial abuse in recent memory, fining Wells Fargo Bank $100 million after it was found to have created a high-pressure sales culture that drove employees to open up more than two million accounts that customers hadn\u2019t asked for. The bureau also, through civil lawsuits and new rules, went after the payday lending industry, with the aim of protecting low income borrowers from becoming trapped by ballooning debt.\n\nAfter Mr. Cordray\u2019s departure in November, Mr. Trump replaced him with the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who once described the agency as a \u201cjoke.\u201d Mr. Mulvaney immediately started cutting back its power.

As the military historian Max Boot writes in his superb biography of the man, \u201cThe Road Not Taken,\u201d Lansdale told Defense Secretary Robert McNamara on their first meeting in 1961, after dumping a sample of the relatively primitive weapons and rubber sandals and equipment used by the Vietcong on his desk at the Pentagon:\n\n\u201cThe people that are fighting there on our side are being supplied with our weapons and uniforms and shoes and all of the best that we have, and we are training them. Yet, the enemy is licking our side. Always keep in mind about Vietnam, that the struggle goes far beyond the material things of life. It doesn\u2019t take weapons and uniforms and lots of food to win. It takes something else, ideas and ideals, and these guys are using that something else. Let\u2019s at least learn that lesson.\u201d\n\nWe never did. Our ally in Saigon was not a democracy. It was a notoriously corrupt, one-party, authoritarian state whose only virtue, in American eyes, was that it was not Communist. It survived only through an exorbitant investment of American money, guns and lives.\n\nCronkite had been a believer. He had no objection to the war on moral or even strategic grounds and for years had been faithfully reporting on his nightly broadcast the official accounts of American progress. He did so even as many prominent print journalists filed damaging reports and even as the reports on his own program by journalists like Morley Safer and Jack Laurence told a different story altogether.", "title": "Opinion | When Walter Cronkite Pronounced the War a \u2018Stalemate\u2019", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "My image was a Boston image: a detail from the portrait of Copley\u2019s half brother that has come to be known as \u201cA Boy With a Flying Squirrel.\u201d The painting is labored and lapidary, a bravura display of the artist\u2019s ability to counterfeit finishes ranging from gold to velvet to glass to fur, and to catch in a likeness the depths of longing, including his own. In 1765, the year Boston began to come apart over imperial taxation, Copley had hauled the painting to the Long Wharf and shipped it to London, a message in a bottle bobbing across a vast and furious ocean. A gossamer golden chain holds the little squirrel, as Copley too felt himself bound \u2014 shackled, he said in his letters \u2014 to a little life in a frozen region. It took the pull of a decade and the push of a revolution, but in time he broke the chain. I wanted to wear the squirrel. A close friend cautioned, \u201cYou know, people won\u2019t see it and think, Copley detail. They\u2019ll think, rat girl.\u201d\n\nThe tattoo artist lines up tiny pots of ink, 16 in all, blacks and browns and reds, a metallic gold, a lurid pink. She has studied the image, taking apart its planes and colors, rewinding Copley\u2019s brushstrokes. To watch her build it up again, from outline to underlayer to surface, working in pigment and blood, is as close as I will ever come to watching Copley\u2019s hand and seeing through his eyes. The work is painstaking, paint-staking. I worry that her eyes must someday fail her, as those of miniaturists often do, as Copley\u2019s eventually did. Tiny facets of the picture that I\u2019ve never noticed before \u2014 the squirrel\u2019s eyebrow, the pink tip of its nose, the peak of its ears, the faint stripes of black that mottle its back \u2014 come clear as they needle into my arm.\n\nMy book-mark has long since peeled and healed. Occasionally, even when I\u2019m wearing faculty drag, the squirrel peeks out from a sleeve. \u201cI thought it would be smaller,\u201d one friend offers, tentatively. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid somebody will see it?\u201d asks another. The mark, like the book, is about seeing; the squirrel simulacrum catches my peripheral vision as I write. Which seems, precisely, the needle\u2019s point. I\u2019m working on a new book project now, an entanglement with a more recent century that may, one day, make for a shocking tattoo. But as I rebury Copley, it seems only fair to admit that my time with him changed me. I will see the whiskers of that little squirrel every day for the rest of my life, flesh falling and eyes failing before its colors run.", "title": "When Writing a Book Leaves a (Literal) Mark on Its Author", "authors": []}

He also learned that his job would prevent him from moving for several years, which meant our plans for travel and a cabin would have to wait. There was also an election, and the future suddenly seemed shaky.\n\nI wanted to discuss it with him, but he was often tired. He had always worked too hard. At night, I fell asleep alone.\n\nSoon I began to talk about the news and bigger worries, and dreams of other cities, with other people, which only reminded me of what he and I were not able to talk about. Early in our relationship he had forwarded me the results of a personality test he had taken as a child that warned of a lack of interest in\u201cmore searching answers\u201d to life\u2019s bigger questions, and that \u201c\u2018once over lightly\u2019 seems to be the rule.\u201d\n\nWe had joked about these results, but I also told him I thought this was how he stayed so buoyant.\n\nNow I realized it meant there had always been a set of closed doors between us, doors I may never walk through. One night we watched a TV show about a troubled marriage. When I tried to talk about it afterward, he told me there was nothing to say. At that moment, he felt very far away.\n\nAround this time, a man I had worked with began sending me links to music, the kind of folk-blues songs that got inside you and unsettled parts better left untouched. He and I were both anxious people, and we began having long conversations about things that worried us and places we would rather be. At night, I listened to the songs he sent me, or the music of old punk bands I used to love, with lyrics that asked me questions about freedom whose answers I didn\u2019t like.\n\nOne night, after one of these songs ended, I found myself writing a story about our story\u2019s end. I wrote it on an empty envelope that had been addressed to us as I sat by our records and the map on the wall. As I was cutting a pizza, I wondered idly who would get the pizza slicer. I thought about how I would make eggs only for one. As I wrote, I felt as if I were on the outside looking in, making a decision without being a part of it. Being on the inside would have hurt too much.", "title": "When Your Body Tells You What Your Brain Won\u2019t", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "I opened the door onto a bedroom with an attached bathroom and enclosed porch, sparsely furnished with all-white side tables, dresser and bed, but no desk or television. The room\u2019s white walls lacked even the desultory kitsch of hotel art, which I never thought I would miss until it was gone. My suitcase was the only sign of human life. I didn\u2019t feel haunted; I felt like the ghost.\n\nThe morning after my arrival, I met Roam\u2019s founder, Bruno Haid, a tall 40-year-old Austrian who lives out of a single black duffel bag and wears only black and white. At the time, he was fully nomadic, with no apartment of his own, preferring instead to crash with friends or at his company\u2019s residences. We had made plans to meet the night before, but he fell asleep while working in bed in one of the other identically outfitted rooms. We convened in the courtyard and walked out of the Roam gate into the neighborhood for breakfast at a Cuban coffee stand. Haid was dressed for the heat, in Toms, a thin white T-shirt and black shorts brief enough to identify him as European. His eyes are a shocking pale blue, and he sported no fewer than three man-buns: two in his wiry dark hair and one in his beard.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your Spanish?\u201d Haid asked me with slight trepidation as we neared the stand. I told him I stopped studying in middle school. Instead, he enunciated carefully in English: \u201cI\u2019ll have a cor-ta-di-to.\u201d Like many people who are most at home in airports, Haid had an aura of unbelonging. It wasn\u2019t just his lack of street Spanish that betrayed him as a nonlocal, or the profuse sweat he broke into in the sun. It was as if he weren\u2019t really occupying the same space that I was. And, in a way, he wasn\u2019t. Haid\u2019s entire pitch to consumers is that cities and countries today can be refashioned as backdrops behind a laptop screen to be swapped smoothly at will. Indeed, a glossy placelessness is part of Roam\u2019s core product. \u201cYou always need a sense of place and home,\u201d Haid said later in the day, as we wandered through the area\u2019s blocks of quiet, rundown apartments. \u201cThe question is, does it need to be geographical?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t look the part, Haid spent much of his life in the hospitality business. He grew up at his family\u2019s small inn in Obergurgl, a tiny Alpine village in Austria with 5,000 inhabitants in the winter and only a handful in the summer. He spent most of his time alone in nature, escaping from the inn\u2019s tight communal quarters. \u201cOur living room was literally the guest room,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t have his own bedroom, forcing an early adjustment to sharing space, something he hated as a boy.\n\nYet the flow of tourists through Obergurgl gave Haid a hint of the wider world, which he escaped into as soon as he was able. He learned computer programming from print magazines and eventually, in 2005, founded a start-up that built custom search engines. By 2011, it had been folded into another company and then closed, leaving Haid, at 33, successful but directionless. He bummed around London and San Francisco for a while, using up accumulated airline points, staying with friends and feeling as if he had missed out on his youth.\n\nAs Haid was becoming more itinerant, the \u201cdigital nomad\u201d lifestyle was emerging from the intoxicating ether of techno-utopianism into the real world. The term\u2019s commonly cited origin is a 1997 book, \u201cDigital Nomad,\u201d by Tsugio Makimoto, a Japanese semiconductor scientist, and David Manners, a British journalist. The book presciently predicts that advances in communication technology \u201cwill make us geographically independent of our homes and offices,\u201d leading to \u201ccerebral nomadism\u201d \u2014 we will travel the world hunting down information and relationships, much as our ancestors stalked the plains for prey.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until around 2007 that a coterie of bloggers began promoting the lifestyle and its possibilities. The trend lashed together backpacker culture, monetized web presences and the happiness-optimization schemes of Timothy Ferriss, whose influential book \u201cThe 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich\u201d was published that year. One early advocate was Tynan Smith, a former professional gambler and pickup artist \u2014 he appears in Neil Strauss\u2019s \u201cThe Game\u201d under the pseudonym Herbal \u2014 turned blogger, who decided to go nomadic in early 2008. Traveling the globe became a way for Smith to regulate his cost of living according to how much his various online hustles brought in, a strategy that Ferriss called \u201cgeoarbitrage.\u201d If you\u2019re scraping together $1,000 a month, the logic goes, the money will go further in Thailand than in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the rise of smartphones, roaming data plans and cheaper air travel, this strategy has proved popular. Nomad hubs have been cropping up anywhere a low cost of living intersects with a high quality of life, most often in Southeast Asia: Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Ubud and Ho Chi Minh City have all become popular destinations on the circuit, as have cheap European cities like Lisbon and Madrid. During his initial travels, he says, Smith mostly encountered backpackers running down their savings, but subsequent generations of nomads emerged: first, marketing consultants often banking on sketchy S.E.O. schemes; next, freelance writers and programmers. Lately, Smith says, he increasingly encounters full-time employees whose bosses allow them to travel and work remotely.\n\nWhile living part time in a Mission District warehouse commune that he helped establish, Haid came upon the thriving Bali nomad scene during a prolonged stay in Ubud in late 2014. With the nearby tropical beaches, convenient co-working spaces and attractive nomadic crowd, \u201clife was really, really good,\u201d he told me, his voice tinged with more than a hint of nostalgia. \u201cI experienced firsthand that you can be just as productive in this beautiful, nice environment where you can have perfect $9 massages each day and amazing coffee.\u201d A start-up, Haid reasoned, could offer the same experience to anyone with enough money and an appropriate passport. At first he called the business Caravanserai, the word for Silk Road merchant hostels, but he simplified it after getting too many blank stares.\n\nHaid sought investors in 2015, when you could still practically stumble into venture capital, especially with a pitch that went something like \u201cUber for international housing.\u201d He brought on two co-founders, Dane Andrews and Flo Lauber, and raised $3.4 million to open Roam\u2019s first spaces, at the Miami compound and a converted boutique hotel in Ubud, which features a polished-cement communal kitchen and a courtyard pool. Roam Tokyo is in Akasaka, with blindingly minimalist rooms and a vintage-furnished communal kitchen. The London location is a plush Victorian in the upscale Chelsea neighborhood, attracting human rights lawyers commuting to The Hague as well as start-up developers.\n\nPhoto\n\nRoam has evolved into a miniature global corporation, with a dozen staff members, most of them digital nomads themselves, living among its locations, communicating through the chat platform Slack, checking in over weekly conference calls and scanning any print mail that comes in for online dispersal. Roam has no offices and no headquarters except its locations. For its clients and employees alike, the start-up provides a comprehensive structure for a post-place life.\n\nLater that day, Haid and I toured the Roam Miami grounds, passing the koi pond and outdoor tables under the palms, and a lone hammock in a circle of white sand next to the co-working space. Each of the four houses features shared amenities, like a yoga room or an art studio. We settled in the communal kitchen attached to the yellow house, where Roamies constantly flowed in and out. They came through to get coffee from the forever-brewing pot, grab a gluten-free artisanal cookie from the honor-system pantry or just look for a chat. It felt like an office kitchen, which in a sense it also was.\n\nMy conversations with Haid wandered from mundane details of hospitality design \u2014 choosing the right industrial fixtures in the kitchen, for heavy use \u2014 to the philosophical roots of nomadism. A surprising thing about Haid is the range of leftist flourishes he adds to any discussion, referencing everything from radical economists and the British filmmaker Adam Curtis to Verso Books and the state of \u201clate capitalism.\u201d In his mouth, they seemed less a coherent politics than a business plan, a means of predicting and profiting from the incipient future. Traditional careers began disintegrating after the financial crisis, Haid theorized, and soon advances in A.I. and robotics will cause further disruption. \u201cThere is not necessarily work there for everyone,\u201d he said. If jobs are no longer static or stable, then the notion of a permanent home must also be rethought. Nomadism, Haid argued, allows the discontented or disenfranchised to design new, sustainable lifestyles in the global marketplace. It\u2019s a means of letting human capital find the path of least resistance, wherever it may be.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThere is a vicious plausibility to Haid\u2019s vision. The macroeconomic pressures he describes in the urbanized West \u2014 a lack of affordable housing and linear careers \u2014 are particularly tough on millennials, who are also, incidentally or not, a historically unattached generation, with low rates of marriage, homeownership and childbearing. If the usual trappings of adulthood don\u2019t seem attainable, and a permanent sense of precariousness seems unavoidable, why not embrace impermanence instead? Already there are partial nomads all around you; you just might not think of them that way yet. There\u2019s the writer who spends a few months of every year in Berlin, making up for diminishing freelance wages with cheap Neuk\u00f6lln rent; the curator bouncing between New York and Los Angeles; the artist jumping from Tokyo residency to Istanbul fellowship. In the competitive freelance economy, geographic mobility has become a superficial sign of both success and creative freedom: the ability to do anything, anywhere, at any time.\n\nThose in less artsy careers who chase that same sort of freedom may find it illusory. The new technologies that have liberated us from place have also made employers more comfortable with remote workers, but only because we can be so easily monitored. Combine this interconnectivity with an increasing population of freelancers \u2014 over a third of the American work force makes money in the so-called gig economy \u2014 and you have the makings of a nomad boom. Haid estimates his target customer base to be around 1.2 million people who make over $80,000 a year and could live anywhere. Pieter Levels, creator of the social network Nomad List, believes there to be a nomad population in the high hundreds of thousands.\n\nHaid claims that Roam is already profitable. In crowded cities, it\u2019s not hard to keep rooms occupied \u2014 empty spaces are also listed on Airbnb \u2014 and the company has a clever business model that limits its risk: Property developers work with Roam to format and furnish buildings, then Roam leases and operates them, much as a hotel does. (The Miami compound is on a five-year lease.) Roam\u2019s largest cost is scouting new locations, which can be difficult. The company started Roam Madrid in a former convent, but it closed it after finding the conditions too austere even for nomads.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe major selling point of Roam is its community, in which no one is supposed to feel strange or isolated, as Haid once did, for leading an itinerant life. The Miami crowd, I found, was surprisingly diverse in age and race. (Like the tech industry that the nomad scene came from, its adherents skew young, white, Western and male.) Over the week, I hung out with South American software developers, two coupled entrepreneurs from Switzerland, a middle-aged American contractor who works for I.B.M. on international events, an Israeli machine-learning expert and a 75-year-old retired real estate agent, Lino Darchun, who seemed to recognize in Roam an opportunity to counteract loneliness. \u201cMy wife passed away,\u201d he told me. \u201cI wanted to just make a lifestyle change.\u201d He went on: \u201cI can afford something pricier than Roam, but I had such a good time here.\u201d And the community did seem like a better place than most to redefine yourself. Another Roamie, a 48-year-old named Stacie Harrison, was also grieving. She lost her boyfriend, a pilot, to a plane crash in 2016 and moved to Roam Miami from Phoenix, her hometown.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDaily routines around the compound varied in proportions of work and socializing. The Israeli, Uri Wolfovitz, commuted to a nearby WeWork to collaborate with his start-up co-founder, who actually lived in Miami. Wolfovitz had no long-term plans to stay, because, as he explained, the start-up would thrive or die within a year. Miami is decidedly second-rate as a tech hub, so he was stuck in a limbo that made Roam useful, if not ideal. \u201cIt\u2019s no place to start a company,\u201d he told me with characteristic bluntness in the kitchen one afternoon. \u201cThis city is [expletive].\u201d\n\nI have to admit that becoming a digital nomad had its personal appeal, especially given that Roam was made for people like me. I\u2019m a freelance writer by trade; I live in a rented apartment in Brooklyn, and I already work from a co-working space. My millennial precariousness is balanced, if that\u2019s the word, by an ability to make rash decisions that renders my situation more bearable: I could theoretically bail at any time and become a vegan surfer in Ubud, filing dispatches to editors still marooned behind their Midtown desks. The option was always there, and in the back of my mind, I thought of Miami as a trial run for true escape: Bali did sound nice.\n\nAt Roam, I found an instant routine, with morning yoga classes on the lawn in the company of a stray black cat (\u201cRoamy\u201d), nightly beers at the outdoor picnic table and a weekly email newsletter listing special events and new-member introductions (\u201cBrent and Michael, married for 25 years, sold their home in Seattle last year and are now planning several years of travel\u201d). On Wednesdays, there\u2019s a \u201cfamily dinner.\u201d For the one I attended, Hanna Boethius, half of the couple from Switzerland and a freelance nutritionist, led the charge with a low-carb, gluten-free meal of sous-vide steak, raw broccoli salad and vegetable lasagna without noodles.\n\nAs Hanna and her husband, Sebastian, founder of a remote software agency, hustled about the kitchen, I perched in the corner with Harrison, whose enthusiasm never flagged. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hybrid between a summer camp for adults and a reality-TV show without the cameras,\u201d she cheerfully warned me about life at the compound. At Roam, she was working on a website that helps users posthumously distribute their digital documents; progress on the site seemed slow, and when I inquired, she blamed the developer she contracted \u2014 who was also remote. More than the younger members, Harrison seemed to struggle with the consequences of her newly unbounded lifestyle. \u201cI feel like all of my old belief systems say I should get a job and find a regular apartment, and my new, emerging belief systems are saying maybe there\u2019s another way,\u201d she told me as she showed me around her sunny, spotless room later in the week. \u201cI needed a fresh start. I\u2019m all about doing what makes me happy \u2014 I just want to be by the beach.\u201d\n\nThe environment encouraged a fast, confessional intimacy. Remote freelance work was one of the few things we all had in common, and so it was a constant topic of discussion: how to stay motivated, entrepreneurial, sane. Sebastian tried to sell me, to no avail, on the benefits of \u201cketo-clarity,\u201d or the enlightened mental state that comes from a low-carb, high-fat diet.\n\nSometimes Roam felt more like immersive group therapy than tourism, because I wasn\u2019t leaving the compound that much anyway. I didn\u2019t have a rental car, and dense Miami traffic made even Uber a hassle. One evening, Marco Andrade, a young Brazilian software engineer, taught a group of us how to play the not-safe-for-work version of Bears Vs Babies, an overwhelmingly complex card game that involves genitalia, explosive diarrhea and fighting monsters. Then we moved on to Cards Against Humanity. More than anything else, it reminded me of high school in the suburbs without a driver\u2019s license.\n\nIn this closed social system, roles and hierarchies develop much as they do on reality shows, just as Harrison had suggested to me at dinner. Long-term residents like Gregg Albert, the gregarious I.B.M. contractor, and a Bloomberg journalist named Nathan Crooks, who had each been living there for six months or more, acted out an earned authority, introducing new guests into the routine. Roam\u2019s live-in community managers played camp counselors, urging on social activity in a pleasant albeit intermittently patronizing way. As Roamies arrived and departed, even in the week I was there, the social texture shifted in subtle and compelling ways, placating any incipient boredom: It was always changing and remaining the same.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCan you imagine a pair of noise-canceling headphones for geography? That\u2019s how I started to think of Roam. When you want to, you can block out your sense of place entirely and exist in a hazy, calm, featureless space that could be anywhere. This nomadic bubble goes beyond a hotel in that it stretches around the world and is built to encompass your entire life; it promises to become your post-geographical home. Yet I found there to also be an anxiety to this hermetic placelessness, no matter how beautifully unburdened or minimalist it appears. Living anywhere is a lot like living nowhere.\n\nHaid sees nomadism as a solution to our technologized, globalized lives, but it seems less like a fix than like an extension or intensification of the same condition. You travel in order to work, or vice versa, but the work becomes all-consuming. For better or worse, Roam has a way of removing what makes travel travel: culture shock, surprises and even loneliness, that feeling of being somewhere no one can find you.\n\nI went to Miami anticipating a lifestyle shift. I could lie on the beaches the city was built to provide access to, get things done and explore a different place while being supported in my esoteric freelancer habits by a like-minded group. But the last of these goals was the only one I could ever seem to advance. I occupied most of my time at the bamboo Ikea desks of the co-working space, sweating over a coffee mug, trying to write \u2014 just as I do in Brooklyn. On the last morning at Roam, I realized I had barely even seen the ocean, so I took a car from Little Havana to Crandon Park Beach, an island nature preserve that used to be a coconut plantation. I left my bag on the sand and waded out into the warm, shallow water.\n\nIt was comforting to float there alone, moving with the gentle waves as they passed. It felt like what I should have been doing all along \u2014 embracing freedom, warm weather, the open horizon \u2014 but I had spent so much time being a nomad that I forgot to do the actual traveling. It\u2019s not much of a solution to the predations of capitalism: You can go anywhere, as long as you never stop working.", "title": "When You\u2019re a \u2018Digital Nomad,\u2019 the World Is Your Office", "authors": ["Kyle Chayka"]}

A 1981 profile in The New York Times reported that he read everything he could about guns at the New York Public Library and \u201cstudied gun metallurgy, gun mechanisms, gun designs\u201d and \u201ccame to regard the gun as a uniquely engineered tool.\u201d\n\nHe also liked to recount how he once revealed to guests at a Manhattan cocktail party what he did for a living.\n\n\u201cWhen you mention you\u2019re in the gun business, people look shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey infer that you have an utter disregard for human life, which is preposterous.\u201d\n\nHe said at the time, \u201cThere\u2019s so much hostility, so many people stimulated to violence. But to be talking about gun legislation as a cure for this is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHis position appeared to evolve. A series of mass shootings captured headlines in the following years. Among them, an unemployed security guard named James Oliver Huberty used an Uzi semiautomatic rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol during a 1984 rampage at a McDonald\u2019s in California that left 21 dead and 19 wounded. In 1991, an unemployment merchant seaman, George J. Hennard, shot 22 people dead at a cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., and injured another 20.\n\nWith momentum building for gun control, Mr. Ruger\u2019s move was partly tactical. He and his allies wanted \u201cto take a responsible position to head off any further restrictions that might even have banned all semiautomatic firearms,\u201d Robert L. Wilson wrote in the book \u201cRuger and His Guns.\u201d\n\nFrom the gun industry\u2019s point of view, Mr. Ruger\u2019s stance is a cautionary tale. If he aimed to forestall a ban on assault weapons, in the end, both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned through a 1994 measure signed by President Bill Clinton. The ban expired in 2004.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Reid Sr., the vice president and general counsel of Sturm, Ruger, said, \u201cAs I am sure you can appreciate, Mr. Ruger died many years ago and folks who were around and worked with him directly are long gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, none of the Ruger family has been involved in the day-to-day operation of the business for more than a decade,\u201d he added.

After the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre led to the deaths of 20 first graders and six adults, Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, was a co-sponsor of legislation that would have required universal background checks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the Second Amendment, I\u2019m a gun owner and take my son shooting,\u201d he said in an interview. But at the same time, he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s completely reasonable to make it more difficult for those who do not have a legitimate right to a firearm to obtain them.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, which was also sponsored by Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, failed.\n\n\u201cYou know, the N.R.A. used to be very big supporters of mine, institutionally; they are not so much anymore,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI will say honestly, a vast majority of Pennsylvanians agree with my approach on background checks, so on balance, I don\u2019t think it hurt me politically.\u201d\n\nThe N.R.A., which did not return calls for comment, has lately been pushing to compel states that do not allow concealed carry permits to honor permits issued by other states. It is also trying to deregulate silencers.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, said his group spent more money lobbying states than the federal government. Restrictions on bump stocks, the device that makes semiautomatic weapons more like machine guns, faltered in Washington after they were used in the Las Vegas massacre. But bans have been enacted in Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe way to move Congress is to show where the people stand on this issue, and you do that most effectively through state ballots and state legislation,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said, likening the approach to the way gay rights advocates methodically advanced marriage rights through state legislatures.\n\nMany other western democracies have far tighter gun control laws. The rate of homicides with guns in the United States is 16 times higher than it is in Germany, 6.6 times higher than it is in Canada and more than 30 times higher than in Australia or Britain, according to data collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwenty-six people died in the Sutherland Springs shooting, including the pastor\u2019s 14-year-old daughter and a pregnant woman, while another 20 were injured by a gun bearing the Ruger name.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "The shift toward reform as a matter of public policy came with the rise of industrial capitalism. By the early 20th century, middle-class Americans found themselves awash in social crises: overcrowded cities, political corruption, mass immigration, wild disparities of wealth. But they were also surrounded by new ideas about how to solve those problems, from a muckraking press to the budding expertise of social scientists, who promised that humans could understand and fix large-scale problems. From this mix came the idea of \u201creform\u201d as a way to adjust society to cope with its new realities \u2014 and the image of \u201creformers\u201d as a special breed of educated do-gooders. Crusading intellectuals like Jane Addams and John Dewey came to epitomize this type: privileged members of society who put their talents to work devising new ways to help the poor or to educate children, aiming to liberate the human spirit to reach its full potential.\n\nProgressive reformers helped bring about tenement laws and income taxes, trustbusting and labor protections, women\u2019s suffrage and the direct election of senators. Some of these measures tried to rein in the capitalist beast, returning the country to an age of yeoman farmers and small-scale producers; others embraced the modern dream of organizing human activity in ever more rational, efficient ways. In either case, some Americans wanted none of it, and saw \u201creform\u201d as perilously close to an elite conspiracy. The era\u2019s conservatives insisted that human nature \u2014 and therefore human society \u2014 was irredeemably imperfect, and that too much mucking around with social legislation bred an overreaching, tyrannical government. Left-wing radicals often disliked such projects, too, insisting that the dribs and drabs of reform were a bourgeois project that only delayed what really needed to be done, which was obviously revolution. In her famous 1899 essay \u201cReform or Revolution,\u201d the German socialist Rosa Luxemburg argued that reform should never be an end in itself, but that agitating for it could be a means of preparing for the final confrontation with capitalism.\n\nThese tensions lasted well into the New Deal, the crowning years of America\u2019s enthusiasm for reform. New Dealers held on to progressive ideas while sloughing off some of the moralizing. Over time, though, their economic policies ushered in what the historian Alan Brinkley has described, in the title of a 1995 book, as \u201cThe End of Reform.\u201d The New Deal, he wrote, grew from a complex tradition of progressive reform, then \u201cattached the word \u2018liberalism\u2019 to it, and set about transforming it.\u201d The new liberals ultimately pinned their hopes on economic growth and Keynesian tinkering, not the trickier task of actively redistributing wealth and power. Over the decades that followed, they would orient themselves increasingly toward civil and social rights rather than sweeping economic reform, a subtle but important shift.\n\nThis may have spelled the \u201cend\u201d of a certain mode of reform, but it did little to change reform\u2019s association with progressives and liberals \u2014 even when it was taken up by their opponents. In 1955, the historian Richard Hofstadter published a book whose title named the period from the 1890s through the 1940s \u201cThe Age of Reform.\u201d He accepted as axiomatic that reformers came from \u201cthe side of the left in American history.\u201d Still, he noted, there was now a tendency among conservative politicians to claim \u201creform\u201d and \u201creformer\u201d as gauzy, feel-good labels. \u201cWe usually reserve our highest acclaim for the politician who has in him a touch of the liberal reformer,\u201d Hofstadter wrote. As a result, any talented conservative politician learned how to \u201cexert his maximal influence by using the rhetoric of progressivism and winning the plaudits of the reformers\u201d \u2014 while otherwise working against what most progressives would want.\n\nSix decades later, a similar impulse seems to hold sway in Washington. While Democrats search for a muscular patriotic language to win back Trump voters (or galvanize their own), Republicans and conservatives seem happy enough to claim the gentler mantle of reform, especially when facing popular skepticism or outright hostility toward their policy proposals. Having accomplished \u201ctax reform,\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan now dreams of \u201centitlement reform,\u201d through which he envisions reducing the deficit by cutting back on signature liberal programs like Medicare and Social Security. In a recent open letter sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, 12 conservative figures urged Ryan, along with Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, not to forget about \u201chealth reform,\u201d by which they mean continuing the effort to undo Obamacare. Several signers of that letter have been described as \u201creform conservatives,\u201d a loose term that signals inside-the-Beltway policy seriousness while creating distance from the more xenophobic elements of the Republican Party.\n\nNot all aspects of reform carry quite the same partisan or ideological tinge. \u201cCriminal-justice reform,\u201d intended to reduce the harms of mass incarceration, seems to be one of the few genuinely bipartisan agenda items in Washington. (Trump himself, who rails against \u201csavage\u201d criminals, has spoken about \u201creforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\u201d) \u201cCampaign-finance reform\u201d occasionally rallies support across party lines, as do a few select aspects of \u201cimmigration reform.\u201d\n\nBut even those issues \u2014 narrow, practical and still contentious \u2014 point to some of the limits of reform right now. A century ago, reform meant coming up with inspiring new ideas that would lead to greater justice, a confidence that human planning and ingenuity could accomplish grand and transformative things. Now it seems to mean, at best, restrained corrective measures \u2014 and far more often than that, actively undoing the policies of the past, an act of hardheaded resignation rather than of collective hope. Reform once promised a future of unparalleled opportunity. Today, it often marks the opposite, a loss of faith in the idea of progress itself.", "title": "When \u2018Reform\u2019 Means a Process of Elimination", "authors": ["Beverly Gage", "First Words"]}

But labor market fluidity \u2014 job switching, creation and destruction \u2014 has been declining since the 1980s.\n\nClear though the pattern may be, the researchers acknowledge that we haven\u2019t yet figured out what is holding the economy\u2019s dynamism back. \u201cThis is one of those big, economywide trends,\u201d Mr. Shambaugh told me. \u201cThere is room for a lot of stories.\u201d\n\nCan the corporate landscape become more dynamic again? \u201cNone of the potential policy explanations have been conclusively shown to account for the bulk of the decline in dynamism,\u201d Mr. Shambaugh and his colleagues note. The critical question that remains is whether there is a set of policies that might restore the economy\u2019s vitality.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about demographic and social change. Sure, we are aging. Older workers will be less likely to move to a new job across state lines. Families with two earners will have a harder time relocating when one gets a new job offer. Stratospheric rents will make it tough to migrate to some of the most vibrant labor markets, like New York or San Francisco.\n\nPolicy has certainly played a role: Labor market regulations can gum up the sorting of workers into the best possible jobs, where they will be at their most productive and most highly paid. Specifically, state occupational licensing rules fence off some of the most desirable, well-paid jobs.\n\nBut this alone cannot explain away stagnation. Explaining stagnation requires explaining not only why there are so few well-paying jobs but also why there are so few emergent companies ready to employ productive workers. Well into the information age, in a business ecosystem with low barriers to entry, where venture capital stands ready to throw itself at the next good idea, the economy has somehow forgotten how to create companies.\n\nMy best guess is that this is all about the decline of competition. Mr. Shambaugh and his co-authors note how noncompete agreements and other devices used by businesses to stop their employees from seeking jobs elsewhere are preventing many workers from taking the better job that pays more money. I would argue that the failure is bigger: By allowing an ecosystem of gargantuan companies to develop, all but dominating the markets they served, the American economy shut out disruption.

But that link seems broken, and like film-noir detectives, analysts have scrutinized hard-edge statistics and fuzzier psychological indicators for clues about why.\n\nIn the recession that began a decade ago, the businesses most likely to survive tended to be the most conservative spenders, said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. That approach was rewarded and has now been reinforced, he said, helping to restrain the growth of full-time work forces and salaries.\n\nAon Hewitt\u2019s annual surveys seem to bear that out. The practice of spending more on variable pay than on permanent raises took root in the 1990s, when growing competition from abroad increased pressure on companies to keep a lid on prices and production costs.\n\nPay-for-performance and other bonuses increasingly functioned as a release valve. Companies could offer more money to attract talent or when profits were strong, and pull back when business was slow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the recession, the trend accelerated.\n\n\u201cThe response in 2009 was unlike any prior response to a recession or depression in that organizations actually reduced salaries, they didn\u2019t just freeze them as a means of allegedly avoiding greater layoffs,\u201d said Ken Abosch, a partner at Aon Hewitt. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lesson learned from that.\u201d That lesson: Stay nimble.\n\nThe recessionary hangover encouraged employers to avoid adding fixed costs and to be as flexible as possible in staffing and compensation. The trend toward outsourcing work that was once handled in house as a way of saving money fits in with that story line.\n\nThe percentage spent on salary increases never returned to its pre-2009 levels, the Aon Hewitt surveys show, while the percentage spent on bonuses and other short-term rewards climbed to new levels. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll see a long-term increase in real wage growth,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.\n\nSo far, Wall Street has drawn a different conclusion, although several economists question whether the 2.9 percent jump in hourly average earnings in January from a year earlier signaled a turning point. Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, attributed wage pickup last month to unusually cold weather, which reduced the number of hours that low-wage workers clocked.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Declining unionization, noncompete contracts, tepid minimum-wage increases, globalization and sluggish productivity have all played a role.\n\nWhatever the cause, the consequences can be profound. Salary increases compound over time, offering greater financial security. Moreover, bonuses have not made up for wage stagnation. The inflation-adjusted median income of men working full time was lower in 2016 than it was in 1973. And their lifetime earnings \u2014 which include salary, wages, bonuses and exercised stock options \u2014 have mostly dropped since then.\n\nMost bonuses still come in traditional forms: payoffs for executive-suite occupants and deal hunters, or sweeteners for newly hired employees. Certain industries, like finance and insurance, with their longer tradition of year-end and performance-based rewards, continue to have much bigger bonus budgets than sectors like retail.\n\nBut the practice has expanded. In 1991, fewer than half of companies that Aon Hewitt surveyed had a broad-based rewards program. Last year, 88 percent did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now widespread across all industry sectors, even some that were holdbacks such as utilities, health care, not-for-profits and government,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSalaried workers, rather than hourly wage earners, remain much more likely to be the recipients of such extra payments.\n\nIn tracking compensation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not differentiate between hourly workers and those on a set salary. Still, Jesus Ranon, supervisory labor economist at the bureau, said, \u201cYou can see in terms of percent of compensation there is an increase in these bonus components.\u201d\n\nIn March 2004, bonuses accounted for 1.6 percent of total compensation (including wages, salaries and benefits). In March 2017, they accounted for 2.6 percent. The wage and salary share of total compensation budgets fell by nearly 2 percent over the same period.\n\nIf given a choice, most workers would take a raise. When Aon Hewitt asked 2,079 American workers in a second, newly completed survey what they would like to see their employers do with their tax-cut windfall, 65 percent chose a pay raise \u2014 twice as many as any other option, including a bonus or a 401(k) contribution.\n\nTakisha Gower, a passenger service agent for Envoy, the air carrier that was previously known as American Eagle and is owned by American Airlines, welcomed her recent $1,000 bonus, which the company credited to the \u201cnew tax structure.\u201d She is much more concerned, however, about her base pay week to week, a subject of longstanding contract negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt was appreciated, but it doesn\u2019t fix the long term,\u201d Ms. Gower said of the bonus. \u201cWe need a livable wage that we can support our families off.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of employees qualify for government assistance,\u201d she added. \u201cSome have to work 60 hours a week to make ends meet.\u201d", "title": "Where Did Your Pay Raise Go?

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "It was debatable how large a share of the blame Goodell personally deserved for this trajectory \u2014 and Goodell, in any case, was not inclined to accept much of it. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little more reflective of how somewhat divided our society is at this stage,\u201d he told me in early January. But division was the inescapable theme that came up in the two-dozen interviews I conducted with players, owners and league officials about a season in which sponsorships were jeopardized, boycotts were threatened, blacklists against players were suspected, tickets and jerseys were burned and ratings and attendance were down. \u201cThere\u2019s no question, this season has been probably unlike anything that I\u2019ve been around,\u201d said Art Rooney II, president of the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose grandfather founded the team in 1933.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.F.L. loves to emphasize how football brings friends, families and communities together, and to present the game as an oasis clear of the rest of life\u2019s messiness \u2014 or \u201cdistractions,\u201d as coaches like to call such extraneous passions as politics. \u201cWe offer fans a respite from the trials and missteps of everyday life,\u201d Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, says. That promise would evaporate abruptly in 2017, when the most potent oligarchy in American sports would have its power structure shaken, and arrive at the end of the season wondering: Was 2017 an anomaly or the future?\n\nI went to see Roger Goodell at the N.F.L.\u2019s headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, the morning after a sluggish docket of first-round playoff games in early January. The commissioner was sitting in his sixth-floor office, sipping water and battling a cold. Goodell, who is 58, wore a beige V-neck sweater and looked somewhat worn down but freshly worked-out; he had just come from a Pilates class at a studio not far from the office. It had been a \u201cchallenging\u201d season, Goodell allowed \u2014 there are never \u201cproblems,\u201d only \u201cchallenges\u201d for this commissioner \u2014 but every season has its issues. \u201cNever has there been a period in our history where everything\u2019s been great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had our challenges.\u201d\n\nGoodell, the son of the former Republican senator from New York Charles Goodell, is a gifted political animal. He can come off as stiff and cautious in speeches and on TV \u2014 and can in fact be stiff and cautious in person too \u2014 but he was also clearly bred for public life, and adept at turning it on as necessary. He is a prodigious slapper of backs, squeezer of shoulders and knower of names. He laughs easily \u2014 maybe for real, or maybe not. He has also mastered the paramount political skill of prioritizing constituencies, none more so than the 32 N.F.L. team owners who employ him, the \u201cmembership,\u201d as they are known to one another. \u201cYou have to be able to deal with and get along with 32 different personalities,\u201d John Mara, the president and an owner of the New York Giants, told me. \u201cWe range from people like me who were born in a family business, and people who are self-made billionaires who think they know everything about everything.\u201d\n\nThen there was that other billionaire \u2014 the one in the White House. From early in his presidential campaign, Donald Trump held up the N.F.L. as a symbol of the sissified and hypersensitive culture he was running against: \u201cYou used to see these tackles, and it was incredible to watch, right?\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Nevada in early 2016. \u201cBut football has become soft like our country has become soft.\u201d\n\nCulture-war critiques of the N.F.L. were previously mostly confined to the left. Liberals were far more prone to suspicion of football for its violence, militaristic sensibility and over-the-top displays of patriotism. But Trump struck a throbbing nerve on the right, making the N.F.L. an improbable symbol of permissive leadership and political correctness.\n\nSeven months after Trump\u2019s Nevada rally, and just in time for the general election, Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, took to kneeling during the national anthem before preseason games: a protest, he explained, against police brutality endured by African-Americans and other minorities. It was only a matter of time before Trump served up the vegan Kaepernick as red meat to his base. \u201cThe N.F.L. is way down in their ratings,\u201d Trump taunted the league at a campaign rally in Greeley, Colo., a week before the election. He said that politics was \u201ca much rougher game than football\u201d and also more exciting. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a lot of people away from the N.F.L.,\u201d Trump boasted. \u201cAnd the other reason is Kaepernick \u2014 Kaepernick!\u201d\n\nWell before Kaepernick was even born, the N.F.L. had figured prominently in the future president\u2019s personal ledger of grievance and unreturned affection. Trump had wanted into the membership for years, even though his earlier foray into football \u2014 as the owner of the short-lived United States Football League\u2019s New Jersey Generals in the 1980s \u2014 ended disastrously, with the league\u2019s collapse. In 1984, he finagled himself a meeting with the N.F.L. commissioner at the time, Pete Rozelle, at the Pierre Hotel in New York, in which he told Rozelle he would do whatever it took to get himself into the league, according to an account of the meeting in \u201cFootball for a Buck,\u201d the sportswriter Jeff Pearlman\u2019s coming book on the U.S.F.L. Rozelle was not impressed.\n\nRozelle was Goodell\u2019s mentor and idol, almost from the day Goodell set foot at the league in 1982. Rozelle\u2019s dim view of Trump \u2014 whom he saw as a clown and a con man \u2014 trickled down to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, though Goodell is careful never to share his views on Trump publicly. He has met Trump at least twice over the years, once at a Yankees game about 15 years ago and then a few years later at a small dinner gathering. Goodell found Trump to be pleasant, engaging and solicitous in those limited encounters \u2014 maybe because Trump was still, at the time, angling for a place in the membership. In 2014, he tried to buy the Buffalo Bills, only to have his bid passed over. After losing out on Buffalo, Trump lashed out at his owner friends \u2014 particularly New England\u2019s Robert Kraft \u2014 for not doing more to grease his entry into the league. He also told friends that the N.F.L., particularly Goodell, was intent on freezing him out, on account of his history with the U.S.F.L.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I interviewed Trump \u2014 now a presidential candidate \u2014 for an article a year later, he was still nursing a grudge, and on a particular hobbyhorse about how unfairly the league had treated his \u201cgreat friend\u201d Tom Brady. The New England Patriots quarterback had recently been suspended by the league for four games over his supposed role in the football air-pressure scandal known as Deflategate. Trump knew I had recently written about the N.F.L. and Brady, and he proceeded to deride Goodell to me as a \u201cweak guy,\u201d \u201ca dope\u201d and \u201ca stupid guy,\u201d among other things.\n\nGoodell comes from a notable Republican lineage \u2014 albeit of the mostly extinct Northeastern-moderate subspecies \u2014 and has donated to Republican candidates. But he is carefully diplomatic in his public politics: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting times we live in,\u201d was as much as he allowed himself to say in our interview. The politics of his league were another matter. When you look at the various constituencies that make up the N.F.L. \u201cfamily,\u201d it\u2019s a wonder the center has held as long as it has. More than 83 percent of N.F.L. fans are white, according to a Reuters report citing a 2007 study, and fans are 20 percent more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. Nearly 70 percent of the players, meanwhile, are black, according to data from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. N.F.L. owners, with a few exceptions, lean Republican; several of them donated to Trump\u2019s campaign, and some donated $1 million apiece to his inauguration committee. But unlike Trump, the N.F.L. cannot afford to play only to its base. It needs far more than just the predominately white, heavily male voters that compose Trump\u2019s hard-core coalition. It wants everybody in the football family.\n\nGoodell was in Colorado on the Friday night in September when Trump, at a rally in Alabama, called on N.F.L. owners to fire players who knelt during the national anthem. \u201cGet that son of a [expletive] off the field right now,\u201d Trump said. Joe Lockhart, the N.F.L.\u2019s chief spokesman and former White House press secretary under President Clinton, called Goodell at 5:30 a.m. the following morning to discuss how to proceed.\n\nGoodell\u2019s initial reaction was a mix of anger and resignation. The league\u2019s top executives \u2014 Goodell; Jeff Pash, the general counsel; and Tod Leiweke, the chief operating officer \u2014 divided up owners to call. The watchword was \u201cunity\u201d: They should present a single front insofar as that would be possible. Owners and teams were encouraged to issue statements, emphasizing their support for their players. Nearly every team did, though very few called out Trump or even mentioned the president. Shahid Khan, the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 owner \u2014 a Pakistan-born Muslim and the only nonwhite owner in the N.F.L., as well as one of the donors to Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 joined his team on the field before the game and locked arms in a show of solidarity. Several other owners followed his lead.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s initial protests in 2016 had inspired roughly a dozen or so players to do the same or similar. But for all the media attention they received, the demonstrations had never reached a critical mass of players or prompted any great fan response. Trump\u2019s provocation in Alabama changed that. \u201cThe week before the president made his statement, four people kneeled,\u201d Arthur Blank told me. \u201cThe president then said his thing, and then 400 people kneeled.\u201d And even that response, Blank went on, showed signs of dying down within a few days \u2014 only to flare up again when Vice President Mike Pence waged (or staged) his own counterprotest, leaving an Oct. 8 Indianapolis Colts game he was attending at taxpayer expense after a group of visiting San Francisco 49ers knelt during the anthem. \u201cA dumb thing,\u201d Blank called Pence\u2019s action.\n\nBut Trump and Pence most certainly appealed to a vocal subset of N.F.L. fans. They booed kneeling players and called for boycotts; teams argued politics among themselves, and some former players criticized current ones. (\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been ashamed to be a Patriot,\u201d the longtime New England lineman Matt Light said after a dozen current Patriots took a knee.) \u201cNo one was expecting this to happen, and it was hard to see coming,\u201d the Steelers\u2019 Art Rooney told me. \u201cI think there was no question it hurt the league.\u201d\n\nCertainly these episodes went well beyond \u201cdistraction,\u201d which itself became a term of offense among protesting players. \u201cWhen people are doing things for kids or natural disasters, nobody considers that a \u2018distraction,\u2019\u201d Malcolm Jenkins, the Philadelphia Eagles defensive back, told me this week. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you\u2019re talking about racism or police brutality, all of a sudden those things are uncomfortable.\u201d Russell Okung, an offensive tackle for the Los Angeles Chargers, said that the whole sequence of events \u2014 begun by Kaepernick, propelled by Trump \u2014 had turned the notion of \u201cdistraction\u201d into something that could in fact usher in a new period of activism in sports. \u201cNever has our generation been presented with these historic choices,\u201d Okung told me. There could be ramifications inside what has traditionally be an iron-fisted hierarchy inside the N.F.L. That\u2019s the nature of movements: They don\u2019t necessarily respect boundaries.\n\nAs with so many things involving Trump, the president\u2019s cannonball into the middle of a relatively contained pool of player protest set off waves in all directions. In the absence of any substantial backlash to the initial Kaepernick-led wave of demonstrations, the N.F.L. could at least tacitly endorse the players\u2019 right to use their platform. But then suddenly not only the president of the United States but also a significant share of Americans were saying \u201cStand up and stick to sports.\u201d It moved the whole argument onto much more historically explosive \u2014 and, in a league where the owner-player divide is also largely a white-black divide, racially charged \u2014 grounds. \u201cYou guys are cattle, and we\u2019re the ranchers,\u201d the former Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm famously told the Hall of Fame offensive lineman and players\u2019 union leader Gene Upshaw during a collective-bargaining negotiation in 1987. The line \u2014 oft-quoted to this day \u2014 encapsulates both the authority structure of the N.F.L. and an autocratic view held by most of the \u201cranchers\u201d and many of the paying customers. More recently, during a tense owners\u2019 meeting at the height of the anthem protests in October, the Houston Texans\u2019 owner, Bob McNair, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t have the inmates running the prison,\u201d according to an ESPN report. Most people construed the remark as an insult with clear racial overtones against protesting players, nearly all of whom were African-American. (McNair later apologized and claimed that the \u201cinmates\u201d he was referring to were not the players but executives at the league office.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I asked Goodell whether he or anyone on his staff had any communication with the White House, back-channel or otherwise, he smirked (I took this as a no). \u201cOur focus is on what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus is on the game itself.\u201d Nevertheless, owners and league officials close to Goodell said he was more supportive of the protesting players than they would have expected. He resisted pressure to enforce a \u201cstand for the anthem\u201d mandate from more conservative owners \u2014 the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Jerry Jones and the Washington Redskins\u2019 Daniel Snyder among them. Goodell spent hours listening to players\u2019 concerns and meeting with members of the N.F.L. Players Coalition, a newly formed advocacy group dedicated to the racial-justice issues that prompted the anthem protests. The league pledged to the coalition that it would donate $89 million over seven years to social-justice organizations. That was less than half what Goodell\u2019s new salary could bring him in just five years, but the commissioner still drew considerable praise from players who were critical of him in the past. \u201cI was in two meetings with Roger, and I felt like he was sincere in what he was trying to do,\u201d Eric Winston, an offensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals and the president of the N.F.L. Players Association, the players\u2019 union, told me. \u201cIn hindsight you can always do more, but I do think he has done a very admirable job.\u201d\n\nIn conversations with owners, Goodell expressed grudging admiration for Kaepernick (at least until he sued the league in October, claiming collusion on the part of the owners to keep him from playing for another team). If nothing else, he respected Kaepernick\u2019s willingness to stand on principle and take an unpopular position. Goodell\u2019s father had done the same in breaking with a Republican president over Vietnam, and it had cost him his job; the previously friendly Nixon White House turned against him and helped to defeat him in his 1970 re-election campaign. Goodell keeps a copy of the Vietnam Disengagement Act, the bill his father sponsored to end the war, on the wall of his office. He fashions himself a similarly strait-laced man of principle \u2014 though principle is a tricky business for an N.F.L. commissioner with many constituencies (and principles) to consider.\n\nIf nothing else, Goodell and the players share a boss: the owners. With some exceptions, they are still, in the main, a geriatric boys\u2019 club: a mix of old money and new, sweethearts and criminals, men of enlarged ego and prostate. They are secure in the one position in the N.F.L. that is answerable to no one. They are subject to no re-election campaigns, recall elections or term limits. \u201cI own this football team,\u201d the 49ers\u2019 owner, Jed York, felt compelled to remind a group of reporters after firing his general manger and third coach in three years after the 2016-17 season. \u201cYou don\u2019t dismiss owners.\u201d The membership are coveters of high-profile properties who nevertheless generally avoid the spotlight. In most cases, they prefer to let their \u201cfootball people\u201d \u2014 their players and coaches \u2014 do the talking. They view themselves as higher-order sportsmen, concerned with the lofty business of legacies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It forced them to take a public position on a matter where any position would anger a lot of people, be they ticket-holders or players. York himself would emerge as part of a newer, younger and more progressive faction of the membership \u2014 outspoken in support of N.F.L. initiatives promoting social justice and community-action causes, and one of the few owners to address reporters during the contentious October meeting in New York, when the owners gathered to discuss the kneeling protests.\n\n\u201cUltimately, social justice is not a political issue,\u201d York said, holding court in the lobby of the Conrad Hotel in Lower Manhattan. Far from distancing himself from 49ers players that protested, York embraced them. He took pride that it was his team that employed the player who started it all. (Kaepernick opted out of the final year of his contract with the 49ers last March; the team\u2019s general manager, John Lynch, said he would have been released for reasons unrelated to the protests regardless.) \u201cI don\u2019t want to take a bow and say that we did something great and special,\u201d York said. \u201cIt happened to start with us. But it started with Colin. And I give Colin so much credit, so much respect for doing something that he knew was going to create backlash.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons\u2019 Arthur Blank, too, was generally considered an ally of the players. A few days after Pence\u2019s walkout in Indianapolis, I met Blank in the family office he keeps in Buckhead, the suburban Atlanta neighborhood. Blank is known for his sleekly tailored suits and the pride he takes in them. \u201cI say to the players, \u2018You put your uniform on every Sunday, the owner should, too,\u2019\u201d Blank said as he slurped up the last noisy drops of a massive Nutella milkshake he had brought in from a nearby Steak \u2018n Shake.\n\nBlank had issued one of the stronger statements in response to Trump, though like the other owners\u2019, it did not mention him specifically. \u201cCreating division or demonizing viewpoints that are different than our own accomplishes nothing positive,\u201d Blank had said. As for the players\u2019 protest, Blank told me when we met: \u201cA lot of what they\u2019re protesting in my view is very legitimate.\u201d When Trump weighed in as he did, he said, \u201cit became a manhood issue\u201d for many of the teams \u2014 \u201cor in some cases a brotherhood issue.\u201d He wondered whether Trump\u2019s attacks on the N.F.L. were motivated by \u201creal issues,\u201d or whether they were just \u201cdistracting from real issues or other issues having to do with the country.\u201d\n\nBlank\u2019s relative outspokenness also reflects the demographic makeup of his customers. The Falcons\u2019 season-ticket base is 40 percent African-American \u2014 a figure that could very well be higher than that of any professional sports team in America. Likewise, Kaepernick\u2019s 2016 protest, and York\u2019s vocal support for it, were bound to receive a more sympathetic hearing in liberal San Francisco than they would have in, say, Dallas, home of the Cowboys and dominion of Jerry Jones.\n\nA devilish Arkansas wildcatter who owns the league\u2019s most valuable team, Jones, 75, fashions himself the biggest, swingingest member of the membership. He likes to make his big opinions known about how the league should be run. For years, while generally supportive of Goodell, Jones had maintained that the league office had become bloated, its top executives overpaid. His feelings were hurt when Blank chose five owners not named Jerry Jones to serve on an expanded version of the compensation committee last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the time, Jones had otherwise been feeling rather pleased about his elevated place in the football universe. In August, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, an honor Jones had coveted. He celebrated with a blowout party at Glenmoor Country Club in Canton, under a huge white tent, fit for a circus. Cowboys cheerleaders, dressed in gold, flanked the entrance to welcome the arrivals. Justin Timberlake performed and declared from the stage that \u201cthe greatest owner in the history of sports is being honored tonight.\u201d Cocktail napkins were printed with inscrutable \u201cJerryisms,\u201d memorable lines uttered by Jones over the years. (\u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time going over and kind of circumcising the mosquito,\u201d he once proclaimed in an apparent critique of overthinking.)\n\nGoodell was among the guests, and he greeted Jones with a hug. He did not happen to mention a piece of looming business the commissioner knew would put a damper on Jones\u2019s bar mitzvah weekend. A few days later, the N.F.L. would announce it would be suspending Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys\u2019 star running back, for the first six games of the 2017 season following accusations of assault from a former girlfriend. (Elliott was never charged.)\n\nJones was not happy with this verdict, to say the least. When the commissioner called with the news, Jones promised, in so many words, to make Goodell\u2019s life a living hell. Coming from a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Al Davis, the infamously oppositional and litigious Oakland Raiders owner, this was not an empty threat.\n\nJones never raised strong objections to the particulars of Goodell\u2019s new contract until the Elliott decision came down, three members of the compensation committee told me. But after the decision, Jones swiftly set about trying to undermine Goodell\u2019s deal. He got in Blank\u2019s ear so frequently about the contract that Blank eventually gave Jones an adjunct role on the compensation committee \u2014 but it was a nonvoting position, with limited influence.\n\nSo Jones set about establishing himself as an opposition government to Goodell. He told at least two owners that he represented a silent majority inside the membership, giving voice to a building frustration among owners over the commissioner\u2019s leadership. Jones tried to rally support to not only scuttle Goodell\u2019s new contract but also, as some owners interpreted it, topple him altogether. He hired the powerhouse litigator David Boies, and in a conference call with members of the committee, Jones vowed to sue them all if they went forward with Goodell\u2019s new deal.\n\nJones also became more and more direct in his disapproval of how the N.F.L. was handling the protests. He tore into the Clinton alum Joe Lockhart, whom he believed had been too aggressive in his response to Trump\u2019s attacks on the league \u2014 and disrespectful to the president himself. \u201cEveryone should know, including the president, this is what real locker-room talk is,\u201d Lockhart said in a September conference call with reporters. It was a clear shot at Trump\u2019s attempt to explain away a leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video, in which he infamously described grabbing women by their genitals without their consent, as \u201clocker room talk\u201d during the 2016 campaign.\n\nA week and a half after Trump\u2019s Alabama speech stirred players to protest en masse, Jones announced that any Cowboys player who did not stand during the national anthem would not take the field. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,\u201d Jones said. This was widely deemed unhelpful by many at the league office and fellow owners struggling to quell the issue, and Goodell, too. \u201cI think Roger\u2019s feeling on it was that any ultimatum would only prompt a larger protest if you attempt to enforce it,\u201d the Giants\u2019 John Mara told me. Some owners, like Jones and Washington\u2019s Snyder, may have believed Goodell should have \u201cput the hammer down,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut I think most of us believed that would cause more problems than it would have solved.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Jones\u2019s threat to would-be kneelers also caught the attention of Trump, who promptly tweeted his praise for the Cowboys owner: \u201cA big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag. \u2018Stand for Anthem or sit for game!\u2019\u201d This was a week and a half after Trump advertised that he had spoken to Jones (\u201cJerry is a winner who knows how to get things done\u201d). If there\u2019s one thing Trump understands, it\u2019s how to manipulate needy billionaires. In addition to being probably the two most powerful, successful and visible owners in the league, Jones and Kraft share a basic insecurity, and also something of a rivalry. They compete for alpha-dog status within the membership, for Super Bowl rings (Kraft has five, Jones three) and Hall of Fame gold jackets (Jones 1, Kraft 0). Both men also prize the limelight and the company of celebrity friends. Both go way back with Trump, and it could not have been lost on Jones that Trump so conspicuously cozied up to Kraft during the presidential campaign \u2014 and even more so after Trump won the presidency and Kraft\u2019s Patriots won their fifth Super Bowl last February. Within a few days of the game, Kraft joined Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for a private dinner at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of Jones\u2019s fellow owners, meanwhile, had begun describing Jones as the N.F.L.\u2019s own version of Trump: a big-talking, attention-seeking billionaire showman who was easily dismissed as a carnival barker. When I asked Jones about this comparison last spring, he was clearly thrilled. Trump\u2019s ascent, he said, \u201cis one of the great stories in America. And let me tell you this,\u201d he went on: \u201cThe president ain\u2019t no joke. He\u2019s got as good a chance to be right as any of them.\u201d\n\nThe owners\u2019 final scheduled meeting of the season, in early December at a Four Seasons outside Dallas, looked for a while as if it would be a Texas showdown. As it turned out, all the major issues with Goodell\u2019s contract were resolved, and the contract was actually signed, before anyone got to Texas. Jones did deliver a stemwinder of a speech in an owners-only session, complaining that the ranchers should have more say in how the league was run. But his message appeared lost on most of the room. \u201cJerry, you just spoke for about 40 minutes, and I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Kraft said after Jones finished.\n\nIt was possible, even likely, that Jones could have built a formidable coalition of owners against Goodell before the season \u2014 several of them had grown frustrated with aspects of his leadership \u2014 and could have leaned on him harder to be more combative with players over their protests. But by December, most of the membership had grown weary of Jones\u2019s antics: his threat to sue if he did not get his way; his perceived grandstanding over the anthem protests; his self-appointment, during the contentious owners\u2019 meeting in October, as the league\u2019s \u201csenior owner.\u201d\n\nEveryone pretty much agreed that it was time to end this chapter and move on to the final weeks of the season. In a hallway interview, Blank played down differences with \u201cmy good friend Jerry.\u201d The Colts\u2019 owner, Jim Irsay, praised Jones as \u201ca Texas gentleman.\u201d In a brief news conference afterward, Goodell was asked if he took Jones\u2019s rebellion personally. \u201cDo I look like I take it personally?\u201d Goodell replied. No one quite knew how to answer that. \u201cJerry, do I look like I take it personally?\u201d Goodell said, pointing to Jones, who was standing behind him and didn\u2019t seem to know how to answer that either. Either way, $200 million can buy a lot of therapy.\n\nWhen I visited Goodell in his office a month later, his demeanor betrayed a mix of relief, fatigue and a perhaps surprising measure of self-satisfaction. After all, so much vulnerability in the league had been revealed this season. When I suggested as much, Goodell assumed a seen-it-all-before jadedness. \u201cRemember, I came into the league in 1982,\u201d Goodell told me. \u201cWe were facing litigation about the Raiders move,\u201d from Oakland to Los Angeles. \u201cWe were on strike for nine weeks. There was a competing league. We had a lot of issues going on.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, he said, 2017 had merely been a year of \u201ctransition.\u201d Discussing his dealings with the N.F.L. Players Coalition, he enthused about the \u201cunprecedented dialogue\u201d between players and owners. \u201cOne of the players said, \u2018We\u2019re sitting here not in a locker room, not on a field,\u2019\u201d Goodell told me. \u201c\u2018We were sitting in a board room and dealing with each other as partners.\u2019 That understanding and listening was remarkable, and really a powerful thing for us as a league.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about this \u2014 to dismiss the league\u2019s financial commitment to community and social-justice initiatives just as a way to placate the agitators. A group of players, led by San Francisco\u2019s Eric Reid \u2014 one of Kaepernick\u2019s original allies in the anthem protests \u2014 recently left the coalition, believing the commitment was just that. Kaepernick remains unemployed. Other reports have trickled out of lower-profile players who demonstrated feeling their job prospects were diminished. There is no question that future protesters in the N.F.L. protest at their career peril. What happens when, say, an Eric Reid, a mainstay at safety for the 49ers for the last five seasons, becomes a free agent this winter? \u201cHow do we make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else?\u201d Okung, who also left the coalition, asked me, referring to Kaepernick\u2019s situation. \u201cReparations need to be made in some manner.\u201d Still, many players and owners I spoke to seemed to give Goodell the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI think he handled things as well as you could expect in this situation,\u201d Mara told me.\n\nBut while Goodell and the N.F.L. may have survived 2017, the commissioner and his league seem to be at the mercy of very uncertain and uncontrollable events in the future. The conflicts of 1982 that Goodell evoked might have been more dramatic and certainly \u201cdistracting\u201d \u2014 that year\u2019s regular season was shrunk to nine games on account of a players\u2019 strike. But they were also more easily resolved. The dilemmas of 2017 were more profound: There was no obvious common ground between Jerry Jones\u2019s vision of the football field as a \u201crespite\u201d and Kaepernick\u2019s vision of it as a platform. The players weren\u2019t kneeling to gain leverage or extract donations, or anything else Goodell or anyone in the league could give them. They were trying to make themselves heard. \u201cI talked to a lot of players who were saying, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t need to be quieter, I need to be louder,\u2019\u201d the Bengals\u2019 Eric Winston, the union president, told me. \u201cThat to me was the key takeaway from this season.\u201d And what happens if an owner like Jones decides to take matters into his own hands and \u201cfire\u201d players if their protests continue?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur focus is on what we do,\u201d Goodell said, punting, when I asked him to speculate. \u201cAnd always trying to figure out the best way to get ahead of issues and focusing on what we can control.\u201d I pushed further: What happens if next season comes around and a handful of players are still kneeling and protesting? What if Trump tries to rekindle the issue, as you figure he\u2019d love to do, just in time for the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 or, for that matter, fires off a tweet calling on viewers to turn off the Super Bowl in the event that any players kneel, prompting the players to do exactly that?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with hypotheticals,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cYou can come up with five scenarios of what could happen.\u201d\n\nFootball is always generating new scenarios. That\u2019s part of what makes it so great and so fascinating. But not all scenarios stay between the sidelines \u2014 or stay hypothetical.", "title": "Where Does the N.F.L.

The case dragged on for a year, with both sides having to make more than half a dozen court appearances.

The office is in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House and is overseen by Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff.\n\nMs. Sanders said that the security office \u2014 which she repeatedly noted was staffed by \u201ccareer officials,\u201d who would not have been appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 had not yet made a final determination on whether Mr. Porter should receive his security clearance at the time of The Mail\u2019s article.\n\nStill, pressed on whether senior officials \u2014 including John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel; and Mr. Hagin \u2014 could have been unaware as far back as last summer that such a significant issue had been raised about one of the president\u2019s closest aides, she conceded she could not be certain.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cI can\u2019t say with 100 percent certainty.\u201d\n\nAccording to the two people briefed on the matter, the White House security office reviewed the allegations about Mr. Porter in July and saw that the F.B.I. had interviewed Mr. Porter\u2019s two former wives but not Mr. Porter himself. The office asked the F.B.I. to go back and do so, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nIn November, the F.B.I. provided another report to the security office, the two people said, adding that at that point, a final review began to determine whether to grant Mr. Porter a security clearance. As part of that review, three officials in the personnel office, including its head, were supposed to come to their own conclusions about whether to grant the clearance, the people said.\n\nBy the time The Mail published its article last week, only one of those officials had made a determination, the two people said, although it is not clear what the official had concluded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late November last year, a distraught girlfriend of Mr. Porter\u2019s contacted Mr. McGahn and told him Mr. Porter had been unfaithful to her by dating Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, and had anger problems, according to several people familiar with the discussion. Mr. McGahn, who knew Mr. Porter\u2019s girlfriend, at that point suggested to Mr. Porter he should consider leaving the White House, the people said.

Mr. Scaramucci posted on Twitter that Mr. Kelly \u201calmost certainly knew about credible allegations of domestic abuse against Rob Porter at least 6 months ago - then recently forced others to lie about that timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cInexcusable,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci added. \u201cKelly must resign.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanders said Mr. Trump maintained confidence in Mr. Kelly, who told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he had no regrets about how Mr. Porter\u2019s case was handled, adding that \u201cit was all done right.\u201d\n\nMr. Porter, who as staff secretary handled all of the documents that made their way to the president, had in the weeks before the allegations been seeking an expanded portfolio in the West Wing, where experienced aides who can bring order to a chaotic operation are in short supply.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides initially said they had no inkling of the accusations against Mr. Porter until the reports in The Mail, and said they acted swiftly to terminate him when they discovered them. In fact, the White House spent the first hours after learning of the accusations \u2014 including the publication of photographs of one of Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives with a black eye she said he had given her \u2014 defending Mr. Porter against the allegations and insisting that he was not being dismissed.\n\nEven after Mr. Kelly changed his stance, calling the allegations vile and orchestrating Mr. Porter\u2019s swift departure, the president has stuck up for Mr. Porter publicly, telling reporters that the situation had been \u201ctough\u201d and \u201csad\u201d for Mr. Porter. The president insisted that Mr. Porter had denied the accusations, and wished him a successful career. On Tuesday, asked by reporters at a White House event with sheriffs if he had a message for victims of abuse, Mr. Trump declined to answer.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties criticized how the White House had handled the episode.\n\n\u201cA lot of us are concerned about what has come to light in terms of these background checks \u2014 how long they take, how long somebody can be in an interim status and still have access to classified material,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said the scandal had exacerbated a generational divide that was already plaguing the party.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Trump, who dispatched Ms. Sanders yesterday to denounce domestic violence but has not addressed the matter himself, had missed an opportunity.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard the president say something directly about how bad domestic abuse is,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cYou know, to have a spokesperson get out and say something is not good enough.\u201d", "title": "White House Let Rob Porter Keep Job Even After Receiving Final F.B.I.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "The assumptions in Monday\u2019s release are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.\n\nMost notably, the administration projected annualized economic growth of 3.1 percent over the next three years. In December, the Federal Reserve projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate to be about 2.4 percent.\n\nThe centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget is a plan to devote $200 billion over the next decade in new spending to improve the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure, starting with $44.6 billion in 2019. The president says the plan will generate as much as $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion in new investments in building roads, bridges and other major projects over the next 10 years, in large part relying on states, cities and private companies to fund them. But the proposal faces steep challenges in Congress, where many lawmakers believe $200 billion is far too little to create a sustainable stream of federal infrastructure money for the future.\n\n\u201cWe will build, we will maintain, and the vast majority of Americans wants to see us take care of our infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House as he released an outline of the plan and discussed it with cabinet officials, governors and local leaders. \u201cWashington will no longer be a roadblock to progress; Washington will now be your partner.\u201d\n\nStill, the budget compensates for the new infusion of infrastructure spending in part by slashing existing transportation programs, which would be cut by $178 billion over a decade, according to a detailed budget breakdown the Trump administration sent Monday to Capitol Hill. Grants to Amtrak would be halved, from $1.2 trillion to $538 billion, while the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages vast amounts of public infrastructure projects, would see a more than 20 percent cut.\n\nLawmakers in both parties, who essentially went around Mr. Trump to strike their own budget compromise, made it clear they had no intention of embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, denounced \u201cdrastic cuts\u201d to the federal crop insurance program, calling them \u201cill advised.\u201d Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said lawmakers in both parties would once again reject the president\u2019s \u201cdeep cuts\u201d to the State Department and foreign aid.", "title": "White House Proposes $4.4 Trillion Budget That Adds $7 Trillion to Deficits", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "text": "There would be much to investigate. A few senior officials in the West Wing had access to details of the allegations of physical and emotional abuse made by Mr. Porter\u2019s ex-wives. A greater number of people had a sense that something was amiss, but chose to avert their gaze instead of asking questions.\n\nThe first hours after the issue was brought to light by an article in The Daily Mail were a confused blur, with officials like Mr. Kelly at first endorsing Mr. Porter\u2019s resignation, but then agreeing to issue statements in support of him. That disarray belied the belief of some in the White House that someone \u2014 Mr. Kelly \u2014 was finally in charge after six months of drama and infighting in 2017. In reality, these officials now concede, no one truly was.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t figured out how the place operates, and apparently they don\u2019t want to learn,\u201d said John Dean, a White House counsel under President Richard M. Nixon. The Porter situation, he added, \u201cis a manifestation of what happens when you have chaos.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly, a four-star Marine general, had been billed as uniquely qualified to bring order to Mr. Trump\u2019s world when he took his post in July. Now he faces a morale crisis in the West Wing, where aides describe a sense of betrayal by a chief of staff they no longer trust after his claims that he had not fully known about Mr. Porter\u2019s problems and had acted within minutes once he learned of them.\n\nBut above all, White House veterans say, President Trump is responsible for the haphazard nature with which his operation has functioned, in part because he knew and cared little for the rules and norms that govern the executive branch. Unprepared to fill the ranks of a new administration, Mr. Trump never tried to set a tone of discipline or ethical rigor in his West Wing.\n\n\u201cA White House reflects the president,\u201d said William M. Daley, a chief of staff under Mr. Obama. \u201cSo he moves on to the next scandal, crisis, attack, whatever, and no self-reflection. So why should anyone be surprised that that sort of becomes the M.O., even when there\u2019s a belief that there\u2019s institutional stuff one should consider.\u201d\n\nFor 13 months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have approached their mercurial and process-averse boss by putting their heads down and ignoring what they could not control, avoiding information that could rattle their daily balance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the case of Mr. Porter, White House aides privately acknowledge, some advisers appear to have chosen to try to protect a colleague who was generally well liked and, more important, too competent to lose. Mr. Trump himself often expressed his regard for Mr. Porter by describing him as \u201cout of central casting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the hours after the allegations against Mr. Porter became public, some senior officials in fact hesitated to force him out, in part because they argued that if one top adviser could be felled by accusations, they could all potentially be vulnerable. Mr. Porter denied privately to his colleagues, as well as publicly, that he had ever physically abused his wives.\n\nWhat distinguished this crisis from the ones that preceded it was that it was not localized to one official, such as Stephen K. Bannon, the isolated chief strategist who left in August, or Reince Priebus, the often uninformed chief of staff who departed a month before that. Mr. Porter\u2019s case had spread to so many aspects of the White House that it ensnared a number of staff members.\n\nWhile multiple officials in the West Wing were aware that he had been unable to pass his background check, none appear to have made an effort to ascertain precisely why and take action on it. Several former White House counsels have said they would have made it their business to know if an official at Mr. Porter\u2019s level was facing allegations as serious as domestic abuse, but officials in the White House have privately maintained that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, never did.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama.\n\nC. Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel under President George Bush, said the problems might have been exacerbated by the existence of the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump campaign ties to it.\n\nMr. McGahn and other senior officials may be reluctant to engage with the F.B.I. or the Justice Department on security clearances or any other matter, for fear of being drawn into the inquiry, he said. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want to call the F.B.I. or call the D.O.J. on any subject, Russia or not,\u201d Mr. Gray said of officials in the West Wing. \u201cThat may have contributed to the breakdown here.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has been in open war with the F.B.I. for months, a fact that some West Wing aides believe contributed to the debacle.\n\nThe dismissal on Wednesday of George David Banks, who was the White House point person on climate change, was seen as a particularly galling move after 13 months in which nobody in the West Wing had seemed particularly concerned about enforcing a standard for past conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Banks had been told that he would not be granted a full security clearance. In an interview, he said the reason was that he had smoked marijuana a handful of times between 2010 and 2013, conduct that he said he had self-reported to the F.B.I. nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Banks said of the decision to deny him a clearance, which he learned about abruptly at the end of a workday, when an official from Mr. McGahn\u2019s office and a human resources aide asked for a meeting later that evening. After informing him of their decision and allowing Mr. Banks to resign, they asked him to gather his things and escorted him from the premises.\n\nInside the West Wing, officials said, Mr. Banks is seen as collateral damage in a belated effort by Mr. Kelly and other top officials to show they are cracking down on interim security clearances.\n\nYet former White House advisers from both parties have been mystified at the ineptitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s team in dealing with the fallout from Mr. Porter\u2019s situation.\n\nPart of the problem, they argue, is a culture at the White House that does not appear to prioritize getting at the truth.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of Crisis Management 101 were certainly not observed here, but more importantly, there does not seem to be a priority on marshaling and disclosing the facts, whatever they may be,\u201d said Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair. \u201cThey need to stop the bleeding, and I think that they\u2019ve got to understand that the bleeding is not going to stop until the full truth is told.\u201d", "title": "White House Seeks to Move On From Abuse Scandal.

The officials familiar with the matter overheard them complaining about a series of meetings that the National Security Council had set up to consider options for North Korea \u2014 signs, Mr. Tillerson said, that it was becoming overly aggressive.\n\nFor now, the frustration at the White House appears to be limited to senior officials rather than Mr. Trump himself. But the president has shown impatience with his military leaders on other issues, notably the debate over whether to deploy additional American troops to Afghanistan.\n\nAs they examine the most effective way of giving credibility to Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of \u201cfire and fury,\u201d officials are considering the feasibility of a preventive strike that could include disabling a missile on the launchpad or destroying North Korea\u2019s entire nuclear infrastructure. American officials are also said to be considering covert means of disabling the nuclear and missile programs.\n\nWhile General McMaster also favors a diplomatic solution to the impasse, officials said, he emphasizes to colleagues that past efforts to negotiate with North Korea have forced the United States to make unacceptable concessions.\n\nThe Pentagon has a different view. Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., argue forcefully for using diplomacy. They have repeatedly warned, in meetings and on video conference calls, that there are few, if any, military options that would not provoke retaliation from North Korea, according to officials at the Defense Department.\n\nRepresentatives of Mr. Mattis and General Dunford denied that they have slow-walked options to the White House.\n\nThe Pentagon press secretary, Dana W. White, said that Mr. Mattis \u201cregularly provides the president with a deep arsenal of military options\u201d and that reports of a delay were \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeneral Dunford\u2019s press secretary, Col. Patrick S. Ryder, said: \u201cWhile the details of his conversations with the secretary of defense and the president are privileged communication, I can assure you that General Dunford regularly provides his best military advice in a timely and responsive manner to both senior leaders, to include military options for a wide range of national security challenges. Suggestions to the contrary are inaccurate.\u201d\n\nDuring a visit in October to the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, Mr. Mattis confronted the central contradiction in the Trump administration\u2019s bellicose language: Virtually any military option would put the sprawling city of Seoul, with its population of 10 million, in the cross hairs of North Korea\u2019s artillery guns.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt times, South Korea\u2019s defense minister, Song Young-moo, appeared to be giving Mr. Mattis a guided tour of how a strike against North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities would quickly trigger extensive retaliation.\n\nEven the most limited strike, the so-called bloody nose option, risks what one Defense Department official called an unacceptably high number of casualties.

He passed along articles critical of preventive military action by two colleagues: John J. Hamre, the president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Michael J. Green, a senior fellow at the center who worked in the George W. Bush administration, as did Mr. Cha.\n\nMr. Green warned against a preventive strike in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said there appeared to be little support for it, even among normally hawkish Republicans like Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.\n\nEven the White House has struggled to send a consistent message. In the week after Mr. Trump issued his threat to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea, Stephen K. Bannon, then his chief strategist, told a progressive journalist, \u201cThere\u2019s no military solution. Forget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don\u2019t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s bluntness angered other White House officials and hastened his exit from the White House. But there is evidence that General McMaster shares those concerns. Asked by a reporter in August whether there was any military option that would not put Seoul in North Korea\u2019s cross hairs, he paused briefly, then said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWith as many as 8,000 artillery pieces and rocket launchers positioned along its border with the South, North Korea could rain up to 300,000 rounds on the South in the first hour of a counterattack.\n\nWhile that arsenal is of limited range and could be destroyed in days, North Korea would still have time to cause widespread destruction. In a rare appearance last year on the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Mattis warned that war with North Korea would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d \u2014 \u201cprobably the worst kind of fighting in most people\u2019s lifetimes.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean the military has not begun preparing for that possibility. At multiple Army bases across the country this month, more than 1000 reserve officers are practicing how to set up so-called mobilization centers, which move reservists overseas in a hurry.\n\nBut as the military gears up, Mr. Tillerson continues to look for a diplomatic channel to North Korea. State Department officials say the United States has far from exhausted its nonmilitary options for pressuring Pyongyang. It could, for example, push to expel North Korea from the United Nations or interdict ships that it suspects are violating sanctions against the government.\n\nNeither Mr. Tillerson nor Mr. Mattis has broken with the White House on the issue of a preventive strike. That is because for now, they still view it as a useful tool in deterring North Korea, according to people briefed by the administration.

Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.", "title": "Opinion | Who First Showed Us That Black Lives Matter?", "authors": []}

Enshrined by parliamentary acts under Mrs. Thatcher and implemented by her two immediate successors, John Major, a Conservative, and Tony Blair of New Labour, the gospel of privatization was embraced by leaders around the world, notably including Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s closest overseas ally, President Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn the realm of transportation, that gospel was soon betrayed by its own chief disciples. Put simply, there were few private-sector buyers with the expertise and deep pockets necessary to maintain control of a transit system that serves approximately seven billion passengers per year. With minimal transparency, operational ownership of the network of train and bus lines that crisscross the 607-square-mile sprawl of Greater London, linking it to the far-flung corners of Britain, was peddled in bits and pieces by the British state or acquired in corporate takeovers.\n\nBut the new bosses were not private, business-savvy British firms.

Where do you currently reside?\n\nLebanon, N.H. (it\u2019s a small town near the Vermont state line)\n\n2. Where and when was your first puzzle published?\n\nMay 3, 2017, by American Values Club Crosswords.\n\n3. How did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?\n\nMy grandfather, who was an immigrant, used to solve crosswords to practice his English. He\u2019d tear a puzzle out of the paper and carry it around in his pocket with a little stub of pencil. He\u2019d ask me for help \u2014 to challenge me \u2014 when I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. Later, a family friend got me a subscription to Games Magazine in the 1980s. I can\u2019t remember ever not solving word puzzles, or not being fascinated by language.\n\n4. What made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?\n\nI\u2019m a librarian at Dartmouth College. A few years ago, when he was a student here, Andrew Kingsley (a New York Times published constructor) used to work on his grids in the reference room. We used to chat about puzzles, and eventually I thought, this is something I could do! When I made my first few (not so great) puzzles, Andrew was very patient and encouraging (cue clich\u00e9d line from a martial arts movie: \u201cThe student is now the teacher!\u201d), and I learned much from his feedback. It also turned out that I shared some close mutual friends with a puzzle editor, Ben Tausig of the American Values Club, and eventually I got up the courage to ask him to mentor me. Since then I\u2019ve also had some opportunities to collaborate, which is a great way to learn (and enormous fun). I\u2019ve been very, very lucky to meet people in the overlapping constructor and solver communities who have been supportive and kind.\n\n5. Why do you do this to yourself?\n\nBecause I want to. There\u2019s a poem by Marge Piercy called \u201cFor the young who want to\u201d \u2014 its last lines are: \u201cWork is its own cure. You have to like it better than being loved.\u201d I think about that poem often. Making puzzles is hard work that is its own cure for this desire I have to make something my own. Sure, I like it when I make something that solvers enjoy. And I\u2019ve felt honored to be associated with all the smart and funny people who are my fellow constructors. But I\u2019d probably make puzzles even if they never got published.\n\n6. Do you use a computer software constructing program, and if so, which one? What do you like about it?\n\nI have a Mac, so I\u2019ve been using CrossFire. I started out with a $5 iPad app called Crossword Maker for Cruciverbalists. It\u2019s rudimentary but I\u2019d recommend it for aspiring constructors before making a larger investment. I\u2019ve integrated Matt Ginsberg\u2019s clue database into CrossFire, which is helpful because in many cases it suggests clues that I don\u2019t want to use again. I love cluing; it\u2019s a chance to get a little looser.\n\n7. How many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?\n\nI\u2019m pretty new at this business, so I don\u2019t yet have my own carefully curated word list \u2014 a friend kindly gifted me his, so I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of giants in that department. In general, though, it\u2019s hard to quantify. I probably spend a lot of unconscious time processing ideas. I have a Google Doc of notes and themes that is mostly rejects and dead ends. It\u2019s convenient because I can add to it using my phone.\n\n8. What entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why? Or, with what entry would you deliberately fail the \u201cbreakfast test,\u201d and why?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that G-SPOT has appeared in The New York Times puzzle plenty of times, but PAP SMEAR hardly ever. I guarantee that there are many solvers who think about pap smears at breakfast and are not grossed out. Why should the human body offend anyone? And why should we further stigmatize illness or disability by pretending that they\u2019re not appropriate for language games? I\u2019m more offended by N.R.A., which appears constantly in grids, than by sexuality or women\u2019s health or so-called profanity. I think puzzles can also be a space to engage with social and political issues \u2014 recently I put SEXTS in a grid and clued it as an opportunity to open a conversation about consent, instead of as a throwaway joke.\n\n9. What is your favorite clue of all time and why?\n\n\u201cTurn-down for Watt?\u201d for the word NAE. This was from a Jonesin\u2019 puzzle by Matt Jones, brought to my attention by Erik Agard; getting it relies on one\u2019s knowledge of both contemporary electronic dance music and eighteenth-century Scottish inventors. I\u2019m also very pleased when constructors turn the clues into a kind of puzzle in their own right; there was one by Peter Gordon, probably my favorite New York Times puzzle of 2017, about Emily Dickinson. Every single clue was a double dactyl \u2014 just like her name. My favorite clue that I\u2019ve not yet had a chance to use in one of my own puzzles: \u201cI can believe it\u2019s not butter\u201d for OLEO.\n\n10. What are you doing these days?\n\nLast summer I was on the constructing team for Boswords, a crossword tournament in Boston. We\u2019re hoping to make it an annual event.\n\nThank you for spending time with us, Ms. Braunstein.\n\nYour thoughts?", "title": "Who Made My Puzzle?: Laura Braunstein", "authors": []}

Article 1, Section 2, says merely that \u201cthe House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states.\u201d No particular method is prescribed.\n\nAnd indeed, in the early days of the republic, states did not uniformly use what we now call \u201csingle-member district\u201d voting. Most did. But a few states used what was then called \u201cgeneral ticket\u201d voting. Under this system, there were no districts. In those states in the first congressional elections, the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists put up slates, and the side with the winning slate took all or most of the seats.\n\nAs it happens, Pennsylvania was the state where the most experimenting was done.

Each one of them, in its beauty, was even then and at once antique, but in the freshness of its vigor it is, even to the present day, recent and newly wrought.\u201d Thus Plutarch described the buildings on the Acropolis as a showcase of Periclean Athens. Although he was writing half a millennium after the Parthenon was built, he touched on the essence of its enduring appeal. Few complexes have cast a greater spell on later generations and even fewer boast such a strange afterlife, its component parts dismembered and divided between Athens and London, its heritage contested and the source of debates that seem to generate more heat than light.\n\nImage\n\nThe afterlife of ancient art and architecture is the subject of \u201cThe Real Life of the Parthenon\u201d by Patricia Vigderman, a professor of English at Kenyon College whose previous book was \u201cPossibility: Essays Against Despair.\u201d Part memoir, part travelogue and part musing on cultural patrimony, her new book is a voyage around the ancient world in which she examines the issues raised by the migration of art in the modern era. Her quest takes her from Athens and Pompeii to Manhattan and Malibu as she confronts the paradox of ownership and wrestles with conflicting evidence. Is the universality of art a pernicious concept, a form of \u201ccultural strip mining,\u201d or is it an acknowledgment of art as part of our common humanity? Should works of art be repatriated to their countries of origin and is that always the right decision? These are big questions, and our answers depend on whether we believe a work\u2019s original context is paramount.\n\nVigderman\u2019s approach is informed by Walter Benjamin\u2019s concept of an object\u2019s aura, a property embedded in time and history. Deprived of its original location, the object\u2019s aura is diminished; yet do major works like the Parthenon marbles belong only to one place, since so many of them have resided in the British Museum for two centuries? Have they not now acquired a different aura, given their impact on generations of artists, from Canova and Rodin to Henry Moore? Mary Beard, whose astute history of the Parthenon lies behind Vigderman\u2019s study, has described the marbles as \u201cvalued because of their deracination,\u201d which charges them with a \u201ccultural electricity.\u201d", "title": "Who Owns the Elgin Marbles?", "authors": []}

Kentucky, for instance, has outlined a number of exemptions to its new requirements that able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries must work and pay small premiums. Former foster care youths and pregnant women don\u2019t have to pay insurance premiums. The evicted and the homeless won\u2019t be locked out from coverage if they miss their payments. People who are \u201cmedically frail\u201d with serious ailments can postpone their work requirements with a doctor\u2019s note.\n\nSuch exemptions sketch new definitions of who is truly able. And they erect more elaborate barriers to assistance as another way of winnowing out the unworthy. Eighteenth-century English overseers tried establishing rules (\u201cnobody who tipples in the alehouse will get poor relief\u201d). Requirements today that the poor take drug tests or pay $1 monthly premiums effectively do the same: \u201cIf you can\u2019t figure out who is or isn\u2019t deserving,\u201d Ms. Ottaway wrote in an email, \u201cthen you can make rules about behavior that will force the poor to reveal themselves as worthy or not.\u201d\n\nBy narrowing aid, proposals like Kentucky\u2019s \u2014 and Indiana\u2019s Medicaid work requirement, approved Friday \u2014 reverse the more recent history in which Medicaid has steadily expanded access. The program began in 1965 with Elizabethan notions intact. It initially served the elderly poor, the blind and the disabled, as well as pregnant women. Over time it came to cover more parents and children. Eligibility was extended to poor women with breast or cervical cancer. In the 1990s, some states began offering coverage on a broader basis \u2014 simply according to income.\n\nIn 2010, the Affordable Care Act sought to make that policy experiment universal. It required all states to expand coverage to everyone earning below or just above the poverty line. (The Supreme Court later made the change optional, so now 32 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to expand.) Millions of nondisabled adults have joined the program in recent years, driving down the rate of Americans without health insurance and increasing Medicaid\u2019s ranks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear sequence from 1965 to 2010, where \u2018able-bodiedness,\u2019 \u2018worthy poor\u2019 is being written out of the statute,\u201d said Leonardo Cuello, the health policy director at the National Health Law Program, a legal advocacy group that is bringing a lawsuit against the Kentucky Medicaid proposal. \u201cAnd that comes to its full completion in 2010, where able-bodiedness is explicitly irrelevant.\u201d\n\nFor Medicaid advocates like Mr. Cuello, the recent focus on the able-bodied feels like an anachronism.\n\nTo others who use the term, it captures how Americans of both parties feel about poverty today.

Without speculating about the Percoco case in particular, he said that total fees in a complex defense white-collar criminal prosecution \u201ccould easily exceed a million dollars.\u201d\n\nThe question of who is picking up Mr. Percoco\u2019s legal tab is of particular interest because of his close relationship with Mr. Cuomo, whose name has surfaced repeatedly in the trial. In the past, Mr. Cuomo has likened Mr. Percoco to a brother. They served together for decades, dating to when Mr. Cuomo headed the federal housing department. Mr. Percoco managed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns in his 2010 and 2014 governor\u2019s races and was his executive deputy secretary in Albany.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The trial resumes on Tuesday.\n\nSchulte, Roth & Zabel\u2019s representation of Mr. Percoco dates to the federal investigation into the Cuomo administration\u2019s dissolving of the Moreland Commission. In 2016, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign committee paid $80,000 to Schulte, Roth & Zabel for what they said at the time was Mr. Percoco\u2019s legal bills. The campaign has not paid the firm since then, records show.\n\nMr. Percoco left Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office in January 2016 to join Madison Square Garden as a vice president.

The point is unmistakable: What they are doing matters to the chief executive. It may even be the future of the company.\n\n\u201cThe world is moving faster and faster. It is being driven by technology and innovation,\u201d said John Kotter, an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School who has written several books on business leadership. \u201cAnd a lot of these businesses are concluding that the speed of technological innovation should be the heart of everything.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA year ago, the Google Brain team of mathematicians, coders and hardware engineers sat in a small office building on the other side of the company\u2019s campus. But over the past few months, it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where Mr. Pichai and other top executives work.\n\nJeffrey Dean, the celebrated Google engineer who oversees the Brain lab, is a short walk from Mr. Pichai. So are Ian Goodfellow, the researcher behind a new A.I. technique that generates lifelike images on its own, and Norm Jouppi, who explores ways of accelerating A.I. research through a new breed of computer chip.\n\n\u201cAny C.E.O. thinks a lot about where people are sitting \u2014 who they can walk around and have casual conversations with,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing team and sits on the board of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cIt is a very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him.\u201d\n\nGoogle is placing big bets on the A.I. being explored by researchers like Mr. Goodfellow. Many questions still hang over the progress of this research. But Mr. Pichai and the rest of the Google leadership hope it will accelerate the evolution of everything from smartphones and home appliances to internet services and robotics.\n\nTo Mr. Byrne, shaking up the seating chart at Overstock was a bit like a common management tactic in the military, when an officer will work closely with a small \u201ccommand initiatives group\u201d that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe were getting bureaucratic,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cAnd this was a way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nThese big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of a Silicon Valley start-up, where the boss is next to everyone. As start-ups grow, they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive. Ms. Greene, who was the chief executive of the software company VMware, said she had always made a point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company\u2019s future.\n\nThere are limits to these arrangements. When Facebook built a team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network, it made a similar desk move. The group is no longer seated next to Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook said this was because the group had grown too large. But across Silicon Valley, virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics. That honor belongs to artificial intelligence.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhere you sit has mattered for years at Facebook. The company\u2019s ad group traditionally sat far away from Mr. Zuckerberg. But after Facebook went public and started a big push for revenue, important members of the ad team moved next to the boss, said Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, who wrote a book about his experiences inside Facebook.\n\nAt Overstock, Mr. Byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office. Like Ms. Greene, he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction. The team members can discuss their work with him, and Mr. Byrne, a doctor of philosophy with a long history of unorthodox business choices, will share his far-reaching ideas with them. And he gets to hear, without the pressure of a formal presentation, what the engineers are excited about.\n\n\u201cIt was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation,\u201d said Judd Bagley, a kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group. \u201cPatrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company, say \u2018hello,\u2019 and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Now, in an echo of the A.I. labs at Google and Facebook, the operation is focused on machine learning, which involves systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data.\n\nIf a chief executive is close to these researchers, he or she is learning from them. But the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company. That is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue, said Kevin Quennesson, a start-up executive who ran an A.I. team at Twitter.\n\nHe also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was, by definition, a trip into the unknown. Amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive, Mr. Bagley said, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between \u201cthe formal direction and informal brainstorming.\u201d\n\nStatus at Facebook was defined by how close your desk was to Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said. And if you were close to the boss, other groups resented you.\n\nPriorities also tend to ebb and flow. At Overstock, a new Bitcoin project will squeeze in beside OLabs. And at Facebook, the A.I. lab is no longer side by side with Mr. Zuckerberg because it also grew too large.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, this work is particularly important to the company as it works to ensure \u201cthe safety and integrity of our community\u201d \u2014 which has become Facebook code for guarding against false, misleading or dangerous activity on its social network, Mr. Schroepfer said.

Fear and suspicion of liberal democracy runs deep in Russia and in other countries slouching toward authoritarianism. They have a vested interest in making Western democracies appear as flawed, ugly and messy as possible.

That was greeted with widespread relief, yet it did not really settle the matter, setting the stage for Wednesday\u2019s action by the European Union.\n\nWhat Exactly Did the E.U. Do on Wednesday?\n\nIts executive, the European Commission, published a draft withdrawal agreement that includes a fallback plan for retaining the soft Irish border.\n\nEuropean officials say they are putting into legal language a document, agreed to by Britain in December, that laid out three options. Britain\u2019s preferred one is for an overall Brexit trade agreement that would solve the problem, but talks on that have not even formally begun. The second was for Britain to propose \u201cspecific solutions\u201d such as the use of technology to avoid a hard border. No detailed plans have been put forward, and many are so skeptical of this idea that critics call it the \u201cNarnia solution.\u201d\n\nHence the fallback option, now written into the draft protocol, of \u201cmaintaining full alignment with those rules of the Union\u2019s internal market and the customs union\u201d that support cooperation with Ireland as laid out under the 1998 Belfast, or Good Friday, agreement.\n\nWhat Is Theresa May so Upset About?\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, Mrs. May described the proposals as a threat to her country\u2019s \u201cconstitutional integrity,\u201d while one of her former ministers, David Jones, told the BBC that the European Union was using the Brexit talks to try to \u201cannex\u201d Northern Ireland.\n\nThey worry that if Northern Ireland stays largely within the European Union\u2019s customs union and single market while mainland Britain quits them, a new economic frontier will be created down the middle of the Irish Sea.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat would be a problem for any London government, because a majority of people in Northern Ireland want to stay in the United Kingdom, but it is particularly poisonous for Mrs. May.

But to do so would invite the wrath of her party\u2019s hard-line Brexit lawmakers, who might then challenge her leadership.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nWednesday\u2019s text is only a draft, but European Union leaders want agreement on it before starting full-scale talks on a trade deal with Britain.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When they are criticized for favoring re-election over the public good, it is often a criticism of putting local concerns over national ones.\n\nFaced with a policy that helps the national economy but costs local jobs, many members will feel obligated to defend their constituents, and oppose the policy. Congressmen routinely oppose trade deals on these grounds, and some blue-state Republicans, in the debate on the recent tax bill, faced opposition at home to altering deductions for state and local taxes.\n\nIn practice, this local incentive tends to distort public policy toward parochialism and away from the national good. But this is neither irrational nor inherently bad. Even if you believe national interests should take priority, it doesn\u2019t follow that local interests should be ignored.\n\nComplicating this, most citizens do not have consistent opinions about when each role should take precedence. So asking members to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d often means asking them to risk their job for an important policy, but just this once. Even worse, determining \u201cthe right thing\u201d is largely subjective; in most cases, it just means \u201ca position I feel strongly about.\u201d\n\nThe third goal of members \u2014 increasing their power within Congress \u2014 is intrinsically linked to partisanship. Power in both the House and Senate is structured along party lines, with party caucuses holding gatekeeping authority over committee seats, chairmanships and chamber leadership positions. Members can parlay skills like fund-raising prowess or issue expertise into increased power, but in most cases they need to please party leaders to improve their standing.\n\nWhen all three of their incentives align, members have little to consider. If a position is strongly supported by constituents, pleases party leaders, and is judged by the member to be good public policy, then taking that position is a no-brainer.\n\nThe most difficult choices members make concern supporting the party position on issues that cut against the preferences of their constituents or district interests. This may take the form of voting with the party on high-profile legislation. For example, the Democrats in 2010 passed the Affordable Care Act even though it was obvious the votes were going to cost them seats in Congress.\n\nSometimes members judge that siding with the party and against their constituents actually best serves their district.

At the time, Ehrman notes, \u201cChristianity probably made up 7 to 10 percent of the population of the Roman Empire.\u201d A mere hundred years later, half the empire\u2019s \u201c60 million inhabitants claimed allegiance to the Christian tradition.\u201d Ehrman declares, without hyperbole, \u201cThat is absolutely extraordinary.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOver the centuries, countless books have been written to explain this, a great many of them by Christian writers and scholars who take the Constantinian view: Their faith\u2019s unlikely triumph was (and is) proof of divine favor. Interestingly, pagan advisers argued in vain to the first Christian Roman emperors that pagan beliefs had been what won the empire favor in the first place. When the emperor Valentinian II removed the altar of the goddess Victory from the Roman Senate house in A.D. 382, for instance, a pagan statesman named Symmachus reminded him, \u201cThis worship subdued the world.\u201d\n\nVery little about the historical triumph of Christianity makes sense. When Constantine converted, the New Testament didn\u2019t formally exist and Christians disagreed on basic theological concepts, among them how Jesus and God were related. For those living at the time, Ehrman writes, \u201cit would have been virtually impossible to imagine that these Christians would eventually destroy the other religions of Rome.\u201d Some saw glimmers of danger, however. An otherwise unknown pagan philosopher named Celsus wrote a tract called \u201cOn the True Doctrine\u201d that attacked Christians\u2019 penchant for secrecy, refusal to partake in public worship and naked appeals to \u201cslaves, women and little children.\u201d\n\nThe great appeal of Ehrman\u2019s approach to Christian history has always been his steadfast humanizing impulse. In his superb book \u201cThe Orthodox Corruption of Scripture,\u201d which concerns textual variants in early Christian texts that were driven by theological agendas, Ehrman argues that these corruptions weren\u2019t typically the product of willful obfuscation but rather the work of careful scribes trying to make sense of often perplexing language, imagery and traditions. Ehrman always thinks hard about history\u2019s winners and losers without valorizing the losers or demonizing the winners. The losers here, of course, were pagan people.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

So how did Christianity triumph? To put it plainly, Christianity was something new on this earth. It wasn\u2019t closed to women. It was so concerned with questions of social welfare (healing the sick, caring for the poor) that it embedded them into its doctrines. And while there were plenty of henotheist pagans (that is, people who worshiped one god while not denying the validity of others), Christianity went far beyond henotheism\u2019s hesitant claim upon ultimate truth. It was an exclusivist faith that foreclosed \u2014 was designed to foreclose \u2014 devotion to all other deities. Yet it was different from Judaism, which was just as exclusivist but crucially lacked a missionary impulse.\n\nEhrman, summarizing the argument of the social historian Ramsay MacMullen, imagines a crowd of 100 pagans watching a persuasive Christian debate an equally persuasive adherent of the healing god Asclepius: \u201cWhat happens to the overall relationship of (inclusive) paganism and (exclusive) Christianity? \u2026 Paganism has lost 50 worshipers and gained no one, whereas Christianity has gained 50 worshipers and lost no one.\u201d Thus, Christian believers go from roughly 1,000 in A.D. 60, to 40,000 in A.D. 150, to 2.5 million in A.D. 300. Ehrman allows that these raw numbers may look \u201cincredible. But in fact they are simply the result of an exponential curve.\u201d At a certain point, math took over. (Mormonism, which has been around less than 200 years, has seen comparable rates of growth.)\n\nEhrman quotes a valuable and moving letter from a devout pagan named Maximus, which was written to Augustine near the end of the fourth century: \u201cGod is the name common to all religions. \u2026 While we honor his parts (so to speak) separately \u2026 we are clearly worshiping him in his entirety.\u201d But when pagan intellectuals decided to confront Christianity on its exclusivist terms \u2014 \u201cWe believe in one God as well!\u201d \u2014 they effectively stranded themselves on their own 20-yard line. The heart-rending pagan inability to anticipate the complete erasure of their beliefs gave Christianity one clear path to victory.\n\nAnd yet, when the caliga was on the other foot, Christians had different opinions about religious oppression and compulsion. Many of Christianity\u2019s earliest apologists wrote of their longing to be left alone by the Roman state. Here is Tertullian: \u201cIt is a fundamental human right, a privilege of nature, that everyone should worship according to his own convictions.\u201d These Christians \u201cdevised,\u201d Ehrman writes, somewhat cheekily, \u201cthe notion of the separation of church and state.\u201d But when Christians seized control of the empire, the separation they had long argued for vanished. The charges once lobbed against Christians \u2014 atheism, superstition \u2014 were turned against pagan people.\n\nEhrman is careful to note that, for the most part, there was no Christian secret police forcing pagans to convert: The empire was too large and diffusely governed to make such an effort feasible. In addition, \u201cthere was no one moment when the world stopped being pagan to become Christian.\u201d Rather, it happened in the manner of Hemingway\u2019s theory of bankruptcy: gradually, then suddenly. Reading about how an entire culture\u2019s precepts and traditions can be overthrown without anyone being able to stop it may not be heartening at this particular historical moment.

The State Department recently argued that it didn\u2019t impose sanctions against companies doing weapons deals with Russia because the threat of sanctions was enough to deter some of those deals.

Republicans, including Mr. Rubio, just voted for a tax bill that violates both of those rules, adding to the deficit and eventually raising taxes on some families. Then they passed a big spending package, too.\n\nSo Republicans just offered ample evidence that they don\u2019t actually care about paying for the things they want. If we agree that people deserve income when they need to take family leave, and that adding to the deficit doesn\u2019t matter when the goals are worthy, then we can focus on putting together the right solution.\n\nMr. Rubio and Ms. Trump should drop their worries about cost and expand their vision. They could pledge to offer Americans 12 paid weeks off not just for the arrival of a new child, but also if they fall sick or need to care for a family member. They could nix the idea that parents have to pay for their own benefits out of Social Security.\n\nIf doing so raises concerns about Social Security\u2019s solvency \u2014 which are often overblown \u2014 then they could levy a small tax on employers and employees, similar to what we already pay to fund Social Security, to build up a new fund for family leave. That would not just spread the burden to rich and poor alike, but it would also reinforce the idea that we all have a stake in helping parents raise the next generation.\n\nMr. Rubio and Ms. Trump wouldn\u2019t even have to start from scratch. Democratic lawmakers have already repeatedly introduced a bill that would do all of these very things: the Family Act.\n\nWhether they think so or not, Mr. Rubio and Ms. Trump are lighting the way toward an effective system of paid family leave a quarter-century after we enacted unpaid leave during the first Clinton administration.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "More recently, economists have emphasized how trade affects productivity. In a model pioneered by my Harvard colleague Marc Melitz, when a nation opens up to international trade, the most productive firms expand their markets, while the least productive are forced out by increased competition. As resources move from the least to the most productive firms, overall productivity rises.\n\nA skeptic might say that all this is just theory. Where\u2019s the evidence?\n\nOne approach to answering this question is to examine whether countries that are open to trade enjoy greater prosperity. In a 1995 paper, the economists Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew Warner studied a large sample of nations and found that open economies grew significantly faster than closed ones.\n\nA second approach is to look at what happens when closed economies remove their trade restrictions. Again, free trade fares well. Throughout history, when nations have opened themselves up to the world economy, the typical result has been an increase in their growth rates. This occurred in Japan in the 1850s, South Korea in the 1960s and Vietnam in the 1990s.\n\nThese results, while suggestive, come with a caveat. Trade restrictions often accompany other government policies that interfere with markets. Perhaps these other policies, rather than trade restrictions, impede growth.\n\nTo address this problem, a third approach to measuring the effects of trade, proposed by the economists Jeffrey A. Frankel of Harvard and David C. Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, focuses on geography. Some countries trade less because of geographic disadvantages.\n\nFor example, New Zealand is disadvantaged compared with Belgium because it is farther from other populous countries. Similarly, landlocked nations are disadvantaged compared with nations with their own seaports. Because these geographic characteristics are correlated with trade, but arguably uncorrelated with other determinants of prosperity, they can be used to separate the impact of trade on national income from other confounding factors.\n\nAfter analyzing the data, Mr. Frankel and Mr. Romer concluded that \u201ca rise of one percentage point in the ratio of trade to G.D.P. increases income per person by at least one-half percent.\u201d In other words, nations should take the theories of Smith, Ricardo and Melitz seriously.", "title": "Why Economists Are Worried About International Trade", "authors": []}

The Crown Prosecution Service has said that it does not plan to bring a new case against him, but critics hold out hope that the service will reverse its position.\n\nMr. Worboys\u2019s accusers believe he remains dangerous, Ms. Wistrich said. \u201cSome of them are terrified for themselves, their daughters, their neighbors,\u201d she said.\n\nVictims say that Mr. Worboys, a former stripper and pornographic actor, could be charming and persuasive, and they expressed a fear that he had manipulated the parole board.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a London cabby from 2002 to 2008, he would show a passenger a satchel full of cash, which he said he had just won at a casino or in a lottery, and urge her to share a celebratory drink that he had spiked with a sedative. After assaulting the drugged woman in the back of his cab, he would drive her home, often taking her inside and leaving her on her bed.\n\nThough their memories were cloudy, several women reported the assaults, but the police repeatedly declined to take the complaints seriously, brushing off the women\u2019s claims of being drugged and failing to connect the attacks despite obvious similarities. Several officers were later disciplined for their roles in the case, which prompted the Metropolitan Police to create a unit focusing on serial sex offenders.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by the victims, a High Court judge ruled in 2014 that the police had made basic investigative mistakes and ignored their own policies for handling sexual assault cases, allowing Mr. Worboys to continue preying on women.\n\nAfter Mr. Worboys was caught in 2008, investigators said that he had attacked well over 100 women, a figure also cited in the 2014 High Court ruling. But the charges against him excluded most of those assaults. Prosecutors said a broader case risked overwhelming the jury and would have diluted the strongest charges with weaker ones.\n\nThe chief prosecutor at the time, Keir Starmer, is now a prominent Labour lawmaker. Though the prosecution service has said that Mr. Starmer was not directly involved in the case, some critics of the parole decision have demanded that he explain why more charges were not filed.\n\nAfter Mr. Worboys was convicted in 2009 of 19 charges involving assaults on 12 women, a judge gave him an open-ended sentence with eligibility for parole after eight years. Women\u2019s groups and his victims said the mandatory part of the sentence should have been longer, but prosecutors assured them that he stood no real chance of being set free.\n\nThen came the news in early January that a parole panel had decided to release Mr. Worboys, a year after another panel had decided that he was too dangerous to parole. The board has more than 200 members, and three \u2014 whose names are not released \u2014 are usually assigned to each case.\n\nVictims are supposed to be alerted in advance of a parole hearing, so they can make statements to the panel \u2014 the job of notifying them falls to another government office, not the parole board \u2014 but many of the women assaulted by Mr. Worboys were not told.

And, as the former director, James Comey, would frequently say in underscoring the importance of high standards, whether a jury believes an agent\u2019s testimony depends on whether it has faith in the bureau\u2019s honesty and independence. To be effective, the F.B.I. must be believed and must maintain the support of the public it serves.\n\nDo F.B.I. agents make mistakes? You bet. They are human beings. Because they are not infallible, the bureau is subject to a robust system of checks and balances, including its internal affairs division, the Department of Justice inspector general, congressional committees and the courts.

In an email, he wrote that what Piketty found can be explained in large part by racial hostility, the adverse effects of globalization on white manufacturing workers, and the decline in social mobility:\n\nIt\u2019s not a new thing. This is what George Wallace and Ronald Reagan were about also. Its current reincarnation is almost surely due to the fact that both globalization and technological changes have left behind vast swathes of the country. But why have these people found a home in the Republican Party, not in the Democratic Party? That\u2019s less clear, but if I were to make a guess, I would say that this is related to the fact that economic hardship does not work by itself. It needs to tap into other grievances, and in the US context these have been related to pent-up hostility towards blacks and immigrants (and perhaps their own albeit slow upward mobility). If so, it is natural that it is the Republican Party, with its southern strategy and more welcoming attitude towards soft racism, that has come to house this discontent.\n\nJacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who writes extensively about inequality, praised Piketty\u2019s work but noted that he and others\n\nhave argued that the Democrats were cross-pressured by rising inequality because they wanted to maximize campaign cash as well as votes and because they got most of their institutional support from a coalition of single-issue groups. This cross-pressure, in turn, contributed to their weak attempt to maintain the allegiance of the white working class.\n\nLike Acemoglu, Hacker argues that the Piketty analysis does not place enough emphasis on race:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very fundamental to Piketty\u2019s story. Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny that the realignment of the parties around race created the opening for the GOP to gain the support of white voters \u2014 especially downscale white voters \u2014 by exploiting resentment of racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nDean Baker, a co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, was the sharpest critic of Piketty among those I contacted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure this analysis is all that useful,\u201d Baker wrote me.\n\nI see Piketty is missing the way in which markets have been restructured to redistribute income upward and to take away options for reversing inequality and promoting growth in ways that benefit low and middle income workers.\n\nPiketty, in Baker\u2019s view, \u201csees the market outcomes as largely given and redistribution just means tax and transfer policy.\u201d\n\nBaker argues that correcting inequality requires adoption of a much broader policy agenda. Citing the argument in his book \u201cRigged,\u201d Baker calls for radical reform of exchange rates, of monetary policy, of intellectual property rights and of the financial sector as well as reform of the institutional protection of doctors, dentists, and lawyers and of corporate governance rules that now allow \u201cC.E.O.s to rip off shareholders.\u201d\n\nBaker is not optimistic about full-throated economic liberalism in the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cBecause the party has largely supported an agenda that redistributes upward, they have lost much of their working class base,\u201d he wrote in his email to me:\n\nThe friends you keep matter. The speeches that folks like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama give at Wall Street firms are not a good look. The banks don\u2019t hand you huge honorariums if they think you are going to take their money and put them in prison.\n\nThere is \u201can ongoing battle,\u201d Baker continued,\n\nin the Democratic Party as well as in most of the left parties across Europe. There are those who would like to accept inequality and focus exclusively on issues like gender equality and anti-racism. I would never minimize the importance of combating gender inequality or racism/nativism, but if that means ignoring the policies that have led to the enormous inequality we now see, that is not a serious progressive agenda.\n\nIf Democrats must adopt a broader agenda to counter inequality, Piketty\u2019s study is indispensable.

That kind of instability fed, in part, the first effort to overturn the will, in which several of his children and grandchildren said his drug problems had prevented him from making sound decisions about his estate.\n\nThe will had set aside $2 million to underwrite scholarships for the grandchildren, and it gave his costumes and other household effects to the six children he recognized, a bequest thought to be worth perhaps another $2 million. But the bulk of the estate was to be given over to the I Feel Good Trust, which he set up to distribute scholarships for children from South Carolina, where he was born, and Georgia, where he lived for much of his life.\n\nAfter the will was challenged, the South Carolina attorney general, Henry McMaster, who is now the governor, proposed a settlement: Mr. Brown\u2019s children and grandchildren would receive a quarter of the estate and Ms. Hynie would receive another quarter.

Ms. Hynie, a singer who worked in Mr. Brown\u2019s band, was apparently married to another man in 2001 when she wed Mr. Brown, a circumstance that led to the legal challenge of her status.

What\u2019s the difference? One is about what seems likely to happen, while the other is about an increase in the chances of an unlikely \u2014 but costly \u2014 outcome.\n\nBack to the drought metaphor: The farmers might still think that another dry year is the most likely result, but if recent showers make them worry more about the risk of flooding, and they all try to buy insurance at the same time, this drives up the price. That seems to be what has happened in the last two months in the market for inflation-protected bonds, which essentially function as insurance against future rises in prices.\n\nThis framework also helps explain why there have been such big swings in financial markets lately.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Asset Management noted recently that government bonds from the United States and Germany \u2014 generally considered some of the world\u2019s bedrock safe assets \u2014 have been more volatile lately than bonds issued by emerging market countries like Indonesia and Mexico.\n\nAnd the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has moved more than 1 percent on eight of 16 trading days in February thus far, which doesn\u2019t make much sense if you\u2019re looking for fundamentals-based reasons for such big moves in stock prices. It makes more sense if you believe that investors are trying to extrapolate from tiny fragments of information the potential risk of a radically different economic and financial market environment in the years ahead.\n\nThe swings in stock prices appear to be intimately linked to movement in long-term interest rates, which in turn hinges on those expectations of inflation and how the Federal Reserve will respond if inflation does rise.\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, the stock market had been on track for a sharply positive day until the Fed released minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Soon after, the stock market plunged and bond yields rose, as investors evidently concluded that the Fed was inclined toward a somewhat faster rate of interest rate increases than had been assumed.", "title": "Why Markets Have Gotten So Jumpy", "authors": []}

But Shiffrin has skied on and carefully analyzed each of those 70 pairs. She needs to know exactly how the skis will perform in each circumstance, and most important, if she can rely on them at daredevil speeds.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter trying each pair, she gives Erlandsson a detailed report \u2014 assessing their strengths in certain conditions, like icy surfaces, moderate or subzero temperatures, bumpy slopes or when she has blasted down the mountain at 80 miles an hour.\n\nErlandsson catalogs those findings in a little black book that is Shiffrin\u2019s equipment bible.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of pages,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nAll elite racers travel with dozens of skis on the World Cup tour, usually 25 to 40 pairs. Each has a different length, or wax preparation, or engineering, or material composition or the placement of the binding, which is how a skier\u2019s boots are affixed to the ski. Since most races are decided by tenths, if not hundredths, of a second, the choice of skis \u2014 an intricate calculation that depends on terrain, temperature and weather \u2014 can be the difference between a winning run and a forgettable one.\n\nThe biggest part of Erlandsson\u2019s job is to prepare Shiffrin\u2019s skis so they are in prime condition and flexible in changing race conditions.\n\nPhoto\n\nErlandsson can grind a variety of deep-textured structures into the ski bottom. He then applies layers of sophisticated fluorocarbon waxes and powders, choosing from more than 50 types he keeps in two metal trunks. Using a hot iron, he can mix the waxes to create hundreds of options. The waxes, integral to making the skis glide across the snow, seep into the ski bases. Then a top layer is scraped off by hand before another wax layer is ironed on. The waxing process can take four hours, or four days, for a single pair of skis. The ski bases are also ceaselessly brushed to keep them smooth and polished.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nErlandsson, who is half-Swedish and half-Austrian and has been working on skis professionally for six years, also must keep the steel ski edges razor sharp, a task he does by hand with diamond-studded files. To keep the Shiffrin ski fleet even more adaptable, the skis might be filed to disparate degrees of sharpness.\n\nThe work can feel endless, and ski technicians famously keep late hours.\n\nLindsey Vonn, Shiffrin\u2019s American teammate, who has won more World Cup races than any woman, had a technician about 10 years ago who went by the nickname Chief.\n\n\u201cIn the winter,\u201d Vonn said at the time, \u201cChief pretty much lives off Coke, Kit Kats and chewing tobacco.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Monday, Erlandsson estimated that during the six-month ski season he works 12 to 14 hours a day, every day. That includes driving cargo through the mountains of Central Europe where so many of the races take place.\n\nTechnicians spend most of their working hours in a series of windowless, prefabricated trailers or in portable boxlike edifices that look like storage containers. Aligned side-by-side at the bottom of a mountain, the area resembles a Gypsy encampment, albeit one guarded by a high fence because of the irreplaceable equipment stored within. Inside the work spaces, it is wall-to-wall skis, and the floor is scattered with spent wax, drills, scrapers and dozens of travel ski bags.\n\nFor the Pyeongchang Olympics, Shiffrin scaled back her supply to 35 pairs of skis. By this point, at the end of the season, she has whittled it down through trial and error to her favorite pairs.\n\nStill, throughout these Games, Shiffrin has been in daily contact with Erlandsson to talk about her equipment. They deliberate over the choices and the modifications to be made before each training session and race. Last week, between the morning and afternoon runs of the Olympic giant slalom, Shiffrin visited with Erlandsson again.\n\nWhat did they discuss?\n\n\u201cAdjustments,\u201d Erlandsson, a man of few words, answered.\n\nIn her second run, Shiffrin came from behind to win the gold medal.", "title": "Why Mikaela Shiffrin Brought 35 Pairs of Skis to the Olympics", "authors": ["Bill Pennington"]}

He also starred with his friend, Alexander Polli, 31, in the film \u201cBase,\u201d about proximity flying (also known as BASE jumping). Mr. Polli died in 2016 after clipping a tree during a proximity flight; the movie was released last year. His death followed that of another well-known base jumper, Dean Potter, who crashed into a granite rock formation after leaping off a cliff in Yosemite National Park in 2015.\n\nPsychologists have tried to categorize people who take extreme physical risks, like sky divers and racecar drivers, as being prone to \u201csensation seeking,\u201d similar to people who abuse drugs and gamble compulsively. Researchers have variously attributed this to psychopathology, a genetic quirk or possibly a chemical imbalance (for instance, low levels of the feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine).\n\nBut none of these explanations is likely the whole story. And while the research is slim and lacking much scientific rigor, studies of extreme-sports enthusiasts suggest they have diverse biologies, personalities and backgrounds.\n\n\u201cThere is no single profile that predicts engagement in extreme sports,\u201d said Dr. Erik Monasterio, a psychiatrist and clinical lecturer at University of Otago in New Zealand, who is also an avid mountain climber. \u201cThere are all sorts of paths to it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and others who study extreme sports point to cultural, sociological and even technological factors as the most likely explanations for the recent surge in participation. \u201cEfforts to eliminate risk are an obsession in the Western world,\u201d Dr. Monasterio said. \u201cWe have to make playgrounds and public spaces perfectly safe and there\u2019s all this litigation around physical and mental injuries in relation to all kinds of activities. That sterile environment is frustrating and makes people crave stimulation and excitement.\u201d\n\nHigh-risk sports are also seen as a reaction against living life mediated through a mobile device rather than having real experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape from a social media-obsessed society where so much seems fake and contrived and we\u2019re indoors so much that the idea of risk-taking in the outdoors is very appealing,\u201d said Dr. Starn, though he added that it\u2019s disturbing that people feel they must go to such extremes to find release.\n\nResearch by Welsh and French sports psychologists indicates individuals who have trouble identifying or expressing their feelings, which is essential to maintaining stable and supportive relationships, are drawn to high-risk sports because it presents them with a very recognizable and unambiguous emotion: fear.\n\n\u201cPeople feel good about themselves afterward because they have the sense that they have control over their emotions, like, \u2018I can conquer my fear,\u2019 \u201d said Tim Woodman, professor of performance psychology at Bangor University in Wales. \u201cBut then they have this urge to go to back again and again because their true, underlying fear hasn\u2019t been dealt with.\u201d\n\nAlthough this largely subconscious fear most often has to do with relationships and intimacy, there is also the compounding unease these days about the state of the world. Political unrest and dysfunction, discord between races and between sexes and the plight of the planet can also make people seek to \u201cexternalize their internal fears\u201d by engaging in extreme sports, said Christine Le Scanff, dean of the school of sports sciences and movement at the University of Paris-Sud in France.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way for people to burn away these worries about the world that occupy their minds,\u201d said Mr. Brice\u00f1o, who continues proximity flying despite having lost several friends, in addition to Mr. Polli, to the sport. \u201cIt gives you this rush and that rush makes you feel like you are alive and free and the happiness in that moment makes you think, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t have any more days of life because what I just did, it was so good, I could die right now.\u2019 \u201d", "title": "Why People Love to Jump Off Cliffs", "authors": ["Kate Murphy"]}

Joining Danny McBride as the son of Dundee were Australia\u2019s biggest stars, including Margot Robbie, Chris Hemsworth, Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman.\n\nThe trailer\u2019s premise \u2014 the foolish Americanized son of an Australian legend returns to the bush \u2014 also suggested a chance to poke fun at Americans and American assumptions about Australia. Bring it, I thought.\n\nBut what looked like a summer film was actually a setup for a Super Bowl ad. Tourism Australia duped us all, aiming directly at America\u2019s love for the Dundee story, with the goal of exploiting it.\n\nAnd it seems to be working.\n\nJohn O\u2019Sullivan, the managing director of Tourism Australia, told me yesterday that their site has seen record traffic since the Super Bowl, and that tourism operators are reporting double and triple the usual interest.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying to North America is you\u2019re welcome in our country and we want you to visit,\" he said. \u201cThat character really does bring that to the fore in a way that no other character has really done before.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. It\u2019s true that Dundee is quite welcoming to the visiting American reporter played by Linda Kozlowski (Hogan ended up marrying her in real life) and there\u2019s clearly something deeper going on with Dundee and Aussie identity.\n\nHere\u2019s Vincent Canby, our former chief film critic, grappling with Hogan and his character in 1986:\n\nMore than anything else, he seems to represent the newly proud Australian, the man who doesn\u2019t apologize for not being born English, who relishes his own, very pronounced accent and vocabulary, and who celebrates skepticism and the old, frontier values, more or less simultaneously.\n\nDoes that sound right to you? (The original film review is a hoot as well.)\n\nRegardless, here\u2019s a related question: Is there a \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d for today? A character or story that embodies how Australia sees itself now?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to use Dundee to reintroduce Americans to Australia. Good on ya for that, especially if it means gaining a deeper understanding of the place through visiting.\n\nBut ad-driven nostalgia is a sticky wicket. In the actual movie, I saw quite a bit more than what many Americans and Australians might recall.\n\nHogan\u2019s performance, closely observed, is unlike what he did for Tourism Australia as a spokesman before the film \u2014 he\u2019s not just a breezy larrikin.\n\nHis Dundee in America is more complicated, revealing in his facial expressions a fair amount of anxiety and awkwardness as he wanders through New York.\n\nThe Australia that he embodied in the \u201980s was not yet a middle power, or middle-power plus as Australia is sometimes known today. It was a young country far away, lacking urgency, trying to figure out a fast-paced, competitive world and just how much it wanted to get involved with all that ambition.\n\nTo some degree that\u2019s still Australia. To some degree it\u2019s not.\n\nAustralia in 2018 is more confident, far richer, more diverse, more urbanized and less unified politically. It\u2019s a beach lifestyle brand, not a Foster\u2019s ad. But it\u2019s still not sure what role it wants to play globally.\n\nSo what would a new Dundee reveal?\n\nAssuming we can cast Chris or Liam Hemsworth \u2014 or perhaps the role belongs to Russell Crowe or Hugh Jackman, who are roughly the same age as Hogan was for Dundee \u2014 what would a tale of Australia and the world tell us about the country today?\n\nWhere would the film be set, whose stories would it capture, and what would make it resonate with today\u2019s Australians?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 2016, only 35 percent of economics majors were women \u2014 about the same as in the early 1980s \u2014 although women earn a majority of all undergraduate degrees.\n\nA host of careful studies has found systematic barriers to women after they become professional economists. The list of problems is daunting. Women in the field often are held to higher standards in written work and aren\u2019t given credit for papers written with men. Student teaching evaluations tend to be biased against women, while journalistic discussions of economic research often relegate women to a secondary role.\n\nOn top of that, seemingly gender-neutral parental leave policies have exacerbated gender inequities because men sometimes use their leaves to further their careers while women spend their time giving birth, nursing and recovering. In addition, a popular online discussion forum has been found all too often to sexualize or trivialize women and their work. And another study has found economics to be an \u201coutlier\u201d among academic fields because of \u201ca persistent sex gap in promotion that cannot readily be explained by productivity differences.\u201d\n\nThe result is that women\u2019s voices are underrepresented.\n\nJanet Yellen is the only woman to have served as Federal Reserve chairman \u2014 and even Ms. Yellen had previously failed to win tenure at Harvard. There has never been a female Treasury secretary. Only three women have been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and none served under a Republican president. Women are outnumbered among full professors at so-called top twenty economics departments by a ratio of six to one. The University of Chicago has one female full professor of economics; Northwestern has none.\n\nThese studies have forced introspection upon many economists, making it difficult to believe that the field is really a meritocracy. They have forced urgent conversations in faculty lounges and conference hallways in parallel to the broader national conversation about gender and power.\n\nIn this time of reckoning, the American Economic Association has issued a statement condemning misogyny, and in a recent report it acknowledged that \u201cunacceptable behavior has been allowed to continue through tacit toleration.\u201d The association has recently drafted a code of conduct for the profession.", "title": "Why Women\u2019s Voices Are Scarce in Economics", "authors": []}

But now we\u2019ve internalized the idea that we have to look hot at the gym? Give me a break. The gym is one of the few places where we\u2019re supposed to be able to focus on how our bodies feel, not just on how they look. We need to remember that. Sweatpants can help.\n\nControl-top exercise leggings that hold in your stomach won\u2019t help. Nor will \u2014 and this is a real thing \u2014 the push-up sports bra.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m annoyed by the whole booming industry around women\u2019s exercise, which is perhaps most evident in the rise of studio classes. According to the Association of Fitness Studios, Americans spent around $24 billion on studio fees in 2015, or about $4 billion more than they spent on traditional gyms \u2014 and that spread has only increased since then. Naturally, women are spending the most; they outnumber men in studio classes by more than two to one.\n\nThey are paying for classes like SoulCycle (high-intensity stationary biking gets your soul super-toned!) and barre (look like a ballerina without ever having to dance!). And if you\u2019re already spending $30 on a fitness class, why not spend $70 on the shirt to wear to it? In 2016, at what we can only hope was the peak of the market, Americans dropped almost $46 billion on \u201cactivewear.\u201d\n\nAll of this turns working out from a healthy thing you might do twice a week into a Way of Life, where $120 leggings are more necessity than extravagance. Consider the way that these fancy exercise clothes have spread from the gym to the street, essentially outfitting women for every activity beyond white-collar work. Consider the way the step-counting Fitbit turns every errand into exercise. When yoga pants are the first thing grown women put on every morning, we can\u2019t help absorbing the message that staying fit is our No. 1 purpose in life.\n\nWomen can, of course, be fit and liberated. We may be able to conquer the world wearing spandex. But wouldn\u2019t it be easier to do so in pants that don\u2019t threaten to show every dimple and roll in every woman over 30?\n\nPantsuits had a moment, back in 2016. I think women are ready to give them another chance. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s bring back slacks, too, and corduroys and, why not, even khakis. But the first step is to bring back sweatpants.\n\nDeep-sea divers need skintight polymer pants; so do Olympic speedskaters. The rest of us could use some breathing room.

The clauses force the pharmacists to remain silent as, for example, a consumer pays $125 under her insurance plan for an influenza drug that would have cost $100 if purchased with cash.\n\nMuch of the difference often goes to the drug benefit managers.\n\nFederal and state officials say they share the pharmacists\u2019 concerns, and they have started taking action. At least five states have adopted laws to make sure pharmacists can inform patients about less costly ways to obtain their medicines, and at least a dozen others are considering legislation to prohibit gag clauses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said that after meeting recently with a group of pharmacists in her state, she was \u201coutraged\u201d to learn about the gag orders.", "title": "Why Your Pharmacist Can\u2019t Tell You That $20 Prescription Could Cost Only $8", "authors": []}

Those subsidies are entirely defensible, but both parties in Congress have agreed to phase them out in a couple of years. Mr. Fowke is jumping now in part to lock in the subsidized prices.\n\nYet costs for renewable technologies are coming down so much that by the time the federal subsidies expire, wind turbines and large-scale solar arrays will still be competitive in large parts of the country.\n\nThe same trend is occurring all over the world, even in countries that do not offer subsidies, with renewable projects routinely beating fossil-fuel projects in countries like Mexico and India. We are confident more price declines are coming.\n\nThe costs of huge batteries are also falling, and it looks as if they will turn out to be a big help in managing the variability of wind and solar power.

It could allow people to collect payments early, as in the plan Ms. Ernst spoke of, or it could administer a new fund, perhaps financed by payroll taxes, an idea some Democrats have proposed. The administration\u2019s goal is to get bipartisan support on what has historically not been a Republican issue.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill.\n\nImage Senator Marco Rubio, left, and Senator Mike Lee also support the proposal, although Mr. Lee voiced concern about the future of Social Security. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\n\nIn a conference call, the senators praised the fact that the plan would not force businesses to provide leave, would not start a new government program and would not raise taxes.\n\nBut Mr. Lee also raised concerns about the underfunding of Social Security, and whether this would accelerate its decline. That is the most controversial aspec t of the proposal, experts said, because it would apply more stress to a program that is already under pressure.\n\nStarting in 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the latest trustees report, unless taxes are raised or benefits are trimmed. And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.", "title": "Why a Republican Plan for Paid Leave Has Stirred Concern About Social Security", "authors": []}

Worse, the government, emboldened by the deal, could well come down even harder on them. In fact, the religious regulations that recently came into effect include much stiffer fines on underground churches and penalties for public-school teachers who give Sunday-school lessons on their own time.\n\nAnd then, rapprochement might augur the Vatican\u2019s readiness to eventually stop recognizing Taipei and instead recognize Beijing as truly representing China. Such a shift would alter the delicate balance of power across the Taiwan Strait, as well as harm Taiwan\u2019s vibrant democracy. It would also confer legitimacy \u2014 and with the pope\u2019s imprimatur! \u2014 on authoritarian regimes throughout the world that crack down on churches and sects.\n\nThe Catholic Church already has a checkered record dealing with fascist or totalitarian states. Pope Pius XII was criticized for betraying the Jews of Europe during World War II: Hewing to what he described as a position of neutrality between the Nazis and the Allies, he never denounced Hitler\u2019s Final Solution. After Soviet forces violently repressed the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the Vatican sidelined the outspoken anticommunist Archbishop J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty in favor of a deal with the new puppet regime.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s eagerness to play catch-up in China today may do it no favors either.\n\nBeijing doesn\u2019t have much of a reputation for honoring commitments. Just look at its application of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement it promised Hong Kong, which was supposed to guarantee the city a large degree of autonomy until 2047.\n\nEven under the deal the Vatican seems to want, the Chinese government could eventually come to control the Catholic Church in China \u2014 by, say, simply delaying nominating anyone for bishop or repeatedly rejecting candidates presented by the Vatican until all the bishops previously selected by the pope have retired or died out. Bishops ordain priests and so without bishops, in time there could be no priests, or very few, and Catholicism in China would have died a silent death.\n\nFour decades ago, when a destitute China was emerging from deep Maoism, Western companies got tipsy at the mere notion of selling deodorant to two billion Chinese armpits. Now that average Chinese have much more disposable income, major international corporations are willing to hand over proprietary technology, stoically endure violent xenophobic outbursts and take on members of the Chinese Communist Party as senior managers rather than risk losing out on the business prospects.\n\nNo one, it seems, can resist the lure of the great market of China, for deodorants, cars \u2014 or congregants.

If interpreted in a prudent and modern way, a little dose of Heimat could help Germany avoid going down the same road to political degeneration that the United States and Britain have followed. Yet the rediscovery of Heimat will bear fruit only if the term is once again redefined.\n\nThe process is underway. In this new conception, Heimat is shelter from a disorderly world. Simply put, Heimat is a counter-concept to globalism. To give just one example, a German magazine called Landlust (roughly translates as Countryside Pleasure) is now the best-selling publication in the country. Its focus? Teaching its readers how to chop their own firewood or how to prepare pear compote the traditional way. That\u2019s the innocent and potentially inclusive form of Heimat.\n\nBut Heimat also holds the danger of serving as a justification to exclude the \u201cother\u201d in order keep the \u201cown\u201d unspoiled. Heimat is why many voters support the new far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German abbreviation AfD, in its battle against Muslim \u201cinvaders.\u201d The AfD is trying to defend Heimat by spreading fear of outsiders coming in hordes to do away with the German \u201cVolk\u201d once and for all. More and more Germans are subscribing to this exclusive understanding of Heimat. According to one poll, the AfD has just reached a popularity rate of 16 percent, replacing the ailing, center-left Social Democrats as the second-largest political force in Germany.\n\nHeimat is what Trump voters and Brexit supporters long for, and what they accuse their political elites of abandoning. The driver of polarization and source of social poison in these countries has been a mutual and self-supporting alienation. Both the Trump and the Brexit vote have been explained as a country versus city divide, yet the cleavage transcends geography. Rather, it stems from the clash between \u201cchange is loss\u201d and \u201cchange is gain\u201d mentalities, which has split village and metropolis alike.\n\nGlobalization has hurt urban and rural life in Germany as well. When low interest rates force a small rural bank branch to close, local residents lose more than just a place to withdraw cash \u2014 they lose a social institution.

On Jan. 10, 2018, after tickets were made available for presale, Fandango\u2019s managing editor, Erik Davis, tweeted that the movie\u2019s first 24 hours of advance ticket sales exceeded those of any other movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe black internet was, to put it mildly, exploding. Twitter reported that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was one of the most tweeted-about films of 2017, despite not even opening that year. There were plans for viewing parties, a fund-raiser to arrange a private screening for the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem, hashtags like #BlackPantherSoLit and #WelcomeToWakanda. When the date of the premiere was announced, people began posting pictures of what might be called African-Americana, a kitsch version of an older generation\u2019s pride touchstones \u2014 kente cloth du-rags, candy-colored nine-button suits, King Jaffe Joffer from \u201cComing to America\u201d with his lion-hide sash \u2014 alongside captions like \u201cThis is how I\u2019ma show up to the Black Panther premiere.\u201d Someone described how they\u2019d feel approaching the box office by simply posting a video of the Compton rapper Buddy Crip-walking in front of a Moroccan hotel.\n\nNone of this is because \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is the first major black superhero movie. Far from it. In the mid-1990s, the Damon Wayans vehicle \u201cBlankman\u201d and Robert Townsend\u2019s \u201cThe Meteor Man\u201d played black-superhero premises for campy laughs. Superheroes are powerful and beloved, held in high esteem by society at large; the idea that a normal black person could experience such a thing in America was so far-fetched as to effectively constitute gallows humor. \u201cBlade,\u201d released in 1998, featured Wesley Snipes as a Marvel vampire hunter, and \u201cHancock\u201d (2008) depicted Will Smith as a slacker antihero, but in each case the actor\u2019s blackness seemed somewhat incidental.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d by contrast, is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a very long time that we\u2019re seeing a film with centered black people, where we have a lot of agency,\u201d says Jamie Broadnax, the founder of Black Girl Nerds, a pop-culture site focused on sci-fi and comic-book fandoms. These characters, she notes, \u201care rulers of a kingdom, inventors and creators of advanced technology. We\u2019re not dealing with black pain, and black suffering, and black poverty\u201d \u2014 the usual topics of acclaimed movies about the black experience.\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter in December, which has since gone viral, three young men are seen fawning over the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d poster at a movie theater. One jokingly embraces the poster while another asks, rhetorically: \u201cThis is what white people get to feel all the time?\u201d There is laughter before someone says, as though delivering the punch line to the most painful joke ever told: \u201cI would love this country, too.\u201d\n\nRyan Coogler saw his first Black Panther comic book as a child, at an Oakland shop called Dr. Comics & Mr. Games, about a mile from the Grand Lake Theater. When I sat down with him in early February, at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, I told him about the night I saw \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d and he listened with his head down, slowly nodding. When he looked up at me, he seemed to be blinking back tears of his own.\n\nPhoto\n\nCoogler played football in high school, and between his fitness and his humble listening poses \u2014 leaning forward, elbows propped on knees \u2014 he reminds me of what might happen if a mild-mannered athlete accidentally discovered a radioactive movie camera and was gifted with remarkable artistic vision. He\u2019s interested in questions of identity: What does it mean to be a black person or an African person? \u201cYou know, you got to have the race conversation,\u201d he told me, describing how his parents prepared him for the world. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t have that without having the slavery conversation. And with the slavery conversation comes a question of, O.K., so what about before that? And then when you ask that question, they got to tell you about a place that nine times out of 10 they\u2019ve never been before. So you end up hearing about Africa, but it\u2019s a skewed version of it. It\u2019s not a tactile version.\u201d\n\nAround the time he was wrapping up \u201cCreed,\u201d Coogler made his first journey to the continent, visiting Kenya, South Africa and the Kingdom of Lesotho, a tiny nation in the center of the South African landmass. Tucked high amid rough mountains, Lesotho was spared much of the colonization of its neighbors, and Coogler based much of his concept of Wakanda on it. While he was there, he told me, he was being shown around by an older woman who said she\u2019d been a lover of the South African pop star Brenda Fassie. Riding along the hills with this woman, Coogler was told that they would need to visit an even older woman in order to drop off some watermelon. During their journey, they would stop occasionally to approach a shepherd and give him a piece of watermelon; each time the shepherd would gingerly take the piece, wrap it in cloth and tuck it away as though it were a religious totem. Time passed. Another bit of travel, another shepherd, another gift of watermelon. Eventually Coogler grew frustrated: \u201cWhy are we stopping so much?\u201d he asked. \u201cWatermelon is sacred,\u201d he was told. \u201cIt hydrates, it nourishes and its seeds are used for offerings.\u201d When they arrived at the old woman\u2019s home, it turned out that she was, in fact, a watermelon farmer, but her crop had not yet ripened \u2014 she needed a delivery to help her last the next few weeks.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I refused to eat watermelon in front of white people. To this day, the word itself makes me uncomfortable. Coogler told me that in high school he and his black football teammates used to have the same rule: Never eat watermelon in front of white teammates. Centuries of demonizing and ridiculing blackness have, in effect, forced black people to abandon what was once sacred. When we spoke of Africa and black Americans\u2019 attempts to reconnect with what we\u2019re told is our lost home, I admitted that I sometimes wondered if we could ever fully be part of what was left behind. He dipped his head, fell briefly quiet and then looked back at me with a solemn expression. \u201cI think we can,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no question. It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019ve been brainwashed into thinking that we can\u2019t have that connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a Hollywood movie, and Wakanda is a fictional nation. But coming when they do, from a director like Coogler, they must also function as a place for multiple generations of black Americans to store some of our most deeply held aspirations. We have for centuries sought to either find or create a promised land where we would be untroubled by the criminal horrors of our American existence. From Paul Cuffee\u2019s attempts in 1811 to repatriate blacks to Sierra Leone and Marcus Garvey\u2019s back-to-Africa Black Star shipping line to the Afrocentric movements of the \u201960s and \u201970s, black people have populated the Africa of our imagination with our most yearning attempts at self-realization. In my earliest memories, the Africa of my family was a warm fever dream, seen on the record covers I stared at alone, the sun setting over glowing, haloed Afros, the smell of incense and oils at the homes of my father\u2019s friends \u2014 a beauty so pure as to make the world outside, one of car commercials and blond sitcom families, feel empty and perverse in comparison. As I grew into adolescence, I began to see these romantic visions as just another irrelevant habit of the older folks, like a folk remedy or a warning to wear a jacket on a breezy day. But by then my generation was building its own African dreamscape, populated by KRS-One, Public Enemy and Poor Righteous Teachers; we were indoctrinating ourselves into a prideful militancy about our worth. By the end of the century, \u201cBlack Star\u201d was not just the name of Garvey\u2019s shipping line but also one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever made.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was the envisioning of a free self. Nina Simone once described freedom as the absence of fear, and as with all humans, the attempt of black Americans to picture a homeland, whether real or mythical, was an attempt to picture a place where there was no fear. This is why it doesn\u2019t matter that Wakanda was an idea from a comic book, created by two Jewish artists. No one knows colonization better than the colonized, and black folks wasted no time in recolonizing Wakanda. No genocide or takeover of land was required. Wakanda is ours now. We do with it as we please.\n\nUntil recently, most popular speculation on what the future would be like had been provided by white writers and futurists, like Isaac Asimov and Gene Roddenberry. Not coincidentally, these futures tended to carry the power dynamics of the present into perpetuity. Think of the original \u201cStar Trek,\u201d with its peaceful, international crew, still under the charge of a white man from Iowa. At the time, the character of Lieutenant Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, was so vital for African-Americans \u2014 the black woman of the future as an accomplished philologist \u2014 that, as Nichols told NPR, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. himself persuaded her not to quit the show after the first season. It was a symbol of great progress that she was conceived as something more than a maid. But so much still stood in the way of her being conceived as a captain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe artistic movement called Afrofuturism, a decidedly black creation, is meant to go far beyond the limitations of the white imagination. It isn\u2019t just the idea that black people will exist in the future, will use technology and science, will travel deep into space. It is the idea that we will have won the future. There exists, somewhere within us, an image in which we are whole, in which we are home. Afrofuturism is, if nothing else, an attempt to imagine what that home would be. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d cannot help being part of this. \u201cWakanda itself is a dream state,\u201d says the director Ava DuVernay, \u201ca place that\u2019s been in the hearts and minds and spirits of black people since we were brought here in chains.\u201d She and Coogler have spent the past few months working across the hall from each other in the same editing facility, with him tending to \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and her to her much-anticipated film of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d At the heart of Wakanda, she suggests, lie some of our most excruciating existential questions: \u201cWhat if they didn\u2019t come?\u201d she asked me. \u201cAnd what if they didn\u2019t take us? What would that have been?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfrofuturism, from its earliest iterations, has been an attempt to imagine an answer to these questions. The movement spans from free-jazz thinkers like Sun Ra, who wrote of an African past filled with alien technology and extraterrestrial beings, to the art of Krista Franklin and Ytasha Womack, to the writers Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor and Derrick Bell, to the music of Jamila Woods and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. Their work, says John I. Jennings \u2014 a media and cultural studies professor at the University of California, Riverside, and co-author of \u201cBlack Comix Returns\u201d \u2014 is a way of upending the system, \u201cbecause it jumps past the victory. Afrofuturism is like, \u2018We already won.\u2019 \u201d Comic books are uniquely suited to handling this proposition. In them the laws of our familiar world are broken: Mild-mannered students become godlike creatures, mutants walk among us and untold power is, in an instant, granted to the most downtrodden. They offer an escape from reality, and who might need to escape reality more than a people kidnapped to a stolen land and treated as less-than-complete humans?\n\nAt the same time, it is notable that despite selling more than a million books and being the first science-fiction author to win a MacArthur fellowship, Octavia Butler, one of Afrofuturism\u2019s most important voices, never saw her work transferred to film, even as studios churned out adaptations of lesser works on a monthly basis. Butler\u2019s writing not only featured African-Americans as protagonists; it specifically highlighted African-American women. If projects by and about black men have a hard time getting made, projects by and about black women have a nearly impossible one. In March, Disney will release \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d featuring Storm Reid and Oprah Winfrey in lead roles; the excitement around this female-led film does not seem to compare, as of yet, with the explosion that came with \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But by focusing on a black female hero \u2014 one who indeed saves the universe \u2014 DuVernay is embodying the deepest and most powerful essence of Afrofuturism: to imagine ourselves in places where we had not been previously imagined.\n\nCan films like these significantly change things for black people in America? The expectations around \u201cBlack Panther\u201d remind me of the way I heard the elders in my family talking about the mini-series \u201cRoots,\u201d which aired on ABC in 1977. A multigenerational drama based on the best-selling book in which Alex Haley traced his own family history, \u201cRoots\u201d told the story of an African slave kidnapped and brought to America, and traced his progeny through over 100 years of American history. It was an attempt to claim for us a home, because to be black in America is to be both with and without one: You are told that you must honor this land, that to refuse this is tantamount to hatred \u2014 but you are also told that you do not belong here, that you are a burden, an animal, a slave. Haley, through research and narrative and a fair bit of invention, was doing precisely what Afrofuturism does: imagining our blackness as a thing with meaning and with lineage, with value and place.\n\n\u201cThe climate was very different in 1977,\u201d the actor LeVar Burton recalled to me recently. Burton was just 19 when he landed an audition, his first ever, for the lead role of young Kunta Kinte in the mini-series. \u201cWe had been through the civil rights movement, and there were visible changes as a result, like there was no more Jim Crow,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe felt that there were advancements that had been made, so the conversation had really sort of fallen off the table.\u201d The series, he said, was poised to reignite that conversation. \u201cThe story had never been told before from the point of view of the Africans. America, both black and white, was getting an emotional education about the costs of slavery to our common American psyche.\u201d\n\nTo say that \u201cRoots\u201d held the attention of a nation for its eight-consecutive-night run in January 1977 would be an understatement. Its final episode was viewed by 51.1 percent of all American homes with televisions, a kind of reach that seemed sure to bring about some change in opportunities, some new standing in American culture. \u201cThe expectation,\u201d Burton says, \u201cwas that this was going to lead to all kinds of positive portrayals of black people on the screen both big and small, and it just didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t go down that way, and it\u2019s taken years.\u201d\n\nHere in Oakland, I am doing what it seems every other black person in the country is doing: assembling my delegation to Wakanda. We bought tickets for the opening as soon as they were available \u2014 the first time in my life I\u2019ve done that. Our contingent is made up of my 12-year-old daughter and her friend; my 14-year-old son and his friend; one of my oldest confidants, dating back to adolescence; and two of my closest current friends. Not everyone knows everyone else. But we all know enough. Our group will be eight black people strong.\n\nBeyond the question of what the movie will bring to African-Americans sits what might be a more important question: What will black people bring to \u201cBlack Panther\u201d? The film arrives as a corporate product, but we are using it for our own purposes, posting with unbridled ardor about what we\u2019re going to wear to the opening night, announcing the depths of the squads we\u2019ll be rolling with, declaring that Feb. 16, 2018, will be \u201cthe Blackest Day in History.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is all part of a tradition of unrestrained celebration and joy that we have come to rely on for our spiritual survival. We know that there is no end to the reminders that our lives, our hearts, our personhoods are expendable. Yes, many nonblack people will say differently; they will declare their love for us, they will post Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela quotes one or two days a year. But the actions of our country and its collective society, and our experiences within it, speak unquestionably to the opposite. Love for black people isn\u2019t just saying Oscar Grant should not be dead. Love for black people is Oscar Grant not being dead in the first place.\n\nThis is why we love ourselves in the loud and public way we do \u2014 because we have to counter his death with the very same force with which such deaths attack our souls. The writer and academic Eve L. Ewing told me a story about her partner, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago: When it is time for graduation, he makes the walk from his office to the celebration site in his full regalia \u2014 the gown with velvet panels, full bell sleeves and golden piping, the velvet tam with gold-strand bullion tassel. And when he does it, every year, like clockwork, some older black woman or man he doesn\u2019t know will pull over, roll down their window, stop him and say, with a slow head shake and a deep, wide smile, something like: \u201cI am just so proud of you!\u201d\n\nThis is how we do with one another. We hold one another as a family because we must be a family in order to survive. Our individual successes and failures belong, in a perfectly real sense, to all of us. That can be for good or ill. But when it is good, it is very good. It is sunlight and gold on vast African mountains, it is the shining splendor of the Wakandan warriors poised and ready to fight, it is a collective soul as timeless and indestructible as vibranium. And with this love we seek to make the future ours, by making the present ours. We seek to make a place where we belong.", "title": "Why \u2018Black Panther\u2019 Is a Defining Moment for Black America", "authors": ["Carvell Wallace"]}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "When you recognize where a story is headed, you usually feel disappointed or comforted by the familiar. The tropes and stock characters have robbed the story of its ability to surprise you. That\u2019s always a threat with a genre so well worn as the coming-of-age film \u2014 the probably nostalgic tale of a child or teenager inching toward adulthood. Yet entries like Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird\u201d still prove that this type of movie has the ability to move us.\n\nCould stories that are so familiar to many a misfit be too similar to each other? In the weeks leading up to the Oscars, discussion has been swirling around \u201cLady Bird,\u201d a best picture nominee, and whether it copied elements from Patricia Cardoso\u2019s 2002 movie, \u201cReal Women Have Curves.\u201d Josefina L\u00f3pez, the film\u2019s screenwriter, told Hoy Los Angeles that \u201cLady Bird\u201d was a \u201cwhite version\u201d of her movie. \u201cI enjoyed it and at moments kept thinking: \u2018Wow, the mother is like the mother in my movie. Wow, they aren\u2019t going to let her go to college, like Ana,\u2019\u201d she said. Other commentators also noted the similarities but used harsher terms like plagiarism or whitewashing.\n\nOn the surface, the two young women in these movies do share many similarities. Ana (America Ferrera) and the self-christened Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) each attend a good school in California with classmates who are financially better off. Both have their hearts set on a college in New York City and share excruciatingly difficult relationships with their mothers, whom they\u2019ll part with either just before or at an airport.\n\nFor me, the similarities end there. Ana is a fantastic Mexican-American student who gets guidance from a well-meaning teacher (George Lopez) on how to apply to Columbia University. She doesn\u2019t seem to have friends at Beverly Hills High School, apart from the boy she likes, or in her neighborhood in East Los Angeles. Her story plays out over the last day of senior year and throughout the summer. She spends just as much of her screen time working at her sister\u2019s dress shop as she does at home. Her family is working class, with no money to send her to college at all or keep her sister\u2019s store afloat.", "title": "Why \u2018Real Women Have Curves\u2019 Never Got Its \u2018Lady Bird\u2019 Moment", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "This view has no better spokesman than Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary. \u201cWe must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed,\u201d he said this month. \u201cWe do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others. We do not want that at all. We do not want to be a diverse country. We want to be how we became 1,100 years ago here in the Carpathian Basin.\u201d (It is remarkable that the Hungarian prime minister remembers so vividly what it was to be Hungarian 11 centuries ago.)\n\nBut his position makes clear the difference between the East\u2019s vision of conservatism and the West\u2019s. In the West, conservatives believe that it is not enough to get an Austrian or German passport to become Austrian or German \u2014 you should also adopt the dominant culture. In Mr. Orban\u2019s view, you cannot become a Hungarian if you were not born a Hungarian.\n\nAnd here is the paradox of today\u2019s nativist revolution in Europe. Both Eastern and Western Europe have shifted to the right in recent years, but instead of contributing to the unity of Europe, this shift makes the gap between the two regions even wider.\n\nWhile Western Europeans contest the merits of diversity, they do live in culturally diverse societies and have for some time. Central and Eastern Europeans, on the other hand, live in ethnically homogeneous societies and believe that diversity will never happen to them. Conservatives in the Western part of Europe dream of a continent where majorities will be the ones shaping society; in the East they dream of a society without minorities and governments without oppositions.\n\nSo while conservative political leaders like Mr. Orban, who wants to take his country back by 1,100 years, and Sebastian Kurz, the new 31-year-old conservative prime minister of Austria, share similar views when it comes to control over migration or mistrust of old-style conservatism, they are not natural allies when it comes to the future of the European Union.\n\nIn fact, they differ in much the same way 1968 in Western Europe differed from \u201968 in Eastern Europe. In the West it was about the sovereignty of the individual. In the East it was about the sovereignty of the nation.", "title": "Opinion | Will 2018 Be as Revolutionary as 1968?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cI was born 13 months after Columbine,\u201d a 12th grader named Faith Ward said on Monday, referring to the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, the dawn of the modern wave of school shootings. Ms. Ward spoke to a television reporter at an anti-gun demonstration outside her school in Plantation, Fla. \u201cThis is all I have ever known,\u201d she said, \u201cthis culture of being gunned down for no reason, and this culture of people saying, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s send thoughts and prayers\u2019 for three days, and then moving on. And I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nSo are we all.\n\nIt is too soon to tell if this righteous anger augurs a sustained youth movement for gun sanity, going beyond the occasional protest. We hope it does. It\u2019s time, once again, for America to listen to its children. Who among us have more at stake than they?\n\nSensible young people have it in their power to make their senseless elders take heed \u2014 and act. We saw it happen during the Vietnam War half a century ago. Young people, initially reviled by establishment forces as unwashed, longhaired traitors, energized an antiwar movement that swept the country and, even if it took years, ultimately ended America\u2019s misguided adventure in Southeast Asia.\n\nTo be effective, any movement needs a realistic program, not mere emotion. Otherwise, it risks coming and going in a flash with little to show for itself. A tighter federal system of background checks is a start, to better monitor would-be gun buyers with mental illness, for example, or histories of gun violence. Such a program should also include reinstating a nationwide ban on assault weapons \u2014 a state measure died in the Florida Legislature Tuesday \u2014 and ending an absurd prohibition against using federal public health funds to study gun violence.\n\nEven President Trump, who told an N.R.A. convention last April that \u201cyou have a true friend and champion in the White House,\u201d has signaled he might be willing to improve the system. The Washington Post reported that after Mr. Trump saw the coverage of the student protesters, he asked Mar-a-Lago guests whether he should do more about gun control. On Tuesday, he ordered that regulations be written to ban bump stocks, devices that can make an automatic weapon out of a semiautomatic. Beyond that, though, it\u2019s hard to tell if he means business when he says he\u2019s open to more thorough background checks. Steadfastness is not a Trump hallmark.\n\nHowever, if young people channeling this angry moment remain steadfast, they might not only force his hand but also stiffen the resolve of other elected officials and candidates. Horrific school shootings aside, they are vulnerable every day to gun mayhem at a stomach-churning rate. The journal Pediatrics reported last June that gunfire, each week, kills an average of 25 children ages 17 and under. A 2016 study in The American Journal of Medicine calculated that among two dozen of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations, this country alone accounted for 91 percent of firearms deaths among children 14 and under.", "title": "Opinion | Will America Choose Its Children Over Guns?", "authors": []}

If he wants to resign under a Republican president in the first half of a presidential term, he must act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201d\n\nParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.\n\nBut Mr. Ward said Justice Kennedy is likely to emulate Justice Byron R. White, who drifted to the right after his appointment by President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Even so, Justice White said, it was fitting to retire under a Democratic president because he had been appointed by one. He stepped down not long after President Bill Clinton was elected and was replaced by Justice Ginsburg, whose voting record has been considerably more liberal.\n\nA new study on departures from the Supreme Court attempted to refine the conventional factors by considering political science data on justices\u2019 voting patterns, involuntary departures and missed opportunities. It concluded that justices have not been particularly successful at ensuring that they would be replaced by like-minded successors.\n\nJustice Kennedy is in a ticklish spot, said the study\u2019s author, Christine Kexel Chabot, who teaches at Loyola University Chicago School of Law.

He spoke about \u201cthe decline of democracy,\u201d about a country at risk of becoming \u201ca pseudo-democracy,\u201d about how \u201cwe are so far from what the norm should be of an active and inclusive democracy,\u201d about how \u201cI have never felt our democracy as imperiled as I do today.\u201d The grim litany was almost enough to make one reach for the bottle.\n\nWe\u2019re in sync with him on the perils of social and economic inequality and on the need for vigilance in the face of this White House\u2019s routine flouting of democratic norms. But it\u2019s hard to escape the sense that Mr. de Blasio is an imperfect messenger for some of the reforms he advocated to \u201credemocratize a society that is losing its way.\u201d\n\nHis call for broader public financing of local elections and \u201cgetting big money out of politics\u201d sounded good. But it might have resonated more had it come from someone who did not rely on big money in his campaigns, and was criticized by federal prosecutors for blurring pay-to-play ethics \u2014 and has no doubt run his last race for local office.\n\nThe mayor pledged to create a commission to revise City Charter provisions on campaign financing. Every New York mayor in the last quarter-century has favored this sort of panel to achieve a specific goal, usually stocking it with loyalists. Why bother with a process that may well run a tortuous course? Nothing stops Mr. de Blasio from immediately drafting legislation to get the same result, and persuading the City Council to pass it.", "title": "Opinion | Will Apathy Defeat de Blasio\u2019s Grand Plan for Democracy?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "The wager has done pretty well already. Berkshire Hathaway started gobbling up Apple stock just over a year ago. At the end of last year, its Apple position had a market value of $28.2 billion, according to the letter. The position cost Berkshire $21 billion, the letter said, which suggests a gain of $7.2 billion, or over 30 percent. The bet also outperformed a soaring stock market. In the past 12 months, Apple stock is up 31 percent, versus 17 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.\n\nWhat do the numbers say now? Apple, by some metrics, looks cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation yardstick that compares a company\u2019s per-share profits to its stock price, is 15.5 times forecasted earnings for 2018. Facebook\u2019s stock is at 26 times, Google is at 27 times, and Amazon is at a dizzying 184 times. Apple\u2019s ratio is even smaller than the overall market\u2019s. The bullish theory: Apple\u2019s stock price will keep rising as investors come to see that it is undervalued.\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t investors have realized this years ago? Apple, after all, is a famous company, and investors have long been aware of its fat profit margins, its grip on consumers and its ability to generate billions of dollars of cash flow. But Apple is unimpressive in a way that often worries investors: It is a slower growing company. Google, Facebook and Amazon are all expected to increase their sales at a significantly faster clip than the 10 percent that Apple achieved in 2017.\n\nIt would take a large number of additional iPhone sales, at higher prices, for Apple to have the sales growth of Google. And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\n\nCould investors become more bullish? It\u2019s hard to know exactly why investors become willing to pay a lot more for certain companies. Amazon\u2019s share price is up over 160 percent over the past two years, a period when business was strong, but not markedly stronger than investors expected. Sometimes the herd just changes its mind. And there are plenty of ways in which Apple excels. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr. Buffett enthused about one. Once consumers own, say, an iPhone, they have a tendency to stay loyal to Apple products. \u201cYou are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nStock investors beware: Inflation could soon jump.\n\nWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.\n\nThey may want to keep fretting, though.\n\nJames W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group, put out some new research on Monday that suggests that the inflation rate, 2.1 percent in January, could move a lot higher in coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculate a metric that draws on both economic and financial data to try and assess the amount of inflation that is brewing in the economy. One version of the New York Fed\u2019s \u201cunderlying inflation gauge\u201d rose by 3 percent in January. Mr. Paulsen took historical data for this yardstick and found that, in the past, it was quite a good predictor of actual inflation. \u201cAlthough not perfect and while the lead/lag relationship varies over time, the underlying inflation gauge has done a good job of forecasting future movements in the core inflation rate during the next 18 months,\u201d he wrote. If this relationship holds up, inflation could be 2.6 percent by the end of this year, and 3 percent by the middle of 2019, Mr. Paulsen wrote. Of course, the relationship might break down in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHigher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.\n\nOn Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom moves closer to striking a deal with Qualcomm...\n\nBut the two remain far apart on price.\n\nOn Monday, Qualcomm\u2019s board in a letter to Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, said the two sides have made progress addressing Qualcomm\u2019s regulatory concerns and proposed the two companies hold a meeting that focuses on negotiating the price.\n\nFrom the statement accompanying the letter:\n\nThe Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom\u2019s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.\n\nBut\n\nBroadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom\u2019s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations.\n\nSo what price is Qualcomm pushing for? The FT reports that \u201cQualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 percent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid.\u201d\n\nDelta is getting political blowback for severing ties with the N.R.A.\n\nRepublican politicians in Georgia, where Delta Air Lines is headquartered, are hitting back at the company, reports Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\n\nLt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted:\n\nRick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with:\n\nWrites Ms. Josephs:\n\nAfter its tweet announcing the end of the NRA discounts, Delta said in a statement that the \u201cdecision reflects the airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings\u201d and that it was taken \u201cout of respect for our customers and employees on both sides.\u201d The airline added that \u201cit continues to support the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWill Warren Buffett get to use his \u2018elephant gun\u2019?\n\nHe certainly sees the need.\n\nIn his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shareholders, Mr. Buffett said:\n\nBerkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At year end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash.\n\nBut will he have the opportunity?\n\nMr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that \u201cproved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.\u201d\n\nCritics\u2019 corner\n\n\u2022 Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: \u201cThe best way Buffett can solidify his legacy is by returning to the M&A market with the same force and determination he\u2019s always shown. He may need to pay more than he wants to, but what\u2019s a little extra to Berkshire in the long run?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Mr. Buffett is on the wrong side of a generational shift, writes John Foley in Breakingviews. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard have waded in and called for companies to do good. That attitude is already baked into the Buffett view, Mr. Foley writes, \u201cBut notions of what\u2019s now referred to as ESG \u2014 environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 are otherwise fuzzy in Berkshire\u2019s universe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther highlights from the letter\n\n\u2022 Berkshire\u2019s windfall of $29.6 billion from the U.S. tax overhaul was only slightly offset by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated earnings. Mr. Buffett did not expand on his recent criticisms of tax cuts. Read more about what he did focus on here.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire\u2019s bottom line could be significant.\n\nPeter Eavis of The Times notes:\n\nIt would indeed be notable if Berkshire started to publish \u201cadjusted earnings,\u201d or financial statements that exclude certain items. In last year\u2019s annual report, Mr. Buffett criticized companies that publish adjusted earnings that leave out costs like stock awards to executives. At the annual meeting on May 5, a shareholder may want to ask why shareholders should be asked to overlook losses on stocks.\n\nRelated\n\nMichael Kives, a longtime Hollywood agent at Creative Artists Agency who has consulted and represented Mr. Buffett \u2014 as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, Katy Perry and Jessica Alba, among others \u2014 is striking out on his own with a new firm, K5.

The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe\u2019s highest court.\n\nFacing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount.\n\nU.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent\u2019s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA shipping rival, FedEx Corporation, agreed to acquire TNT in a $4.8 billion deal in 2015, completing the deal after receiving approval from European regulators the next year.\n\n\u2014 Chad Bray\n\nPhoto\n\nWeinstein Co. will file for bankruptcy\n\nTalks about a sale to a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet have collapsed.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "Wall Street watchers should ask:\n\nIs this good or bad volatility? In recent years, investment bank executives had differentiated between two types of volatility: One that leads to less trading because it frightens and confuses investors, and another that generates a higher level of trading because investors see changes in yields and prices they have to adapt to. Goldman is counting on the latter.\n\nIs Goldman well positioned to profit? The bank has a plan to revamp its bond trading operations that centers on broadening the types of investors it does business with. The bank was too dependent on hedge funds that liked to make big bets on bonds, currencies and commodities, so it has made efforts to bring in large asset managers and other financial institutions as clients. But do these new clients trade anywhere near as much as the hedge funds, and are the trades they do as profitable as the ones the hedge funds favor?\n\nGoldman\u2019s first-quarter earnings could offer clues.\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe the meal-kit industry isn\u2019t dead yet.\n\nBlue Apron gained notoriety when its I.P.O. proved to be one of the biggest busts last year and spurred talk that the meal kit industry was a flash in the pan. But its latest results showed some tentative signs of life \u2014 and those of its biggest rival, HelloFresh of Germany, suggest that it isn\u2019t worth writing off the sector just yet.\n\nWhat Blue Apron reported\n\n\u2022 For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 13 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $187.7 million \u2014 less than analysts had expected.\n\n\u2022 It also reported a $39 million loss for the quarter, again a smaller loss than expected.\n\n\u2022 Both the cost of goods sold and marketing expenditures were down from the year-ago period.\n\n\u2022 The company\u2019s customer rolls dropped 15 percent year-on-year to 746,000, though the company said that was to be expected from the lower marketing spend.\n\n\u2022 The average orders per customer and revenue per customer each rose a tiny bit.\n\nBlue Apron\u2019s ability to hold the line on marketing expenses was probably the most promising sign, though that was in part because management was also focused on improving operations at the company\u2019s distribution center in Linden, N.J.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe HelloFresh perspective\n\nHelloFresh has had a better run in the stock markets since going public last year.

Mr. Richter contended that the company could become profitable this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we need to strive for or put a lot of effort into,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 He added that he doesn\u2019t see supermarkets selling their own meal kits as true competitors, running counter to investor fears that the combined Amazon/Whole Foods portends doom for smaller competitors. \u201cWe have more in common with Chipotle or a fast-casual chain,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tale of the tape\n\nBlue Apron\u2019s shares are down 66 percent since their debut.

It was a pinky-finger promise not to stage any provocations during the Winter Games. It was also a stunning act of theater.\n\nIn swift succession, just days before the opening of the Pyeongchang Games, the two Koreas agreed to march into the Olympic arena under a unified flag, to field a joint women\u2019s ice hockey team for the first time at an Olympics and to stage cultural performances. Mr. Kim had yet one more surprise: He sent not only North Korea\u2019s ceremonial head of state but also his trusted younger sister in what will be the first official visit by an immediate member of the Kim family to South Korea.\n\nThis may sound like a movie-ready Olympic story of peace and reconciliation, but I doubt it will be so simple.\n\nAs a young journalist, I was at Sydney\u2019s Olympic Stadium in 2000 when the two Koreas marched in together, for the first time at an Olympic Games, under the white-and-pale-blue \u201cunified Korea\u201d flag. The moment, met by cheers and a standing ovation, sent chills down my spine. It felt like we were on the cusp of a new era of peace.\n\nEighteen years later, the mood is different here in South Korea. Hope for peace has been replaced by distrust and skepticism. The South Koreans who remember Korea as one country and long for its reunification \u2014 my grandparents\u2019 generation \u2014 are gone.

The president has spoken about raising the age limit for the purchase of assault rifles to 21, along with a ban on so-called bump stocks, which are devices that help increase the rate of fire. The N.R.A. seems broadly opposed to both, however, so that\u2019s a nonstarter. And I don\u2019t think Trump is going to expend much political capital on getting the G.O.P. to change its mind, either. Which is a tragedy, given the number of future mass shootings we can expect, considering how many past ones we\u2019ve endured.\n\nGail: Yeah, if it hurts gun business, it\u2019s toast. Like the N.R.A. folk, Trump lives in an alternate universe where being armed means always being capable of hitting somebody in a crisis situation.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "So while filing an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the administration\u2019s lawyers also went to the Supreme Court with a \u201cpetition for a writ of certiorari before judgment,\u201d a request to the justices to hear the case this spring without waiting. The Supreme Court\u2019s rules reserve this court-jumping procedure for cases of \u201cimperative public importance.\u201d Only a handful of cases has cleared that bar, including the Nixon tapes case, which effectively forced the president\u2019s resignation and the 1981 case that ratified the agreement that ended the Iran hostage crisis. Invoking those cases, Solicitor General Francisco insists to the court that \u201cthat standard has been met here,\u201d an assertion the plaintiffs vigorously dispute.\n\nSaying so doesn\u2019t make it so, and in fact the odds of a rebuff from the Supreme Court are so good as to raise the question of why the president\u2019s legal team doesn\u2019t devote its energy to the Ninth Circuit, which has agreed to hear the appeal on an expedited schedule. Beyond the president\u2019s grudge against the appeals court, I think the answer lies in a more subtle effort to demonize Judge Alsup and through him, the growing number of federal district judges who are pushing back against the administration across a range of issues. The petition sends a message that Judge Alsup \u2014 a highly respected veteran of 17 years on the bench \u2014 and by extension, the others, are so out of line that the country can\u2019t afford to wait for a normal appeal to run its course. And if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t take the bait \u2014 well, that just shows that the justices are part of the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that in the hall of mirrors that passes for the Trump administration\u2019s legal policy shop, this case, U.S. Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, looms large. Judge Alsup and, most recently, Judge Garaufis in Brooklyn, have called the president\u2019s hand. Their analysis is a subtle one. Judge Alsup suggests, and Judge Garaufis says explicitly, that the president has the legal right to terminate the DACA program if he does so properly. What was improper about the order issued in September by the acting secretary of homeland security to wind DACA down in six months? Judge Alsup observed that the administration based its action not on a policy judgment, which might have rendered the termination unreviewable in court, but on a \u201cmistake of law.\u201d The judge noted that President Trump had repeatedly said and tweeted that he liked the Dreamers and wanted to help them. These statements left Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other die hard anti-immigrant presidential advisers with a problem. Disabled by the president himself from an all-out attack on DACA on policy grounds, they had to come up with another rationale for ending the program.\n\nWhat they came up with was something called \u201clitigation risk.\u201d It turned out that Texas and allied states, which had successfully gone to court to stop the Obama administration from expanding the DACA program to include more than four million parents of DACA-eligible children, had conveniently offered to sue to undo DACA itself. This lawsuit would succeed because the program was in fact illegal, Attorney General Sessions declared in a memo aimed at providing a seeming law-based, and therefore neutral, justification for ending the program.\n\nBut that \u201cpithy conclusion\u201d of illegality was not the attorney general\u2019s to reach, Judge Alsup said in his opinion, explaining that \u201cdetermining illegality is a quintessential role of the courts.\u201d He said the current DACA program and the earlier proposed expansion that the lower courts had invalidated were sufficiently distinct as to make improper a simple extrapolation from one to the other. The judge labeled the \u201clitigation risk\u201d explanation a \u201cpost hoc rationalization\u201d \u2014 an explanation made up after the fact to fit a desired outcome.", "title": "Opinion | Will the Supreme Court Become Trump\u2019s Enabler?", "authors": []}

Ryan Sherstobitoff, a senior analyst at McAfee, said the hacks had appeared to be well organized and backed by substantial resources, with \u201cthe hallmarks of a nation state.\u201d What that nation state planned to do with the stolen data and its foothold in victims\u2019 machines, Mr. Sherstobitoff said, was still anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nA spokesman for the International Olympic Committee declined to comment on how the organization was addressing the heightened threats.\n\nSecurity researchers often discuss risks with a level of informed paranoia. Some of their warnings are based on what is possible but has not actually occurred in the real world. On other occasions, their warnings are based on what has already happened, and where those incidents could lead.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut cyberattacks on international events have become common. The 2015 nuclear negotiations in Geneva and the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, for example, were plagued by hackers from various nation states. The Olympics are another alluring target \u2014 but with wall-to-wall television coverage.\n\n\u201cThe Olympics involve so many countries, and so many sports, many of which have their own infrastructure, that it has become a rich target environment for many adversaries,\u201d said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence at the security firm FireEye.\n\nHe has been tracking the activities of Russian hackers and other groups as they lay the groundwork for attacks on Olympic organizations. In the past few months, Mr. Hultquist said, his team at FireEye has seen several examples of Russian groups tampering with the computers of Olympic-related organizations. The activity is \u201cobviously meant to drag Olympics-related organizations through the mud and discredit them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear, which has been tied to the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and has links to Russia\u2019s main military intelligence unit, has already started posting hacked emails intended to highlight discord among global sports officials and investigators who exposed systemic Russian doping.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, the group posted emails and other documents online from the International Luge Federation, claiming they demonstrated violations of antidoping rules. And earlier in January, the group released hacked emails and documents from the International Olympic Committee, which it advertised as proof \u201cthe Europeans and the Anglo-Saxons are fighting for power and cash in the sports world.\u201d\n\nTrend Micro, the Tokyo-based security company, said its researchers had also witnessed Fancy Bear attacks on the International Ice Hockey Federation, the International Ski Federation, the International Biathlon Union, and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation in the final months of 2017. The attacks occurred while an International Olympic Committee disciplinary panel was preparing bans for dozens of Russian athletes caught doping in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin has its fingerprints on cyberattacks that were retribution for exposing the Russians\u2019 Sochi games doping scheme, which was a fraud on the purity of sport,\u201d said Doug DePeppe, a founder of Sports ISAO, a nonprofit cybersecurity organization in Colorado Springs. The group is trying to help sports associations, including Olympic organizations, combat threats.\n\n\u201cTheir goal is to say, \u2018No one is following the rules, and Russia shouldn\u2019t be singled out,\u2019\u201d Mr. DePeppe said.\n\nFireEye, McAfee and other security companies said that over the past few months they had seen attack groups from Russia, and others of unknown origin, dispatch hundreds of \u201cspearphishing\u201d emails, laced with malicious links and attachments, to target Olympic-related groups.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

They warn that those activities could be a prelude for a broader Russian campaign.\n\nIn 2016, Russian hackers targeted the World Anti-Doping Agency after it recommended that Russian athletes be banned from the 2016 Rio Games because of doping. The personal data of more than 40 athletes was leaked not long after.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be attacks in which hackers tried to shut off lights in a stadium during an event, or perhaps even tampered with electronic timing results, warned Betsy Cooper, the executive director at the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo protect the Olympics, South Korea has mobilized tens of thousands of security personnel, including cybersecurity analysts and 50,000 soldiers, in what has been described as one of the most militarized security forces in Olympic history.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the United States State Department has set up a temporary security monitoring operation on one floor of its embassy in Seoul. Analysts from the State Department, the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security are scheduled to arrive there this week.\n\nBut an official who was briefed on the State Department-led operation, and who was not allowed to discuss it publicly, worried that the operation was too focused on combating traditional threats like physical attacks on venues.\n\nThe State Department did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nElsewhere in Pyeongchang, an alliance of security personnel from South Korea, various Olympic sponsors, technology suppliers and cybersecurity sleuths from around the world are monitoring computer screens and potential threats at the unmarked Security Command Center.\n\nEach country participating in the Olympics also has its own security delegation on the ground, with those from the United States and Israel among the largest. Those delegations are busy conducting their own threat assessments and receiving daily threat briefings from South Korean law enforcement authorities.\n\nWhile cybersecurity experts believe the North Korean threat was lessened by the last-minute addition of a North Korean delegation to the Games, they have not ruled out that North Korea may be looking to embarrass its southern neighbor.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for certain: We can\u2019t simply rely on these actors to behave themselves in this context,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cThey\u2019ve proven, again and again, over the past few years that they are not afraid to flout international norms and create chaos.\u201d", "title": "Winter Olympics\u2019 Security on Alert, but Hackers Have a Head Start", "authors": ["Nicole Perlroth"]}

McFaul, a political scientist and diplomat who, before serving as the American ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014, wrote extensively on building democracies.\n\n\u201cNobody is making that argument today,\u201d he added, \u201ccertainly not Trump.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration on Monday brushed off questions about Mr. Xi\u2019s move. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a decision for China to make about what\u2019s best for their country,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cBut as you know, the president\u2019s talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign. It\u2019s something that he supports here in the United States, but that\u2019s a decision that would be up to China.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlmost no one would have described China as genuinely democratic before the latest move, which was announced without fanfare on Sunday; the country remains a one-party state with extensive control over political, social and economic life.\n\nEven so, Mr. Xi\u2019s gambit ended a period of collective and term-limited leadership begun by Jiang Zemin, who held the same post as Mr. Xi from 1993 to 2003, that many had hoped was leading China toward greater rule of law and openness. This shift confirms a growing view that those expectations were probably na\u00efve, some say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deluded in our conviction that everybody is going to become a democracy like us,\u201d said Merriden Varrall, the director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\nMr. Xi, who will be 69 when his second five-year term ends in 2023, is not simply following the example set by Mr. Putin or other leaders, she and other experts said. His motivations are unique to Chinese history and politics. Yet, they are deeply shaped by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Soviet Union two years later.\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThose historical milestones ushered in an era of expanding political and economic freedoms. Mr. McFaul said that for nearly a quarter of a century autocratic leaders \u201chad to play defense\u201d against the democratizing trend that seized the post-Cold War order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven the Russia that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union adopted a democratic constitution and instituted free elections. Whatever the chaos of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s era in the 1990s, democracy was taking root when Mr. Putin came to power \u2014 in a relatively free and fair election, no less.\n\nThe rumination of Francis Fukuyama, the scholar, has come up repeatedly. In a famous essay titled \u201cThe End of History?\u201d (note the question mark), he argued that Western liberal democracy had become recognized as \u201cthe final form of human government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe end of history is no more,\u201d Brad W. Setser, a Treasury official during the Obama administration who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a message after news emerged of Mr. Xi\u2019s move.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn hindsight, Mr. Putin was the vanguard of what Mr. McFaul called the \u201cilliberal international,\u201d a new version of the Communist International founded by Lenin to spread communism around the world.\n\nAuthoritarian leaders now act with greater impunity \u2014 or at least less worry about international isolation. Aspiring authoritarians like Viktor Orban of Hungary in turn seem enticed by the kind of power Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi wield, untroubled by the need to compromise or consult or, in the case of corruption and cronyism, to answer for evidence of misrule and malfeasance.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s critics say that while he may not yet have eroded democracy in the United States, his populist appeals and nativist policies, his palpable aversion to the news media and traditional checks on power, and his stated admiration for some of the strongest of strongmen are cut from the same cloth.\n\nThe trend toward authoritarianism, while specific to each country\u2019s history, is rooted in insecurities and fears afflicting the world today: globalization and rising inequality, the stunning and scary advances in technology, the disorienting chaos and extreme violence of civil wars like Syria\u2019s, separatism and terror.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe institutions of the post-Cold War \u2014 which reflected the bedrock values of Western liberalism \u2014 no longer seem able to cope. Countries that once were beacons for others are consumed by the same anxiety and weakness, and internal strife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin has long cited such flaws to shore up his power at home; the campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the United States seemed intended, in the first place, to discredit American democracy still more.\n\n\u201cLiberal democracies in the United States and even in Europe no longer look like such an inspiring model for others to follow,\u201d said Mr. McFaul, whose book on his experience shepherding Russian policy in the Obama administration, \u201cFrom Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d will be published in May.\n\nFrom China\u2019s perspective, the end of the Cold War was hardly an inspiration, having led to the toppling of one-party dictatorships. The \u201ccontagion\u201d of 1989, which saw popular protesters bring down Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, infected China, too. A few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Chinese students massing in Tiananmen Square posed what officials in Beijing viewed as an existential threat, a legacy that continues to color everything the government does to this day.\n\n\u201cIf anything gives Xi Jinping and the party nightmares, it is perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union,\u201d Ms. Varrall said, referring to the reforms the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sought before the system unraveled.\n\nMr. Xi, as a result, believes that only stability can ensure his vision of China\u2019s revival and emergence as the world\u2019s power. \u201cHe seems to genuinely believe that he\u2019s the only person who can achieve this vision,\u201d she said. In last fall\u2019s Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi even presented China as a new model for the developing world \u2014 a thinly veiled argument that the United States and Europe were no longer as attractive as they once were.\n\nThe need for a strong grip appears to be a long-held conviction of Mr. Xi\u2019s. According to a 2009 diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks, an old associate told the American ambassador in Beijing at the time, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., that as a son of one of China\u2019s communist revolutionary leaders, Mr. Xi was an elitist who believed deeply in the unwavering authority of the party.\n\n\u201cOne cannot entirely escape one\u2019s past,\u201d the associate said. \u201cXi does not want to.\u201d", "title": "With Xi\u2019s Power Grab, China Joins New Era of Strongmen", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers"]}

An official said on Sunday that the White House was open to releasing it pending an examination to protect intelligence sources and methods.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we\u2019re open to considering any document the House Intel Committee submits to us for declassification along the lines that the Nunes memo was considered,\u201d said a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, referring to Representative Devin Nunes of California, who spearheaded the Republican memo as the Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nThe Democratic memo is said to contend that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. Republicans allege that the bureau did not disclose to the court that information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, that was used in the warrant application had been partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nPeople familiar with the document have said it also rebuts Republican claims that Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I. at the time, had told the Intelligence Committee late last year that the agency would not have sought a wiretap of Mr. Page without Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier of information.\n\nRepresentative Jim Himes of Connecticut, a senior Democrat on the committee, said on Sunday that Americans needed to see the Democratic document.\n\n\u201cWhat we will learn is that it is not true that this FISA warrant was awarded solely on the basis of the Steele dossier,\u201d Mr. Himes said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe will also learn that the F.B.I., because they are very careful people, didn\u2019t mislead the judge, that the judge had some sense that this information came out of a political context.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, told Mr. Trump in a letter that any move to block the memo would \u201cconfirm the American people\u2019s worst fears\u201d that the release of the Republican document was intended solely to undermine the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S.

The memo in fact undermined some Republicans\u2019 efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway before law enforcement officials presented the Steele information in obtaining the warrant to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.\n\nOn Sunday, several Republicans on the Intelligence Committee distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who advised the Republican committee staff members who drafted the memo, said that he saw no substantive connection.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t think it has any impact on the Russia probe,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is a Russia investigation without a dossier.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who also sits on the intelligence panel, echoed those remarks on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, what we\u2019re dealing with is a situation within our FISA court and how we process within our government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it really has anything to do with that,\u201d he added, referring to the broader Russia inquiry.\n\nThe people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.\n\nThe memo is also said to argue that Republicans distorted the testimony by Mr. McCabe, the F.B.I. official, and left out reams of other evidence included by the F.B.I. to support the bureau\u2019s suspicions that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Mr. McCabe in fact presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, a former Moscow-based banker who had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, according to those familiar with the memo.\n\nDemocrats have publicly called for the Republican-controlled committee to release a transcript of the interview with Mr. McCabe.", "title": "With a Monday Vote Expected, Democrats Press to Release Their Own Memo", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"]}

(That dinner would eventually serve as the prologue for the book.)\n\nThe next day, Mr. Wolff told Mr. Rubin and Mr. Sterling in an email that he had the go-ahead from his White House connections and the project was on.

There was nothing in the way of formal interviews. Mr. Wolff was simply there, a witness to the frenzied nature of an institution going through seismic changes. Originally, the plan had been to limit the scope and for Mr. Wolff to produce a book called \u201cThe Great Transition: Inside the First 100 Days of the Trump White House.\u201d Soon, he realized that he would have to stay longer.\n\nIn August, after Mr. Bannon\u2019s abrupt departure as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, all agreed it was time to write.\n\nWhen it came time to publish, Holt had a carefully planned rollout \u2014 beginning with a 6,700-word excerpt in New York magazine that would appear on the web on Jan. 4 at 12:01 a.m. When The Guardian, a British newspaper, managed to get its hands on a copy of the book, excerpting some of its most salacious claims in a news article posted online on Jan. 3, all the carefully made publishing plans fell apart.\n\nBy now much of the world knows what happened next. Lawyers for Mr. Trump sent Holt a letter demanding that it halt publication or else risk a libel suit that could result in \u201csubstantial monetary damages and punitive damages.\u201d Instead, the company moved up the publishing date to Jan. 5 from Jan. 9, working with three printers to get the first run of 150,000 copies into bookstores as fast as possible. (As of this date, no libel suit has been filed against Holt.)\n\nWithin days, the book was a sensation, and Mr. Wolff was an in-demand media star, appearing on such shows as \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d and \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut all the publicity was not positive.

Haley, his ambassador to the United Nations, that he was unable to substantiate enough to include in his book. (Ms. Haley later called those rumors \u201chighly offensive\u201d and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d) On Feb. 1, the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski booted him off the program when she accused him of refusing to acknowledge making those insinuations or apologize for doing so.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get what we\u2019re talking about \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, this is awkward, you\u2019re here on the set with us, but we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Brzezinski said. \u201cMichael Wolff, thank you.

There\u2019s little doubt that Mr. O\u2019Reilly \u2014 with whom Mr. Rubin had a publishing relationship at Doubleday Broadway going back almost 20 years \u2014 played a crucial role in helping Mr. Rubin help Holt belt out so-called big books. Under Mr. Rubin\u2019s auspices, \u201cKilling Lincoln,\u201d the best-selling book Mr. O\u2019Reilly would write alongside Martin Dugard, soared and created a series of popular (if sometimes deeply factually flawed) history books.\n\nWhen evidence of multiple allegations of sexual harassment were publicly disclosed in a lengthy New York Times investigation last spring, the ramifications for Mr. O\u2019Reilly were harsh. In the aftermath, he lost his perch on Fox News and was dropped by both United Talent Agency and William Morris Endeavor, his literary agency.\n\nStill, Holt remains committed to publishing his works. It\u2019s a subject that Mr. Rubin and others at the company are understandably wary of.

I said, \u2018If Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s books are selling, then he\u2019s got an audience. And if he has an audience, print the books, publish the books. You can\u2019t censor the guy.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Thanks.\u2019 He needed some support. But I knew what he was going to do. He was going to publish the books. People have done things far worse than Bill O\u2019Reilly.\u201d\n\nPermanently Altering the Conversation\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Mr. Rubin was joined by two members of Holt\u2019s senior management team and Don Weisberg, the president of Macmillan, as together they looked over covers and titles for a coming sales conference. The first one in the packet was for a yet-untitled O\u2019Reilly book.\n\nWhen the group reached a page showcasing a coming book by another author, Mr. Rubin was resigned to the title, but was displeased with its red-and-black visual presentation. \u201cIf we use this jacket, I\u2019m going to kill myself,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cThe title is going to stay,\u201d said Maggie Richards, Holt\u2019s vice president and deputy publisher in charge of sales and marketing. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to use this jacket?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nThe meeting lasted only a little over 10 minutes.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fair to say Mr. Rubin changed Holt \u2014 such quick decision-making was not always part of its DNA \u2014 Holt has also changed Mr. Rubin. Often described by many as the best-dressed man in publishing \u2014 admittedly, it\u2019s not a high bar \u2014 Mr. Rubin has scaled things back. When a visitor expressed surprise that he was not wearing a tie and his customary cuff links when they first met, Mr. Rubin said: \u201cI hope I\u2019m not disappointing you.\u201d\n\nAnd despite his more casual attire \u2014 on most winter days he can be found in Bally sneakers and a zipped-up cardigan beneath his suit jacket \u2014 there remains much of the boy from the Bronx who made good and knows it. He proudly displays photographic works by Cecil Beaton, Eve Arnold and Irving Penn on his walls and still maintains a car and driver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn truth he never let go of the trappings of the pre-Holt life. He still throws sprawling catered parties at the expansive apartment near Central Park West that he and his wife, Cynthia, who represented classical musicians and who died of lung cancer in 2010, purchased in 1998. Last month, one for Mr. Wolff attracted, among others, Ann Coulter, the former Hollywood Reporter editor Janice Min and NPR\u2019s David Folkenflik. Another recent event there was a gathering for the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, which is home to the Stephen and Cynthia Rubin Institute for Music Criticism.\n\nAnd he is still a man on the town, retreating to his home in Westhampton every Friday and occasionally to the flat he maintains in London. He has stayed a fixture at the opera and at the best restaurants in the city. On a recent evening, his regular dinner group \u2014 consisting of himself, Ms. Friedman, the former Times music critic John Rockwell and the food writer Moira Hodgson \u2014 ate at the Beatrice Inn in the West Village. While the food impressed him, the clamor of the hedge funders and oligarchs who have overrun every hard-to-book restaurant in Manhattan did not. A day later he fumed at the bill.\n\n\u201c$932 without tip for four people!\u201d Mr. Rubin lamented. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back there again. It was outrageous!\u201d\n\nMr. Rubin remains coy about what \u201cFire and Fury\u201d means for him personally, to have this kind of triumph so late in his career. Still he beams at its success and celebrates its cultural relevance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly fulfilling for me personally to have published a book I\u2019m really proud of that has permanently altered the conversation about our presidency,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s selling a kajillion copies.\u201d", "title": "With \u2018Fire and Fury,\u2019 Stephen Rubin Is Publishing\u2019s 76-Year-Old Comeback Kid", "authors": ["Sridhar Pappu"]}

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces took control here about 18 months ago, in a campaign supported by American Special Operations forces and air power. While the Manbij Military Council, which is now in charge, is a majority Arab force, the new government is organized on Mr. Ocalan\u2019s revolutionary principles.\n\nWomen were immediately given the right to divorce, previously a right reserved to men; to inherit property on an equal basis with men; and to keep their children and their homes in a marital breakup. Gone were long-observed Shariah law provisions that gave a woman\u2019s testimony in court only half the weight of a man\u2019s.\n\nThose changes were not without pushback. The Kurdish majority area of Kobani in Syria, for instance, outlawed the practice of men taking more than one wife.

Adapted, from the French film of the same name, by Emma Rice, the Globe\u2019s soon-to-depart artistic director, it\u2019s about a tradition-bucking heroine too timid to stand up for her own genius, whose colleagues bow and scrape before an inscrutable man-fool they\u2019ve been told is a savant.\n\nDuring the scene where the heroine, reflexively overlooked, watches a man be congratulated for her sublimely innovative achievement, I put my head in my hands. It is so easy to be invisible, or inaudible, simply by virtue of being female.\n\nAnd this is the thing: that so many women\u2019s stories, for so many years, have gotten overlooked, or drowned out or shouted down, while men\u2019s stories have been enshrined in tradition.\n\nIn the theater, telling and retelling the same tales is part of the culture. There are good reasons to revisit the canon, searching for fresh resonances each time. But there are bad reasons, too, like being so tuned in to male voices and experiences that others fail to register as valid or worthwhile.\n\nGender parity for playwrights, a goal that the Women\u2019s Voices festival is helping to push forward, would almost by default improve our understanding of the world, deepening our knowledge of what it is to be human.\n\nIn the gift shop at Ford\u2019s Theater, there\u2019s a T-shirt emblazoned with a famously democratic phrase. \u201cCreated equal,\u201d it says, a proud allusion to the Gettysburg Address and the Declaration of Independence before it.

He has consistently denied the allegations of abuse, and in October he warned against allowing \u201ca witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the certainty of the Dylan Farrow case is that there has been a gross injustice: Either an innocent man\u2019s career is being destroyed, or a victim has been unfairly doubted since she confided in her pediatrician about an assault when she was 7 years old.\n\nI asked Dylan if there was any chance that this was a false memory, that she had been brainwashed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI think it\u2019s more logical almost that the people who accuse me of being brainwashed are brainwashed themselves by the celebrity, the glamour, the fantasy, the pull they have to Woody Allen, their hero on a pedestal.\u201d\n\nThe larger point, she said, is not her own suffering over the years, but the need to listen to victims.\n\nThat\u2019s where we have systematically failed \u2014 with gymnasts, with Harvey Weinstein\u2019s victims, with the Catholic Church and with innumerable girls and boys suffering anonymously at the hands of abusive coaches, relatives, family friends or bosses.

Nevertheless, they will pay for the right experiences and technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where you go on vacation, what you do and what technology you have,\u201d said Allen Adamson, one of the founders and managing partners of Metaforce, a brand marketing and consulting firm, and one of the authors of \u201cShift Ahead: How The Best Companies Stay Relevant in a Fast Changing World.\u201d Those experiences need to be \u201cInstagram-worthy,\u201d too. The quirkier, flashier and more offbeat the experience, the better, he said.\n\nAnd businesses are catching on.\n\nIMAX, for instance, rolled out six virtual reality theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Manchester and Toronto over the last year as a pilot project to attract millennials. And it has plans to open four more.\n\nPhoto\n\nIMAX charges roughly $10 for a 10-minute VR experience, which is far cheaper than the $1,500 or more needed to buy an in-home VR technology system with a high-end PC and headset. A visitor steps into a pod, snaps on a VR headset and is virtually transported on a 360-degree journey that can include flying over volcanoes, diving into the world of criminals and hit men from the John Wick films, or stepping into the shoes of virtual game superheroes like Batman and Wonder Woman.\n\nAfterward, the players receive a video of their VR experience, which they can share with friends on social media. \u201cMillennials want really special experiences and ones that are hard to replicate,\u201d said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX.\n\nWhen it comes to automobiles, many millennials don\u2019t care about high-end cars the way that previous generations did, but they do want the in-cabin technology and luxury features that often go with them, said Sam Russell, Buick\u2019s marketing director.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But its lounges, bars and public spaces are large and encourage a social atmosphere, where guests can mingle and even play board games with friends and strangers. Guests check in electronically through their phones or through the hotel bar instead of at a front desk. There are special events, like midnight pajama parties, where guests are invited to the bar for a nightcap, as well as yoga classes, tarot card readings and \u201cConBody\u201d events, where ex-convicts lead prison-style boot-camp fitness classes.\n\nAt the Moxy Times Square, a neon-pink light marks the entryway and art graces the ceiling and walls.

Norton & Company. $25.95.\n\nWhatever happened to kissing as a source of literary inspiration? You hardly read about it anymore (except in news accounts of it being nonconsensual). As editor of The New York Times\u2019s Modern Love column, I sift through some 8,000 personal essays about relationships every year. Almost none are about kissing. People will always kiss, I suppose, but these days it\u2019s an act that doesn\u2019t seem to generate much conversational traction.\n\nExcept, that is, in \u201cThe Kiss: Intimacies From Writers,\u201d edited by Brian Turner, himself an essayist, as well as a poet and memoirist. In this anthology of essays and stories, lip-locking takes center stage \u2014 featuring such smoochy, no-nonsense titles as \u201cKiss,\u201d \u201cKiss, Kiss\u201d and \u201cKiss, Kiss, Kiss.\u201d Befitting the brevity of the average mouth-on-mouth contact, most entries last only two or three pages. A few go on too long, making you want to twist free, while others tantalize with such grace that they linger sweetly in your mind for days.\n\nI was curious to discover what all of these meditations \u2014 prompted by the editor\u2019s call for \u201cthoughts on a specific kiss\u201d \u2014 would unearth. Would they focus on new love, where passion dominates? (I realized, diving in, that I probably kiss the top of my dog\u2019s snout more than any other surface, if only because he lets me.) I hoped it would explore vulnerability. A kiss, after all, is typically the first physical gesture in which we make plain our desire and open ourselves to rejection.\n\nSoon enough, the book went straight there. In \u201cThe Evolution of a Kiss,\u201d Nickole Brown describes this action as \u201ca break in the dam separating two beings that agree, Yes, please touch me there. An insane gesture, at least on paper, to open up our most necessary and vulnerable aperture and surrender it to another, to give over that place with which we eat and speak and breathe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYes, when you spell it out kissing can sound crazy and even repellent (and especially frightful for germophobes). Unlike sex, which ensures survival of the species, kissing doesn\u2019t seem to serve any obvious purpose. And as Tom Sleigh points out in his short essay \u201cJudas Kiss,\u201d \u201ckissing is far from universal: In fact, less than half of the world\u2019s cultures kiss for romantic purposes, and almost no animals.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book doesn\u2019t really explore why humans kiss, or why some of us do while others don\u2019t. But we do hear plenty about it being an urge, a compulsive act of affection, of love, of hello and goodbye. The most moving entries involve no romance at all, but rather familial bonds, and loss, and how with a kiss we seek to demonstrate the depths of devotion or grief when words fail.", "title": "Writers Pay Lip Service to a Universal Gesture of Love", "authors": ["Daniel Jones", "Brian Turner"]}

Despite increasing concerns about China\u2019s evolution, the West has yet to come to grips with this threat.\n\nSince taking office in 2013, Mr. Xi has amassed power assiduously, taking control of not just the government but also of the Chinese Communist Party, the military and the press. He has imposed his views on the educational system and culture, hardening an already authoritarian system that ruthlessly controls social media and wields law enforcement to crush dissent.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "The Harder Kind of Dictatorship\n\nIf Mr. Xi stays in office for life, as many now expect, that will only formalize a process he has undertaken for years: stripping power away from China\u2019s institutions and accumulating it for himself.\n\nIt helps to mentally divide dictatorships into two categories: institutional and personalist. The first operates through committees, bureaucracies and something like consensus. The second runs through a single charismatic leader.\n\nChina, once an almost Socratic ideal of the first model, is increasingly a hybrid of both. Mr. Xi has made himself \u201cthe dominant actor in financial regulation and environmental policy\u201d as well as economic policy, according to a paper by Barry Naughton, a China scholar at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Xi has also led sweeping anti-corruption campaigns that have disproportionately purged members of rival political factions, strengthening himself but undermining China\u2019s consensus-driven approach.\n\nThis version of authoritarianism is harder to maintain, according to research by Erica Frantz, a scholar of authoritarianism at Michigan State University. \u201cIn general, personalization is not a good development,\u201d Ms. Frantz said.\n\nThe downsides are often subtle. Domestic politics tend to be more volatile, governing more erratic and foreign policy more aggressive, studies find. But the clearest risk comes with succession.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a question I like to ask Russia specialists: \u2018If Putin has a heart attack tomorrow, what happens?\u2019\u201d said Milan Svolik, a Yale University political scientist. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn China, up until now, the answer to that had been very clear,\u201d he said. A dead leader would have left behind a set of widely agreed rules for what was to be done and there would be a political consensus on how to do it.\n\n\u201cThis change seems to disrupt that,\u201d Mr. Svolik said. Mr. Xi, by defying the norms of succession, has shown that any rule could be broken. \u201cThe key norm, once that\u2019s out, it seems like everything\u2019s an option,\u201d Mr. Svolik said.\n\nFactional purges risk shifting political norms from consensus to zero-sum, and sometimes life-or-death, infighting.\n\nAnd Mr. Xi is undermining the institutionalism that made China\u2019s authoritarianism unusually resilient. Collective leadership and orderly succession, both put in place after Mao Zedong\u2019s disastrous tenure, have allowed for relatively effective and stable governing.\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nKen Opalo, a Georgetown University political scientist, wrote after China\u2019s announcement that orderly transitions were \u201cperhaps the most important indicator of political development.\u201d Lifelong presidencies, he said, \u201cfreeze specific groups of elites out of power. And remove incentives for those in power to be accountable and innovate.\u201d\n\nWhat Makes Authoritarian Legitimacy\n\nIn 2005, Bruce Gilley, a political scientist, wrestled with one of the most important questions for any government \u2014 is it viewed by its citizens as legitimate? \u2014 into a numerical score, determined by sophisticated measurements of how those citizens behave.\n\nChina, his study found, enjoyed higher legitimacy than many democracies and every other non-democracy besides Azerbaijan. He credited economic growth, nationalist sentiment and collective leadership.\n\nBut when Mr. Gilley revisited his metrics in 2012, he found that China\u2019s score had plummeted.\n\nHis data showed the leading edge of a force long thought to doom China\u2019s system. Known as \u201cmodernization theory,\u201d it says that once citizens reach a certain level of wealth, they will demand things like public accountability, free expression and a role in government. Authoritarian states, unable to meet these demands, either transition to democracy or collapse amid unrest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis challenge, overcome by no other modern authoritarian regime except those wealthy enough to buy off their citizens, requires new sources of legitimacy. Economic growth is slowing. Nationalism, though once effective at rallying support, is increasingly difficult to control and prone to backfiring. Citizen demands are growing.\n\nSo China is instead promoting \u201cideology and collective social values\u201d that equate the government with Chinese culture, according to research by the China scholar Heike Holbig and Mr. Gilley. Patriotic songs and school textbooks have proliferated. So have mentions of \u201cXi Jinping Thought,\u201d now an official ideology.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s personalization of power seems to borrow from both old-style strongmen and the new-style populists rising among the world\u2019s democracies.\n\nBut, in this way, it is a high-risk and partial solution to China\u2019s needs. A cult of personality can do for a few years or perhaps decades, but not more.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u2018Accountability Without Democracy\u2019\n\nChina is experimenting with a form of authoritarianism that, if successful, could close the seemingly unbridgeable gap between what its citizens demand and what it can deliver.\n\nAuthoritarian governments are, by definition, unaccountable. But some towns and small cities in China are opening limited, controlled channels of public participation. For example, a program called \u201cMayor\u2019s Mailboxes\u201d allows citizens to voice demands or complaints, and rewards officials who comply.\n\nThe program, one study found, significantly improved the quality of governing and citizens\u2019 happiness with the state. No one would call these towns democratic. But it felt enough like democracy to satisfy some.\n\nThis sort of innovation began with local communities that expressed their will through limited but persistent dissent and protest. Lily L. Tsai, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scholar, termed it \u201caccountability without democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, some officials are adapting this once-resisted trend into deliberate practice. Their goal is not to bring about liberalization but to resist it \u2014 to \u201csiphon off popular discontent without destabilizing the system as a whole,\u201d the China scholars Vivienne Shue and Patricia M. Thornton write in a new book on governing in China.\n\nMost Chinese, Beijing seems to hope, will accept authoritarian rule if it delivers at least some of the benefits promised by democracy: moderately good government, somewhat responsive officials and free speech within sharp bounds. Citizens who demand more face censorship and oppression that can be among the harshest in the world.\n\nThat new sort of system could do more than overcome China\u2019s conflict with the forces of history. It could provide a model of authoritarianism to thrive globally, showing, Ms. Shue and Ms. Thornton write, \u201chow non-democracies may not only survive but succeed over time.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Xi\u2019s power grab, by undermining institutions and promoting all-or-nothing factionalism, risks making that sort of innovation riskier and more difficult.\n\nWhen leaders consolidate power for themselves, Ms. Frantz said, \u201cover time their ability to get a good read on the country\u2019s political climate diminishes.\u201d\n\nSuch complications are why Thomas Pepinsky, a Cornell University political scientist, wrote on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019m no China expert, but centralizing power in the hands of one leader sounds like the most typical thing that a decaying authoritarian state would do.\u201d", "title": "Xi Sets China on a Collision Course With History", "authors": ["Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "There were three excavation locations at the museum, and we saved the biggest and best for last. The vast, final dig site held hundreds of soldiers, lined up in a majestic and slightly eerie show of force: infantrymen, archers, even a few horses. I was surprised when Jia Jia told us that while Qin Shihuang created around 8,000 life-size soldiers to protect him in the afterlife, only 2,000 or so have been unearthed and reassembled since local farmers made the discovery in 1974 (and only a portion of those are on public display at any given time). Many, many decades of painstaking work remain. Admission to the site, should you choose to go on your own, is 150 yuan, or 120 during the winter off-season.\n\nI was able to do most of my exploration of Xian solo, though, thanks to the compactness of the city center. I recommend making a quick stop at the Bell and Drum Towers, which closely resemble each other and are both located in the heart of the city. Tickets to each will cost 35 yuan, or you can buy a combo ticket for 50 yuan. The pagoda-like structures, with their distinctive upward-tilting eaves, are quite regal and majestic, and beautifully illuminated during the evening. They were constructed within years of each other during the 14th century by the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty \u2014 the Bell Tower rang to mark the beginning the day; the Drum Tower , its end.\n\nAnother duo of complementary sights is the Giant Wild Goose and Small Wild Goose Pagodas, both south of the city walls. The larger of the two is one of Xian\u2019s most famous structures, a sandy-colored Tang dynasty pavilion constructed in 652 A.D. to house sutras and icons brought from India by the Buddhist monk Xuanzang. The seven-story pagoda occupies the spacious and peaceful grounds of Dacien Si (Mercy Temple), which costs 50 yuan to access.\n\nMeandering around the temple grounds on a chilly day, I saw men and women lighting incense and worshiping at Sakyamuni, the main hall of the monastery. From there I entered the pagoda (this requires a separate 20-yuan ticket) and climbed the nearly 250 wooden stairs leading to the top. Created to protect the 657 volumes of Buddhist scriptures Xuanzang brought back, the pagoda yields another benefit: the views from the top are excellent, if slightly hindered by smog.\n\n(Air quality is a problem throughout China, and asthmatics and those with delicate respiratory systems should take particular notice. The government is t esting measures to stem the problem in different cities, including Xian, which is experimenting with building-sized air purification towers.)\n\nTo the northwest is the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (built in 707, it\u2019s slightly younger), and while the pagoda itself is currently being restored, the area is worth visiting for a couple of reasons. The Studio of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting, in addition to traditional artwork, has a small museum dedicated to Mao Zedong that I found to be more honest and critical than I expected. It cites the \u201clost generation of the Cultural Revolution\u201d and the era\u2019s \u201cdisastrous blow on traditional Chinese culture.\u201d A friendly employee at the shop directed me to the spacious, modern Xian Museum (free admission), which has diverse array of installations: contemporary paintings from the Taklamakan Desert region, relics from the Tang and Sui Dynasties, and, in the basement, an exhibition detailing the history of Xian.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the city\u2019s ancient walls are an attraction in and of themselves. Accessible in different locations around the city, I found it easiest to enter by the main southern gate (Yongning), the most elaborate and ornate of the entrances. Tickets are 50 yuan, but I was able to score a half-off discount by showing my high-speed rail ticket from Chengdu. The ambitious can rent a bicycle on the parapets \u2014 45 yuan for three hours \u2014 and bike the approximately 8.5 miles around the entire wall. (Given the subfreezing temperatures and poor air quality, I decided to just walk the walls for a while. I wasn\u2019t disappointed \u2014 the views were good, and provided a nice vantage point of much of the surrounding area.)", "title": "Xian Offers Terracotta Warriors, Stunning Food and Plenty of Bargains", "authors": []}

The Whiffenpoofs possessed unparalleled resources, he reasoned, and he knew of female singers who wanted and deserved a spot in their ranks. The debate grew \u201cugly and personal,\u201d Mr. Code said, before the rest of his Whiffenpoofs class reached a unanimous conclusion: They would remain all male.\n\nThree decades later, that finally changed, when on Monday the Whiffenpoofs tapped Sofia Campoamor, a junior, as the first female member of the group since its founding in 1909. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that I ever expected, and I\u2019m so excited,\u201d Ms. Campoamor said.\n\nThe break with tradition immediately rippled across Yale\u2019s campus and alumni community.\n\n\u201cI cried when I heard,\u201d Mr. Code said. \u201cI am thrilled.

Boone must sort through the outfielders\u2019 roles, decide if Torres and Andujar are ready for the majors, and find depth beyond his top five starters. Any smart baseball person could make those calls, but as a first-time manager, Boone has subtler challenges.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk into our clubhouse, hopefully I\u2019m a part of what I believe is a winning culture \u2014 but also a culture where guys are at ease, where guys are allowed to be themselves, where when you walk into our room, it\u2019s not a stressful place,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where guys are at work and enjoy coming there to do their job.\u201d\n\nBoone mentioned his first day as a Yankee, after a trade from Cincinnati in 2003, when he met Joe Torre in the manager\u2019s office in Oakland. Torre had a presence, Boone said, a \u201csoothing nature\u201d and tone that made him comfortable with a new team. Torre\u2019s successor, Joe Girardi, was more intense and uptight.\n\nEven so, Girardi was an excellent manager \u2014 driven, prepared, caring \u2014 and he shepherded a young clubhouse into a new era.

I sat next to one of our critics, and we both chuckled throughout.

His dad and granddad were Navy enlisted men \u2014 it was what you did. He got an R.O.T.C. scholarship to the University of Colorado and became the first college graduate and military officer in his family. He was married with a child by the time he went to Vietnam in 1969 with a top-secret cryptography clearance.\n\nRon\u2019s wife, Jane, was his lifeline and his connection to the antiwar and youth movements exploding in the United States. She knew, more even than he could express, that Ron had strong moral misgivings about the war. He wrote her about holding a dying Vietnamese boy in his arms and how much it upset him. She sent Ron tapes with his son\u2019s first words along with thoughts and advice. She told him he might be a conscientious objector, or C.O. When his ship returned to San Diego in the summer of 1970, Jane met him at the dock wearing granny glasses and a madras dress and carrying the local underground newspaper announcing a meeting of the Concerned Officers Movement. \u201cYou have to go,\u201d she said. He did. By the end of the year, he prevailed in a precedent-setting case, McMahan v. Laird, and was honorably discharged as a C.O.\n\nPaul Rogers went to Notre Dame. He was the son of a disabled World War II veteran and the Army nurse who saved his life. He had good grades, was captain of his high school football team, won an R.O.T.C. scholarship and did what was expected. But then in 1970 Kent State and Jackson State happened. The Notre Dame students voted to close the school down: Students had been killed; the war raged; Vietnam became the curriculum for the entire student body. Paul joined 50 graduating R.O.T.C. cadets in signing a petition pledging that upon becoming commissioned officers they would do everything they could to end the war. When assigned to the crew of the aircraft carrier Constellation, he carried out that pledge.\n\nJohn Kent was a two-time all-American wrestler from the Naval Academy. He wanted to be an astronaut and became a jet pilot. But events kept pulling him in another direction. There was that blind date at Annapolis who argued with him all night about the Vietnam War. He thought it was a just war, but he came out on the short end of every argument.

He didn\u2019t learn much about the war, but he learned something else when his ship docked at the Subic Bay Naval Base. This was the largest American Navy installation in the Pacific, adjacent to the Philippine town of Olongapo. It was one of the most celebrated R&R destinations for military personnel in Vietnam, a so called fantasyland for adults. What he found instead was a nightmare of degradation, all in service to and fostered by the American military. You could throw coins into the sewage-filled river and see kids and desperate Filipino adults dive into the fetid water. And that was only the beginning. No thank you.\n\nOn his way to Miramar, Calif., for F-8 training en route to Vietnam for the second time, John went home on leave. It was November 1969 and one of the biggest antiwar demonstrations was gathering in Washington, D.C., near where he lived. His siblings were going, and he and his dad decided to follow. The power of hundreds of thousands of antiwar voices was immense, and the songs brought both of them to tears. Pete Seeger led the huge crowd in singing, over and over, John Lennon\u2019s line, \u201cAll we are saying, is give peace a chance.\u201d Between choruses Seeger would sing phrases like, \u201cAre you listening, Nixon?\u201d \u201cAre you listening, Pentagon?\u201d\n\nJohn was listening, and before they left the Mall he turned to his dad and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can go back to Vietnam.\u201d He didn\u2019t, and within a few months, along with other naval officers, he founded the San Diego chapter of the Concerned Officers Movement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJim Skelly grew up in an Irish working-class family within a strict Catholic tradition, which he rebelled against, leaving him with a hatred of arbitrary authority. He got into the University of Minnesota on an R.O.T.C. scholarship. By the time he graduated in 1967, he was already ambivalent about the growing war. He volunteered to work on an oil tanker with the Atlantic Fleet, even though he was increasingly disturbed by what he was reading and hearing about the war. Shortly after learning of Robert Kennedy\u2019s murder in June 1968, he wrote a letter saying he was opposed to the war and asking for a better way to serve his country. He never sent it.\n\nIn January 1970 Jim received orders to become part of the Military Assistance Command Vietnam in Saigon. He knew that if he went to Vietnam he might well come back a human wreck, drunk and dead at 40. Not sure what to do, he went to his predeployment training in San Diego and began searching. He found some literature from the Movement for a Democratic Military, an antiwar group, in a local head shop.\n\nWhen he showed up at the M.D.M. office, he met a San Diego police officer named John Paul Murray, then disguised as Jay King, an antiwar activist. They talked for a while and then \u201cJay King,\u201d playing his antiwar role, said, \u201cYou sound like a conscientious objector.\u201d Jim said, \u201cOh, O.K.,\u201d and within a few months had filed his application for C.O. and found the other men in the Concerned Officers Movement. He was the first of several of us to file a federal lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird seeking to be released from active duty as conscientious objectors.\n\nThe day John Huyler graduated from Princeton University in June 1967 and became an officer in the Navy, he knew that the Vietnam War was wrong and that he would refuse orders to go there. He had majored in philosophy, thought a lot about values and personal integrity, war and peace, and became a Quaker. His senior thesis was on civil disobedience: Thoreau, Gandhi and King. He had concluded that the war was wrong but thought that he could outwit the system. He thought the war would be over in the 18 months required to become a naval aviator. When it was not, he decided to become a flight instructor, avoiding the war for another 18 months. After those three years the war still was not over. When John received his final orders to a noncombatant squadron based in San Diego, he thought he had finally made it through.\n\nIn San Diego, John became active with the Concerned Officers Movement, where he met other officers who had declared themselves conscientious objectors, refused orders to Vietnam and stood trial when the Navy denied their claims. He watched a film called \u201cFaces,\u201d a 10-minute, silent, black-and-white documentary showing the faces of Vietnamese children during bombing raids, which turned his stomach. His thoughts had moved into his gut and he realized that if he was connected in any way to the terror in even one of those faces, he could no longer look himself in the mirror. The next Monday he told his commanding officer that he refused to fly because he was a conscientious objector. He was granted an honorable discharge on that basis.\n\nFrom all our different directions we came together in San Diego. We organized against the war and to stop the Constellation from returning to Vietnam. As officers and pilots, we could take advantage of tactics not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as John Huyler\u2019s flying the banner reading \u201cConstellation Stay Home for Peace\u201d frequently over San Diego, and making antiwar stickers appear everywhere onboard the Constellation, including in the captain\u2019s personal bathroom (which Paul Rogers to this day claims he had nothing to do with). We influenced public opinion through numerous public statements. We joined with thousands of others in San Diego and many, many more throughout the United States and around the world in resisting the war. We know we made a difference.\n\nWe went on with our lives. We became a college professor of peace studies, an environmental mediator, an accountant for Native American tribes, a union organizer, a successful entrepreneur and a revolutionary communist. We are all proud that we had the courage to stand up against injustice and an unjust war. Today, we continue to be a group of close friends with a powerful common experience who are still active and committed to peace and social justice.", "title": "Yes, There Were Antiwar Officers", "authors": ["John Huyler", "John Kent", "Will Kirkland", "Ron Mcmahan", "Paul Rogers", "James Skelly"]}
{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "On Twitter, he found his way, as most people in financial planning do sooner rather than later, to Michael Kitces. Mr. Kitces, who is 40 years old, is an industry octopus with 29 letters of credentials after his name who speaks at conferences, works as a partner at a financial planning firm, writes and researches in quantity, and starts companies here and there. Together, Mr. Moore and Mr. Kitces cooked up XY (as in Generations) to provide a community and infrastructure \u2014 including technology tools, investment resources and compliance assistance \u2014 for other advisers who wanted to work in this way.\n\nTo get this far, they\u2019ve sought out financial planners who could be content with a mere low-six-figure income. If 80 clients pay $150 a month, XY advisers can earn gross revenues of $144,000, though XY charges member financial planners $409 per month.\n\nMany traditional brokerage firms would fire people generating that amount of money. \u201cIt\u2019s literally failure, two or three times the median household income,\u201d Mr. Kitces said. \u201cOur income expectations in this industry are completely out of whack, and that was a big part of the opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most compelling part of the XY offering is what the founders make the advisers do or promise to customers. Those potential clients are often seeking to check off a number of questions or concerns before they sign up with someone.\n\nYou must be a fiduciary, which means you have to pledge to act in your clients\u2019 best interest at all times. Revenue can come only from client fees, not commissions. You have to be a certified financial planner to be listed in the network\u2019s consumer directory and must have no major marks on your disciplinary record. One big fine can mean eviction.\n\nThere is that requirement to offer a recurring billing option, which can include an upfront charge for getting a new client set up, with no investment minimum. Also, advisers have to be willing to work virtually if clients want to, which allows people with particular niches to find their clients wherever they may live. One member employs Christian principles in his practice, while another specializes in helping women who work in technology companies that have not yet gone public.\n\nPhoto\n\nPeople find their way to the profession and the network in a variety of ways. Anna Sergunina\u2019s family immigrated from Moldova, and her father worked as a truck driver while her mother cut people\u2019s hair and did their nails. They wanted her to be a doctor, but she said financial planning gave her the same chance to make a difference in people\u2019s lives, especially her peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always thought I\u2019d have to work with older people,\u201d said Ms. Sergunina, 34, who is based in Burlingame, Calif.\n\nThe median age of XY advisers is 38, and it\u2019s a refrain that many of them sound, having come from other planning firms or related industries where the easiest way to make a living is to chase older clients with the most money.\n\nXY encourages its members to find a niche among their peers instead. Jason Howell, 43, who works in Vienna, Va., considered politicians (he once ran for Congress), children of immigrants (his parents were born outside the United States) and others. He eventually found success helping many couples where one person is a business owner and the other works a 9-to-5 job.\n\nOthers seek niches in ways of thinking about the world. Inga Chira, 35, who has a doctorate in finance and is an assistant professor at California State University, Northridge, maintains a part-time practice with a focus on money and happiness.\n\nIt is reasonable to wonder if the practitioners are dabblers, as with any fledgling professional network filled with people in the first halves of their careers. Some won\u2019t make it in the industry, while others may go upmarket. And while no one has made a claim on XY\u2019s errors and omissions insurance yet, at least a bit of scandal tends to eventually find its way into most corners of the financial planning world.\n\nStill in a very short time, XY has grown to be more than twice the size of similar networks. Its closest cousin is probably the Garrett Planning Network. Its founder, Sheryl Garrett, is one of the great unsung heroes of American financial services, because she helped persuade many financial planners to charge by the hour.\n\nFinding so many new clients for hourly work does require a lot of effort, which doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone. \u201cThe majority of the financial services industry has always been chasing after customers with the ability to provide advisers with the most income for the least amount of labor,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Kitces and Mr. Moore, who was once a member of the Garrett Network, profess no animus for Ms. Garrett and her member planners. Some, like Ms. Sergunina, belong to both.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI wish there were 5,000 Garrett planners serving a whole bunch of markets that don\u2019t get served,\u201d said Mr. Kitces, who recently had Ms. Garrett as a guest on his podcast.\n\nThere are other options, too. Vanguard\u2019s Personal Advisor Services offers holistic financial planning for a 0.30 percent annual fee, based on a percentage of your assets. And the so-called roboadvisers, which once only ran your investments with their trading and rebalancing software, have added other services. Betterment recently introduced a charitable giving feature, while Wealthfront can now help you plan your housing purchase.\n\nBut if you want to meet a real live human, face to face, you no longer have to be rich to do so. Sure, you are probably smart enough to do it all yourself. But will you make the time? Will you keep emotions at bay that might cause you to make ill-advised investment moves?\n\nIf not, there has probably never been a better time to go shopping for a financial planner.", "title": "Yes, You Can Find a Financial Planner Even if You\u2019re Not Rich", "authors": ["Ron Lieber", "Your Money"]}

I contemplated going to see the movie again (I have seen in 6.3 times \u2014 once I was taking my kids to another movie and kept sneaking into \u201cGreatest Showman\u201d). There is an indelible magical component of \u201cGreatest Showman\u201d that makes you feel like hope is out there, that good people are out there, and that we can have joy and happiness \u2014even when we make mistakes. J. WATERS\n\nI\u2019m a 44-year-old male high school English teacher, and I have seen \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d eight times with my wife. First, it\u2019s about a circus \u2014 and circuses have always offered the masses a much-needed break from reality. There is also a happy ending for everyone.

I cannot get enough of the soundtrack. And the movie was touching. The moment on the rooftop with his daughters was beautiful. I think many parents can relate to that feeling of wanting to give your kids a world of opportunities that were maybe unavailable to you in some way. HALEY KASPRZYK\n\nThe music is uplifting and joyful in a way that I haven\u2019t heard in such a long time. The choreography, costuming and sets were beautiful to me. And, most important, the story of a man losing his way and coming home was something I needed in these difficult times. ASHLEY C. NICHOLS\n\nEverything. The songs, the lessons ... the fact that my children loved it. I hate paying for the movies and we\u2019ve seen it twice. We sing \u201cThis Is Me\u201d as a family when someone is feeling down. It\u2019s an amazing message and movie. STEPHANIE BASTEK\n\nThis weekend will be my third time seeing the film. Is the film an accurate biopic about Barnum? No. Was Barnum as great a humanitarian as Hugh Jackman is in the film? Most likely not. But we\u2019re judging him by today\u2019s times instead of the times in which he lived. Instead, they gave us memorable songs to express what the characters were feeling and actors who can say much with little or no dialogue.

But in fact there is something rather profound going on as you take that long, refreshing drink after a run or a hot day in the garden.\n\nAs you become dehydrated, there is less water in your blood, and neurons in your brain send out the word that it\u2019s time to look for water.\n\nThen, once you take a drink, you feel almost instantly satisfied. But if that is obvious, it is also mysterious. You aren\u2019t pouring water directly into your bloodstream, after all. It will take at least 10 or 15 minutes, maybe longer, for the water in your stomach to make its way into the blood. And yet somehow, the brain knows.\n\nSometimes that process isn\u2019t as straightforward as it should be: People with a syndrome called polydipsia feel excessive thirst and drink enormous quantities of water. That can be dangerous, because if the blood is diluted too much, a person can die \u2014 a victim of water intoxication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs neuroscientists ponder how and why we thirst, a group of researchers at the California Institute of Technology has shed light on one small corner of the problem. Interested in how the brain keeps track of what the body is drinking, they have identified a set of neurons that receive messages as thirsty mice gulp down water. Passed around in the brain\u2019s thirst centers, these messages seem to be behind the sensation of swift satisfaction that comes after a drink, and also suggest that it\u2019s not just what is drunk, but how it is slurped down, that affects the brain. If the circuits work the same way in people, it may be key to understanding the neuroscience of what happens as we feel thirsty.", "title": "You Get Thirsty and Drink.

But as a heterosexual female at an all-women\u2019s college, my dating life was nonexistent until I was introduced to Tinder and Bumble. Initially I hated the concept of dating apps. The upside to them was blind dates (yikes) and the downside was the opportunity to get rejected in three seconds or less by a potential match.\n\nBut as I began to create my dating profiles, choosing the most attractive pictures of me and my golden retriever, I started to have some fun. I hadn\u2019t yet warmed up to the idea of driving an hour or two to grab a drink with a stranger, but the conversations were light and the attention was wonderful. After hundreds of swipes left and right \u2014 and plenty of opening lines that received no response \u2014 I finally matched with a guy I was eager to meet.\n\nHe was a Virginia Tech student who seemed intelligent, witty and happened to be 6-foot-4 \u2014 tall enough for my highest heels. Conveniently, my best friend is also a student at Tech, so when I told her about this new guy, she immediately responded with \u201cCome to Blacksburg! You can meet up with him, and if he sucks, stay with me.\u201d So I drove two hours to meet a guy I\u2019d only been messaging for a week and a half. I\u2019d never heard the sound of his voice, or seen the way he walked or chewed his food. What would he think about my smile or the awkward snorting sound I make when I laugh too hard?\n\nI pulled into the parking lot of the Thai restaurant hoping that I didn\u2019t have pit stains and flaking mascara. When I saw him waiting for me, I almost did a double take \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t look like the guy in the pictures, but because he looked better. He was tall, blond, with green eyes and a smile wider and more welcoming than I\u2019d imagined. We had dinner and drinks, and several months later, we\u2019re still doing the same. Dating apps aren\u2019t for everyone, but they gave me the opportunity to meet someone I wasn\u2019t sure existed.\n\nI Found My First Date on an App\n\nCaleb Keyes, Otterbein University, Class of 2018\n\nIn high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded by a feeling of trepidation that if I tried to date someone and we broke up, it would be hard to see them around campus. A friend encouraged me to download Coffee Meets Bagel, which was described as a dating app for people who are easily overwhelmed.\n\nI got a date and she suggested we get ice cream, even though it was snowing outside.

In August, the resettlement agency created its Community Safety Initiative, which says that no gang member can be released to a sponsor without a judge\u2019s order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last killings that authorities have linked to MS-13 came on April 11, when four young Latino men were found hacked to death with machetes in the woods behind a Central Islip soccer field. Two of the victims had been students at Bellport High School, where teachers had noted an uptick in the presence of MS-13.\n\nThat was where the plaintiff in the lawsuit was a freshman last year. Identified as L.V.M. because he is a minor, he was suspended from Bellport High School less than two weeks after the killings after being accused of flashing gang signs in the hallway with another student, according to the complaint.\n\nThree months later, L.V.M. was arrested by immigration agents conducting a sweep they called \u201cOperation Matador,\u201d which has arrested 205 young adults for MS-13 connections on Long Island.\n\n\u201cHe is not a gang member, he doesn\u2019t support MS-13, he fled gang violence in his home country,\u201d his lawyer, Paige Austin, said. L.V.M. said he was raising both middle fingers to respond to another student, the lawsuit said.\n\nAfter his arrest, agents brought L.V.M. to Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center in Virginia, a secure facility. Nearly six weeks later, he was transferred to a lower level of supervision at Children\u2019s Village in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.\n\nAt L.V.M.\u2019s Dec. 18 hearing, the government presented additional evidence outlining his gang involvement. According to his lawyers, the government said a video existed of him flashing gang signs (which they have been unable to see), he wore clothing that distinguished him as a gang member, he had been identified by the Suffolk County Police Department as belonging to the gang, and he had gang tattoos.\n\nHis mother, Esmeralda Mejia de Galindo, said she was surprised to hear all of these allegations \u2014 especially that last detail. \u201cMy son doesn\u2019t have a tattoo,\u201d she said in an interview through an interpreter on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m the mom, I would know.\u201d\n\nMs. Meija, 36, fled El Salvador with L.V.M. and his younger brother in May 2016 because they were targeted by gang members, according to the lawsuit.

He was hooked.\n\nAt the Joyce the two will perform a new duet, \u201cDen of Dreams,\u201d on a program also featuring Mr. Brown\u2019s \u201cCome Ye\u201d (2002), inspired by Nina Simone, and an excerpt from his 1995 \u201cLessons\u201d set to a speech by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Honoring another close relationship will be the company premiere of \u201cDancing Spirit,\u201d created in 2009 for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater as a homage to its artistic director at the time \u2014 and a mentor to Mr. Brown \u2014 Judith Jamison.

Instead, on Feb. 8, the prolific composer Nico Muhly, fresh off the debut of his new opera \u201cMarnie\u201d in London (coming to the Metropolitan Opera next season), will oversee and perform his own reimagined versions of some of Mr. Glass\u2019s more obscure works.\n\nAn obsessive admirer of Mr. Glass since high school and the composer\u2019s studio assistant in college, Mr. Muhly has crafted his own artistic voice that imbues Mr. Glass\u2019s minimalist abstraction with a rhapsodic self-expression. Mr. Muhly will be joined by a world-class clique of collaborators including composer and vocalist Caroline Shaw, violist Nadia Sirota and, perhaps most intriguingly, the great Laurie Anderson.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI have been contemplating quitting my job for the past six months or so. I\u2019m finally certain about the decision, but I can\u2019t seem to find the right time to tell my boss. It didn\u2019t seem right just after the holiday break. Then I came down with the flu and missed several days, putting additional stress on my team. Plus the company is in the middle of kicking off several big new projects, and my role would be integral. Our company is small, and I have a close relationship with everyone, my boss included. I don\u2019t think anyone suspects that I am even thinking about leaving. I have had a couple of amazing years here and expected to stay longer. But I\u2019m burned out by long hours for not enough money and don\u2019t find creative satisfaction in the work any more.

For example, one experiment asked 1,000 people to look at a simple data set and draw conclusions about a skin cream\u2019s effectiveness. Not surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans were about equally good at calculating the math and determining how well it worked.\n\nBut when the experiment offered the very same data set and said it referred to the effectiveness of a gun control measure, Democrats and Republicans alike went to pieces. In one version, the numbers showed that a gun control measure worked \u2014 and Republicans kept flubbing the math. In another version, the gun control measure was ineffective, and this time the Democrats couldn\u2019t manage the calculations.\n\nThe evidence on these biases is complex, studies sometimes haven\u2019t replicated well, and I don\u2019t want to exhibit confirmation bias in my warnings of confirmation bias. Researchers also caution that it\u2019s too glib to say we are all locked in our echo chambers, for most Americans still are regularly challenged by dissonant information.\n\nBut what does seem clear is that rigid ideological beliefs impair our cognitive functions. For many years, Philip Tetlock of the University of Pennsylvania has been running experiments measuring the ability of thousands of people to make sound predictions.\n\nThe best forecasters, Tetlock finds, are not experts or even intelligence officials with classified information, not liberals and not conservatives, but rather those instinctively empirical, nonideological and willing to change their minds quite nimbly.

When we stay within our own tribe, talking mostly to each other, it\u2019s difficult to woo other tribes to achieve our aims.\n\nThe ideological blinders may worsen because of our tendency to seek out like-minded people. A 2014 Pew survey found that half of consistent conservatives and 35 percent of consistent liberals say \u201cit\u2019s important to me to live in a place where most people share my political views.\u201d\n\nIt should be possible both to believe deeply in the rightness of one\u2019s own cause and to hear out the other side.

Yu Darvish, perhaps the most prominent pitcher left on the frigid open market, has agreed to a six-year, $126 million deal to join the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe agreement, first reported by Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, was confirmed by a baseball official who was granted anonymity because Darvish must pass a physical for the deal to be official. It is the richest contract given to any free agent this off-season, both in years and dollars, surpassing outfielder Lorenzo Cain\u2019s five-year, $80 million deal with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nDarvish, 31, is a four-time All-Star who beat the Cubs in the National League Championship Series last fall as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

He said he was thinking too much instead of just skating. Still wearing his costume, he immediately went downstairs to the training rink and rehearsed his jumps.\n\nBut things only got worse in the singles competition.\n\nAsked how he would plan for Saturday\u2019s skate, Chen seemed at a loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been in this position before, so I don\u2019t know exactly what to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHanyu had not competed since late October.\n\nHe sustained ligament damage in his right ankle on Nov. 9 while rehearsing a quad lutz before a competition in Japan. It is the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps being performed.\n\nHe missed about two months of training on the ice; in the meantime, he rehearsed his jumps on the floor at his training center in Toronto.\n\nHe has only been practicing his triple axels for about three weeks and his quad jumps for two weeks. But his coach, Brian Orser, a two-time Olympic silver medalist for Canada in the 1980s, cautioned reporters not to underestimate Hanyu\u2019s talent and resolve. Hanyu has said that he does not want to simply be a champion skater, he wants to be a great skater.\n\n\u201cI know many people have been waiting for me to skate, and I want to the show them the performance that makes them feel it was worth the wait,\u201d Hanyu said at a news conference the other day.

He\u2019s everything. He\u2019s the skater, he\u2019s the jumper, but quintessentially, he\u2019s the performer. He seems to have the superpower to take all the pressure, all the expectations and all the lights and all the cameras, and somehow he\u2019s able to use it as a competitor.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the free skate played out:\n\nGermany\u2019s Paul Fentz Does Game of Thrones Cosplay\n\nPaul Fentz of Germany had a heavily themed Game of Thrones routine. He skated to the dramatic music from the television show\u2019s soundtrack, and was dressed in a shirt designed to look like armor. He wore one gold glove, perhaps reminding some viewers of Jaime Lannister, who has a metal hand. But the judges did not seem to agree that Winter is coming, and put him in third place of the three skaters who have gone.\n\nJapan\u2019s Keiji Tanaka Leads Early; Nathan Chen Up Next\n\nWith the six lesser lights of the 24 competitors having skated, Keiji Tanaka of Japan is the early leader, helped by a quad Salchow at the top of his program. The second group of six will include Nathan Chen of the United States, who disappointed badly in his short program, but has a daring five-quad program to try to make up ground.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo Quads Gives Bychenko the Lead\n\nAlexei Bychenko of Israel, the first skater of the second group, gave a strong performance that moved him into the lead. Bychenko, skating to music from the opera Pagliacci, hit both his quads and fell to his knees with joy at the end of the performance.\n\nPhoto\n\nNathan Chen Gets Aggressive, Goes for Six Quads\n\nNathan Chen, who bombed his short program and stood in only 17th place, hoped to make up ground with a daring five quad performance. But he did not land five quads. He threw in one more and landed six.\n\nChen, 18, performed a quad Lutz, flip combination, flip, toe loop combination, toe loop and Salchow. The quad toe loop-triple toe loop combo scored a huge 17.63 points by itself. Chen also did well on the more subjective judging elements, getting over 9 for performance. He takes a big lead over the other early skaters, by a full 40 points.\n\nIt was a redemptive and audaciously ambitious performance. Chen became the first Olympian to land five quadruple jumps cleanly in a routine and actually attempted six, but put his hands to the ice on the quad flip. His score of 297.35 could put him in medal contention if the leaders struggle later.\n\nBrendan Kerry Invokes Pink Floyd\n\nBrendan Kerry of Australia has had some of the more intriguing musical choices of the event. In the short program he skated to an eerie cover of \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World.\u201d For the free skate he chose a Pink Floyd medley, including \u201cShine on You Crazy Diamond\u201d and \u201cMoney.\u201d But his performance wasn\u2019t quite up to snuff and he bailed out of his quads. That concluded the second group of six skaters. Twelve to go. Chen still leads by 40 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nKeegan Messing Puts on a Show\n\nThe Olympics are at their heart, a sports competition, but no one has had more fun here than Keegan Messing of Canada, who entertained the crowd with a Charlie Chaplin routine on Saturday after skating to Singin\u2019 in the Rain on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is unapologetic about being a showman as much as a competitor. \u201cI just feel like I can bring the crowd in; it makes my skating so much more fun for me,\u201d he said. Messing also hit two quads and moved into third place.\n\nNathan Chen Made a \u201cGame-Time Decision\u201d to Try 6 Quads\n\nLeader Nathan Chen spoke after his amazing program:\n\n\u201cHaving such a rough short program allowed me to just forget about expectations and just allow myself to really enjoy myself,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI think six quads was almost a game-time decision, I knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cAs much as I tried to deny it, I felt the pressure a lot before the short program, especially thinking about scores and placement and all that. And that was completely out of my control. That just tightened me up and made me really cautious on the ice.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nVincent Zhou Nearly Matches Nathan Chen\n\nVincent Zhou, 17, exceeded expectations in his short program, placing 12th. And he rolled out an ambitious five-quad free skate. And like his countryman Nathan Chen, he delivered.\n\nIn skating\u2019s complicated scoring system, Zhou was credited with four quadruple jumps, three of them landed cleanly. He put his hand to the ice on a quad flip. And his attempt to become the first Olympic skater to land two quad Lutzes \u2014 the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps being performed \u2014 came up short. His second Lutz was judged to have been under-rotated. Still, his score for the long program was a lifetime best of 192.16 points.\n\nHis technical score was only 7 off Chen\u2019s and he moved into second place overall, 21 points down. Zhou is definitely one to watch for 2022.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdam Rippon Skates a Clean Program, but No Quads\n\nAdam Rippon, the man with the killer abs, was the final American to skate. A program without quads would make it difficult to finish high, but he wheeled out all his showmanship, including birdlike motions while skating to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cArrival of the Birds.\u201d And he landed all those triples.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRippon skated with his accustomed elegance, but the jumping prowess of Nathan Chen and Vincent Zhou illustrated the gulf between his artistry and the bold athleticism needed to score highly under today\u2019s scoring system.\n\nWith six more to skate, the American men can finish no lower than 7th, 8th and 10th. This is the fourth time in the last five Olympics that all three men have made the top 10. The last time was 2010, when Evan Lysacek won the gold medal, Johnny Weir finished sixth and Jeremy Abbott took ninth.\n\nDmitri Aliev Struggles\n\nDmitri Aliev, the 18-year-old Russian, was the first of the final six to skate and probably the least likely winner, with only two quads in his program. He wound up falling as well and can only place third, though that\u2019s not likely.\n\nJin Boyang Passes Nathan Chen for First Place\n\nJin Boyang of China was fourth after the short program and planned a four-quad program set to \u201cThe Planets\u201d and the Cantina Theme and other music from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Jin delivered an almost clean routine, marred by one fall. His free skate score was lower than Nathan Chen\u2019s, but Jin had a 21-point lead over Chen after the short program. It adds up to a new leader by less than a point. Chen is back in second.\n\nPatrick Chan Can\u2019t Make Up Ground\n\nPatrick Chan of Canada was sixth after the short program. His routine, set to Jeff Buckley\u2019s version of \u201cHallelujah,\u201d had two quads, both right at the top. He landed the first and stepped out of the second one slightly. He also put a hand down on a later jump and had an unprovoked stumble. An always dignified skater, the 27-year-old Chan stood only in sixth. Next up, the leader and gold medal favorite, Yuzuru Hanyu.\n\nPhoto\n\nYuzuru Hanyu Leads After Strong Routine\n\nYuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the world\u2019s most famous Winnie the Pooh enthusiast, had the gold medal for the taking, with the lead and a four-quad performance planned. He nailed the first three, but stumbled on the fourth, a planned quad-single-triple combination. It might have been enough for the gold, but Hanyu threw in one more unplanned quad for good measure. One more small stumble came on a triple, but Hanyu laid down a strong performance that will make him hard to catch. Winnie the Pooh dolls rained down from the audience in the aftermath.\n\nHanyu took over first place. His free skate score was 6 points lower than Chen\u2019s but combined with the short program he claimed a 20-point lead.\n\nPhoto\n\nJavier Fernandez in 2nd Place After Strong Routine\n\nJavier Fernandez of Spain was fourth four years ago, but he put himself in position to get a medal this time. After a strong second in the short program, he delivered in his free skate to Man of La Mancha, completing two of his three planned quads. The last skater will be Shoma Uno of Japan, with the current medal positions Hanyu-Fernandez-Jin. The American Nathan Chen has slipped to fourth place.\n\nShoma Uno Passes Fernandez for Silver\n\nIt all came down to Shoma Uno, who could get a medal and maybe even the gold if he nailed his four-quad program set to Turandot.

Nudes of old people, men and women alike, play a crucial role in this exhibition \u2014 as markers of the body in evolution, and as test cases for the social meanings of desire and disgust. Ms. Lassnig, a hero of Viennese painting who died in 2014 at 94, appears here in the 1975 self-portrait \u201cButterfly,\u201d her breasts drooping, her arms gaunt, her mouth pursed.\n\nPhoto\n\nA more recent nude self-portrait on show is \u201cCentered\u201d (2002), by the American figurative painter Joan Semmel \u2014 whose unabashed paintings of herself unclothed influenced a generation of feminist successors. Ms. Semmel, who turned 70 the year she painted the work, sits with her right leg bent and her arm wrapped around her knee. She holds a camera in front of her face: a marker of authorship, but also a mask.\n\nCompared with the paintings, the photographs of nude older people in the exhibition display less benevolence. A late suite of images by Mr. Coplans, a British artist (and co-founder of the magazine Artforum) who photographed his body with merciless objectivity, divides his nude, reclining body across four starkly cropped prints. His distended belly, flabby thighs and skin speckled by decades of exposure to the sun appear in a cool, even light, as if he were already on a mortuary slab.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there are also more tender photographs, and not all the nudes are self-portraits: Juergen Teller photographs a then-64-year-old Helen Mirren in the bath, her nipples faintly visible beneath the soapy water, her face steely and seductively absolute. The image is a confident sally against double standards of sex appeal: If Denzel Washington can still draw looks in his early 60s, why can\u2019t she?\n\nPaintings of nude old people are relatively rare in art history, not only because of a cult of youth and beauty. More concretely, humans now live decades longer than they did just a couple of centuries ago. (When the Belvedere was built in the early 18th century, the life expectancy for European males was under 30.) In the catalog for \u201cAging Pride,\u201d Ms. Fellner notes that the ranks of the elderly are set to expand 37.5 percent in Austria over the next 12 years alone. Low birthrates from Spain to Slovakia, combined with increasing life spans, will see Europe\u2019s work force shrink nearly 12 percent by 2060: a phenomenon with not only worrisome economic consequences but political ones, too.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Loneliness is a risk \u2014 though changing work patterns and isolating technologies have seen a surge in loneliness among the young \u2014 and long-term relationships pose hazards of their own. Mr. Op de Beeck\u2019s grave video \u201cCoffee\u201d (1999) shows an older couple in an overlit cafe, she staring into the distance, he slumping in his chair, bored, absent.\n\nIncreasing life spans and improving medical technologies have also introduced a growing danger in old age: that of dementia, of the body outlasting the brain. In a revealing series of black-and-white portraits by the Vienna-based photographer Regina H\u00fcgli, people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease show expressions of delight, confusion, bemusement and utter vacancy.\n\nBut old age can also be a third act of life, permitting new identities and greater social independence. It need not entail a loss of sexual desire \u2014 western literature bulges with dirty old men, and women of a certain age, too, have the right to desire.\n\nOne of the delights of \u201cAging Pride\u201d is a short video by the Austrian artist Carola Dertnig, who interviewed her grandmother, then 86, about a dream she had the night before: she had fantasized that she was in a forest, locked in the arms of \u201ca hunk.\u201d She is embarrassed to have such desires at her age, but only a little.\n\n\u201cSuch a nice fellow I picked up in my dream,\u201d the grandmother says wistfully, before the telltale strains of Barry White\u2019s \u201cLove\u2019s Theme\u201d play.\n\n\u201cYouth\u2019s a stuff will not endure,\u201d sings the downhearted fool in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cTwelfth Night.\u201d To grow old, though, is not only a chronological fact but also an inevitability of fading powers and sagging integument. To grow old is a social phenomenon, one we have the power to make better or worse if we want to; and Europeans, facing a stark demographic future, should probably get to work.\n\nNo art in \u201cAging Pride\u201d speaks more eloquently to our collective power to reimagine old age than a clip from the German choreographer Pina Bausch\u2019s \u201cKontakthof\u201d \u2014 her 1978 masterpiece of lonely-hearts on the dance floor, which she created for her company of dancers in Wuppertal, Germany, but later restaged with volunteers over 65. The older dancers, wearing the same tight suits and slinky silk dresses that Bausch\u2019s regular troupe had worn, go through the ritual preening they learned over decades; they get lucky or get humiliated, and come back for more.

Part of the movie\u2019s emotional and visual appeal lies in the fact that Wakanda has never been colonized.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWakanda is a kind of black utopia in our fight against colonialism and imperial control of black land and black people by white people,\u201d said Deirdre Hollman, a founder of the annual Black Comic Book Festival at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. \u201cTo the black imagination, that means everything. In a comic book, it is a reality, and through a major motion picture, it\u2019s even more tangibly and artistically a reality that we can explore for ourselves. There\u2019s so much power that\u2019s drawn from the notion that there was a community, a nation that resisted colonization and infiltration and subjugation.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Compared with President Trump\u2019s disparagement of Haiti and African nations, he said, \u201cYou have Wakanda as a place of Afro-futurism, of what African nations can be or what they could have been and still be had colonialism not taken place.\u201d (Mr. Joseph\u2019s campaign, which raised more than $40,000 to take children from the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem to the film, has led to more than 70 similar efforts.)\n\nThe Black Panther\u2019s regal alter ego, Prince T\u2019Challa, is a draw as well, said Jonathan Gray, author of the forthcoming \u201cIllustrating the Race: Representing Blackness in American Comics.\u201d He explained: \u201cNow there you have every black boy\u2019s fantasy. He is richer than Bill Gates, smarter than Elon Musk, better looking than Denzel.\u201d And with vibranium, \u201che is the hereditary ruler of the richest nation on Earth. The movie is about wish fulfillment. When you see Bruce Wayne, this dashing billionaire, where is the black version of that? You got T\u2019Challa.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is as much an alternative to our contemporary racial discourse as it is a throwback, not only a desire for what could have been but also a nostalgia for what we once had. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that this movie appears precisely in a moment in which our politics seems inescapable,\u201d Mr. Gray said, adding later that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of the Obama era have been undermined.\n\nFor Marc Bernardin, an author of the comic book \u201cGenius\u201d and host of the podcast \u201cFatman on Batman\u201d with the director Kevin Smith, the movie taps into \u201cthe cultural longing for what Obama was, the time in which you didn\u2019t check your phone every day hoping the world wasn\u2019t on fire again. A time where devaluation of young black life wasn\u2019t as stark and awful as it feels like it is right now.\u201d\n\nSimply going to the movie can be interpreted as a small gesture of protest and a grand expression of cultural pride.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBlack Panther\u201d has already become a kind of shared language. \u201cLast week I was at the mall when another black dude passed by me,\u201d Mr. Bernardin said. \u201cWe gave each other a nod, and he said, \u2018Black Panther\u2019s\u2019 in a month, yo.\u2019 That was his version of \u2018what\u2019s up,\u2019 his way of marking of time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to fans wearing custom-made Black Panther costumes and African-inspired haute couture to the premiere last month, African-American civic groups and others are buying out movie theaters so African-American children can experience the film with one another.\n\nIn Oakland, Calif., LaDawn James Williams originally intended to fly to New York to see it with her college friends from Howard University. Instead she plans to host a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d screening for her local chapter of Jack and Jill of America. She, her husband, and their 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son will watch it with more than 90 other African-American families in a private viewing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to take the mask off,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really subtle, but we\u2019re going to get certain things about the movie and its language that only we know.

But \u201cBlack Panther\u201d also arrives at a time when studios have started to respond to growing pressure to make their big-budget movies more inclusive, driven in part by the recent #OscarsSoWhite movement. And with audiences increasingly inclined to stay home and watch Netflix, producing movies featuring lead characters with different skin colors, genders and sexualities is proving to be good business.\n\nPhoto\n\nAttendance at theaters in North America, the world\u2019s largest movie market, dropped 6 percent in 2017, hitting a 22-year low. At the same time, studios are more reliant than ever on ticket sales. Their home-entertainment businesses \u2014 negatively impacted by the rise of streaming services \u2014 are collapsing to an alarming degree. The major studios reported an 18 percent drop in holiday home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, compared to a year earlier.\n\n\u201cHollywood can no longer afford to take any moviegoer for granted,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cThat is causing them to look at underserved groups where there is pent-up demand, and the black audience is one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDisney, which spent roughly $350 million to make and market \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d remains cautious about declaring global victory, noting that the film will not arrive in crucial markets like China and Japan until next month. The movie, focused on one of Marvel\u2019s lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\n\nBut even if \u201cBlack Panther\u201d stumbles in some countries, it will easily become the top-grossing film by a black director and with a largely black cast in Hollywood history, surpassing \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which took in $214 million worldwide in 2015, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d directed by Ryan Coogler, will also break box office records in North America, where ticket sales between Friday and Monday are expected to total about $165 million, an astounding start for a film released outside the holiday and summer corridors.\n\nThe record-holder for a February release is \u201cDeadpool,\u201d which arrived to an adjusted $159 million in 2016 and itself challenged conventional wisdom, proving that an R-rated superhero movie could strike a broad chord. \u201cDeadpool\u201d went on to collect an adjusted $819 million for 20th Century Fox, which will release a sequel in May.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother test will come on March 16, when 20th Century Fox releases \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d a $17 million romantic comedy centered on a gay teenager. Studios have long insisted that multiplex crowds will not support same-sex love stories, dismissing \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d which took in $231 million in 2005 for Focus Features, after adjusting for inflation, as an Oscar-boosted exception to the rule. Fox is the first major studio to take a chance on a movie anchored by a gay character in memory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done living in a world where I don\u2019t get to be who I am,\u201d Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the \u201cLove, Simon\u201d trailer. \u201cI deserve a great love story.\u201d\n\nStudio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument \u2014 a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics \u2014 that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films \u201cCatwoman\u201d in 2004 and \u201cElektra\u201d in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like \u201cDreamgirls\u201d in 2007 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMadea\u201d series.\n\nSome film executives even cite \u201cGet Out\u201d as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.\n\nAs studios embrace a wider variety of stories with more diverse casts, they have had to confront pockets of racism, sexism and homophobia. Internet trolls tried to use Facebook to organize a campaign to falsely drag down scores for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d on the influential review site Rotten Tomatoes. Some men had a conniption when a Texas theater organized all-women screenings for \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d An Alabama theater banned Disney\u2019s live-action \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d over a gay sidekick character, creating a media frenzy.\n\nPhoto\n\nDisney\u2019s willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: \u201cWe can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples\u2019 behavior \u2014 get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan F.

Full of youthful angst, I spent many sleepless nights wondering whether there was something wrong with me; none of my friends had similar interests.

When humans arose in Africa 300,000 years ago, recent research shows, they had a mixture of light and dark variants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHumans first arrived in Europe from Africa about 45,000 years ago. Western hunter-gatherers migrated from the Near East much later, mostly replacing the Europeans already there.\n\nResearchers studying a Spanish 7,000-year-old fossil first discovered that at least some Western hunter-gatherers were most likely dark-skinned and blue eyed. Later research confirmed this finding.\n\nUntil now, no one knew the affinity of Cheddar Man. The new research shows that he was part of the Western hunter-gatherer population.\n\n\u201cBefore, we didn\u2019t know what population lived in Britain, because we didn\u2019t have a genome from there,\u201d Dr. Diekmann said.\n\nStudying a more recent skeleton, the researchers found evidence for the arrival of farmers in England, who descended from people in the Near East. These people carried some variants for lighter skin.\n\nMore Reporting on Human Origins\n\nResearchers have found genetic variants for light skin in Sweden and elsewhere farther east dating to 7,700 years ago. Later waves of people from the Near East and Central Asia also brought light-skin variants with them.

The soundtrack album to \u201cFifty Shades Freed,\u201d the finale of the soft-core BDSM romance trilogy based on the novels by E.L.

First, for some reason, a pair of long crossing entries stuck out to me \u2014 PAROLE HEARING and BAILED OUT. That inspired the silly readout under the headline today, and just struck me as extra clever. It couldn\u2019t be my own conscience, which is as innocent as a spring lamb, and certainly couldn\u2019t be because the long, extremely slow-moving arm of the law has been on my blameless mind these days. Nevertheless, I appreciated it.\n\nThe other, less particular attribute today was the nice mix of clues from different vernacular eras. Today\u2019s puzzle had a couple of very recent terms that I was challenged by, and another couple of long entries that were anachronisms to me, equally hard to figure. Most of the good Times puzzles use modern slang, terms from antiquity, and everything in between; the best do it so skillfully that solvers of all linguistic interests can find a clue or two for their genre of choice, as well as pick up some terms. That\u2019s one of the things that keeps this sport alive!\n\nTricky Clues\n\n1A: So, there\u2019s a movie called the FIFTH ESTATE, from 2013, that\u2019s about WikiLeaks, basically, although the inference is that the term refers to everything informational and digital. That was the only reference I could come up with for this clue without help (from the fifth estate, I guess one could say). But a quick Google search finds a Canadian investigative journalism show like \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d sort of, by the same name; it dates from 1975. Then a little more perspective: The term was used in England in 1932 to refer to radio. As long as we in newspapering can just stay fourth it\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to get on the medal podium.\n\n17A: For \u201cDirt spreader,\u201d I thought literally, and tried to figure out what farming or construction implement could fit in here.

I also have a bunch of movies that I\u2019ve written over the years that nobody seems to want because they aren\u2019t about superheroes or exploding machinery. I\u2019m a person who likes to work. I knew that HBO was looking for a family drama. So I sat down to write one. But I didn\u2019t want it to be just another family drama about a family dealing with what families deal with. Certainly a multiethnic family made it more interesting for me as a writer. It also just seemed like it would give us more interesting stories than sibling rivalry or somebody gets a mammogram. You know, your usual family TV show tropes. [Laughs] The sort of mystical-mysterious element just sort of happened.\n\nWere your story lines affected by the political moment?\n\nI was working with the writers when Donald Trump was elected president, and we started to see the show as a kind of prism through which we could look at all these different characters\u2019 multiethnic, multigenerational viewpoints living in Trump\u2019s America. How do you deal with that? How do you make sense of that?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy Portland?\n\nPortland has this reputation for being so incredibly progressive \u2014 and it is. However, it also has a pretty sketchy history in terms of racism. For a place that\u2019s very progressive, it\u2019s still predominantly Caucasian. So there\u2019s an interesting dichotomy there, because it\u2019s a very progressive town and one of the greatest places to live. At the same time, it isn\u2019t really what it aspires to be.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat research did you do for the characters?\n\nI knew that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to write a lot of the characters in this show from a place of personal experience. So when we \u2014 myself and my producing partner, Peter Macdissi \u2014 were putting the writers\u2019 room together, we made sure that we had a couple of African-Americans, a guy of Asian descent, a Lebanese Muslim guy and a Palestinian gay guy. We have people who are adoptive parents. Growing up in my white privilege, I have no reason to know these things. So it\u2019s not so much research on my part, it\u2019s having these great writers that I work with who bring their own experiences to the table.\n\nLike Greg, you recently turned 60. Were you as unhappy about the milestone as he appears to be?\n\nWell it\u2019s hard to age, to get older, to realize \u201cWow, my body isn\u2019t working like it used to.\u201d It\u2019s hard to go, \u201cHow many years do I have left?\u201d I\u2019m not sure I have any empirical data to back this up, but I think it\u2019s harder for men than women. I think women are more in touch with their emotions, with the cycle of living. Whereas men are conditioned to believe that we\u2019re invincible and will remain that way forever \u2014 and we\u2019re stupid enough to believe that. [Laughs] I feel like I\u2019ve had about five midlife crises. I think the first one was when I was about 35. As someone who struggled with depression and anxiety [my] whole life, I feel like you got to pull yourself out of there, you got to find a way. I wanted Greg to start off at the bottom. I wanted to see him work his way out of that.\n\nYou also feature a Muslim family where the parents are comfortable with their child being transgender. Is there a story behind this?\n\nPhoto\n\nPeter said, \u201cIf this is going to be a show about America, we need a Muslim family to be a part of this tapestry.\u201d People are so terrified of, don\u2019t understand, project all kinds of weird stuff onto Muslim characters \u2014 especially the way they\u2019ve been depicted in the mainstream media. They\u2019re never complex or nuanced. I did some research and, of course, there are trans Muslim kids. We\u2019re so conditioned to think of Muslim families as so conservative that there\u2019s no room for any kind of out-of-the-box expression for one\u2019s identity \u2014 and that\u2019s just not the case.\n\nYour favorite childhood movie \u2014 \u201cMy Six Loves\u201d \u2014 is about a family of adopted children. Are you paying tribute?\n\nIt\u2019s not my favorite movie. It\u2019s the first movie I ever went to see. Debbie Reynolds plays an actress who ends up adopting six adorable hillbilly children. And she realizes: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to be an actress. I want to be a mother. That\u2019s what\u2019s really fulfilling.\u201d [Laughs] One of the running gags is that one of the kids is mesmerized by flushing the toilet, and he keeps doing it. I just remember that was the first time I sat in a big darkened theater, looked up on a screen and saw this story unfold. I haven\u2019t seen it since I was 5 or 6. I\u2019m sure it would be a big letdown from what exists in my memory.\n\nIn 2000, you won an Oscar for writing \u201cAmerican Beauty.\u201d I read that you dressed it in a pink fur coat. Because?\n\n[Laughs] My identity, a lot of it, is based in feeling like the outsider. So when I won an Oscar, it was terrifying. When I brought it home, I put it on a shelf, and it looked so pretentious. So I bought a pink fur Barbie coat and put it on [the Oscar] and somehow it made it O.K. for me to have it in my house. But then I got over that and took it off. Now I have a shelf in my office where all the statuaries are.

{"date": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "Ashley is the screen on which society\u2019s racism is projected. Kristen, who talks openly about slut-shaming and menstruation in class, is becoming the show\u2019s avatar for feminism. She\u2019s had the bad luck of contracting chlamydia from her very first sexual encounter, and when Ashley takes her to Planned Parenthood, Kristen beats up an anti-abortion protester who calls her a \u201cdumb whore.\u201d Both sisters get arrested, but while the cops goof around with Kristen, who finds the whole experience exhilarating, a female officer humiliates Ashley, forcing her to remove her wig, questioning her about her expensive purse and cracking that the tampon she finds inside it explains Ashley\u2019s bad mood.\n\nThe upshot? Ashley embraces her natural hair. Sure, why not?\n\nApart from my certainty that even the nastiest female cop wouldn\u2019t have made that tampon joke, what\u2019s irritating about this story line is that it\u2019s just as didactic as Greg\u2019s lecture. It doesn\u2019t give us any insight into who Ashley and Kristen are as individuals. From the clunkiness of its plot points to the laundry list of racial and gender issues it neatly checks off, the episode reduces one character to the archetypal oppressed black woman and the other to the archetypal entitled white girl.\n\nAudrey\u2019s story line, which casts her as a true believer in the power of empathy, is just as frustrating. We discover what her Empathy Initiative actually does, sort of, when the principal of Kristen\u2019s high school seeks her advice on what to do about a \u201cNorthern European Heritage Society\u201d that some students have recently organized. Many students are, understandably, angry about what they see as a school-sanctioned neo-Nazi organization. So, Audrey brings the factions together and, thanks to the magic of \u201cI feel\u201d statements, quickly gets the white kids to back down. Well, that was easy.\n\nThen there\u2019s poor Duc, who\u2019s stuck with this episode\u2019s worst subplot. In a painfully expository exchange (\u201cFairfax Press loves the latest draft of your book, not to mention your Twitter and Instagram followings\u201d), we learn that he\u2019s visiting Vancouver to meet with a potential publisher. Fairfax, which also happens to have published Greg\u2019s groundbreaking book, offers him a deal, with the caveat that he has to ask his father to write the foreword. This scene apparently exists to reinforce what was already apparent from the premiere: Duc is living in Greg\u2019s shadow. Got it.\n\nMore ridiculous is the sequence in which Duc, who\u2019s supposed to be celibate, beds a series of women in quick succession. These erotic-thriller shots are interspersed with flashbacks to his childhood in Vietnam, where a young Duc is forced to watch a prostitute, presumably his mother, sleep with clients. (At first, because there\u2019s no dialogue and the editing is so ambiguous, I thought the whole sequence was an abstinence-induced hallucination.) By the end of the Vancouver trip, this compulsively healthy \u201cmotivational architect\u201d is swimming in empty beer bottles, junk food wrappers and shame. I guess this means he\u2019s a secret sex addict?", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 2: Empathy and Fear", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-25 00:00:00", "text": "Whether it\u2019s chemical, environmental or both, Greg\u2019s affliction appears to be a potent cocktail of depression about the state of the world and anxiety about its future. He says as much at the ethics conference, scoffing at a colleague\u2019s insistence that the most logical response to global turmoil is optimism. \u201cNo wonder Dante populated the first circle of hell with philosophers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnxiety is a completely appropriate response to today\u2019s reality.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201canxiety\u201d reverberates through this episode, the same way empathy and fear kept popping up last week. Ramon confesses to Farid that he hasn\u2019t stopped smoking weed because it soothes his nerves. He and Henry don\u2019t have much else to do in this hour, besides serving as foils for Ramon\u2019s high-achieving older siblings \u2014 who are, by all appearances, driven primarily by their various anxieties.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Henry politely suggests that following some ambitious life plan doesn\u2019t always work out the way you intend. A new character, Carmen (played by Fernanda Andrade), an \u201cintuitive\u201d who seems destined to play a role in both Duc\u2019s and Ramon\u2019s lives (she balks at Duc\u2019s use of the word \u201cpsychic\u201d), heartily agrees. It turns out that Ramon\u2019s game, which he says is about \u201chow we perceive impossibility,\u201d whatever that means, isn\u2019t exactly goal oriented, either.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s obvious that the \u201cHere and Now\u201d creator, Alan Ball, reserves much of his empathy (that word again!) for characters like Ramon, Henry and Ashley\u2019s husband, Malcolm (Joe Williamson), who aren\u2019t always laboring toward some inane accomplishment. In a purely expositional side story, Duc scolds Malcolm for squandering his opportunity to win a bike race, and Malcolm replies that he\u2019d rather be happy than victorious. I appreciate that obnoxiously competitive people exist in the world, but three episodes in, I wish the show would give us a reason to care about Duc.\n\nInstead, it is painting Farid as a sort of secular saint. In a scene in which he bares his scarred back, the psychiatrist repeats worries he\u2019s already expressed about Navid\u2019s religious commitment and fluid gender expression: \u201cI just want to keep you safe, that\u2019s all,\u201d he tells his son. \u201cWe already have targets on our backs.\u201d As Farid explains to a clerk at Cannabliss, he suffers from \u201creligious anxiety\u201d and can only bear to attend a Muslim wedding after sharing a joint with (why not?) a homeless woman. The tension between Farid and his American-born family is rich with potential. But it is surrounded by so much narrative clutter that the show barely has time to dig into it.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashley is stuck with this week\u2019s \u201chuh?\u201d subplot. Just as Kristen is informing Ashley\u2019s model buddy that he gave her chlamydia (and that she still wouldn\u2019t mind hooking up with him again), his girlfriend appears. When Ashley hears what happened, she lures him into her studio for a photo shoot, where she dresses him in a doughnut-print onesie, threatens to report him to the police and forces him to confess on camera that he is \u201cguilty of statutory rape.\u201d Later, she emails Kristen the video. Subject line: \u201cVENGEANCE.\u201d\n\nI guess this is supposed to be a righteous, girl-power moment, but it just made me pity the model. Yes, he cheated on his girlfriend (assuming they\u2019re monogamous) and unknowingly passed chlamydia to a minor. Yes, the age of consent in Oregon is 18. But Kristen is 17, in a country where most states allow teens to consent at 16 or 17, and she was wearing a horse mask when they met and never took it off, before or during sex. Is humiliating this happy-go-lucky idiot and calling him a rapist \u2014 in that way implying that Kristen is a rape victim \u2014 really a sane response? I got the feeling that these scenes were supposed to demonstrate her loyalty to her sister, but Ashley comes out of them looking slightly unhinged.\n\nIt\u2019s story lines like these that crowd out the show\u2019s more promising aspects, from Farid\u2019s family drama to Ramon\u2019s video game to Greg\u2019s hunger to feel connected with the world again. Last week, I complained that \u201cHere and Now\u201d was spelling out what each character represents to the exclusion of exploring who they all are. That continuing issue aside, Ball is introducing too many subplots and invoking too many huge concepts (empathy, fear, anxiety, religious devotion, optimism, nihilism, relativism, hedonism, sexism, racism) to give any element the attention it deserves. At this point, an episode that delves deep into just a few characters or lingers at one event would be a relief. The only way to fix this show is to slow it down.", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 3: High Anxiety", "authors": ["Judy Berman", "Here"]}

That much is implied in the first moments of the series premiere, as a barrage of apparently unrelated images flashes across the screen, followed by a shot of a woman and a little boy playing on the beach. The camera quivers. The sound skips like an old record. The woman gasps, removes her sunglasses, calls out the name \u201cRamon\u201d and scratches four long, deep gashes into her own face with her fingernails. She says something in a language that isn\u2019t English. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve entered some new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d lodge.\n\nBut, phew, it\u2019s nothing more than a dream. Or, at least, it seems that way when Ramon Bayer-Boatwright (Daniel Zovatto), a college student who designs video games, awakens in his Portland, Ore., apartment. That same morning, he summons the courage to take his flirting to the next level with Henry Bergen (Andy Bean), a bearded barista who might be Ramon\u2019s soul mate and who is surprisingly eager to accompany him to his father\u2019s 60th birthday party that evening.\n\nIt\u2019s a good day. The only thing that seems off about it is that Ramon keeps seeing the number \u201c11:11.\u201d First it\u2019s a clock in the coffee shop. Then it\u2019s the dashboard of his elliptical, at the gym, which freezes 11 minutes and 11 seconds into his workout. After a few of these scenes, it occurred to me that the four gashes from his dream also resembled four ones. Ramon tells Henry about a website that claims that people who are \u201ccontacted\u201d by the number 11:11 have \u201csome positive mission to accomplish.\u201d They laugh it off in bed, joking that their hookup is that mission.\n\nStill, the extent to which this show is going to be weird doesn\u2019t become clear until the final ten minutes of the episode. At the party, as his depressive philosophy professor father, Greg Boatwright (Tim Robbins), delivers an uncomfortably pessimistic speech, Ramon has a vision. There are four candles on top of a bookshelf, and their flames seem to stretch into, yes, four long, straight, blazing lines.

But the early indications are that the show is going to try to have it both ways \u2014 to keep Carrie medicated, while putting her in a situation so dire that her behavior still unnerves those around her. (There will, however, be changes in how she obtains her drugs, and which ones she takes, according to this interview with Ms. Danes.)\n\nThis echoes her current conflicted situation. Having prevented the assassination of the winning presidential candidate Elizabeth Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) by right-wing radicals in Season 6, only to be blindsided when Keane trampled on civil rights by ordering mass arrests (including that of Saul), Carrie is now secretly working to expose Keane\u2019s lies.\n\nFans will be happy that this involves the resurfacing of Carrie\u2019s spycraft, and it\u2019s a pleasure in the season premiere to watch her pulling her gear out of hiding, or duck into a hotel room and put on a disguise \u2014 it\u2019s like she\u2019s getting back into her own skin.\n\nOn the downside, it also means that she\u2019s back to willfully endangering the people in her life, a trait that could be seen as a complexity of character but has always registered as an unpleasant distraction. Once again it\u2019s up to Carrie\u2019s sister, Maggie (Amy Hargreaves, in one of television\u2019s more thankless roles), to angrily lecture her. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast government conspiracy and you\u2019re the only one who can bring it to light, I know,\u201d Maggie says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my meds,\u201d Carrie wails in response to her sister\u2019s accusations. She\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing \u2014 including putting her young niece at risk as part of her investigations \u2014 because the country is in free-fall, she says. And there\u2019s a poignancy to her plea that accords with the current mood of much of that country, an inchoate sense that events you can\u2019t control call for some sort of radical action.\n\nThe implicit promise of \u201cHomeland,\u201d of course, is that over the course of 12 weeks Carrie will indeed bring the vast government conspiracy to light, and restore justice and order to boot.

Some schools opt to make the drills feel partially authentic \u2014 an approach several schools backed off from this week out of fear they would stir already heightened anxieties.\n\nAt Dysart High School in El Mirage, Ariz., the principal took extra steps to make sure students knew its previously scheduled drill on Thursday was, in fact, just a drill.

The Tennessean newspaper, citing public records, reported that the pair took some trips in the company of other city officials, but that nine trips, including one to Athens, Greece, were taken by Ms. Barry and Mr. Forrest alone.\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, at the request of Nashville District Attorney General Glenn R. Funk, is looking into whether Ms. Barry or Mr. Forrest broke any laws by misusing public funds. The City Council, generally supportive of the mayor\u2019s agenda, voted on Tuesday to create a special committee to investigate the trips.\n\nMs. Barry has said that she did nothing wrong. A lawyer for Mr. Forrest declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nThis week, The Tennessean also reported that Ms. Barry had recommended Mr. Forrest\u2019s adult daughter, Macy Amos, for an entry-level job that Ms. Amos later landed in the city law department.\n\nSean Braisted, the mayor\u2019s spokesman, acknowledged that Ms. Barry recommended Ms. Amos to the city law director sometime after she took office. But Mr. Braisted insisted that the recommendation, and Ms. Amos\u2019s first day of work, all predated the affair, which he said started sometime in the spring of 2016.\n\n\u201cMs. Amos was recommended by many people inside and outside of Metro Government,\u201d Mr. Braisted said in a prepared statement. \u201cShe began the interview process with the Department of Law in December of 2014. She was offered a position in 2015 by Metro Law Director Jon Cooper and began her job in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe scandal has dealt an unexpected jolt to a political narrative here of a mayor well-matched with her city\u2019s burgeoning self-conception as a sophisticated but down-home place, where honky-tonks, high-rises and, increasingly, a pronounced streak of social liberalism all coexist.\n\nAs a City Council member, Ms. Barry had been an outspoken champion of abortion rights and same-sex marriage. In a September 2015 runoff election, she defeated David Fox, a former hedge-fund manager. Mr. Fox tacked to Ms. Barry\u2019s right, but his strategy seemed to show that the culture-war dog did not hunt in the new Nashville. Voters shrugged off his campaign\u2019s assertion, in radio advertisements, that Ms. Barry and her husband, Bruce Barry, an American Civil Liberties Union member, had opposed prayer before high school football games.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn interviews this week, a number of liberals and conservatives said they did not wish to judge Ms. Barry\u2019s decisions in her private life. But many of them said the questions about the money and the trips concerned them.\n\n\u201cWith two consenting adults, I understand that those things happen,\u201d said James R.

It does not matter, Ms. Blaine argued, whether a person who engages in such an affair is a male or a female.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s a consensual relationship, that\u2019s still an abuse of power,\u201d Ms. Blaine said. Referring to the #MeToo movement, she added: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge movement going on right now.\u201d\n\nA Vanderbilt University poll last year showed that Ms. Barry enjoyed a 72 percent overall approval rate. Her successes have included a popular youth employment program, Opportunity Now, and the landing of a Major League Soccer team.\n\nBut some African-American leaders have criticized her handling of budget problems at Nashville\u2019s public hospital. And Black Lives Matter activists have criticized her for the city\u2019s handling of a police shooting of a 31-year-old black man, in which the officer was not prosecuted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis week, an activist group called Community Oversight Now raised the possibility that high-ranking police officers may have wielded knowledge of the affair to influence the mayor\u2019s decisions on police reform issues. (In a statement, Mr. Braisted said that Ms. Barry took her positions on such issues \u201cin the best interest of the entire community.\u201d)\n\nThe group\u2019s suspicions may be little more than a conspiracy theory, but they show how difficult it may be for Ms. Barry to maintain what have been deep stores of good will among Nashvillians. It was a bond cemented by tragedy in July, when Ms. Barry announced that her only child, Max Barry, 22, had died of a drug overdose.\n\nHis visitation was attended by thousands of locals.\n\nToday, the centerpiece of Ms. Barry\u2019s public agenda may be most imperiled: a multibillion-dollar transit plan that would introduce a light-rail system to the congested city. Voters could consider the plan in a referendum as early as May 1.\n\nOpponents have argued that it is too costly, and a poor match for Nashville\u2019s infrastructure needs.\n\nUntil now, the opposition has largely refrained from tying the affair to the transit issue. But on Monday, John Cooper, an at-large councilman who has criticized the transit plan and other big projects backed by the mayor, said he had received numerous calls and emails from constituents expressing \u201cgreat concerns\u201d about Ms. Barry\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be too cool to take that seriously,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cNashville is kind of proud of being a cool city.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.\n\nAfter the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last week, The Times heard from many teenagers in the United States who have grown up in an era of school gun violence. We wondered how this climate also affects teachers, the people we trust to protect our children.\n\nIn comments on our coverage of the Florida massacre, teachers and other educators explained what it\u2019s like to teach amid lockdown drills and fear of attacks.\n\nHere is a selection of their comments, which have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\n\u2018We Cannot Force Them to Get Counseling\u2019\n\nI have been a public high school teacher for 20-plus years. Schools know who these kids are, but there is very little we can do about them. We can recommend counseling, talk to the family, dole out suspensions and even expel them if it\u2019s bad enough. But we cannot force them to get counseling, we cannot force their families to admit to the degree of illness, and we cannot stop them from getting guns and coming to school to kill us. The only sane solution is limiting their access to weapons. \u2014 \u201cMOMofTWOGIRLS\u201d from New York\n\n\u2018Our System Is Reactive, Not Proactive\u2019\n\nI wince at the mention of \u201cautism.\u201d I\u2019m a developmental specialist, and work with kids who have sensory issues and spectrum disorders day in and day out. Yes, brain and behavioral health are woefully underfunded and unaddressed. Yes, our entire society needs to be forced to shift to a trauma-informed perspective rather than a trauma-inducing orientation. But no, the problem here was not the youth, but his ability to purchase a gun. Our system is reactive, not proactive. \u2014 \u201cNnaiden\u201d from Montana\n\n\u2018The Shooter Always Has the Advantage\u2019\n\nI am a professor at a community college in Florida, two hours north of Fort Lauderdale. My eyes were welling with tears during my 8 a.m. class, as I felt overcome by my feelings of grief and helplessness over Parkland. My classroom is on the ground floor, a step away from two entrances to the building, and has TWO doors. I am finding it increasingly difficult to keep my fear of being shot dead as I teach in the BACK of my mind. Many people, including legislators in Tallahassee, have suggested that arming myself (and the students on campus) is the answer. It is NOT. No matter how many weapons I have on my person, and no matter how well trained I am to use them, the shooter always has the advantage: the element of surprise. I\u2019ll be first one shot, and I\u2019ll be dead before I ever fire a round. God help my students: While they scramble for their guns amid shock, adrenaline and terror, the shooter is firing away with an AR and clip after clip of ammo. \u2014 Connie from Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Can Our 5-Year-Olds Run Fast Enough?\u2019\n\nAfter Sandy Hook, when our nation\u2019s politicians failed to advocate for and enforce stricter gun regulations, I felt despair and dread. I am a kindergarten teacher who now has to practice \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d drills with my young charges. Across the hall are three-year-olds whose teachers quietly sit with them in a corner of their room while listening on walkie-talkies for the \u201call clear.\u201d We have a code that will be broadcast should a shooter enter our school, so we won\u2019t scare the children. But I can tell you, while we teachers are sitting during the drill with our students, praising their quiet patience, we are thinking about where we would take them, where we could hide them should a monster with an automatic weapon enter our school. Can our five-year-olds run fast enough? How many three-year-olds can my fellow teachers carry to escape danger? Those who blame the mentally ill for these murders are neglecting the real cause of the mass casualties. A mentally ill intruder is scary. A mentally ill intruder with an automatic weapon is deadly. \u2014 Vicki Smith from Sandy, Utah\n\n\u2018We All Suffer Each Massacre\u2019\n\nI was a young teacher when Columbine happened. Years later, I graded Advanced Placement exams with a teacher who had been there that day; he was the only faculty member still there at the 10-year mark. He asked us to ask him nothing. Ten years later it was still unspeakable. My school now does A.L.I.C.E. training (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) twice a year in addition to standard lockdown drills three times a year. We had one already scheduled for the day after the Pulse massacre, and the administration decided to keep it in place knowing it would be raw. It was. I had students break down crying. One told the class that there has not been a day since Sandy Hook that she has not paused before leaving her car and thought, \u201cIs this the day I die in school?\u201d We know the numerical chances, but that is not how the human heart and psyche work. Our school spaces have become so contaminated by the fear of death that no matter how statistically rare, each shooting feels as if it happens to us. On the day of Sandy Hook, I stood huddled with other teachers in our art room crying as the horror broke over us; each image more awful than the last. We all suffer each massacre. \u2014 \u201cAhBrightWings\u201d from Cleveland\n\n\u2018Do Not Deflect the Blame Onto Us\u2019\n\nAt this point, all of this sudden attention toward what SCHOOLS should be doing to keep their students safe is analogous to blaming a woman for being raped because she was wearing \u201crevealing\u201d clothing. I teach CHILDREN in a SCHOOL that is supposed to be inviting, safe and dedicated to producing the next generation of engaged citizens. I refuse to carry ANY weapons to my school. It goes against everything a SCHOOL stands for. The root of the epidemic of school mass shootings lies not on the school side or the victims. Do not deflect the blame onto us. Do not believe for a single moment that the security Kabuki being bantered about will help. It\u2019s the GUNS. It\u2019s always the GUNS. The GUNS are everywhere. Ultimately, we have decided at Sandy Hook that our right to own guns trumps my students\u2019 rights to being alive. \u2014 Alan Foo from Philadelphia\n\n\u2018I Have a Child of My Own Who Needs Me\u2019\n\nI have been a teacher for 18 years. When I started this career, it never occurred to me that one day I would have to seriously consider whether I would give my own life to protect my students. I have a child of my own who needs me. I\u2019m not a police officer, firefighter, soldier or member of another profession for which these questions must come with the territory. \u2014 \u201cM\u201d from New York\n\n\u2018Every Time We Conducted This Drill, My Stomach Hurt\u2019", "title": "\u2018Is This the Day I Die?\u2019: Teachers React to the Florida School Shooting", "authors": []}

The Pentagon\u2019s version of the rifle, renamed the M16 and capable of automatic or burst fire, was first distributed to American troops in Vietnam, and versions of the gun that do not fire automatically became enormously popular for civilian use.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "Foster, who is 53, was charged with criminal trespass and criminal mischief, conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. At his bond hearing in Cavalier, N.D., he learned that he faced a maximum sentence of more than 26 years. When prosecutors requested that his bail be set at $100,000, Foster asked for a chance to speak. \u201cYour Honor,\u201d he said, \u201cone of the main reasons for this action is to appear here and see justice done for our children, and to protect the air and land and water that they will require to survive. So it\u2019s very important for me to be here in this courtroom, and I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. I\u2019m \u2014 it\u2019s terrifying \u2014 but I am not going to miss it.\u201d\n\nJudge Laurie Fontaine set his bail at $75,000.\n\nI first met Foster on a pitch-black evening in November 2016, a week after the presidential election, in the community room of a progressive church in Hood River, Ore. Foster and the four others accused of pipeline sabotage, all of whom had been released on bail, had been dubbed the Valve Turners, and this was their first public appearance since their coordinated action. They stood in a self-conscious line before their audience, unsure how to begin.\n\nOne by one, they recounted their actions on the morning of Oct. 11. Ken Ward, 61, a longtime environmental activist from New England, closed a shut-off valve on Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline near Mount Vernon, Wash. Leonard Higgins, 66, a soft-spoken Unitarian and retired state-government employee from Corvallis, Ore., closed a shut-off valve on the Enbridge Express Pipeline near Coal Banks Landing, Mont. Emily Johnston, 51, an editor and a poet, and Annette Klapstein, 65, a retired attorney for the Puyallup tribe, traveled together from Seattle to Leonard, Minn., and turned the shut-off valves on a pair of pipelines owned by Enbridge. The five men and women said little about themselves, dwelling instead on what they saw as the existential threat of climate change and the inadequacy of available legal remedies. \u201cI\u2019m not courageous or brave,\u201d Johnston told the small crowd. \u201cI\u2019m just more afraid of climate change than I am of prison.\u201d\n\nFoster, dressed in what I would learn was his standard outfit \u2014 Hawaiian shirt, jeans and running shoes \u2014 stood at one end of the row, bouncing on his toes. Slight and agile, he can seem much younger than his years, almost impish. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d he said, grinning.\n\nHis companions laughed tolerantly; they had heard this before. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, because you\u2019ve got the biggest charges,\u201d Johnston teased.\n\nThe Valve Turners are, for the most part, quiet people. They wear sensible shoes, and several attend church regularly. Most are parents, and one is a grandparent. All are white, all are college-educated and none are truly poor. While all are deeply concerned about climate change, none are immediately threatened by its worst effects: no one\u2019s home has flooded, and no one\u2019s health has been seriously damaged by heat waves or failed harvests or northward-creeping tropical diseases. All say that it is this relative safety \u2014 and the relative advantages of age, race, education and wealth \u2014 that makes them feel they have a particular responsibility, as climate activists, to push the boundaries of civil disobedience.\n\nMost Americans treat climate change, as the saying goes, seriously but not literally. We accept the science, we worry about its forecasts. We tell ourselves that the effects won\u2019t be as bad as predicted, or that they will happen elsewhere, a long time from now. We tell ourselves that someone else will get serious about fixing the problem very soon. We find some way to blur the causal line between our individual actions and their cumulative effects. This is, in many ways, an eminently reasonable reaction, because it allows us to continue with our daily lives and to tend to the political emergencies of the moment \u2014 which are, after all, always numerous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Valve Turners take climate change both very seriously and very literally. They are among those whom Ward calls the \u201cclimate freakout people\u201d \u2014 the scant 2 to 3 percent of Americans who, when asked by Gallup to name the most important problem facing the country today, mention pollution or the environment. They can quote from the work of scientists like James Hansen, the former director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, who was an author of a 2008 paper concluding that in order to preserve a planet \u201csimilar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted,\u201d the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere needs to be reduced to 350 parts per million or less. (They can also tell you that the current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which was about 385 parts per million when Hansen and his team published their paper, is now above 407 \u2014 higher than it has been in at least 800,000 years.) For a variety of reasons, they have found themselves unable to look away from the scientific consensus that global business as usual is likely to cause, and may well already be causing, unspeakable suffering. With what their admirers call moral clarity and their detractors \u2014 including some of their loved ones \u2014 call tunnel vision, they\u2019ve decided that their own business as usual must end.\n\nFoster may have made up his mind as early as high school, when he starred in a production of \u201cThe Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,\u201d the 1970 play about Thoreau\u2019s refusal to pay a poll tax because of his opposition to the Mexican-American War. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d the play\u2019s Thoreau tells the local constable. \u201cWhat the government of this country is doing turns my stomach! And if I keep my mouth shut, I\u2019m a criminal. To my Conscience. To my God. To Society. And to you, Sam Staples.\u201d\n\nThe modern environmental movement was born around the time Thoreau adjourned to his cabin on Walden Pond in 1845, but the climate movement \u2014 the part of the environmental movement concerned primarily with reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and easing the effects of climate change \u2014 is barely 10 years old.\n\nFor decades, the predictions of climate scientists inspired little citizen action: In North America, at least, the possible consequences of climate change were too abstract, too distant in time and space, to galvanize a popular movement. But as international negotiations kept stalling, proposed legislation repeatedly staggered toward failure and scientific forecasts worsened, frustration grew among grass-roots environmentalists. In 2008, seven Middlebury College graduates and a Middlebury scholar in residence, Bill McKibben \u2014 whose 1989 book, \u201cThe End of Nature,\u201d was among the first to take on climate change for a mass audience \u2014 founded the advocacy group 350.org, named after the study led by James Hansen. The work of McKibben and his students helped define the goal of the nascent climate movement: reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million or less. In the process, they also defined their opponents. Those who were adding the most carbon dioxide to the atmosphere were the movement\u2019s biggest enemies, and at the head of that list was the fossil-fuel industry.\n\nClimate-movement leaders organized mass demonstrations \u2014 in front of the White House, at international climate conferences and elsewhere \u2014 but almost from the start, a handful of activists began executing smaller-scale, more confrontational actions, hoping to both rouse complacent sympathizers and shame major emitters. In Utah in 2008, an economics student named Tim DeChristopher, who had grown alarmed about the increasing likelihood of climate scientists\u2019 worst-case scenarios, posed as a bidder at an auction for public-lands drilling rights, placing fraudulent bids for leases on 22,500 acres of land. DeChristopher was convicted of two felonies, sentenced to two years in jail and fined $10,000.\n\nLike DeChristopher, Ken Ward, a former deputy director and chief operating officer of Greenpeace U.S.A., had become convinced that such actions were essential provocations. \u201cThis is the kind of disruption that\u2019s necessary to change politics,\u201d he says.\n\nNearly six feet tall, Ward has craggy features, thick, dark eyebrows and a professorial air belied by his customary sturdy workwear. In the fall of 2012, he and other activists paid a series of surreptitious visits to Brayton Point, a port on the southeastern fringe of Massachusetts and the home of an aging coal-fired power plant that was, at the time, the state\u2019s largest carbon-dioxide emitter. Posing as bird-watchers, they surveyed the harbor with binoculars.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, Ward and a young Quaker sailmaker named Jay O\u2019Hara piloted a 32-foot lobster boat into the Brayton Point ship channel, dropping anchor in the path of a freighter carrying a load of West Virginia coal to the power station. When the freighter neared, Ward and O\u2019Hara alerted the police and the ship\u2019s crew that they were carrying out a peaceful protest. (\u201cThis coal is coming from the United States,\u201d a crew member responded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with that?\u201d) It took the rest of the day to move the boat, which Ward and O\u2019Hara had named the Henry David T. The pair were charged with three misdemeanors and a felony.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut on the morning the trial was scheduled to begin, the district attorney, Sam Sutter, announced that he had decided not to pursue criminal charges. \u201cClimate change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced,\u201d he told reporters gathered in the courthouse plaza. Sutter added that he would join a climate march later that month. (That year, Sutter ran for mayor of the working-class city of Fall River, Mass., and won.) By then, the owners of the Brayton Point station had decided to close it, citing low energy prices and the costs of retrofitting the facility to meet current environmental standards.\n\nWard moved from Boston to a small town outside Portland, Ore., and began thinking about how he might continue what he and O\u2019Hara started. Quietly, he began to discuss possibilities with core members of the climate movement in Seattle \u2014 conversations that would eventually include Michael Foster.\n\nFoster, a family therapist, longtime environmentalist and father of two, had been living in Seattle for two decades, and he\u2019d recently become active in raising awareness about climate change. But his road to the beet fields of North Dakota began years earlier near Houston, now the southernmost endpoint of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Foster was 3, his father was shot and killed on the street in Laredo, Tex. His mother, who left the family a few months earlier, lost custody of her three children to Foster\u2019s paternal grandparents. Foster and his siblings were raised in a Houston suburb, Deer Park; his mother remarried, moved to central Texas and maintained an affectionate but somewhat distant relationship with her children. (Not until Foster was in his 20s did she reveal her suspicion that his father, a junior-college professor, had been having an affair with a female student and was shot by a rival.)\n\nDespite the upheaval of his early years, Foster remembers his childhood as a happy one. His paternal grandfather worked for the Shell oil refinery whose smokestacks still punctuate the Houston skyline, and his grandparents were able to raise Foster and his siblings in relative comfort.\n\nFoster\u2019s grandmother died of cancer when he was in eighth grade, and he responded to the loss, in part, with a tent-revival religious conversion, becoming a Baptist. Foster believed that his future lay in the ministry, and he eagerly anticipated the return of the traveling preacher who had drawn him into the church. But as he sat with other believers in his high school auditorium, watching his mentor prowl the same stage where Foster had pretended to be Thoreau, he saw only artifice. \u201cHe was promoting his television show, he was asking for money,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI\u2019d learned something about performance, and I could see this was a performance.\u201d He walked out of the auditorium, and out of the church, with a lifelong horror of hypocrisy.\n\nFoster first encountered the notion of climate change when his high school debate team was assigned to research energy independence. In Texas in the 1970s, support for increased domestic oil production was practically a requirement for residency, but the team had to argue both sides of the issue, so they studied the prospects for energy sources at home and abroad. One day, an upperclassman gave Foster an interesting tip: At Exxon, where some students\u2019 parents worked, company scientists had considered the effects of carbon-dioxide emissions on the climate and concluded that humanity would soon have to wean itself off fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cIt was just this goofy, weird piece of information,\u201d Foster remembers. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even figure out how to use it \u2014 was it an argument for energy independence, or against it?\u201d In 2015, when news broke that Exxon scientists had indeed studied the causes and effects of climate change for decades, Foster would remember how he and his fellow debaters failed to understand that the industry on which their families depended might also be upending their world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFoster studied theater at the University of Houston and found work performing Shakespeare in local schools. Theater led him to Louisville, Ky., where he returned to school for a degree in counseling, hoping to channel his love for children and the outdoors into a career as a wilderness therapist. After graduation he moved to the Pacific Northwest, where he worked for a succession of outdoor education programs. He also reconnected with his college girlfriend, who was working in Seattle, and in 1999, they married.\n\nThey soon had two children. Foster took enthusiastically to fatherhood; the violent death of his own father had given him an early lesson in the uncertainty of life, and he delighted in providing his family with the sense of security he had lost. \u201cMy friends started complaining that I wouldn\u2019t spend time with them because I insisted on being home for bedtime,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just so happy \u2014 ridiculously happy.\u201d\n\nBut Foster was increasingly troubled by one particular threat to his family. In high school, he regarded the heating of the planet by humans as a goofy rumor, but he\u2019d since come to see it as a credible, even pressing, concern. During the summer of 1988, when he was 23, he turned on the television just as Hansen was testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on global warming. \u201cIt is already happening now,\u201d Hansen said at the hearing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThat\u2019s it, Foster remembers thinking. Now Congress knows. Now it\u2019s going to be fixed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t fixed, of course. Through the 2000s, Foster worked as a therapist and an outdoor educator, finding solace in the connections he forged between kids and the rest of the living world. But he knew that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was increasing, and he knew that its heaviest consequences \u2014 more extreme droughts, floods, fires and storms \u2014 would be borne by his children\u2019s generation and those that came after it.\n\nHe felt compelled to do more, and in the summer of 2012, at the suggestion of a friend, he traveled to San Francisco for climate-change activism training run by Al Gore. When he returned home, he adapted Gore\u2019s famous PowerPoint presentation for younger audiences, adding stories about kids who planted trees, built their own wind turbines and sued the United States government over its inaction on climate change.\n\nSoon Foster was talking about climate change to hundreds of students every month. He worked with a group of kids who were suing the state of Washington over its climate policy. In 2013, he and Emily Johnston helped found 350Seattle.org, which became part of an intensifying campaign against the expansion of fossil-fuel infrastructure in the Pacific Northwest, successfully opposing the construction of several new coal and oil export terminals in Washington and Oregon. In May and June 2015 in Seattle, Foster, Johnston and hundreds of other activists tried to prevent the departure of Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s offshore oil rig, the Polar Pioneer, by forming chains of kayaks and canoes; the following month, Foster joined another boat blockade, in Portland, that tried to stop a Shell icebreaker from leaving for the Arctic. Though both vessels eventually proceeded north, Shell officials were reportedly surprised by the strength of the opposition and the coverage it garnered. In September, citing the disappointing results of its exploration, the company abandoned its Arctic drilling operations. For Foster, it was a revelation: He had put his body in the way of the polluters, and the polluters had turned back.\n\nIn the late summer of 2016, an acquaintance invited Foster to a meeting with Ward and a small group of other activists but warned Foster that his very attendance could make him an accessory to a felony. Foster didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHow lovely!\u201d he remembers saying. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting!\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 9, 2016, Ward left for northwestern Washington, Higgins for Montana, Klapstein and Johnston for Minnesota and Foster for North Dakota. They agreed that their actions would be nonviolent and that they would willingly accept the consequences in court. All five have faced or are facing trials in the states where their actions took place, and in each, they have sought to use the \u201cnecessity defense\u201d \u2014 to argue that they broke the law because they had exhausted all legal means to reduce or eliminate a clear and present danger, namely the threat of climate change. The necessity defense, traditionally applied to crimes committed to head off immediate physical threats, has been permitted only rarely in civil-disobedience cases, and it has almost never succeeded. But for the Valve Turners, its articulation is a deliberate extension of their campaign, a way to publicly express the urgency they feel. \u201cIt\u2019s both practical and political,\u201d says Lauren Regan, the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center in Eugene, Ore., and the lead attorney in Ward\u2019s case. \u201cTalking about this as a necessity \u2014 that really pushes the conversation in a direction the movement wants it to go.\u201d\n\nThe Valve Turners see their actions as complementary to the rest of the climate movement, as adding an offense to a movement that has so far played mostly defense \u2014 as it did during the mass protests against the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and early 2017, which were led by the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes. Foster says: \u201cI\u2019d participated in all these different protests, but how much of the poison had I actually stopped? That I had a chance to take a major action against the existing flow \u2014 God, finally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Valve Turners\u2019 tactics are not popular within the environmental movement as a whole and remain controversial even within the climate movement. While the national leadership of 350.org offered its support to the Valve Turners after their arrests, the response from mainstream environmental groups was subdued; for some, the shut-offs were reminiscent of the anonymous vandalism carried out by groups like Earth First! and the Earth Liberation Front beginning in the 1980s, which enabled opponents to demonize environmentalists as domestic terrorists.\n\nDeChristopher, who went on to study divinity at Harvard, has worked with several of the Valve Turners through the New England-based Climate Disobedience Center, which provides strategic support to climate activists practicing civil disobedience. He says their willingness to assume responsibility, and to publicly explain their actions, distinguishes their strategy from that of anonymous saboteurs. \u201cIf you do something and then run away, that gives your opponents a huge opportunity to come in and say, \u2018Let me tell you who these people are and why we should go after them,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cIf you stand your ground and tell your story, that puts a face on it, and it can have an entirely different effect.\u201d\n\nThis theory was tested when Ward, whose case was the first to go to trial, appeared in court in the small city of Mount Vernon, in far northwestern Washington State, on a cold, bright January morning last year. The judge, Michael Rickert, did not allow Ward to use a necessity defense, ruling that Ward had not exhausted his legal options. Ward was charged with both burglary and sabotage \u2014 which, in Washington, is defined in part as willful interference with a commercial enterprise \u2014 and as Rickert dryly pointed out, the case was \u201cnot exactly a whodunit.\u201d The jury even watched a video of Ward cutting the chain that secured the emergency valve of Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline. But after nearly six hours of sometimes heated deliberation, the jurors announced that they could not come to a decision on either charge. They told me that all were in favor of conviction except for one, who maintained that Ward\u2019s primary intent was not to break the law but to make a point about climate change.\n\nThe judge declared a mistrial based on the hung jury, and Ward was tried again five months later, in June. This time, he was convicted of burglary, but once again the jurors could not reach a decision on the sabotage charge. The second jury was even more divided than the first: a retired nurse who voted against conviction on the sabotage charge described Ward as a \u201chero,\u201d while the presiding juror, Donald Munro, voted for conviction on both counts, calling Ward a \u201cjerk\u201d who \u201cdid it to get attention.\u201d\n\nAnother juror, Warren Wicke, a former corporate recruiter who retired to Mount Vernon, voted against a sabotage conviction, calling the charge \u201coverkill,\u201d and described Ward as a \u201cgood man.\u201d But like many of the other jurors I interviewed, he has his reservations about Ward\u2019s strategy. \u201cI\u2019m worried about somebody trying to outdo him, somebody doing something more outrageous for the sake of publicity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe maximum penalty for second-degree burglary in Washington is 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. After the prosecution decided not to pursue a second retrial on the sabotage charge, Judge Rickert sentenced Ward to two days in prison and 30 days of community service, which Ward, an experienced carpenter, fulfilled this summer by working for the local Habitat for Humanity chapter. \u201cDo I think that Mr. Ward\u2019s behavior\u2019s going to change if he spends 90 days in jail? No,\u201d Rickert said at the sentencing. \u201cWould putting Mr. Ward in jail change the behavior of other people from throwing the tea off the boat or shutting off the oil pipeline? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nMost of the Valve Turners say that their acute concern about climate change, and their decision to break the law because of it, have come with significant personal costs. Some have lost friends and partners, and all have found that \u201cclimate freakout people\u201d are not popular at parties. Still, most have reached an accommodation with those who don\u2019t share their alarm.\n\nFoster has found such accommodations \u2014 with himself, with others \u2014 nearly impossible. When Foster committed himself to the climate movement, he also recruited his children, then 8 and 10, to march and speak alongside him. His older child, now a cleareyed 16-year-old, says that both siblings were initially happy to participate \u2014 in part because it gave them a chance to spend time with their father, whom they saw less and less of as his activism increased. But before long, they felt pressured. \u201cWhen we would try to refuse, when we would say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m tired,\u2019 or \u2018Hey, I have homework,\u2019 or \u2018Hey, I have school today,\u2019 it would be: \u2018Don\u2019t you care about the planet? Don\u2019t you care about the future?\u2019 \u201d the older child explains. \u201cThat felt awful, because of course we cared, of course we wanted to do our part. But it felt like he was using our voices to spread his message.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFoster was also determined that his household reduce its own carbon footprint. He tried to talk his family out of a Hawaiian vacation and other travel. He tried to talk them out of buying a Christmas tree and getting a cat. \u201cEverything I do and don\u2019t do today, to pollute or stop polluting, changes what lives and dies on the planet for the next 300 years \u2014 in a very specific, particular way,\u201d he told me. \u201cI can\u2019t let myself off the hook.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t let his family off the hook either, and resentments deepened. \u201cWhen people asked me how things were going, how I was doing, I\u2019d say, \u2018He\u2019s doing important stuff, and it matters,\u2019 \u201d says his ex-wife, Malinda, who asked that her last name and her children\u2019s names not be used to protect her family\u2019s privacy. \u201cI\u2019d also say, \u2018I really respect Gandhi, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be married to him.\u2019 \u201d Both Malinda and her older child say they felt constantly judged, and frustrated, by Foster\u2019s inflexibility. In 2014, Malinda filed for divorce, and his children said they no longer wanted to be part of his activism \u2014 or part of his life.\n\nPhoto\n\nMalinda says the emotional scars Foster left are profound. \u201cI think he believes he is doing what\u2019s right, and he would be the first to say he\u2019s doing this to protect his kids,\u201d Malinda told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s tragic is that he\u2019s traumatizing his kids\u2019 present, and what good is the kids\u2019 future without their present?\u201d Things might have been different, Foster\u2019s older child added, if he had presented climate change to his kids as something to be aware of, not something to fear. If he had responded to their occasional reluctance with understanding instead of anger. If he had listened. \u201cWhen I hear someone mention climate change now, I just feel this overwhelming guilt,\u201d Foster\u2019s older child said. \u201cI think, 27 trees. I\u2019ve only planted 27 trees. I haven\u2019t done enough. I have so much further to go.\u201d\n\nAfter his divorce, Foster, who had already closed up his private therapy practice to focus on climate activism, moved into a room in a house owned by two fellow activists. He now lives on less than $500 a month, usually traveling by bus, train or bicycle. While low-carbon living affords him some peace of mind, he can\u2019t entirely eliminate his own impact on the climate, and he sometimes stands in the grocery store, wondering what he can possibly justify eating. He is not in regular contact with his family \u2014 a situation that clearly pains him deeply \u2014 and his voice still shakes when he talks about his children. \u201cI am so sorry that I was not able to listen, or sit still enough, or be present with them enough so that they could share whatever they were feeling,\u201d he says now. \u201cI failed to stay close and safe, and be somebody they could count on, and that will always be my single greatest shame.\u201d\n\nFoster\u2019s trial began in Cavalier, a tiny town in North Dakota, on Oct. 2 of last year, and after two and a half days of testimony, the jury convicted him of felony criminal mischief, felony conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and criminal trespass, a misdemeanor. He was found innocent only of reckless endangerment. Foster\u2019s co-defendant, Sam Jessup, a 32-year-old carpenter who accompanied him to the valve and live-streamed its closing, was convicted of felony conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and misdemeanor criminal conspiracy. (The charges against Schlosberg were dropped.) In pretrial hearings, Judge Fontaine ruled that Foster and Jessup would not be allowed to mount a necessity defense, just as the judges had ruled in Ward\u2019s case in Washington and Leonard Higgins\u2019s in Montana. Lawyers for the two other Valve Turners, Emily Johnston and Annette Klapstein, were able to persuade the judge to allow that defense in their forthcoming trial, but the decision has been appealed by the prosecution. As a result, the climate scientist James Hansen, who attended Foster and Jessup\u2019s trial, was not allowed to testify, but it\u2019s very unlikely that more information about climate change would have altered the verdict.\n\nUnlike the divided jurors in Ward\u2019s trial, all the jurors in Cavalier were persuaded that Foster and Jessup were guilty of something. \u201cIf you want to protest, you can protest,\u201d one juror told me, \u201cbut you can\u2019t go on to someone else\u2019s property and destroy things.\u201d Lonny Johnson, the TransCanada employee who visited the site after Foster turned the valve, testified that the valve wasn\u2019t designed to be closed against pressure as Foster had done, but that he\u2019d found no cracks or leaks when he inspected it. The prosecutors, however, argued that a leak could have caused a fire or explosion or polluted the nearby Pembina River. During jury selection, several potential jurors said that they had heard about Foster\u2019s action while listening to police scanners and had been so frightened by the potential consequences that they did not feel they could serve on the jury.\n\nAfter his conviction, Foster returned to Seattle to await sentencing. He continued to plant trees, give slide shows and talk publicly about his decision to turn off the Keystone Pipeline, and he gave several guest sermons at liberal churches, some inspired by Thoreau\u2019s essay \u201cOn the Duty of Civil Disobedience.\u201d \u201cHilarious to think my emotional experience is no different today,\u201d he told me in a text.\n\nOn Feb. 5, he and Jessup were back in Cavalier for their sentencing, accompanied by Klapstein, Higgins and family members. The temperature was well below freezing even at midday, and the frosted streets were quiet. That evening, in the bar of the town\u2019s only motel, the two prosecuting attorneys sat together, while Foster and his group ate dinner just a few feet away. Foster was in a reflective mood. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange to think that tomorrow I could get 21 years \u2014 or I could be free for lunch,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next morning, inside the century-old county courthouse, Judge Fontaine asked if Foster wanted to make a statement before his sentencing. \u201cYes, Your Honor,\u201d Foster said.\n\nApologizing pre-emptively for his tendency to \u201cstart preaching,\u201d Foster spoke for almost 20 minutes, invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and Thoreau. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this action was effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody else, somewhere down the line, takes some meaning from what I did and they apply it in the way that they see fit, that\u2019s what my action was meant to do.\u201d\n\nJessup, weighing his words carefully, spoke next. \u201cFor my entire adult life, I\u2019ve been concerned about this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI came to North Dakota because I had a hope that through the necessity defense, the people of North Dakota would be given the opportunity to consider the evidence and weigh in, participate in a public deliberation in a way that I haven\u2019t seen.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that this was a perfect realization of that vision.\u201d\n\nJudge Fontaine announced a short recess. \u201cThis is not a typical criminal case,\u201d she said when she returned. She had rejected the necessity defense because, in her view, there were still legal means to address climate change. \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince the government, then you convince the people,\u201d she said, \u201cand it seems to me the way you convince the people in this world is by 60-second sound bites, by commercials.\u201d\n\nShe had, she said, received many letters on Foster\u2019s behalf, most describing him as generous to his community and as doing exemplary work with kids. A few, however, described him as narcissistic and attention-seeking. \u201cYou like being in front of the camera, you like all the attention,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything about you, and everything you\u2019ve said to me, is this was the right thing to do, this is what I\u2019m called to do, this is what I have to do. So nothing about that tells me you wouldn\u2019t do the same thing next month, next year, next week.\u201d\n\nJudge Fontaine sentenced Foster to three years in prison, with two of those years to be suspended and served on supervised probation. Jessup was given a suspended sentence of two years. When the hearing ended, two officers approached Foster. He stood, and as he silently mouthed, \u201cI love you,\u201d to his supporters in the front row, he was escorted out of the courtroom. Jessup stayed behind the defense table, looking lost.\n\nThe next afternoon, Higgins and I visited the county jail, an 18-bed operation tucked behind the courthouse. We stood in the cramped cinder-block visiting booth, separated from Foster by a thick sheet of Plexiglas, and took turns speaking to him through a phone handset. Foster was dressed in bright orange prison scrubs topped with a matching sweatshirt, and he looked tired but happy. Higgins, whose own sentencing for felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor criminal trespass is scheduled for March 20, teased Foster about his new wardrobe, and Foster laughed. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe isolation\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d He would miss fresh air too. Thoreau\u2019s cabin wasn\u2019t much bigger than a jail cell, but he got to go outside whenever he liked. Foster acknowledged, though, that he was there by choice, and said he had regrets about his statement to the judge. \u201cI blew it. I really didn\u2019t speak to her concerns.\u201d But for the moment, at least, he felt as if he were in the right place. Then he paraphrased the man he portrayed onstage 30 years ago: \u201cIf society is unjust, the only just place for a person is in jail.\u201d", "title": "\u2018I\u2019m Just More Afraid of Climate Change Than I Am of Prison\u2019", "authors": ["Michelle Nijhuis"]}

His formula was tainted with salmonella \u2014 and a broad range of other Lactalis powdered milk products still on the shelves were at risk, too.\n\nIt would take three recalls and many weeks for the scope of the problem to finally become clear, stoking public outrage over what has become known in France as \u201cl\u2019affaire Lactalis.\u201d In one of the biggest recalls of its kind, the company has pulled more than 7,000 tons of potentially contaminated baby formula and other powdered milk products across more than 80 countries, mostly in Europe, Africa and Asia. And its chief executive said on Thursday that the company\u2019s powdered milk products may have been exposed to salmonella for more than a decade.\n\nThe massive recall and the missteps along the way have exposed corporate lapses and regulatory gaps that allowed tainted products to make their way into supermarkets and pharmacies, even weeks after the problems were discovered. The episode at Lactalis, which also makes yogurt, butter and cheese, has highlighted what critics say is lax oversight of industrial food companies and weak reporting standards across the European Union.", "title": "\u2018My Baby Almost Died\u2019: Formula Scandal Sends Shudders Through France", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nOn Feb. 13, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day, the Criterion Channel on FilmStruck debuted \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d George A. Romero\u2019s 1968 horror classic. The posting is notable for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, if you stream a lot of video, you know that \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d is everywhere. There are three versions, including a colorized one, free to Amazon Prime members. So you may well ask why the FilmStruck/Criterion Channel offering is a big deal. It\u2019s because the version appearing on the site is a new restoration from the film\u2019s original negative, produced by the Film Foundation (the preservation nonprofit founded by the director Martin Scorsese) and the Museum of Modern Art, which put \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d in its permanent collection. The restored film was shown in November 2016 at MoMA and later in repertory and art house theaters all over the country.\n\nFor another, this is the second time Criterion has put up a film on the site the same day as its release on physical media, in this case a two-disc Blu-ray on the Criterion Collection label. (The first time this happened was with \u201cDesert Hearts,\u201d released and posted last November.)\n\nSome skeptics online who haven\u2019t seen the restoration ask \u201chow good can the new version look?\u201d After all, \u201cLiving Dead\u201d is one of the original low-budget horror movies that morphed into a classic. The answer lies in part with just how bad the versions you can watch on Amazon Prime look. There\u2019s one with a \u201cFisher Klingenstein Films\u201d logo before the opening shot. The image is blurry, with the whites far too bright, washed-out and lacking in detail. A \u201c50th Anniversary\u201d edition, touting the movie as \u201cNow Available in 1080p High-Definition-2K HD transfer from a rare film print\u201d may well be as advertised. Yet however \u201crare\u201d the print from which the version was scanned, it wasn\u2019t in very good shape. A lot of scratches and blotches, and overly high contrasts that deepen the blacks into nothingness while distorting the whites. We shall not even speak of the colorized version.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese various iterations exist because the movie\u2019s original distributor failed to copyright it. Once it went into the public domain, anyone with a print of the movie could distribute it anywhere, produce video versions, and more, free. The creators of the movie didn\u2019t make any money. The Film Foundation and MoMA allowed Image Ten, the original company behind the film, founded by the director, Mr. Romero, the producing brothers Gary and Russell Streiner, and the writer John Russo, among others, to register a copyright for this restoration. And Janus Films and its sister company Criterion licensed the movie from Image Ten. So this is the only edition of the film that yields revenue to all its original creators.", "title": "\u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019: Zombies Restored to Their Full Beauty", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny"]}

It\u2019s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably \u2014 over something like having children \u2014 end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing.\n\nSame with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her.

My mom had a stroke and didn\u2019t tell me for 12 years! That\u2019s real!

In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be.

It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.\n\nIs there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?\n\nWell, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well.

Aja did fine as a salty Crystal LaBeija, from the 1968 pageant documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d as did BeBe Zahara Benet, as Grace Jones. Shangela wisely opted for Jenifer Lewis, a personal friend she channeled loud and clear.

So was BeBe, luscious in monochromatic dark blossoms. BenDeLaCreme, covered in orchids and shimmering butterflies, was named top two for the fourth week in a row. She was joined by Shangela, done up in a nod to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s floral-wreathed pregnancy announcement photo.\n\nIn the bottom: the inconsistent Kennedy, who was last week\u2019s winner; Chi Chi, lovely in lilies but adrift in the challenge; and a kaleidoscopically effloresced Trixie, who cried while the camera zoomed in.\n\n\u201cI get nervous here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m at Camp Crystal Lake and Jason\u2019s outside with the machete.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you have, and what you offer, and who you are, whether this continues or not,\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said. (\u201cYeah,\u201d the producers of Trixie\u2019s hit Viceland show added, at home.)\n\nBackstage, the top two took meetings. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to plug away at this,\u201d BenDeLaCreme told Chi Chi, sounding a bit like the teacher of that painting class I shouldn\u2019t have taken.\n\nMeanwhile, Aja \u2014 who has calmly consoled so many queens backstage this season \u2014 sat with a vulnerable Trixie. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of drag in the real world,\u201d Trixie said, and I felt for her. She\u2019s gifted, perhaps just not at \u201cDrag Race.\u201d\n\nShangela, on the other hand, was born for this, holding court in yet another confessional. \u201cThis is the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 of drag,\u201d she said, refusing to let an episode go by without making that comparison. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have alliances. Is Trixie Jon Snow, or is she Cersei Lannister?\u201d (Actually, right now I\u2019d say Trixie\u2019s more Season 3 Edmure Tully, firing arrows at his father\u2019s funeral boat and missing, am I right?)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a lip-sync to Katy Perry\u2019s not-timeless \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d both Shangela and BenDeLaCreme were crowned winners and, in a twist, each was given the chance to eliminate one of the bottom three queens. BenDeLaCreme eliminated Chi Chi, fine, and Shangela, who really did a supermarket sweep of this episode, milked the moment. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve chosen didn\u2019t leave with the crown, but they made a career,\u201d she said, teasing out what sounded like a Trixie elimination, only to reveal she\u2019d eliminated Chi Chi as well. (Warning shot: fired \u2014 and a sobbing Trixie clearly heard it.)\n\n\u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chi Chi said, waving. \u201cI\u2019m sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could,\u201d she added backstage, smiling. \u201c\u2018All Stars 3\u2019 was hard.\u201d\n\nFinally: a gracious exit. God, I love Chi Chi. Does she bake?

Katha Pollitt\u2019s excellent \u201cPro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights\u201d (2014) was also addressed to those Americans in the \u201cmuddled middle\u201d of the debate, though Pollitt explicitly set out to persuade them that abortion, by allowing women a measure of control over childbearing and therefore their lives, was an unequivocal moral good. Watson\u2019s goal with \u201cScarlet A\u201d \u2014 to get Americans to just start talking with one another \u2014 is less polemical but no less difficult, at least in this distrustful day and age.\n\nImage Katie Watson Credit John White\n\nTo that end, she begins with a personal anecdote, recounting a trip to Rome when she came across a \u201cfoundling wheel\u201d at a hospital. Installed around the year 1200 at the behest of Pope Innocent III, the rotating compartment allowed parents to place their baby in the care of strangers, at a time when unwanted children were commonly drowned in the Tiber River. \u201cSpinning that 800-year-old wheel reminded me what an old question Roe v. Wade revolved around: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant, but I don\u2019t want to have a baby. What can I do?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cScarlet A\u201d is an unusual hybrid of a book: part memoir, part legal exegesis, part philosophical tract, part conversational guide. Watson delves into the underlying assumptions behind different positions, taking seriously arguments other than her own. She addresses the ethics of abortion \u2014 something those who support access to abortion are often loath to do, because of what she calls the \u201cRussian Doll problem\u201d: \u201cthe anti-woman, anti-sex, political pot-stirring motivations\u201d that often come hidden in the guise of morality.\n\nAbout an issue so fraught, she knows she can take very little for granted. She acknowledges the trouble with vocabulary and terms (\u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-life\u201d are the least of them) that come with arguments baked in. She explains how Supreme Court decisions helped create certain \u201cmasterplots\u201d that circumscribe our cultural assumptions. She breaks down the various secular approaches to abortion ethics \u2014 whether they treat the issue as a matter of biology, autonomy or public health. She explores the connection between the decline in clinic blockades and the rise in restrictive abortion laws.\n\nAs comfortable as Watson is when navigating around treacherous shoals, readers seeking the bland flag of neutrality should look elsewhere. \u201cI don\u2019t claim neutrality,\u201d she writes, \u201cI claim plurality.\u201d The same warning goes for those who insist that the claims of embryos and fetuses necessarily trump those of women. If anything, Watson argues, the \u201cnever-ending\u201d abortion debate confirms \u201cthat the moral status of embryos and fetuses cannot be proven to the degree necessary\u201d to justify government intervention on their behalf. We can talk about embryos and fetuses to no end, circling one another\u2019s uncertainty, but that still \u201cfails to address the moral status of women, about which we are certain: 100 percent people.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Scarlet A\u2019 Wants Less Shouting About Abortion and More Talking", "authors": []}

According to Cornwell, 20 percent of Federation territory is now occupied. But Starfleet just got its prized ship back and its cloak-breaking technology is now being disseminated to all the ships. The spore drive can put the Discovery anywhere it needs to be instantaneously. In effect, Starfleet has an advantage now that should help them get back some of that territory.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo why is the situation so dire that Evil Georgiou is in charge now? Imagine her giving orders to Saru, who is supposed to be a slave in her eyes? (And, there is a chance this whole thing is a red herring for some other plot twist. A good chance, in fact, judging from Sarek\u2019s farewell to Burnham.) And everyone in the Terran Empire lives in a universe of deceit and violence. What incentive does Georgiou have to keep to any plan for her freedom? She can just escape the ship on her own!\n\nBut that\u2019s just it: Everything is a red herring for something else in this show. Story threads and characters flip at a moment\u2019s notice, so there really is no point in getting invested in anything.\n\nWhat worked\n\nAsh and Saru\n\nShazad Latif and Doug Jones do excellent work as Tyler and Saru in their scene together. Saru shows reluctant compassion for Tyler, whatever is left of him, and Tyler\u2019s vulnerability is well-conveyed by Mr. Latif.\n\nWhat didn\u2019t work\n\nAsh and Burnham\n\nTyler and Burnham have a very emotional talk where they hash out their differences before saying goodbye. Burnham\u2019s beef: Tyler was forced into being a secret Klingon spy without fully realizing it and didn\u2019t come to her for comfort. Tyler\u2019s: After attempting to kill her as a secret Klingon spy, he thinks she is just trying to look for a way out because she\u2019s never been in love before. You know, normal couple stuff.\n\nThis felt forced, in part because we haven\u2019t seen enough of them together to get to know them as a couple. And also, he tried to kill her. Granted, it was a Klingon essence inside of his body, but still.\n\nThis reminded me of when Picard is captured and assimilated by the Borg in a \u201cThe Next Generation\u201d episode. The Borg, a single-minded robot entity, then turned him into Locutus, who went on to lead the drones in the killing of thousands of Starfleet personnel. The Enterprise crew eventually rescued and accepted him back as captain, and we, the viewers, loved it. That\u2019s because we knew the characters well. We saw their relationships develop and grow. We saw squabbles, humorous moments, rescues and everything in between. We just don\u2019t see that very often on \u201cDiscovery.\u201d\n\nDid you catch that?\n\nAside from a glancing response to Captain Archer, this episode had a similar plot thread to one in \u201cNext Generation\u201d: \u201cYesterday\u2019s Enterprise,\u201d where the Enterprise C travels 22 years into the future by accident, causing a brutal war with the Klingons. The Federation is losing in this timeline too. It remains one of the best episodes of any \u201cStar Trek\u201d series.\n\nFinale questions?\n\nNext week is the season finale of the \u201cDiscovery\u201d maiden voyage. Even though the show has flaws, it is ambitious and unpredictable. It also has no investment in its characters. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if I end up writing a recap next week about Burnham\u2019s death. Or we see Prime Lorca again.

And the suit involves a fascinating part of Bouvier family history that helped make the documentary a cult classic and later led to a Broadway musical and a 2009 HBO movie starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wallace has refused the Beale family\u2019s request to provide proof of its ownership or else hand over the painting and depicts the suit as an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the painting rather than buy it.\n\nHe called its provenance \u201cimpeccable\u201d and said he bought it legitimately in the late 1980s from \u201ca very reputable\u201d art and antiques dealer. He refused to name the dealer but said he was prepared to do so in court and give a full accounting of the painting\u2019s ownership history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of my defense,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the painting was probably stolen from Grey Gardens in the late 1960s. The two women never reported the theft because of a contentious relationship with local officials over the poor condition of their home, the lawsuit claims.\n\nGrey Gardens was eventually cleaned up and somewhat restored with the help of financing by Mrs. Onassis in 1972.\n\nTwo years after Big Edie\u2019s death in 1977, Little Edie sold Grey Gardens to a Washington power couple, Ben Bradlee, then the executive editor of The Washington Post, and Sally Quinn, the journalist and author.\n\nLittle Edie\u2019s flamboyant manner in the documentary helped make her a campy icon known for her memorable description of herself as a \u201cstaunch character\u201d \u2014 \u201cThey don\u2019t weaken, no matter what.\u201d Before her death in 2002, at age 84, she asked Mr. Beale, the executor of her estate, to recover items stolen from Grey Gardens, he said.\n\nMr. Beale and his wife, Eva, who live in California, spent years after Little Edie\u2019s death going through reams of letters and documents she had left behind, \u201cin keeping with her wishes for the family to preserve her history and attend to her outstanding affairs,\u201d Mr. Beale said in a statement, through his lawyer, Megan Noh.\n\n\u201cFrom these letters, we learned that Jackie\u2019s father, \u2018Black Jack\u2019 Bouvier, had mishandled a family trust that would have provided Edie with financial security,\u201d Mr. Beale said in the statement. \u201cBefore his death, he gave his prized portrait of Jackie to Edie to make things right.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He responded that he bought it from a dealer who was now dead but would not identify the dealer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat feeling that the painting came from Grey Gardens was confirmed in 2016 when Mr. Beale and his wife found in Little Edie\u2019s records a 1998 article from Hamptons magazine that showed the painting and described it as having \u201cdisappeared\u201d from Grey Gardens and bought by Mr. Wallace from a dealer.\n\nThe article \u201cled us to realize that the missing painting was indeed the one at Wallace Gallery,\u201d Mr. Beale said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe article mentioned that it was the only portrait of the future Mrs. Onassis as a teenager. The article describes it as being painted shortly after she fell off a horse and incurred a scar that is visible in the painting.\n\nThe painting \u201chas got a good story behind it,\u201d Mr. Wallace said, but is not very valuable. The painting has been appraised, he said, but he would not disclose that figure.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the painting \u201cwell exceeds the $75,000 threshold\u201d necessary to bring a federal suit. Ms. Noh would not give an estimate but noted that memorabilia associated with the Kennedys has historically brought \u201ca significant premium above its intrinsic value.\u201d\n\nMs. Noh said that under New York State law, an owner cannot gain what is legally recognized as \u201cgood title\u201d to a work of art if there has been a theft in its chain of custody.\n\nAnd with the Beales\u2019 \u201carguable claim\u201d on the painting, \u201cthe burden shifts to the current possessor to prove that the work was not stolen,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Mr. Wallace called it \u201ca very strong possibility\u201d that the painting was never even given to Big Edie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just assuming it must be part of their legacy \u2014 these people don\u2019t really know,\u201d said Mr. Wallace, 70, a blunt-spoken former Marine who served in the Vietnam War.\n\nHe called himself an honest dealer who had personally assisted local police and federal investigators working on theft and fraud cases over the years.\n\n\u201cI have a good clientele. Why would I risk my reputation for a painting?\u201d Mr. Wallace asked.\n\nStill, Ms. Noh said, \u201cIt is difficult to understand why Mr. Wallace refuses to disclose the provenance of the Jackie portrait.\u201d\n\nAs for the painting\u2019s provenance, which Mr. Wallace would be required to disclose for the case, if it is indeed impeccable, Ms. Noh said, \u201cIt is puzzling that he would choose to engage in that costly legal process, rather than voluntarily provide the information.\u201d\n\nMr. Wallace said he would \u201cgladly return the painting to the rightful owner, if it could be proven that the painting was stolen.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, he said, he would welcome an offer from the Beale estate to buy the painting, even while cautioning that the price might climb because \u201cI\u2019m getting more annoyed by the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey got a law firm to push me around, but I\u2019m not that pushable,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t figure that into the equation.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Staunch Characters\u2019 Battle Over Painting of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis", "authors": ["Corey Kilgannon"]}

Kreizler\u2019s makeshift detective squad, which now appears to include Police Commissioner Teddy Roosevelt, is delivered another slain child \u2014 as we, in turn, are delivered a close-up of the victim\u2019s empty, bloody eye socket, which Lucius probes with his finger in search of clues about the murder weapon. In another scene, John Moore awakes from a nightmare in which the young prostitute who lured him into a trap in last week\u2019s episode has his eyes similarly cut out. It\u2019s the biggest jump-scare the show has served up yet.\n\nWe also learn that at least two members of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler\u2019s staff \u2014 his driver, Cyrus, and his maid, Mary \u2014 have themselves committed murder. Those murders seem to have happened under mitigating circumstances, but still. The Scooby-Doo gang this ain\u2019t.\n\nIt may sound odd given that this show\u2019s sordidness has been one of my chief obstacles to taking \u201cThe Alienist\u201d as seriously as its creators surely wish, but I found myself wishing that one of the episode\u2019s most upsetting story lines had been handled with more frankness, not less. Moore suffered more than a nightmare when he was drugged: He was sexually assaulted by the underage employees of the gangsters who own the brothel he was investigating \u2014 all under the watchful eye of their police cronies, in hopes that the resulting shame would prevent him from disclosing anything he discovered. And yet Moore and the show itself seem to shake off this traumatic event within hours; in fact, it\u2019s played primarily for laughs, with an off-color joke by Captain Connor and an \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think!\u201d gag about Kreizler\u2019s gang having found him wandering around without any pants.\n\nBefore long, the intrepid illustrator even returns with Kreizler to the scene of the crime, seemingly more concerned with having been robbed than raped. Elsewhere in the episode, he endures an awkward blind date arranged by his grandmother, and he finally makes his feelings toward Sarah clear with an unrequited kiss. The scene with his grandmother is as amusing as the other bits of comic relief; the kiss is effective in furthering the bizarre love triangle between our three principals. Both, however, feel deeply strange as part of a day in the life of a man who has been sexually assaulted no more than 48 hours before.\n\nIt\u2019s all the more baffling because the episode is so successful elsewhere in probing the inner workings of its main characters. A marvelous, complex scene at a Vassar reunion, in which Sarah is the only remaining bachelorette, hints at a possible old fling with a classmate and a definite interest in Kreizler. These revelations take place during a daring sotto voce conversation about \u201cdoing it\u201d and a party game in which the attendees are \u201cmurdered\u201d when the designated \u201ckiller\u201d winks at them. It\u2019s a game the jaded police employee reacts to with an impassive stare courtesy of Dakota Fanning, who renders her face as somehow blank and expressive at once.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 3: There\u2019s No Later", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "If only \u201cThe Alienist\u201d had the same faith in its audience\u2019s ability to understand the complexities of its characters\u2019 minds that Kreizler has in Sara\u2019s. Take the sequence in the park. It\u2019s not for-the-ages dialogue, but the writing is certainly clear in its emotional and intellectual intent (Daniel Br\u00fchl and Dakota Fanning\u2019s characteristically restrained performances make the gruesome details of their exchange even more memorable.) But the end of the sequence lays aside the scalpel and breaks out the sledgehammer: As Sara contemplates Kreizler\u2019s sad tale, children sing a schoolyard rhyme about putting a baby \u201cin a bathtub to see if he could swim,\u201d while a close-up practically immerses us in the waters of a nearby fountain. It could hardly be less subtle if the script had called for Ms. Fanning to turn to the camera and say, \u201cGet it?\u201d\n\nMore such unsubtle material abounds. In the opening scene, Kreizler visits a former patient, now a professional dominatrix, seeking insight into the connection between pleasure and pain. In keeping with the show\u2019s depiction of sex workers as both insatiable and lacking savvy, the dom comes onto the doc like a wolf in a Tex Avery cartoon. No doubt his discomfort is supposed to be revealing.\n\nBut the insights offered in the scene are meager, or at least simplistic, even for its era. (\u201cThe man who enjoys defiling women is usually dominated in his daily life,\u201d she tells him, \u201cwhile man who enjoys being beaten is probably a bully.\u201d) Likewise, at his institute, Kreizler comes across a boy who\u2019s in a funk because his parents didn\u2019t visit him that week. He peps the boy back up with a bit of unorthodox therapy, suggesting that the boy kick a ball for a while. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend it\u2019s someone special,\u201d Kreizler says. \u201cWho would you choose it to be?\u201d The boy chooses his mother.\n\nAfter the boy leaves, Kreizler punts the thing himself, effectively begging us to wonder whose head he imagines kicking. Considering his frustrations with local law enforcement, the triangle of tensions between him and John and Sara, his inability thus far to stop the killer, and even the story Roosevelt tells about almost coming to blows with Kreizler in college, there is no shortage of prospects, including his own. The better question, perhaps, is whether insights like these are very interesting.\n\nAnd yet the episode still manages to entertain, in part because the investigation is picking up steam. Thanks to a piton left behind at one of the crime scenes, the Isaacson brothers discover that the murderer is able to make his seemingly inexplicable locked-room escapes and scale the tall buildings because he\u2019s an experienced climber.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 4: Onions and Carrots", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "text": "Roosevelt, furious both with the cops who have been keeping this information from him and with an alienist who seems to view it all as some intellectual game, blows off Kreizler\u2019s caveat and charges in anyway.\n\nThus, we\u2019re led to believe a twist on the \u201cLambs\u201d maneuver is in the offing. Perhaps the chrome-toothed creep we first saw in last week\u2019s episode (played by the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d veteran Josef Atlin) will open the door when Roosevelt comes calling after all, and we\u2019ll be shown a second suspect while Willem is being hauled away in cuffs (in other words, perhaps Willem has a thing for drugging and bathing boy prostitutes in milk, but he doesn\u2019t have a thing for butchering them). Or perhaps the creep isn\u2019t Willem at all. Maybe he\u2019s a ringer set up by the show, and Roosevelt will arrest the real Van Bergen \u2014 someone innocent, whom we\u2019ve never seen before \u2014 while \u201cthe man with the silver smile\u201d carries on drugging and murdering the boy.\n\nWith a little help from a deeply corrupt New York Police Department, the episode takes yet another route. Roosevelt does indeed arrive at the wrong address, proffered him by the crooked Captain Connor, whom the Commissioner fires from the force for the deception. At the same time, Mrs. Van Bergen and a private investigator stop her silver-smiling son in the middle of his \u201cdate,\u201d demanding he leave the city. \u201cMy Willem,\u201d purrs Mrs. Van Bergen, attempting to comfort him. \u201cMy good, good boy.\u201d Willem\u2019s explosive reaction to her words and touch indicate that Kreizler\u2019s colleagues, Sara Howard in particular, were on to something when they suggested that a woman played a key role in the killer\u2019s abusive upbringing, a suggestion the doctor responded to with a fury on par with Willem\u2019s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnd here we arrive at the beating heart of the episode. The title, \u201cHildebrandt\u2019s Starling,\u201d takes its name from an anecdote shared earlier in the episode by Kreizler and one of his Harvard professors. The old professor had assigned his then-student to study a dead bird, over and over again, with the simple instruction \u201cLook at your bird.\u201d The professor\u2019s goal was to teach Kreizler that \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you learned in class, Laszlo, it\u2019s how you learned it.\u201d The conclusion, in other words, was of secondary importance to his process of investigation and analysis. Part of that is always taking another look. Part of it is always revising what it even means to look.\n\nWhen Kreizler confides to his old mentor that he fears he\u2019s become fixated on a particular theory of the current crimes to the exclusion of all others, the professor simply replies: \u201cLook at your bird, Laszlo. Look at your bird.\u201d During a later visit by Kreizler and John Moore to the prison where a child killer Laszlo treated earlier in his career has been kept for years in solitary confinement, the murderer serves as the bird. Laszlo discovers that perhaps his theory about the killer\u2019s motivations is wrong \u2014 that perhaps, as he confides to Moore, \u201cI don\u2019t know as much as I think I do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a less discouraging sentiment than it may seem. This newfound realization that he\u2019s not infallible leads Laszlo to a rapprochement with Sara (over whiskey, her drink of choice), who had come to him armed with the identity of Willem Van Bergen. She, herself, had been set on Van Bergen\u2019s trail by Commissioner Roosevelt, thanks to an error in judgment by the city\u2019s sleazy mayor, who inadvertently tipped him that there was a high-society suspect in the first place. Thanks to her own dogged police work and a series of fortuitous events, Sara finds her suspect and gives him to a protagonist who\u2019s suddenly much more open to other people\u2019s theories than he was before. The team has never been better situated to get its man.\n\nAll of which makes that concluding fake out that much more baffling, and fun, to puzzle out. Was Kreizler wrong about the killer\u2019s relationship with his mother, and wrong that the killer comes from the same lower-class background as his victims? Was he wrong to conclude that Willem isn\u2019t their man? The writing and editing of the sequence certainly suggests he was, emphasizing Connor\u2019s deception, Roosevelt\u2019s frustration, and Willem\u2019s twisted relationship with his mother.\n\nOr was the scene with the milk bath a red herring? Have Connor and the rest of the cops been covering for the wrong man?\n\nWho knows? And as long as the results are this entertaining and the investigation this meticulously constructed, who cares? It\u2019s not what you learn, it\u2019s how you learn. I, for one, am willing to keep on looking at this particular bird.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 5: Look at Your Bird, Laszlo", "authors": ["Sean T.

Morgan to the police department brass \u2014 met his end at the barrel of the former captain Connor\u2019s gun.\n\nYes, that former captain Connor, the one who seemed so dedicated to the cover-up surrounding Van Bergen\u2019s crimes that he continued to act in concert with the conspiracy even after his involvement cost him his job.\n\nTipped off by an informant that Willem is back on the prowl \u2014 his parents had instructed him to board a ship to Buenos Aires, but the young and syphilitic dandy just can\u2019t help himself \u2014 Connor intercepts him almost immediately. A chase ensues up the scaffolding of a bridge under construction, which is when we get tentative confirmation of Kreizler\u2019s theory that Van Bergen is not the killer: The murderer routinely scales buildings to deposit the corpses of his pray; Van Bergen is clearly terrified of heights.\n\nIf only he\u2019d been as wary of ex-cops, he might have survived.

One of seven children. The son of an Illinois coal miner. He began his career selling premixed pancake batter out of the trunk of a beat-up old car. And today Lee manages 32 million square feet of commercial property across the Midwest.\u201d\n\nLater, at home, Marilyn moisturizes her face and removes her cosmetic eyelashes. It would have been easy for the episode\u2019s writer (Tom Rob Smith) and director (Gwyneth Horder-Payton) to have this moment be the one when the mask of a happy marriage is removed, its ugly face revealed.\n\nIn some ways that happens: In a quiet moment before the mirror, Marilyn applies a drop of perfume down the front of her silk robe, her eyes hollowed out with longing. In another room, Lee takes a call from Andrew Cunanan, dialing from a pay phone, and when Marilyn asks who is calling, he lies and says it\u2019s a business call. But the marriage is not merely a sham. When Marilyn asks Lee what he plans to do while she is away on business, he sounds down. She asks him to accompany her.\n\n\u201cI like it when you\u2019re there,\u201d she says, and she means it.\n\nIt is their last meaningful encounter.\n\nWith Marilyn away, Lee opens his door to the serial killer, who happens to be in town. Lee shows him his plans to build a 125-story, 1,952-foot Sky Needle, which would have been the world\u2019s tallest building.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe conversation does not go well. Andrew thinks the main point of having a building taller than the Sears Tower (now Willis Tower) is to surpass the latter structure\u2019s observation deck. Andrew also urges Lee to name the tower for himself, something the self-effacing developer has no intention of doing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I am not like most escorts. I am not like most anybody. I could almost be a husband, a partner.\u201d\n\nI found this reference to marriage anachronistic, and puzzling, and not for the first time in this series. In earlier episodes, Gianni Versace\u2019s partner, Antonio D\u2019Amico, tired of their hedonistic lifestyle, proposes, and Cunanan tells a friend \u2014 falsely, we believe \u2014 that Versace once proposed to him.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not making light of commitment or the desire for it. But I\u2019m puzzled by the use of words like \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cproposed.\u201d They don\u2019t seem true to my own memories of the late 1990s, when gay men were more likely to speak of boyfriends, partners and companions, and they seem strangely ahistoric.\n\nMy next quibble with this episode is more prosaic: the killing of Lee Miglin, in his garage, by Cunanan is so grisly and sadistic as to be difficult to watch. I\u2019ll spare the details, but the monologue Cunanan delivers before delivering the coup de gr\u00e2ce bears note:\n\nI know that you\u2019re not wearing your hearing aid, so I am going to speak very loudly and very clearly so you can understand. I want you to know that when they find your body, you will be wearing ladies\u2019 panties. Surrounded by gay porn. I want the world to see that the great Lee Miglin is a sissy. Soon the whole world will know that the great Lee Miglin, who built Chicago, built it with a limp wrist. The cops will know, the press will know, your wife will know, your children will know, the neighbors will know. Tell me something, Lee: What terrifies you more, death or being disgraced?\n\nThe monologue raises the question: Is Cunanan motivated by self-hatred, a desire to expose hypocrisy, or both? His use of homophobic language suggests self-hatred, but his focus on disgrace suggests some kind of crusade. It is not, of course, a crime to cross-dress, or to look at porn. This mutual failure of recognition \u2014 murderer and victim seem to agree on one thing, that to be gay is a disgrace \u2014 is perhaps the saddest moment in this series so far.\n\nThe rest of the episode is a tour de force by Judith Light, whose portrayal of a wife in denial is simply magnificent. She offers a brisk inventory of what\u2019s missing from the house \u2014 a Lexus, $2,000 in cash, two leather coats, two suits, \u201csome inconsequential pieces of jewelry,\u201d rare gold coins and a dozen pairs of socks \u2014 as she reaches the conclusion that the killing must have been a random and opportunistic robbery.\n\nTold by the Chicago police superintendent about the gay porn found next to the body, Marilyn surmises that \u201cthey must have belonged to the killer,\u201d but goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in his intentions. Find him, catch him, but don\u2019t talk to me about what or might not be going through his mind.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cDollars, jewelry, socks, suits \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019ll allow that man to steal from me. He won\u2019t steal my good name. Our good name. We worked too hard making that name, and we made it together.\u201d\n\nFor an ambitious woman born in the 1930s to have a husband who is fully supportive of her professional aspirations might indeed, as she suggests, have been \u201ca fairy tale life.\u201d \u201cHow many husbands believe in their wives\u2019 dreams?\u201d she asks her Home Shopping Network viewers \u2014 and us \u2014 later in the episode. \u201cHow many treat us as partners, as equals?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLeft unsaid: Perhaps his being gay allowed him to be such a supportive partner.\n\nCompared with all this, Cunanan\u2019s murderous escapades seem mundane. He flees to New Jersey, and the police failure to capture him after a radio station reveals that investigators have been tracking his movements by car phone. In search of a new car to steal, he stops at a cemetery, where he marches one of the groundskeepers into a basement and makes him get down on his knees.\n\nThe man begs for mercy, but his plea is cut short. And for the first time in this series I was so disgusted by this killer\u2019s lack of remorse that \u2014 for a moment at least \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to keep watching.\n\nAt least most of carnage is out of the way.

David and Andrew have been bickering, and while their relationship isn\u2019t exactly explained, a romance gone sour is implied.

In the lobby and elevator, we learn a lot:\n\n\u2022 David tells Jeff that Andrew proposed marriage, calling David \u201cthe man of his dreams\u201d and \u201chis last chance at happiness.\u201d\n\n\u2022 David says that he declined, noting that gay marriage isn\u2019t legal, but that Andrew thinks Jeff is \u201cthe reason I said no.\u201d Jeff is surprised that Andrew knows that Jeff and David have been together. \u201cHe has this feline intuition,\u201d David says.\n\n\u2022 Jeff says that Andrew took a gun from Jeff\u2019s apartment, and that he has come to get it back.\n\nAs we are processing all this, the two men enter the apartment, and what happens next is a murder with a claw hammer too vicious and grisly for me to watch.\n\nTerrified and stricken, David seems to go numb. He asks why Andrew killed Jeff; Andrew replies, \u201cI lost control.\u201d\n\nDavid calls 911, but Andrew compels him to hang up by saying that if the police arrive, they will both go to prison, disingenuously eliding the fact that it was he who set all this in motion. He goes on to argue that homophobia makes justice impossible anyway. \u201cWhen the police open the door they\u2019ll see two suspects, not two victims,\u201d he says. And when David insists he is no killer, Andrew replies: \u201cThey won\u2019t believe you. They hate us, David, they\u2019ve always hated us.

Or was I afraid of the disgrace, the shame of it all. Is that what I\u2019m running from?\u201d\n\nIn David\u2019s hometown, Barron, Wis., his stunned parents learn from the Minneapolis detectives that a stranger named Jeffrey Trail was murdered in David\u2019s home, with 27 blows from David\u2019s steel claw hammer. The detectives tell them about another stranger, named Andrew Cunanan, whose friends in San Francisco have described as reliable, intelligent, generous. David\u2019s father insists his son is innocent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI can see with certainty, there\u2019s a great deal you don\u2019t know about your son,\u201d the detective says. But as we soon learn in a heart-wrenching scene, he probably knows more than the detective assumes.\n\nIn one of several flashbacks, David is shown speaking with his dad in the garage. It\u2019s a workingman\u2019s garage (in an earlier flashback, the two of them had gone hunting), and David has graduated from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, at the top of his class. He tells his father he is gay.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t lie and say that it doesn\u2019t make a difference,\u201d the father responds. \u201cYou know what I believe. And maybe this isn\u2019t what you wanted to hear. Maybe you wanted to be told I don\u2019t have a problem with it. I can\u2019t say that. But what I can say is I love you more than I love my own life.\u201d\n\nIt is a bittersweet moment, one that in its overall contours many lesbian and gay people may recognize. That someone with reasonably tolerant parents in the mid-1980s could nonetheless feel such shame and self-loathing says a lot, by implication, about those who lacked such emotional support.\n\nWe get another look at how crushing that shame and self-loathing might be, when Andrew and David stop at a roadside bar. As David ponders escaping from the bathroom, Andrew is brought to tears by a singer\u2019s rendition of the Cars\u2019 1984 song \u201cDrive,\u201d a rare moment of true emotional vulnerability from him, his pain brimming to the surface. David, whether because he feels he can\u2019t escape or won\u2019t be believed, forgoes the chance to save his own life and returns to the table with Andrew. Perhaps their need for human connection is mutual.\n\nIn a diner the next day, David recalls how Andrew dazzled him when they met at a bar in San Francisco, a year and a half earlier. \u201cWhat\u2019s this man going to see in me, a small-town boy?\u201d he remembers thinking. They ended up in a $1,000-a-night room at the Mandarin Oriental. David continues:\n\nI remember thinking: How hard do I have to work to live like him, like Andrew? \u2019Cause I\u2019ll do it. Except it was all a lie. You\u2019ve never worked for anything. It was an act. Is that why you killed Jeff? You loved him. It was so obvious. But he figured you out in the end, didn\u2019t he? It took him a few years but he finally saw the real you, and you killed him for it.\n\nAndrew tries to change the subject, promising David that they\u2019ll lead a glamorous life in Mexico. He can\u2019t stop lying.\n\nBack in the car, David arrives at a further, belated discovery \u2014 that Jeff was set up, that Andrew planned all along to kill him in David\u2019s presence. \u201cWhy are you always talking about the past?\u201d an enraged Andrew asks. \u201cWe had a plan. We had a future.\u201d\n\nThey pull over. David\u2019s fate is sealed.\n\nEpisode 3 argued that denial could be a tool of survival.

A co-worker, an ex-Marine, learns that Trail worked on an aircraft carrier that was decommissioned after the first Gulf War. Trail says he misses the military life, and regrets leaving.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "Timepieces are examined as works of art as well as cultural barometers in the new book \u201cThe Beauty of Time,\u201d by Dominique Fl\u00e9chon and Fran\u00e7ois Chaille.\n\n\u201cEach timepiece was selected to represent the intellectual and artistic currents of a period,\u201d Mr. Fl\u00e9chon wrote in an email that was translated from French by Gr\u00e9gory Gardinetti, the expert and historian in watchmaking at the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, a partner in the book\u2019s publication. (Flammarion published it in Europe in January; the North American version is to be released March 6.)\n\nContemporaneous artworks are interspersed among the images of clocks and watches, selected from the Middle Ages to modern times, to \u201cshow the evolution of tastes,\u201d Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said. Here are a few examples:\n\nPhoto\n\nPlanetary perfection\n\nThe Astrarium is an example of the period that, Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said, showed how \u201cwatchmakers started from nothing, considered almost everything and pushed research beyond limits.\u201d Built between 1348 and 1364 by Giovanni de\u2019 Dondi, an Italian physician, astronomer and mechanical engineer, the clock was \u201cthe first mechanical device to display, in real time, the movement of the planets with remarkable accuracy,\u201d the author said. The original was lost in 1630 when Austrian forces sacked Mantua, Italy, so the model shown is a 1985 reproduction by Luigi Pippa, a Milanese watchmaker, now displayed in the Mus\u00e9e International d\u2019Horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. The three-and-a-half-foot tower has 107 moving parts and a dial on each of its seven sides showing features like the movements of the planets known in the 14th century: Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, as well as the sun and moon.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nRoyal flourish\n\nThe shape, lavish decoration and refined workmanship of this 1690 oak clock with oak pedestal defines Louis XIV\u2019s grand si\u00e8cle, Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said, adding, \u201cIts brilliance, richness and commercial value breaks definitively with the use of ebony associated with the ivory used in the preceding period, particularly austere.\u201d The king\u2019s favorite artisans were involved in making the piece, giving it some of their signature touches found in other timepieces at Versailles. For example, the tortoiseshell, engraved brass and pewter marquetry were hallmarks of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, the king\u2019s cabinetmaker and sculptor, and the eight-day, spring-wound brass and steel movement most likely was the work of Isaac II Thuret, the royal clockmaker. The gilded bronze dial has white enameled Arabic numerals and, like other timepieces of the late 17th century, the author said, it \u201cwas now accurate enough to indicate minutes.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRevolutionary power\n\nThe watchmaker who created this elaborate automaton clock in 1799 and 1800, during the second golden age of French clockmaking, showcased the profusion of dials, automatons and columns, Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said. The eight multicolored enamel dials showed elements like sunrise and sunset, the moon\u2019s age and phase, and both the Republican calendar (created during the French Revolution) and the traditional Gregorian calendar (risking imprisonment for both the watchmaker and owner, the author said). The blue enamel that Joseph Coteau, the renowned enameler, used for the clock \u201cwas so rare and difficult to perfect that few of his contemporaries managed to copy\u201d it, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnderstated style\n\nThis 1815 pocket watch, Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said, illustrates the work of Abraham-Louis Breguet, who revolutionized watchmaking with elegant cases, guilloch\u00e9 dials and tourbillons. The timepiece includes a guilloch\u00e9 gold case, guilloch\u00e9 silver dial, an hour dial in appliqu\u00e9d silver with a fast-slow indicator as well as an openwork aperture indicating moon phases on midnight blue enamel. The watchmaker\u2019s off-center dial already had become a signature design element \u2014 as had the 10-millimeter depth, made possible by flat mechanisms, so the timepiece could be less detectable in the pockets of the new tight clothing. \u201cThe demand of thin watches was dictated by a change in fashion,\u201d he said. Some of these features still are found in contemporary Breguet models, like the Classique 7787 with its hollow hands and moon phase indicator.\n\nPhoto\n\nPop Art\n\n\u201cThis watch, still produced, had a great impact because it broke with the traditional codes of watchmaking by its shape, colors and crowns,\u201d Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said. The Mach 2000 chronograph was designed in 1975 for the French watchmaker Lip by Roger Tallon, who was not a watchmaker. (He was well known for designing France\u2019s T.G.V. high-speed trains.) It used aluminum to produce a lightweight case, plastic for the red, yellow and blue pushers and rubber for the strap. \u201cBy making watchmakers adapt to the directives of the designers, which until then was the opposite, aesthetics, therefore beauty, becomes as important as technique,\u201d the author said. Lip revived the model in 2008 as an analog quartz chronograph with a brushed stainless steel case, calendar at 6 o\u2019clock and a black rubber strap; variations featured Arabic numerals and stainless steel straps.\n\nPhoto\n\nRobotic future\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, watchmakers looked to mythology, nature, and arts and crafts as inspiration. At MB&F, however, robotics was the spark that in 2015 produced Melchior, a table clock that stands almost a foot tall. While the robo-clock \u201cis treated in a fun way,\u201d Mr. Fl\u00e9chon said \u2014 with a rocket launcher and Gatling gun as arms and a visible escapement as the brain \u2014 it \u201ckeeps its traditional functionality.\u201d The jumping hours and sweeping minutes tell the digital time on Melchior\u2019s steel chest, his blinking eyes mark 20-second intervals and the 40-day power reserve is indicated on his shiny abs. There is even an old-school movement by the Swiss manufacturer L\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e 1839.\n\n", "title": "\u2018The Beauty of Time\u2019", "authors": ["Melanie Abrams"]}

While the band\u2019s music has consistently tangled with anxiety and inner conflict, the lyrics of \u201cBottom\u201d come from the perspective of a man on a crashing plane as he readies himself for oblivion.

{"date": "2018-02-03 00:00:00", "text": "Over the last year, Democrats have snatched away Republican seats in more than a dozen special legislative elections from Seattle and Tulsa, Okla., to Atlanta and Miami, in many cases electing female and minority candidates with strong turnout on the left.\n\nRepublicans will not be easily dislodged: In many states, Republican governors have built powerful machinery to defend their allies, and Mr. Trump remains popular enough across much of the Midwest and South to limit Democratic gains. In 31 out of 50 states, Republicans command the entire legislature; in 25 of those states, the governor is also a Republican.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut with some momentum behind Democrats \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the party appears positioned to make inroads in crucial legislatures, winning a new measure of relevance in state policy and perhaps limiting Republicans\u2019 influence on congressional redistricting after 2020.\n\nMatt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, the party\u2019s national hub for legislative campaigns, said Republicans were on the defensive in all but a few states. Citing Democratic turnout in recent special elections, Mr. Walter said Republicans should use the next nine months to sound the \u201calarm bells\u201d for their voters.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen in the special elections is a significant spike in the interest, engagement, spending and energy by the liberal Democrats and progressive movement,\u201d Mr. Walter said, adding: \u201cThe spending is real. The organizational prowess is real. And the energy is real.\u201d\n\nThat energy was on raucous display last weekend in the Bucks County borough of Newtown, where well over 100 Democrats packed into a red-brick tavern to cheer Steve Santarsiero, a Democrat seeking a State Senate seat left open by a Republican\u2019s unexpected retirement. Before a lively breakfast crowd, Mr. Santarsiero needled Mr. Trump and hailed his fellow Democrats running for the legislature\u2019s multiplying number of open seats.\n\nApplauding from the front was Helen Tai, an official in nearby Solebury who is running in a May special election for the State House prompted by a Republican\u2019s resignation. Democrats nearly swept local elections in four counties outside Philadelphia last November; Ms. Tai said the combination of Republican retirements and liberal enthusiasm had transformed the fight for the legislature.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI wish it was a presidential year,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to vote. They can\u2019t wait to vote.\u201d\n\nAdding to Republicans\u2019 unease are several unresolved lawsuits that could unravel carefully drawn maps in states like North Carolina and Texas. The United States Supreme Court is expected to consider a number of cases involving gerrymandered maps this year, and Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said the group is considering new litigation against state legislative districts in the Pennsylvania courts, which voided a Republican-drawn congressional map last month.\n\nMs. Post said special elections over the last year had revealed \u201cearly indicators of the wave.\u201d\n\nIn many of the biggest purple states, however, Democrats must overcome huge Republican majorities and forbidding legislative maps. In Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 120 seats in the 203-seat State House, and 34 of 50 in the State Senate.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough Republicans have thin majorities in a few states, like Colorado and Minnesota, the party is entrenched by gerrymandering across most of the Midwest and has long controlled Sun Belt prizes like Florida and Arizona.\n\nIn North Carolina, Republican legislators wield margins enormous enough to override a veto by Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, on a party-line vote in both chambers. For 2018, Mr. Cooper and state Democrats have announced a \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d campaign, not to capture either chamber, but merely to deprive Republicans of their supermajorities.\n\nRepresentative Darren Jackson, the Democratic leader in the North Carolina House, said there had been a surge in candidate recruitment, and Democrats plan to pursue more than five-dozen seats where Mr. Cooper won about 44 percent of the vote or more in 2016. They are especially hopeful about the areas around Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte \u2014 the state\u2019s three largest cities \u2014 which resemble suburbs in other states that have turned on Republicans.\n\nBut Mr. Jackson takes an unromantic view of his party\u2019s prospects. A screen saver on his laptop cycles through headlines from when Mr. Trump won the presidency, as a reminder that any anticipated victory can evaporate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in challenging incumbents, even in fairly red areas,\u201d Mr. Jackson said, cautioning: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have good candidates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocratic legislators in several states said in interviews that they were waiting on a major trove of data related to last year\u2019s elections in Virginia, where a coalition of educated white, young and minority voters delivered the party a 15-seat gain in the House of Delegates. State leaders say they intend to use that information to hunt for targets even in areas with unfriendly district lines.\n\nRepublicans are most concerned about a collection of big states where they hold at least one legislative chamber by a narrower majority. In Florida, they hold the State Senate with 23 of 40 seats, and in Arizona both chambers tilt Republican by five seats or fewer. Mike Gardner, a former Arizona legislator who is now a Republican lobbyist, predicted Republicans would keep power in that state, but noted surging energy in the \u201chatred-toward-Trump camp.\u201d\n\nState Representative Jose R. Oliva of Miami Lakes, a Republican in line to be speaker of the Florida House, doubted Democrats could win either chamber, but said Mr. Trump might hobble Republicans in the ultra-diverse communities in and around Miami. Democrats picked off a State Senate seat there in 2017, though they have faced their own woes, including the resignation of a state party chairman amid harassment allegations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Trump won the state in 2016 and, with the help of gerrymandered districts, Republicans began last year with 20 of 33 State Senate seats.\n\nBut that number recently shrank to 18 after the Democrats\u2019 special election upset and with another vacancy. Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term, called Republicans\u2019 defeat in a red district on the Minnesota border a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d and party strategists are monitoring the Milwaukee suburbs, a cornerstone of Mr. Walker\u2019s political coalition, for signs of unrest.\n\nState Senator Chris Larson, a Democrat, said a special election fought in below-freezing temperatures had buoyed Democrats who had grown accustomed to disappointment. \u201cA lot of skepticism by Democrats is starting to melt away,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not Mr. Trump alone mobilizing Democrats down ballot. In some states, Republicans have been in charge long enough to generate their own cloud of fatigue. In moderate areas where Mr. Trump is toxic, some voters have also tired of Republican policies \u2014 on abortion, guns and environmental regulation \u2014 championed by rural legislators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a meeting of the liberal group Indivisible in Eagleville, Pa., last month, Democratic activists railed not just against Mr. Trump, but also against Republicans in Harrisburg, the state capital, accusing them of wringing money from suburban voters while neglecting local schools and infrastructure. Katie Muth, a leader of the group who is running for State Senate, declared from the front of a Unitarian church that 2018 was the moment to \u201csave Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity is likely to help. Pam Hacker, an electrician running for the State House, said she rarely brings up the president, but sees him alienating communities that once voted Republican.\n\n\u201cIt is a new Republican Party,\u201d she said, \u201cand I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a friendly face.\u201d", "title": "\u2018They Can\u2019t Wait to Vote\u2019: Energized Democrats Target Dominant G.O.P. in Statehouses", "authors": ["Alexander Burns", "Alan Blinder"]}

In your almost 20 years of working here, you\u2019ve witnessed and helped shepherd the company\u2019s transformation from a print-only newspaper to a digital platform. When you first arrived here in 1998, what was the latest newsroom technology and what were the steepest technological learning curves?\n\nI love this question. I came to The Times when I was still in journalism school. I was an intern. I had always been this kind of tech nut. Not an expert at anything, just an early-ish adopter of a lot.\n\nI found it immensely exciting that The Times had its very own website, which was updated I think once per day. I don\u2019t remember what the art looked like. But I do remember thinking that the Times website was like space age.\n\nThe load time was really short. I just remember being really impressed by it. But there was no general awareness in the newsroom that there was a website.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople knew about it, but they didn\u2019t think about it. At that time, you weren\u2019t thinking about how things were going to play on the web.

It was not part of the core news operation by any stretch.\n\nWhat other technological transformations have you witnessed in the newsroom?\n\nIn those days, we didn\u2019t have Slack. People in the newsroom mostly communicated through this system called Atex. You could direct message through Atex. You had to know everyone\u2019s name. It was the first two letters of first name and first four of last name. I was \u201cmodrak.\u201d It was really easy to make mistakes and send your message to the wrong person!\n\nOver the years, The Times\u2019s website steadily got better. It went through all of the changes at the same pace as other websites. At one point, I think we realized you can\u2019t just report stories until end of day and publish them all around midnight. If stories are happening throughout the day, we need to put them up.\n\nSo we created a continuous news desk to handle that. That was a big change.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve changed our content management system a few times. And we\u2019re getting another new system soon. The changes aren\u2019t easy. But the dedication to the mission of what we\u2019re doing means that we\u2019re all game to figure these things out.\n\nOver the years The New York Times has been criticized for failing to diversify the gender and race of its staff and leadership.

In a case like that, we can shape donated bone or combine several pieces of bone to create a bone graft that will fit that particular patient. As another example, we shape skin grafts to fit a breast implant for a woman having breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. We clean the tissue and sometimes treat it with chemicals that remove the cells \u2014 a process called decellularization. We also have it tested to make sure it can\u2019t transmit any infection to the person who receives it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is your background?\n\nI was studying to be an architect in Colombia, where I grew up. When my family emigrated to the United States I continued my studies, but I had responsibilities that made it too difficult to finish, so I became a technician at an auto dealer. I thought I needed medical experience for this job, but I didn\u2019t. I received intensive training and had to learn about anatomy.\n\nHow did you get this job?\n\nIn 2002 I told a friend who worked here that I couldn\u2019t grow any more at my job, and he said there were openings at his company. I was reluctant about applying because I thought I\u2019d be squeamish doing this type of work, and my family was against it. My mother and grandmother are very religious and thought the soul and body should stay together after death. After I saw how this work helps the living, I had a different view of life and death.
