This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles \u2014 sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal \u2014 while tamping down their heat.

Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck.\n\nMr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn\u2019t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about.\n\nIt provides the ground floor of about half the things you will eat. Pressed and griddled \u2014 in good weather, this is done outside on a domed comal set over a fire \u2014 the masa becomes the small warm tortillas that are folded into shrimp tacos with an unusually complex chipotle sauce. Larger fried tortillas are the foundation of tostadas, which can be quite the productions here: turkey in salsa with a flicker of heat soothed by crema and mashed avocados; raw yellowfin tuna with blood oranges and puffs of fried pork skin and a whiff of smoke from Oaxacan pasilla chiles.\n\n", "title": "Oaxaca on the Gowanus: The Charms and Chiles of Claro", "authors": []}

Meanwhile, many of those with higher incomes \u2014 up to 400 percent of the poverty line, or more than $95,000 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for subsidies. That\u2019s 59 percent of the population, but because many of those with higher incomes get insurance through their employers, it\u2019s 83 percent of those signing up on the exchanges. And here\u2019s the thing: Those subsidies aren\u2019t fixed. Instead, the formula sets the subsidy high enough to put a limit on how high premium payments can go as a percentage of income.\n\nWhat this means is that of the 27 million Americans who have either gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion or purchased insurance on the exchanges, only about two million are exposed to those Trump-engineered premium hikes. That\u2019s still a lot of people, but it\u2019s not enough to get a death spiral going. In fact, for complicated reasons (\u201csilver-loading\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t ask), after-subsidy premiums have actually gone down for many people.\n\nAnd that leaves the G.O.P. very, very frustrated.\n\nFrom the beginning, Republicans hated Obamacare not because they expected it to fail, but because they feared that it would succeed, and thereby demonstrate that government actually can do things to make people\u2019s lives better. And their nightmare is gradually coming true: Although it took a long time, the Affordable Care Act is finally becoming popular, and the public\u2019s concern that the G.O.P. will kill it is becoming an important political liability.\n\nWhat this says to me is that if Republicans manage to hold on to Congress, they will make another all-out push to destroy the act \u2014 because they\u2019ll know that it\u2019s probably their last chance. Indeed, if they don\u2019t kill Obamacare soon, the next step will probably be an enhanced program that lets Americans of all ages buy into Medicare.\n\nSo voters are right to believe that health care is very much an issue in the midterm elections.

The document says the changes would result in a 35 percent reduction in inter-confederation games played from 48 to 31 over a four year cycle. Still, the expansion would likely mean more games for the world\u2019s top talent. Lionel Messi has played in just two Club World Cup matches the past six years.\n\nJust one European team currently plays in the Club World Cup. Under one proposed format, Europe would provide 12 teams, far more than any other continent.

That would largely serve to line the pockets of the richest clubs. FIFA would also provide leagues and nonparticipating clubs with 5 percent of revenue, which it says is sufficient \u201cto maintain the competitive balance at club level and to produce better champions for future editions,\u201d according to the document.\n\nThe commercial strategy for the tournament fits neatly with recent developments in China, which has been on a major push to promote soccer, and switch from one of the sport\u2019s also-rans into a major player.

Among the hosting requirements for FIFA are countries that are prepared to pay a fee, that have high growth potential for the sport and for their own top clubs.\n\nSaudi officials have also expressed interest in hosting the tournament, which would fit ambitious plans to grow the country\u2019s leisure sector.

Mary Fallin instituted new or higher taxes on oil and gas production, tobacco, motor fuels, and online sales. The state will also allow ball and dice gambling, which will be taxed.\n\n\u201cThe big win happened before the walkout started,\u201d said Brent Bushey, executive director of the Oklahoma Public School Resource Center, which provides administrative services for small school districts. \u201cIt is a short-term win, but my focus is how do we turn this into a long-term focus on education.\u201d\n\nGregg Garn, the dean of the college of education at the University of Oklahoma, said that who won or lost is yet to be determined. \u201cThe teachers clearly were able to make some good strides,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, if candidates that support education get elected, that\u2019s what will determine who won or lost.\u201d\n\nSome teachers seemed ambivalent about ending the walkout.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I agree 100 percent with us stopping this walkout, but I do understand,\u201d said Cory Williams, a teacher at George Washington Carver Middle School in Tulsa, who participated in days of protests at the Capitol. \u201cWe are going to get to the point where it is an unstoppable force meets an unmovable object.

He said that because oil and gas prices are volatile, the new production tax was \u201ca raw deal for teachers\u201d and pointed to other areas where taxes could have been raised.\n\n\u201cOklahoma has eliminated $1 billion in personal income tax,\u201d he said, referring to some estimates of lost state revenue from cuts in recent years. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s political will to do a personal income tax hike.\u201d\n\nAllies of the industry may try to introduce a ballot referendum to reverse the increase in production taxes.\n\nAs in West Virginia, rank-and-file teachers started the walkout movement by organizing on Facebook, at first without much help from unions. The Oklahoma Education Association gave legislators until late April to provide new revenues or face a walkout, but teachers protested and pushed the union to adopt an April 1 deadline. In Oklahoma, union membership is optional for teachers. Still, the large rallies, marches and lobbying that developed around the walkout would not have been possible without the muscle of state and national labor organizations.\n\nParents, too, participated in protests. Lanae DeArman of Sulphur, Okla., joined picketing teachers at the Capitol, lobbying her representatives to raise taxes to fund education.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "That\u2019s because if the boomers were destructive, they were also creative. Indeed, you can make a reasonable case that theirs was the last great burst of creativity in Western history, the last great surge of mass cultural invention. The boomers were the last generation to come of age with some traditional edifices still standing, the old bourgeois norms and Christian(ish) religion and patriotic history, which gave them something powerful to wrestle with, to rework and react against and attempt to overthrow. And because they came of age within a stable-seeming (though not for long) common culture, their revolution was experienced as a communal experience itself, something that united millions of people simply by virtue of their being young and Western in 1965 or 1969 or 1975.\n\nIn an essay on \u201cGolden Ages\u201d in his \u201cPrejudices: Philosophical Dictionary,\u201d Robert Nisbet argued that a great period of ferment and achievement often features a \u201cdialectical antinomy.\u201d This is a fancy way of saying that you need ideas and trends and forces in tension with each other (community and individualism, the secular and the sacred, new ideas and settled consensus, younger and older generations) to ignite what he calls \u201cthe blaze of creativity.\u201d We can debate just how golden their achievements really were, but in hindsight his description applies to the period of the boomer takeover \u2014 it was the tension between a multitudinous younger generation\u2019s utopianism and libertinism and mysticism and an older generation\u2019s attachment to patriotism and family and religion that shaped and stamped the rise of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, the rebel cinema of the 1970s, the New Age reinvention of religion, the New Journalism and the postmodern wave in the academy and the libertarian ascendancy in the G.O.P. and more.\n\nIn the movies and television, this tension led to an extended reworking, deconstruction and reinvention of classic American genres (the Western, the war movie, the gangster flick, the sitcom), something that happened first in cinema and then extended more gradually into TV. What we often think of as two golden ages \u2014 the auteur years in 1970s Hollywood, and then the more recent golden age of television \u2014 are really part of the same generational takeover; it just took longer for boomer influence to work itself out on the small screen. But it did eventually: what David Chase did with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and David Simon with \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and before them figures like the just-passed Steven Bochco and Matt Groening and yes, Roseanne Barr, was all an extension and an echo of the era-defining pop cultural ferment that began in the 1960s and took off in 1970s.\n\nBut now we are in the twilight of that era \u2014 and it is not at all clear that the boomers\u2019 successors are prepared to react against boomer hegemony with anything like the same creativity and vigor. In part that\u2019s because technological and social change has left the rising cohorts of Americans fragmented, polarized, alienated from one another, too divided by belief and taste and language to build something new together. And in part it\u2019s because the boomers themselves contributed mightily to fragmentation, leaving too little standing when they tore things down and rebuilding haphazardly and self-interestedly, bequeathing a spirit of transgression and permanent revolution that\u2019s run out of things to deconstruct and is either feeding on itself, lapsing into torpor, or generating niche forms of radicalism on the further left and right that are too weak as yet to produce revolution or renewal. (Indeed it is not a coincidence that conservatism, itself decadent in this late-boomer dispensation, is desperate to claim boomer culture for its own \u2014 think of Ted Cruz\u2019s love of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d or the new pro-\u201cRoseanne\u201d ardor on the right.)\n\nAs Nisbet writes in the same essay, golden ages give way to ages of iron very easily. \u201cIf there is no community,\u201d then \u201cthere is nothing to challenge, nothing to fuel the dynamism\u201d required for a golden age, and if there is nothing but transgression and dissent, there is nothing to give acts of transgression the \u201cpurpose, substance and meaning\u201d that make them something more than just puerile self-indulgence. Both problems define our age; everyone fancies themselves a rebel, even Sean Hannity and Donald Trump, but the traditional forms and structures that would give rebellion purpose and clarity exist only through as effigies to be torn down in ritual re-enactments of the original revolution, now decades in the past.\n\nAnd so we just keep returning to boomer culture \u2014 revisiting its glorious victories or simply replaying its greatest hits. The same week that \u201cRoseanne\u201d hit it big, the number one movie in America was Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One\u201d \u2014 an aging boomer director telling a story saturated in nostalgia for the pop culture that defined his peak artistic years. And the big Easter television event was the live performance of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d a musical that the baby boomer Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote at the tender age of 22, in a world where a rock-opera retelling of the passion still had a Christian culture to draw from, react against, enlighten and offend.", "title": "Opinion | Old Boomers Never Die", "authors": []}

In the early days, the group hunkered down in a remote cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, where they grew corn, made whiskey and serenaded their neighbors over CB radio, intent on experiencing an old-fashioned, subsistence lifestyle while they internalized a repertoire of hillbilly, jug band and prewar blues songs that, as Mr. Secor put it, \u201cchampioned America\u2019s underclass.\u201d\n\nTo Mr. Secor and his cohorts, living as hardy homesteaders was part of committing their imaginations to traditional music. \u201cHow can you utilize that when you\u2019re a prep school kid, or your mom works at the college and you grew up on Cheerios, and you\u2019re as far from a coal mine as you are from equatorial Africa?\u201d he asked, nodding to his own background. \u201cThe way that you do it is that you put on the mask and embody it.\u201d\n\nOld Crow did a lot of street-corner busking in those days, which was how the band got the attention of the influential flat-picking guitarist Doc Watson and Marty Stuart, a multifaceted champion of country tradition. Mr. Stuart saw them as carrying on a lineage of wild and woolly string band showmanship stretching back to the 1920s and \u201930s. \u201cThey filled that slot that was absolutely part of the foundational vision of the Grand Ole Opry,\u201d Mr. Stuart said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd they do it in a beautiful, 21st-century, contemporary, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, old-time way.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, Old Crow was embraced by the more austere old-time duo Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, held up at the time as leading lights of alt-country. With Mr. Rawlings producing, the band released a self-titled album, followed by \u201cBig Iron World,\u201d and emerged ahead of a flood of energetically earnest acoustic acts, including Mumford & Sons.

Its most-covered track, \u201cWagon Wheel\u201d \u2014 a sauntering road song that Mr. Secor completed at 17 from a Bob Dylan fragment \u2014 topped the country chart in a version by Darius Rucker. In a single week in 2013, the band was given both Opry membership and the Americana Music Association\u2019s Trailblazer Award. Then the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum invited the group to reinterpret the entirety of Dylan\u2019s opus \u201cBlonde on Blonde\u201d in conjunction with an exhibit. A live album, \u201c50 Years of Blonde on Blonde,\u201d which came out in 2017, was the group\u2019s first major-label release.\n\nAfter Old Crow had played nothing but reimagined Dylan covers for months, Mr. Cobb advised the group to save the finessing of its own new material for the studio. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t arrange [the songs],\u2019\u201d Mr. Fuqua recalled. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t play them live. Don\u2019t do anything, but just come in.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn \u201cVolunteer,\u201d the group incorporates instrumental textures like pedal steel and electric guitar here and there that weren\u2019t as prominent on past recordings. With its frisky, empathetic take on an immigrant\u2019s plight, \u201cA World Away\u201d exemplifies Old Crow\u2019s signature mixture of social-statement-making and yarn-spinning entertainment. And the willful protagonist of the wild-eyed romp \u201cShout Mountain Music\u201d more or less sums up the band\u2019s ethic: \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna change my sound when I get to Nashville town/Shouting mountain music all night long.\u201d\n\nReleasing this music on a major label is a slyly contrarian victory for Old Crow, a chance for the group to gain a bigger platform while staying true to its priorities. \u201cWhat the band can do,\u201d Mr. Secor said, \u201cis be the exact same band that it was on the street corner.\u201d", "title": "Old Crow Medicine Show Looks to the Future While Picking at the Past", "authors": ["Jewly Hight"]}

But very little, in the end, went right for Casspi in the Bay Area.\n\nWith the start of the playoffs a week away, Casspi was summoned by team officials Saturday night after the 80th of 82 games and informed that he was being waived to make roster room to convert the reserve guard Quinn Cook\u2019s two-way developmental contract into a full-fledged N.B.A. contract before the postseason began.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith Curry expected to miss at least the first round of the playoffs because of a sprained knee, someone had to be cut so the Warriors could make the unexpectedly productive Cook playoff-eligible as Curry\u2019s stand-in.\n\nGolden State\u2019s options came down to cutting Casspi or waiving someone from its center-by-committee sextet of Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell, David West, JaVale McGee, Kevon Looney and Damian Jones. A stubborn ankle injury that held Casspi out of his final 11 games as a Warrior, following an earlier back issue, proved to be the clincher.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult to sit with him and tell him we were going to do this,\u201d Kerr told reporters Sunday night in Phoenix. \u201cBut it was the only decision we could make under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThis is the second consecutive season in which the Warriors have been forced to make such an unkind cut. In February 2017, after promising to sign the savvy Spanish playmaker Jose Calderon in the wake of Calderon\u2019s release by the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State had to abruptly let Calderon go without granting him a single second in uniform. In Calderon\u2019s case, it was a similarly severe knee sprain sustained by Durant which necessitated the addition of a forward (Matt Barnes) as opposed to a guard.\n\nWaiving Casspi at this juncture is painful in its own way, since the Warriors are well aware he took less money than he could have earned elsewhere on the open market and, worse, is ineligible to appear in the playoffs for another team this spring because he was not released by March 1. But the loss of Curry \u2014 as well as Kerr\u2019s belief that he will need every big man he can muster to get to a fourth successive N.B.A. finals \u2014 left little alternative.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven though Casspi has been healthy enough to log 10 or more minutes only five times since January, his detractors would argue that he might have convinced the Warriors to keep him had he shown a greater willingness to shoot 3-pointers. Despite its freewheeling reputation, Golden State is actually sorely lacking when it comes to trusty floor-spacers off the bench.\n\nCasspi, though, attempted only 22 3-pointers in his 53 games as a Warrior. This naturally puzzled local observers who will never forget the sight of Casspi, then a member of the Sacramento Kings, tying a franchise record by hitting nine 3-pointers en route to 36 points in a breathtaking shooting duel with Curry at Oracle Arena on Dec. 28, 2015.\n\nYet Casspi, in last month\u2019s interview, revealed that Kerr never asked him to change his game. Casspi\u2019s best moments in Golden State came when he was moving off the ball and cutting backdoor, capitalizing on the distractions provided by his more celebrated teammates. He averaged 11.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game in his seven starts while shooting nearly 59 percent from the floor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

I talked to Steve about it several times, and he always said, \u2018Keep playing the way you\u2019re playing.\u2019\u201d\n\nCasspi thus remains convinced it\u2019s simply an unfortunate numbers game caused by injuries \u2014 Curry\u2019s and his own \u2014 that will keep him atop the list of active players with the most regular-season games played (552) to never taste the postseason, narrowly ahead of his close friend, DeMarcus Cousins, the All-Star center of the New Orleans Pelicans (535).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the case for the last two years. Every time I hit my stride, something happens,\u201d Casspi said, referring to the broken thumb he suffered in his first game as a member of the Pelicans last season, following the trade that sent him and Cousins to New Orleans.\n\nOne inevitably wonders what happens now in Casspi\u2019s basketball-crazed homeland, which had been eagerly awaiting the sight of Casspi, who turns 30 in June, stepping onto the biggest stage in the sport as a member of the team that two championships in the last three seasons.

And now every day I miss calling my mother (I never took her contact out of the \u201cfavorites\u201d list on my phone, though the number no longer works) and I miss walking through the city with her holding my arm, and urging her to order fancy cocktails and hearing her talk about teaching and her students and editing her writing and just checking in with her, about her life and my life, and my children\u2019s lives, and the weather, and her latest computer travails.\n\nSo why does it feel surprising to me, that I am an orphan? I didn\u2019t know this when I was young, but the world is full of orphans in their 50s, their 60s, their 70s, and I think that many of them \u2014 many of us \u2014 are regularly surprised to remember and acknowledge our status. When I had my own children, I think I did realize that I had turned into a parent, and would be one for life, but I\u2019m not sure that I realized how very definitely I would also remain my parents\u2019 child, also for life. So I am turning 60, and I think about being an orphan.

In fact, I thought orphan was a rather romantic storybook word, suggestive of children cast out to have adventures in a cruel uncaring world \u2014 \u201cOliver Twist,\u201d \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cThe Secret Garden,\u201d \u201cA Little Princess,\u201d \u201cEscape to Witch Mountain\u201d (I grew up before \u201cThe BFG\u201d or \u201cHarry Potter\u201d). Or orphans might perhaps be adopted into quirky loving families \u2014 I was attached to a book called \u201cThe Family Nobody Wanted,\u201d a 1954 memoir by Helen Doss about adopting a dozen children from different ethnic groups.\n\nLike many children, I was also rather fascinated by the idea of orphanages, which I imagined dotted the landscape, housing children whose parents had died tragically. In fact, through their long history, orphanages and foundling homes often took in children with living parents who for reasons of poverty or social disapproval could not care for them. As a pediatrician, I wrote about the evidence of how institutions have not turned out to be healthy places for children to grow up, either physically or psychologically, and they have mostly closed in the United States and western Europe; J.K. Rowling has made it her cause to end orphanage care for children and get them into family placements.\n\nBut as a child, I read and reread a series by Natalie Savage Carlson about a French girls\u2019 institution including such titles as \u201cThe Happy Orpheline\u201d and \u201cA Brother for the Orphelines.\u201d The first book carries this online summary: \u201cThe orphanage is home to 20 happy little girls whose greatest fear is that they will be adopted and have to leave \u2026\u201d\n\nSo to me, back then, an orphan was by definition a child, whether ragged and wandering alone through the world or living in an orphanage or triumphantly adopted; the very term raised the question of who was taking care of the child. What could that possibly have to do with adults?\n\nI don\u2019t particularly need taking care of \u2014 in fact, part of what I miss is taking care of my mother \u2014 but I guess I miss that sense of being watched and tracked and cared about, as I watch and track and care about my own children, even as they get older and more independent.\n\nYes, I miss having my parents. Wednesday would have been their 65th anniversary, and I wish they were here to celebrate that happy 1950s marriage. Yes, I know I was lucky to have them as long as I did, and lucky that they were who they were. I\u2019m grateful and I miss them, and I\u2019m surprised that they aren\u2019t here, because I\u2019m their child after all (their aging child) and shouldn\u2019t they be out there, watching the world, watching me, being my parents?", "title": "On Being an Orphan, Frequently", "authors": ["Perri Klass", "The Checkup"]}

Bolton.\n\nHow these new players will mesh with Mr. Trump\u2019s throwback persona may determine whether the president is signaling a midcourse correction in foreign policy or merely retreating to phrases and positions that give him comfort.\n\nMr. Tillerson and General McMaster curbed some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most radical ideas \u2014 convincing him, for example, not to rip up the Iran nuclear deal. Along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, they talked him into deploying more troops to Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton, analysts predict, will bend more readily to Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes. Add to that a difficult midterm election, which aides say will make the president determined to cater to his political base. And, after more than a year in office, they say Mr. Trump is more confident that his instincts are the right ones.\n\n\u201cHe has been very consistent essentially since the 1980s,\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, a former under secretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cHe knows very little about the world, about history, about the policy details. But he does have strong convictions and they are remarkably durable and apparently impervious to contrary evidence.\u201d\n\nThey include, Mr. Edelman said, the belief that his predecessors were gullible, and that he will do better; that allies have exploited the United States, and must pay back their debts; that free trade is bad; and that military force should be used sparingly, but that \u201cwe should be strong and scary and that will make people afraid to screw with us.\u201d\n\nAll those convictions were on vivid display in the East Room on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump reiterated his contention that the North American Free Trade Agreement is \u201ca phenomenal deal for Mexico\u201d and a \u201chorrible deal for the United States.\u201d Mexico, he complained, ran a trade surplus of more than $100 billion with the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe claimed that no one had been tougher on Russia than him, pointing to his recently passed $700 billion defense budget.

But he slammed other NATO members for not paying their fair share of the alliance\u2019s costs.\n\nNor did Mr. Trump spare a more favored ally, Saudi Arabia, which he said was pressing the United States to stay militarily engaged in Syria. The White House said the president spoke on Monday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, and Mr. Trump seemed to refer to the conversation at the news conference. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, you know, you want us to stay, maybe you\u2019re going to have to pay,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks, which came two weeks after he welcomed the king\u2019s heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to the White House, left some senior officials shaking their heads. They also created a split-screen moment that is becoming all too common in Washington.\n\nEven as he was talking about withdrawing the 2,000 remaining United States troops in Syria and cutting more than $200 million in recovery aid there, the administration\u2019s point man for combating the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, was making the case across town for more aid and troops staying until the job is done.\n\nSpeaking at the United States Institute of Peace, Mr. McGurk said the $100 million the United States has already spent on recovery aid \u2014 used to clear away unexploded bombs and clean up giant piles of war rubble in Raqqa \u2014 was essential to allow many of the one million displaced residents to return home.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s order to suspend the future aid, pending a review, \u201cis not hampering our work in the field,\u201d Mr. McGurk insisted. He also seemed to suggest that American troops were not leaving anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Syria to fight ISIS,\u201d Mr. McGurk said. \u201cThat is our mission.

And he will be working with his son, Cl\u00e9ment.\n\n\u201cI was born above a cellar in Morey-St.-Denis and grew up among barrels and vats, working with my father,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have some blood in my wine, not wine in my blood.\u201d\n\nMr. Ponsot, 63, lean and voluble with salt-and-pepper hair that once hung past his shoulders but is now trimmed neatly, said his new label would simply be \u201cLaurent Ponsot,\u201d which he said represented not an estate or a house, but simply an \u201centity.\u201d The name was selected not out of vanity, he said, but as an assumption of responsibility for what is in the bottle.\n\nDomaine Ponsot was best known for its grand cru Burgundies, in particular its Clos de la Roche, a vineyard named for the rockiness of its limestone soils \u2014 a character expressed, as the French wine writer Jacky Rigaux once put it, \u201cto the chagrin of pickaxes and ploughs but to the delight of the roots that can penetrate into the depths of the parent rock.\u201d\n\nMr. Ponsot will continue to make some grand crus, though no Clos de la Roche. But he said he will also focus on less exalted, and less expensive appellations.\n\n\u201cWhen I left Domaine Ponsot,\u201d he said, \u201cI traveled and asked people in the trade, \u2018I\u2019m starting from zero; what do you want me to produce?\u2019 They said, \u2018Bourgogne rouge et blanc, and then villages.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThese are the lower levels of the Burgundy hierarchy, in which vineyard areas are ranked on their potential to produce distinctive wines. Regional wines like Bourgogne Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc are made of pinot noir or chardonnay, just like their grander counterparts. But while they may be delicious, they theoretically offer no distinct sense of place beyond a general Burgundy character.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbove these are village wines, which may express the personality of places like Meursault, Gevrey-Chambertin or Chambolle-Musigny, all of which Mr. Ponsot will produce. Still more distinctive are premier cru wines, from particular vineyards within villages that have the potential to produce better wines, and, at the top, the grand crus, which receive no village designation because the vineyards themselves are so singular.\n\nAs Burgundy has gained popularity around the world in recent decades, these grand cru wines, made in minute quantities, have become exorbitantly expensive, leading in part to counterfeiting, as in the Kurniawan case.\n\n\u201cYou have people pricing these wines at insane levels,\u201d Mr. Ponsot said. \u201cSeventy percent of grand cru is drunk by people who know nothing about wine. This makes the pricing crazy.\u201d\n\nAt such prices, he said, bottles from the most esteemed estates like Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti become status symbols or investments that are rarely enjoyed for their intrinsic beauty.\n\n\u201cI want to produce wines that people can open and enjoy,\u201d Mr. Ponsot said. \u201cNot one in two bottles of D.R.C. is ever opened.\u201d\n\nIf the current situation makes Mr. Ponsot angry, it is primarily because he passionately loves Burgundy and its defining notion of terroir: that the best wines can express the qualities of where the grapes were grown and the culture of the people who made them. He hates to see a distortion of what it represents.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

My whole life I have been believing in terroir.\u201d\n\nThis faith in terroir, and a desire that people understand it better, has led Mr. Ponsot to his most ambitious, and perhaps most outlandish, idea for the future.\n\nHe wants to build a visitor center, to be called Villa Vinum, set on five acres among the vines of the C\u00f4te de Nuits, not far from the Clos de Vougeot. The multilevel center will use virtual reality, interactive screens, films, performances, conferences and a library, with the purpose of educating people about the wines, vineyards and terroir of Burgundy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe futuristic design, which Mr. Ponsot said he came up with in conjunction with Cicada, a landscape architecture firm based in Singapore, and Eric Poillot, a Dijon architect, will integrate the complex with his new winery, a restaurant, a boutique and a wine shop.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe emphasized that Villa Vinum would not be a museum. Rather, he said, it would be focused on the future. The project, he estimated, would cost 20 million euros. He said he hoped to break ground in 2020 or 2021. While he is committed to his vision, he said he also found it a bit daunting.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a little na\u00efve, otherwise you do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI am scared of this, but it activates my blood.\u201d\n\nMr. Ponsot has never taken the easy way. While he knew early on that he wanted to work in the vines, he said he would not have felt challenged had he never left Burgundy. Instead, he said, he hid his early passion for wine and left to see the world.\n\nEventually, he opened a travel agency in Paris, married and had three children. Only in his early 30s did he decide to return to the family domaine. He still will not elaborate on why he left it last year. Domaine Ponsot is now run by his sister Rose-Marie.\n\nHis aim at Laurent Ponsot, he said, is to make \u201chaute couture\u201d wines.\n\n\u201cI want to work on each element, from planting the vine to presentation of the wine on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t grow the grapes, the grapes I buy must be perfect, in my opinion. Every detail is important.\u201d\n\nIn his winemaking, as in his new visitor center, Mr. Ponsot combines a reverence for history with an appreciation of what technology can offer. He farms without chemicals, but refuses to adhere to any sort of agricultural ideology, which he describes as restrictive. He avoids sulfur dioxide, but protects the wine in vats with layers of neutral gas.\n\nStung by fraud, he says his bottles will be equipped with microchips to assure their provenance. And cases will carry temperature sensors so that customers can be sure they have not been mishandled in transportation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ponsot has always avoided the use of new oak barrels because he dislikes the oaky flavor that they can impart, but he has continued to use older barrels because they permit the slow oxygenation of the wine as it rests in the winery.

Children waded into the water at the river\u2019s edge and a man fished near a smoky barbecue grill. A rooster crowed as a soldier wiped smudges from the lenses of his binoculars with his uniform. A white car peeled out on the Mexican side and then sped out of the neighborhood; one soldier noticed that it was the car\u2019s third pass-through that afternoon.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d a man on the Mexican side shouted at the troops.\n\nThe soldiers ignored him, and kept their binoculars trained ahead.\n\nAt the observation posts and at the Guard\u2019s armory headquarters in the nearby town of Weslaco, the troops could be seen embarking on two seemingly contradictory missions: standing out, and blending in.\n\nUp high on the edges of the river, the troops were meant to be seen and feared. They were heavily armed, dressed in battle fatigues and equipped with military vehicles. The chatter from their radios filled the air.\n\nBut out on the streets of the South Texas cities they traveled through, they were all but invisible as they sat in ordinary civilian pickup trucks. Many people still associate the calling-up of the National Guard with disasters and riots, and the troops\u2019 lack of visibility in border communities is an attempt to soften their presence. Aiming to allay criticism that the deployments turn border cities into militarized zones, officials have taken steps to demilitarize the look of their operations.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt one point on Tuesday, troops in a minivan and Ford 4x4 pickup trucks sat for a long time at a four-way stop as a group of high school students got off a yellow school bus. Many of the students crossing the streets did not look twice at the waiting vehicles. They had interrupted a military convoy that was cutting through their town, but didn\u2019t know it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Texas, the National Guard had already been deployed on the border as part of a state-ordered call-up, and this low-key visibility in border cities has helped ease any worries that the military was invading.\n\n\u201cThey were just embedded so efficiently that really you couldn\u2019t tell that they were out there,\u201d said Pete Saenz, the mayor of the border city of Laredo who supports the new deployment of troops. \u201cIf they do it the way it\u2019s been done, using the National Guard the way it\u2019s been done in the past, I think it\u2019s acceptable.\u201d\n\nAs part of the president\u2019s order, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that Texas would deploy more than 1,000 troops to the state\u2019s 1,200-mile border with Mexico, adding about 300 troops a week to the current contingent of about 250 troops. Mr. Trump said he expects a total of 2,000 to 4,000 troops along the southwest border, including additional deployments in New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nIn an interview on Fox Business on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott said the Guard presence on the border has no end date in sight as the Trump administration seeks to complete a border wall.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be there, I perceive, for a long time \u2014 years \u2014 because if you just look at what the president said, he said that this is a gap filler until he gets funding for the wall and greater border security,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe are prepared for the long run to have National Guard presence there, to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to better secure the border.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGov. Jerry Brown of California said on Wednesday that his state, too, will accept federal funding to add about 400 National Guard troops, to help combat transnational criminal gangs, human trafficking and the smuggling of drugs and weapons along the border.\n\nCalifornia presently has about 250 Guard members employed in such operations, including 55 along the Mexico border.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s be crystal clear on the scope of this mission,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement. \u201cThis will not be a mission to build a new wall. It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life. And the California National Guard will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn South Texas, the observation posts are the front lines of the stepped-up border operation.\n\nAt the cliffside post that spotted the raft (it was unclear whether it was carrying people or cargo), the soldiers\u2019 headquarters had four big wheels: a green Humvee. Mounted on top of the vehicle was not a machine gun but a giant optic system \u2014 effectively a boxy, superpowered pair of binoculars \u2014 and next to a rear tire, a red portable cooler. The cross-saber insignia spray-painted next to the driver\u2019s door was left over from a different mission. One soldier was operating the Humvee\u2019s optic system, while the others paced back and forth on the cliff, watching. They wore sunglasses, combat fatigues, canteens and steel-plated body armor.

Rick Perry, then the governor, sent 1,000 troops to the border in July of that year and his successor, Mr. Abbott, kept the troops there, though in smaller numbers. About 100 troops were stationed on the Texas border when Mr. Trump ordered the new deployment.\n\nOfficials say the troop presence is freeing up Border Patrol agents to focus on apprehensions. The soldiers are prevented from detaining immigrants trying to illegally cross into the United States. A Defense Department deployment memo stated that National Guard personnel \u201cwill not perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants or other persons detained\u201d without the approval of the secretary of defense, and are to be armed only in \u201ccircumstances that might require self-defense.\u201d\n\nYet such deployments are costly, and have not been without controversy in tax-conscious Texas.\n\nThe use of civilian rental vehicles illustrates the expense of border deployments, both in the state-run mobilization and the new one ordered by the president. The rentals prevent wear and tear on military vehicles, and also help troops blend into civilian communities. In 2016, Texas National Guard documents obtained by NBC 5 in Fort Worth showed that the Guard had spent $1.8 million on rental cars at that point. One van was rented for $1,100 but driven only 47 miles; another was driven only nine miles at a rental cost of $1,300.\n\nBy 2017, the total price tag for the state-ordered Guard deployment and other border-related Texas Military Forces expenses was nearly $63 million. Officials estimate that the state deployment lately has been running a tab of about $1 million a month.\n\nState officials and Guard leaders defend the costs, and say the state deployment has been a success. \u201cThe addition of National Guard on the border has proved to have a meaningful impact to reduce the flow of people and illegal activities coming across the border,\u201d Mr. Abbott said in a statement.\n\nPolitical opponents, especially those in border communities, are raising questions nonetheless.\n\n\u201cThat money could be better used,\u201d said State Senator Juan Hinojosa, a Democrat whose district includes Mission and other border towns. \u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that we want to secure our border, that we as a nation have a right to defend our border and define our border. But let\u2019s do it in a smart way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the tools and the resources to do that without getting the military involved.

They even discussed the possibility of Amazon financing a new light-rail station for its system, though no commitments were made, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Atlanta, the company spoke to a representative of the Westside Future Fund, a nonprofit working to prevent displacement in an area being redeveloped. The fund will pay for the increases in property taxes for residents who have lived in the area since at least 2016 so that they\u2019re not priced out of their homes.\n\nIn Amazon\u2019s visit to Toronto, the company discussed its potential impact on the labor market and the affordability of housing, said Ed Clark, the business adviser to Kathleen Wynne, the premier of the province of Ontario.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about what could be gentrification or displacement, how do we deal with that,\u201d said Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, which is involved in the New Jersey city\u2019s bid.\n\nAdam Sedo, a spokesman for Amazon, confirmed that public transport and housing affordability were important topics in conversations with the finalist locations but declined to elaborate further.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company employs about 45,000 people in Seattle, spread out among more than 30 buildings near the downtown area. Despite a construction frenzy, building of new homes hasn\u2019t kept up with demand, leading to soaring housing costs in Seattle, where rents are now close to those in Boston and New York and home prices are growing faster than those in any other large city.\n\nWhile Amazon is not the only reason for all the change, it has become the most convenient target for groups worried about home prices and paralyzing traffic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere was clearly a sensitivity both to the real and to the perceived impact when they come in to a place,\u201d Mr. Clark said, referring to Amazon\u2019s discussions in Toronto.\n\nThe company says it has given $40 million for affordable housing projects in Seattle. In a new office building it is constructing, Amazon has agreed to give a rent-free space to a homeless shelter for families. The company says its employees are big users of public transportation, with 17 percent of its local employees living in the same ZIP code in which they work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

The tax is expected to raise $75 million annually, with most of the money being funneled into building affordable housing. The remainder will go to support services for the homeless.\n\nThis month, supporters of the plan staged a rally in front of Amazon\u2019s glass spheres in Seattle holding signs that read \u201cTax Amazon\u201d and \u201cTax Bezos,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. Asked why Amazon was discussing affordable housing with officials of the finalist cities for its second headquarters, Kshama Sawant, a socialist member of the Seattle City Council, said it was because of what\u2019s happening in the company\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re getting massive pushback from ordinary people in Seattle,\u201d said Ms. Sawant.\n\nGrowing cities with thriving local tech scenes are already grappling with affordable housing challenges, even without Amazon. Mr. Clark, the adviser involved in Toronto\u2019s bid, said it helps that Amazon isn\u2019t ducking the problem.\n\n\"To have someone coming in and worried about this issue and wanting to work with you to solve the issue is a big plus,\u201d he said.", "title": "One Goal of Amazon\u2019s HQ2: Learn the Lessons of Seattle", "authors": ["Nick Wingfield"]}

It is one of two currently popular noninvasive X-ray techniques to assess cardiac risk and help determine who could benefit from treatments to ward off a crippling or fatal heart attack. The other test, a CT angiogram, is usually covered by insurance but is most often done only when other tests or symptoms suggest possible blockages in the arteries that feed the heart.\n\nA cardiac calcium scan is a specialized type of low-dose X-ray that highlights calcium deposits in the plaque that can line and clog arteries feeding the heart. The more calcium, the more plaque a person is likely to have and the greater the risk of a blockage that can precipitate a heart attack if a piece of plaque breaks loose. The procedure, known as multi-slice computerized tomography, does not require that a dye be injected into the bloodstream to visualize the coronary arteries, though the findings are less precise than those from a CT angiogram, which requires a dye.\n\nA calcium scan is most useful to assess patients considered to be at moderate risk of heart disease, as well as those whose risk is uncertain. Someone who has 5 percent to 7.5 percent chance of suffering a heart attack in the next 10 years, based on standard risk factors like age, gender, race, cholesterol level, blood pressure, smoking behavior and the presence of diabetes, is considered to be at moderate risk. The scan can also be helpful for patients deemed at low risk but with a family history of heart attack at a relatively young age, as in the case of my brother.\n\nDr. Mandrola, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Baptist Health in Louisville, Ky., recently reviewed both the main benefits and limitations of a cardiac calcium scan. He pointed out that the accepted nonmedical way of assessing a person\u2019s risk of a heart attack \u2014 based on standard risk factors \u2014 is imprecise and often overestimates the risk of underlying heart disease, although it is frequently used to decide whether the patient should be taking medication, like a statin to lower cholesterol.\n\nBut when findings on a calcium scan are combined with the presence of these traditional risk factors, the result gives a clearer picture of a person\u2019s risk of suffering a heart attack in the next decade. Also, if the calcium score is zero, it might mean the person can safely skip taking a statin or other heart-protective medication.", "title": "One More Heart Test to Consider: A Calcium Scan", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cBacklash\u201d was originally a mechanical-engineering term: It describes the gap between two parts of a machine, and the slight jolt that occurs when one of those parts, springing into motion, meets the next. The appeal of the metaphor is obvious, given that it maps so neatly onto human behavior. Around a decade ago, as the nation\u2019s social media addiction took hold \u2014 prompting everyone to broadcast intense feelings about new topics each day \u2014 \u201cbacklash\u201d was a useful means of describing the machinelike way public opinion could shift around any given pop-culture concern. First would come sustained praise for a film or song or celebrity; then that praise would start a groundswell of resistance, naysaying and condemnation; then all that hostility would arouse a volley of even more ardent adulation; and so on.\n\n\u201cIt is a pop-culture law that everything generates a backlash,\u201d The Ringer observed earlier this year, before pointing out that the ensuing cycles of opinion \u2014 from initial hype to stubborn critiques to indignant defenses \u2014 were now so familiar they could be predicted with almost scientific precision. It went on to do exactly that for \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d a film about which you could eventually find some people arguing \u201ceveryone loves this movie, but I hate it\u201d and others declaring that \u201ceveryone is criticizing this movie, but they\u2019re wrong\u201d \u2014 viewpoints that only grew more heated and high-stakes as they dived into the film\u2019s racial politics.\n\nYou didn\u2019t even need to be a pop-culture figure to get chewed up by these wild swerves of prevailing opinion. For reasons that remain hard to discern, a sweater-wearing man named Ken Bone became an internet hero after asking a question during a 2016 presidential debate \u2014 but after hearing of his past Reddit posts about pornography and the \u201cjustified\u201d shooting of Trayvon Martin, millions of people turned instantly from applauding this total stranger to mocking and denouncing him. In an age of hyperpublic living, every person, company and brand is one tripwire away from a precipitous fall and a furious backlash.\n\nNo matter how familiar the internet becomes with how all this works, even seemingly manageable events will send the usual cycles repeating, each more exaggerated than the last. It\u2019s predictable that, after the death of a political figure, solemn eulogies will give way to vigorous criticism, which will in turn occasion righteous defenses. But you still might not have guessed that, within 36 hours after the death of Barbara Bush, the Women\u2019s March would be facing backlash for having tweeted \u201cRest in peace and power,\u201d and a college professor would be facing nationwide calls for her firing over tweets that called Bush racist and expressed pleasure in her death \u2014 each impulse, it seems, working hard to counter the prevalence of the other.\n\n\u201cBacklash\u201d entered the political lexicon around the mid-1950s, as a name for the powerful hostility with which many voters reacted to the nascent civil rights movement. By the 1964 presidential race, the British journalist Godfrey Hodgson was writing of a \u201cwhite backlash\u201d driving the campaign of the segregationist Democrat George Wallace. That same year, the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset published an article titled \u201cBeyond the Backlash,\u201d arguing that extremist conservative revolts, including the K.K.K. and McCarthyism, were a recurring feature in American politics, arising whenever powerful groups viewed themselves as in decline. And in the decades since, the entire concept of political backlash has been deeply connected with reactionary uprisings among certain white conservatives \u2014 a streak of resentment the Republican Party has quite often turned to its electoral advantage. \u201cFrom George Wallace to George W. Bush,\u201d the writer Thomas Frank observed in 2005, \u201ca class-based backlash against the perceived arrogance of liberalism\u201d has been one of the most powerful weapons in politics.\n\nAt the root of this analysis, of course, is the assumption that liberalism has been on a steady, triumphant march \u2014 that a progressive ascendance sparks a conservative reaction. (\u201cIt cannot be stressed too strongly,\u201d Lipset wrote, that backlash politics were \u201ca consequence of the fact that the United States is becoming more liberal.\u201d) But in 2016, it was the avatar of white conservative resentment who was elected president \u2014 a result the CNN commentator Van Jones described, on election night, as a \u201cwhitelash.\u201d And in the aftermath of this stark shift in government, it\u2019s clearly difficult for Americans to reach even a vague consensus on which ideological impulses are dominant and which are lashing out in response. Many conservatives appear to have scarcely registered their political victories, preferring instead to complain of a sinister \u201cdeep state\u201d beyond executive control and resume their retaliatory campaigns against Hillary Clinton. At the same time, the backlash strategy has been handed off like a baton, cropping up with greater frequency in descriptions of liberals energized by their opposition to Trump.\n\nThis is the landscape of our broader political wars. What\u2019s fascinating is that it\u2019s also the landscape of our innocuous pop-culture battles, over which films are underrated and which celebrities overappreciated. Social media, in particular, is almost perfectly designed to turn mundane exchanges into ferocious moral dust-ups. Questions of taste and aesthetics have always been intimately bound up with questions of status and character and overarching cultural values. Even the most humdrum disagreement resolves itself, through one wave of backlash after another, into the same central question: Why does \u201ceveryone\u201d believe the wrong thing?", "title": "Online or in Politics, \u2018Backlash\u2019 Is as Predictable as Weather", "authors": ["Cameron Tung", "First Words"]}

It\u2019s the image of Canada as a tolerant, progressive, kind and humanitarian nation, populated by mild-mannered and polite people. The idea of Canada the Good \u2014 a Scandinavian-style socialist democracy, with the added bonus of multicultural harmony \u2014 is an attractive one, helpful in providing Canadians with some kind of national identity, and left-leaning Americans with a handy rhetorical device for political arguments: Look at what\u2019s possible, right next door!\n\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that this image of Canada, currently personified by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is a relatively recent construction, largely put forth by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Before that \u2014 and for most of the intervening years, between Trudeaus \u2014 the public face of Canada has looked a lot like, well, Jordan Peterson. Mr. Peterson is the University of Toronto psychologist who leveraged his defiant stance in 2016 against a human rights bill concerning gender expression to become, arguably, the country\u2019s most famous academic ever.\n\nCanada is home to many more Jordan Petersons than Justin Trudeaus. Mr. Peterson is \u2014 to use one of his favorite terms \u2014 something of a national archetype, the default setting of the Canadian male: a dull but stern dad, who, under a facade of apparent normalcy and common sense, conceals a reserve of barely contained hostility toward anyone who might rock the boat. To these types, those who make a fuss are bothersome and ignorant at best, and probably dangerous and destructive too.\n\nThis is a mind-set with deep historical roots in the Great White North. There is, for example, no national mythology surrounding the idea of Canadian independence; that\u2019s because try as our forefathers might, it\u2019s not easy to construct an inspiring story out of representatives traveling to London to request greater autonomy while remaining within the British empire.

I am rarely without one, and I wear mine knotted and tied to chase chills with a collarless T-shirt/sweater combo. Many brands sew a name tag and content label into the rolled edge, which I find annoying and scratchy and too visible, but removal would cause the scarf to fray. As a lover of vintage, I\u2019m also aware that \u2018with tag\u2019 often adds to the value of a garment. Advice? \u2014 Joni, Fredericksburg, VA\n\nA: This seems like such a simple question, but turns out to be 1) a problem literally everyone has, including Parisian friends who are dedicated to wearing a silk scarf knotted at their throat or around their handbag, and 2) extremely hard to solve. Because you are exactly right: Those tags are a big pain in the neck, plus they often stick out in unsightly ways. And you are also right: They increase the resale value of any scarf when intact.\n\nSo what\u2019s a frustrated person to do?\n\nOne colleague suggested carefully picking the label out with embroidery scissors, though noted that this doesn\u2019t always help when the edges are rolled.

Their answer pretty much boiled down to \u201cdon\u2019t,\u201d but if you have to, use \u201cgreat care\u201d and \u201cnail scissors.\u201d You can also, interestingly, bring any Herm\u00e8s scarf to an Herm\u00e8s store, and the tailors there will remove it for you, a service that suggests they have a certain number of clients who request this.\n\nHowever, given that Herm\u00e8s scarves are not in the cards for most of us, I also wanted to pass on another solution, which may be the best one, though it does require a bit of work (and organization).\n\nIt came from Cameron Silver, the founder of the Los Angeles vintage store Decades, who acknowledged that a scarf without a label could lose 30 percent of its resale value (they then say it is \u201cattributed to\u201d X brand) UNLESS you do \u201cwhat some die-hard fashionistas do: Delicately remove the label, place it in an envelope with either a photo of the item or a written description of the item, and create an actual fashion file.

Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: I am heading off to a college reunion in early June. What to wear? No football games. No late-night dances. No looking for guys. We sit close and talk loudly. \u2014 Leslie, NYC.\n\nA: Speaking of psychology! The decision about what to wear to a college reunion is awfully fraught (at least for me). After all, who you were and what you wore between 18 to 21, and who you are now and what your wardrobe might contain are probably two different things, whether you graduated a year ago or 60 years ago. How do you reconcile the two?\n\nEspecially given that we all also have the physical signifiers of age to take into account, and that what looks really great in New York, say, or L.A. or Chicago, might look kind of peculiar in the quads of higher learning.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get too specific, but a few rules of thumb: Do not dress how you dressed back in the day, for obvious reasons. As Thomas Wolfe said, you can\u2019t go home again. But also do not dress like you are going to the office, even if the suit is your security blanket, unless you want your old friends to stereotype you immediately (maybe you do). My general approach is the less branded the better, so that your clothes are effectively a blank canvas that allow you to tell your own story about who you are now \u2014 at your own pace.\n\nAt the most general, that means comfortable shoes (you may be standing around). Maybe easy silk or jersey trousers with a blouse (think tailored pajama dressing), or perhaps a shirtdress. A scarf or long cardigan for evening in case it gets cold. The aim should be pulled-together, but also relaxed. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "title": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "authors": []}

During the Misk Talk, successful Saudi men and women representing technology, entertainment and other industries sought to impart wisdom and inspiration to the young crowd.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, Misk hosted an art exhibit in an industrial-style event space in the arts district of downtown Los Angeles, where women in miniskirts and leather pants mixed with young Saudi women in head scarves, while young Saudi men who live in Los Angeles worked as volunteer guides to Saudi art.\n\nHala Alzuhayri, a Saudi woman at the University of San Diego who attended the Misk Talk, praised the prince for opening up the economy and said she was pleased about the new prospects for women, even as she worried about the pace of change. \u201cBut we are a Muslim society, so these kinds of big steps have to take time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shock society with big steps one after another.

Journalists and analysts in Washington who follow the kingdom could not get a precise schedule. There was a last-minute scramble for hundreds of visas for visiting Saudis, according to Bloomberg. In New York one night, the tempo of the Middle East, where meetings often stretch into the dark hours of the night, prevailed.

One is offered by Soros candidates, the other is offered by Fidesz.\u201d\n\n\u201cMassive migration goes together with the increased terrorist threat,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen there is large migration, women are under threat of violent attacks.\u201d\n\nIt is a theme Mr. Orban never seems to tire of. \u201cAfrica wants to kick down our door, and Brussels is not defending us,\u201d he told the crowds outside the Hungarian Parliament three weeks ago. \u201cEurope is under invasion already, and they are watching with their hands in the air.\u201d\n\nSuch appeals have placed Mr. Orban in the vanguard of populist leaders, building what he calls an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d one of majoritarian rule and winner-take-all politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a style that has found imitators and admirers from Warsaw to the White House.\n\nWhile more than half the country did not back Fidesz in the last election, those that support Mr. Orban do so with passion and without reservation.\n\nLaslo Palovics, 56, an engineer from Budapest, said that Mr. Orban and Fidesz were the only ones willing to speak politically incorrect truths. \u201cThe opposition is weak and not capable of anything,\u201d he said as he handed out lighters and bottle openers at a Fidesz rally Thursday evening.\n\nThe memories of tens of thousands of migrants flowing through the country, jamming railway stations and setting off clashes with police, have been kept fresh by constant government warnings. With each terrorist attack in Europe \u2014 from Paris to Brussels \u2014 the message is reinforced: Islam is dangerous.\n\nHe has also created a work program targeting often neglected communities in the countryside, where the promised benefits of capitalism have yet to be fully realized. At the same time, the economy remains strong, with the World Bank projecting the country\u2019s gross domestic product to grow 3.9 percent this year.\n\nFor the European Union, which has been unable to stall Mr. Orban\u2019s systematic dismantling of the checks and balances essential to democracy, a sweeping victory for him would present an even graver challenge.\n\nPolitical opponents and Western critics say it could lead to the end of a state built on the rule of law, a free press, civil society and a vibrant political discourse.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake is whether this country will find its way back to the family of democratic nations or whether we will continue on the current path,\u201d said Marton Gyongyosi, a leader in Jobbik, the second-largest opposition party in Parliament. \u201cThat path will take us from a soft dictatorship to a full dictatorship.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to Mr. Orban\u2019s own words during a March rally, when he promised to take revenge on all those who did not support Fidesz.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will seek moral, legal and political recourse after the elections,\u201d Mr. Orban told supporters.\n\nThe government dismisses critics. \u201cDemocracy has many faces,\u201d said the government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough the opposition is badly fragmented, the recent victory of a local mayor in a Fidesz stronghold offered a glimmer of hope for the opposition.\n\nVoters there rallied around a single opposition candidate in order to propel him to victory.\n\nWith stiff penalties for parties that withdraw candidates, many opposition party officials have been unwilling the make the kind of sacrifices necessary to repeat the strategy in Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One is for a national list of candidates, the results of which make up 93 seats in Parliament. They also cast votes in local elections, filling the remaining 106 seats.\n\nMr. Orban\u2019s party is currently two votes short of the two-thirds majority he needs to push through constitutional changes.\n\n\u201cIf he wins a two-thirds majority, it will lead to the complete collapse of the opposition and a very dangerous scenario for the future of Hungary,\u201d Mr. Toth said.", "title": "Orban Campaigns on Fear, With Hungary\u2019s Democracy at Stake", "authors": ["Marc Santora"]}

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that some 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries are prescribed opioids that meet or exceed this arbitrary threshold, so the change, if it goes into effect as planned next January, will suddenly put a very large number of people at risk of severe opioid withdrawal and the return of pain and suffering. This could well drive many of them to synthetic opioids.\n\nInstead, we need a rational drug policy both to rein in the excessive prescribing of opioids and to help the people who are already dependent on them.\n\nFirst, we need a national prescription database. The state-level databases that we have now are not enough. They allow clinicians to identify patients who \u201cdoctor shop\u201d and are high consumers of opioids, but patients can still fill their prescriptions in nearby states, and no one is the wiser.\n\nWe also have to deal with doctors who contribute to the epidemic. The Drug Enforcement Administration, using that national prescription database, should identify clinicians, particularly those who aren\u2019t pain specialists, who are outliers in their opioid prescribing patterns, review their treatments and clamp down on inappropriate and excessive prescribing.\n\nThis is tricky; we do not want to discourage doctors from adequately treating pain out of fear of legal sanction. But those who adhere to current standards of care should have little to fear.\n\nFinally, reasonable drug policy has to take account of the fact that opioid-dependent individuals have different levels of tolerance, which means there cannot be a one-size-fits-all guideline, like the Medicare proposal, to limit prescribing.\n\nTo be sure, there is solid evidence that nonopioid treatments are safer and just as effective as opioids for certain types of chronic pain \u2014 and it\u2019s critical that we improve pain education for all health care professionals so this becomes common knowledge.", "title": "Opinion | Ordering Five Million Deaths Online", "authors": []}

You can\u2019t buy it for someone else,\u201d a pharmacy worker said at a Walgreens in Bronx Park, another area with a high overdose death rate. \u201cIf it\u2019s for someone else, they would need to get a prescription.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nActivists on the front lines of the crisis were alarmed by the findings. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and upsetting,\u201d said Van Asher, who runs daily operations and the syringe exchange at St. Ann\u2019s Corner of Harm Reduction in the Bronx. \u201cThat\u2019s akin to if I were a diabetic and I went to pick up my insulin and they didn\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifesaving drug.\u201d\n\nThe importance of having naloxone available was made clear just last week, when the United States surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, issued a national advisory recommending that more Americans carry it and learn to use it \u2014 the first advisory from the surgeon general in more than a decade.\n\nNaloxone comes in either an injection or a nasal spray commonly known by the brand name Narcan. New York City officials are engaged in what the city\u2019s health commissioner calls a \u201cfull-court press\u201d to get the drug to the public, and since last July, more than 70,000 naloxone kits have been distributed to the police, health care providers, homeless shelters and community-based organizations. When the mayor recently announced the city would spend an additional $22 million a year on anti-opioid initiatives, bringing annual funding for its HealingNYC program to $60 million, he said some of the extra funds would go toward increased training and distribution of naloxone.\n\nBut that did not mean pharmacies should be neglected, Mr. Asher said. \u201cPeople might go to pharmacies who would never go into a needle exchange,\u201d he said. If they were told they needed a prescription or had to wait for the drug, they could grow discouraged and might not have it when they needed it. The consequence?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the loss of a loved one,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain and simple.\u201d\n\nOlivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, called the situation \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said that City Hall had instructed the health department to immediately contact all the participating pharmacies.\n\nThe drug was hardest to find outside Manhattan, The Times found. This winter, a woman in her 40s named Rebecca tried to buy naloxone in Brooklyn after learning that a friend was bingeing on prescription painkillers. (Rebecca asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her friend\u2019s privacy.) \u201cI\u2019ll just throw it in my work bag and I\u2019ll have it wherever I go,\u201d she recalled thinking.\n\nShe pulled up the city\u2019s map on her phone, and a number of pharmacies in Downtown Brooklyn came up. At the first Duane Reade she visited, when she asked for naloxone, \u201cI had to repeat it a couple of times,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were nice enough but they said they didn\u2019t have any in stock.\u201d\n\nAt the next store on the list, another Duane Reade, she had no better luck. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Nope. We don\u2019t carry that.\u2019 I went around the corner to a CVS and got the same story from them. The pharmacist said I was one of three people who had ever come to ask for it. The lead pharmacist popped her head up and said, \u2018Is everything O.K.? Is this an emergency?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThey have these giant billboards in the subway,\u201d she added, referring to the city\u2019s public awareness campaign featuring posters of people who saved someone\u2019s life using naloxone. \u201cYou\u2019d think there would be some follow-through.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe program was created with the idea that anyone, including minors, could walk into a participating pharmacy and leave with the drug, under what is known as a standing order: Pharmacists were to use the city health commissioner\u2019s name, Mary T. Bassett, in place of a prescribing physician\u2019s. They were to show the customer how to administer naloxone and bill their insurance. (Initially, Rite Aid and some independent pharmacies enrolled; the chains CVS and Walgreens, which owns Duane Reade, later announced their own standing orders, increasing the number of pharmacies on the list.)\n\nIn response to queries about the availability of the drug, Dr. Bassett said of the pharmacies, \u201cThey are learning, as we are.\u201d She added: \u201cWe want everyone to be able to walk into a pharmacy and get naloxone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the health department, if a pharmacy on the list did not have naloxone in stock, but offered to order it, they were considered to be meeting the program\u2019s guidelines. If a pharmacy enrolled in the program required a prescription, however, that was a mistake.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nDr. Bassett said that in addition to contacting stores on the list, the department would send workers to as many as 800 independent pharmacies in neighborhoods with high rates of overdose deaths.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo determine how readily available the drug is, The Times placed calls to all 720 pharmacies that the city said were taking part in the program over a one-week period in March. At about 270, naloxone was in stock and no prescription was required; roughly 90 more had it in stock but required a prescription.\n\nAt the other 360 or so pharmacies, naloxone was not available. Most pharmacists said it was out of stock, citing low demand, but could be ordered. But dozens said their store did not carry the drug. Several locations on the list, which was last updated in January, had nonworking numbers.\n\nThere was also widespread confusion among pharmacy workers about dispensing protocol, including whose insurance should cover the drug. Visits to pharmacies around the city revealed that signs and pamphlets about the drug were rare.\n\nIn at least one case, confusion over prescription requirements has had serious consequences.\n\nThis winter, a man overdosed outside a Rite Aid on Richmond Avenue on Staten Island. \u201cA man ran in. He started screaming, \u2018Someone give me Narcan!\u2019 \u201d said a customer named Lisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name. \u201cThey said, \u2018We can\u2019t give it to you without a prescription.\u2019 He said, \u2018There\u2019s a guy dying in the parking lot!\u2019 They said they were not allowed.\u201d\n\nLisa went outside and waited for an ambulance with other bystanders. \u201cThe guy was totally lifeless. He was just lying there,\u201d she said. Workers at Rite Aid confirmed the episode.", "title": "Overdose Antidote Is Supposed to Be Easy to Get. It\u2019s Not.", "authors": ["Annie Correal"]}

Her childhood, in her telling, was Dickensian: born in Jamaica to an interracial couple; left motherless at a young age; abandoned by her father on a Boston street; and adopted by a benevolent Irish Catholic woman who treated her so well that she gave her a motorcycle when she was 16 years old.", "title": "Overlooked No More: Bessie B.

The operators\u2019 duties included keeping careful accounts of calls for billing purposes, and in 1913, Daley provided crisp and exacting testimony during an investigation of influence-peddling accusations against Rep. James Thomas McDermott, Democrat of Illinois, that resulted in his censure.\n\nBy 1929, Daley and the now-18 operators who reported to her were working out of more established quarters on the fifth floor of the Cannon Office Building, handling around 30,000 calls a day over 100 main lines and 1,000 stations. A year later, the introduction of the dial telephone provoked an uproar among senators. (\u201cCould not be more awkward than it is,\u201d grumbled one, Clarence Dill, Democrat of Washington State.) They passed a resolution opposing it and got phones that allowed for the option of warmer, more interactive \u201cmanual\u201d service, with a woman\u2019s hands connecting the calls.\n\nBy the time she retired in 1945, Daley was supervising a corps of 50 loyal \u201chello girls,\u201d as they had come to be known, or \u201cpluggers,\u201d as they were also called, and attending to 535 members of Congress with a switchboard 60 times the size of the one she had first encountered. \u201cThis army of women were the ones who made the connections,\u201d Lupton, the curator, said.\n\nAs the general leading this army, which her own daughter joined for a time, Daley had much discretion in handling calls and a prodigious institutional memory. Her salary, however, peaked at $2,740 a year, less than $40,000 in today\u2019s dollars. She lived in a series of modest apartments with her daughter and, eventually, a granddaughter, Lucrece. One apartment was at the Brighton Hotel, where they sometimes took in boarders.

This was a demanding undertaking both for Liang, who walked with a bad limp after a motorcycle accident as a young man, and Lin, who had tuberculosis for years.

But because these areas are coastal, deepwater habitats were not included.\n\nIn 2015 we passed a law to create the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, a protected offshore marine reserve covering 80 percent of our waters. This is not a \u201cjust add water\u201d approach; it is a comprehensive approach that is bigger and better.\n\nThis strategy protects not only our marine resources but also our food and cultural security.

A Czech astronaut is shot into space to investigate a mysterious cloud, and leaves behind a trove of earthly baggage. As our reviewer, Hari Kunzru, put it: \u201cBut for all the strangeness of outer space, it is the writing about his home village, the place to which he longs to return and perhaps never can, that beats strongest in this wry, melancholy book.\u201d\n\nLOCKING UP OUR OWN: Crime and Punishment in Black America, by James Forman Jr. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) Forman offers a masterly account of how black elected officials grappled with the drug crises and violence of the 1970s.

Bergen. (Basic, $16.99.) A delightful investigation of profanity dabbles in language theory and neuroscience. As our reviewer, Josh Lambert, put it: \u201cWhat seems like a book about language taboos turns out to be a cognitive scientist\u2019s sneaky \u2014 charming, consistently engrossing \u2014 introduction to linguistics.\u201d\n\nDefectors, by Joseph Kanon. (Washington Square Press, $17.) It\u2019s 1961, and Frank, a former C.I.A. operative, has been living in Moscow with his wife for years after defecting from the United States.

But the opportunity to understand Frank\u2019s reasons for leaving \u2014 and learn about life under Soviet rule \u2014 proves irresistible.\n\nBlitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich, by Norman Ohler. (Mariner, $15.99.) Despite the Nazis\u2019 all-out war on drug use, virtually everyone, from housewives to the F\u00fchrer, was drugged up. A low-dose methamphetamine comparable to crystal meth, Pervitin, became a go-to cure for everything from a flagging sex drive to depression, and fueled many Nazi battlefield campaigns.

{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "Fortnite does, to be sure, involve firearms, and is recommended for ages 13 and up. But its graphics are free of blood and gore. And though adults may worry that shooting games cultivate aggression, C. Shawn Green, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who researches video games, notes that, \u201cthere\u2019s really no evidence that playing a violent video game would take someone who has absolutely no violent tendencies and suddenly make them violent.\u201d\n\nResearch does, however, confirm that action video games cultivate the spatial skills needed in advanced mathematics and engineering.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another wrinkle that may appeal to kids and parents alike: At least one college has announced it is offering scholarship money to skilled Fortnite players.\n\n\u2026 But It Is Built to Be Addictive\n\nFortnite incorporates much of what game designers know about how to ensure a captive audience. Some of what hooks players is obvious: it has quality graphics, a sense of humor and advances rapidly. But it also includes stealth habit-forming features, such as an element of luck that keeps players coming back for more. As with gambling, it\u2019s hard to walk away if you believe that good fortune is always just around the corner.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead of feeling as if they\u2019ve lost, players may feel as if they nearly won. \u201cIt\u2019s like an adrenaline rush if you almost win,\u201d says Miles Weiskopf, age 14, of University Heights, Ohio, \u201cyou feel like \u2018I gotta play again.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the heavily social aspect of Fortnite serves to make the game even more compelling. As Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University and a leading expert on adolescence explains, \u201cWhatever kids do, they enjoy it more when they\u2019re with other kids.\u201d\n\nSetting Limits in a Positive Way\n\nGiven the game\u2019s gripping power, young people may need help limiting their involvement with it. So how should parents step in? Instead of being against playing Fortnite, some adults position themselves as being for other important activities, such as completing homework, being physically active, participating in family life and getting enough sleep. As Dr. Green notes, \u201cthere is value to setting limits to how much a young person can do one thing because it\u2019s useful for kids to have a variety of experiences and to engage in lots of different intellectual activities.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another reason parents might want to insist that all screen time (game playing included) comes after other priorities have been addressed: because there are many ways to engage with Fortnite beyond actually playing it. Enthusiasts may devote hours to watching streaming videos of highly skilled gamers, studying highlight reels posted on YouTube and tracking the game\u2019s strong social media presence and following among celebrities like Drake.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParents might reduce some friction at home by talking with their family gamer about how best to keep Fortnite in check. Davida Pines of Waban, Mass., and her 14-year-old son, Noah, found that a hard stop didn\u2019t work because, as Noah explained to his mother, \u201cpulling out with no warning is like leaving a soccer game or another team sport just when the team might need you most.\u201d\n\nThey now agree on a rough period of time for playing. At a certain point, Dr. Pines alerts Noah that he\u2019s on his last game, knowing that a single game can take less than a minute for a gamer ambushed by an adversary who quickly finds a rifle, or not more than 20 minutes for the competitor who wins.\n\nThe game itself may even provide a carrot adults can use to their advantage. Though Fortnite is free, participants have the option of purchasing costumes known as \u201cskins\u201d to customize the look of their combatant. Parents of players who are jonesing for a skin might consider offering to buy one as a reward for a period of good compliance with the household technology rules.\n\nAdults who are catching up to Fortnite shouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask young people about the game. I have found that many teenagers love to talk about it with anyone who\u2019s willing.

Her supporters, mostly older South Koreans, have insisted on her innocence, and hundreds of them protested outside the courthouse on Friday, demanding her release and calling her a victim of \u201cpolitical revenge.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly impeached Ms. Park in December 2016 on charges of bribery and abuse of presidential power after weeks of demonstrations. In March 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld the lawmakers\u2019 decision, making Ms. Park the first South Korean leader to be removed from office through parliamentary impeachment.

For about three minutes, he shot round after round into the glass \u2014 but they were hurricane-resistant windows. \u201cThe rounds fragment and splinter immediately, and they do not find targets,\u201d Detective Scott said.\n\nOutside, several sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived on campus after reports of shots fired, but they could not determine where they were coming from. At least two officers from the Coral Springs Police Department did realize the shooting was taking place inside the freshman building, but did not enter. One of them, Bryan Wilkins, said in a firsthand account released on Tuesday that he was advised \u201cby an unknown BSO Deputy taking cover behind a tree, \u2018he is on the third floor.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnlike the older buildings on the Stoneman Douglas High campus where classrooms line open-air hallways \u2014 resembling a motel \u2014 the freshman building was enclosed and allowed the gunman to operate without being observed from outside.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he picked Building 12, in my view,\u201d Sheriff Gualtieri said of Mr. Cruz. \u201cThis was a unique building. He was unchallenged. Unfettered.\u201d\n\nThe state commission, which has subpoena power, is expected to issue its findings and recommendations by Jan. 1. Commissioners plan to go to the campus to walk around the building and see the place where surveillance video showed that Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer, took cover outside during the shooting, in apparent violation of protocol requiring that law enforcement try to confront an active shooter. Mr. Peterson resigned after Sheriff Scott Israel placed him under internal investigation eight days after the shooting. Several other deputies also are under investigation for failing to immediately enter the freshman building.\n\nSheriff Israel, who has defended his \u201camazing leadership\u201d of the office, faces a nonbinding vote of no confidence on Thursday from the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputies Association, a labor union that did not represent Mr. Peterson. The union president, Jeff Bell, cited the sheriff\u2019s handling of the Parkland shooting as one of the reasons deputies have lost confidence in their leader. Sheriff Israel has dismissed the vote as a bargaining tactic from a union seeking a pay raise.", "title": "Parkland Gunman Carried Out Rampage Without Entering a Single Classroom", "authors": ["Patricia Mazzei"]}

Their decorations were usually homemade and consisted of signs, chain links and streamers all made of paper, as well as twinkle lights, she said.\n\nParty City\u2019s new line includes tableware, banners, decals, gift bags and balloons in purple, blue, green and gold, and embellished with mosques and the star and crescent symbol.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo some degree, Ms. Khwaja\u2019s parents were ahead of the curve. Adorning a home for Ramadan and the Eid is not necessarily traditional for Muslims, but it has become increasingly popular.\n\n\u201cI converted to Islam in 2001, and I definitely see a big difference,\u201d said Jittaun Jones, 39, of Elk Grove, Calif., the mother of two young boys. \u201cIn the last 10 years, more and more people with kids find it really important to go all out because Christmas is such a big deal, and holidays are such a big deal.\u201d\n\nMariam Abdelgawad, 29, who has three young children, agreed that decorating helps Muslim families contend with the hype around the December holidays, and helps children feel connected to their religion and culture while also being American.\n\nDuring Ramadan, adults, as well as girls and boys who have reached the age of religious observance, abstain from food and drink, including water, during daylight hours and focus on contemplation, devotion and remembrance of God.\n\nThe decorations help excite the children who are not yet fasting, said Ms. Abdelgawad, who lives in Santa Clara, Calif. She expands her collection yearly, she said, often buying from sites like Etsy, where hundreds of thousands of crafters sell homemade goods. \u201cI try not to overdo it,\u201d she said, but \u201cit\u2019s so exciting, I want to buy everything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Party City website has recently been shared among different Muslim groups, Ms. Abdelgawad said, adding that people often pass around information on how to find new decorations this time of year.\n\nAside from the Oriental Trading Company, Party City does not have a lot of direct competition in the party-goods market. As for Ramadan decorations, its only major competitors are Etsy and Amazon, which both offer a good variety.\n\nPhoto\n\nA search of the online stores of Oriental Trading Company and Target, as well as of the arts-and-crafts companies Hobby Lobby and Michael\u2019s, did not turn up any Ramadan or Eid decorations.

There are about nine million Muslims in North America, according to a 2014 study released by the American Muslim Consumer Consortium. The consortium\u2019s founder put Muslim spending power in the United States at about $100 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are the fastest growing religious community in America, and I think that businesses are beginning to realize that there\u2019s a market out there for us,\u201d said Ms. Jones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hallmark continues to offer Eid cards, which it began doing years ago, and companies including Net-a-Porter and Tommy Hilfiger have in recent years offered Ramadan-specific apparel. In February, Macy\u2019s introduced a collection of modest clothing, including hijabs.\n\nOther attempts, though, have turned sour.

That same year, Whole Foods backed away from a Ramadan promotion that included giveaways after receiving complaints.\n\nParty City is not worried. Mr. Vero said that regardless of religion or holiday preferences, the company is always looking to support its customers.\n\nSome American Muslims also feel that, with more ugliness directed toward Islam recently, it\u2019s increasingly important to celebrate openly.\n\n\u201cWe want our kids to feel attached to Ramadan, and it\u2019s really hard in today\u2019s political climate, where everything about Muslims is kind of questioned,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Jones said. \u201cYou want your children to be proud and have these amazing memories.

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "On May 6 and 7, New Yorkers can reflect on some of these issues, too, when MasterVoices and the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s present Gluck\u2019s Italian-language version of his opera, \u201cOrfeo ed Euridice,\u201d along with Matthew Aucoin\u2019s \u201cThe Orphic Moment,\u201d written in 2014.\n\nThe subject of Mr. Aucoin\u2019s work is what he calls the \u201cdark heart\u201d of the story: the moment before Orpheus turns around and loses his wife a second time. \u201cTo me there seems to be something cold in the way the second death seems like an excuse for more music,\u201d Mr. Aucoin said in a phone interview. \u201cIt leaves me thinking \u2014 in a distressed way as a composer \u2014 of music being valued over love.\u201d\n\nAny opera about Orpheus, the musical icon of Greek mythology, is always also about opera itself. Monteverdi wrote his \u201cOrfeo\u201d in 1607, seven years after Jacopo Peri\u2019s \u201cEuridice,\u201d one of opera\u2019s founding works. Making the case for the then-radical concept of sung drama, both pieces turned to a myth that puts music at the center of the action and provides plenty of excuses for \u201cactual\u201d singing \u2014 what is known as diegetic music. Gluck then turned to the story when he set out to reform the genre from what he saw as the excesses of opera seria.\n\nBut as the musicologist Tim Carter told me in a phone conversation, political subtexts were always acknowledged. \u201cThe story is also one of how music can be abused either by individuals or by state mechanisms,\u201d he said. \u201cMonteverdi is a composer, so he\u2019s clearly out there to make a point about how wonderful his music is. But even so there are moments in his \u2018Orfeo\u2019 where there\u2019s an edge of warning: \u2018Be a bit careful, because music is really powerful. But power is dangerous stuff.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA survey of Orphean operas shows a curious drop in the 19th century, followed by a resurgence of interest following World War I. It can be no accident that composers including Darius Milhaud, Philip Glass, Hans Werner Henze and Harrison Birtwistle turned to it. For all their differences and for all their bucking of conventions, each of their treatments was also a plea for the continued validity of opera as it drifted from mainstream culture.\n\nPhoto\n\nA similar energy seems to infuse other operas in which music plays a significant role, including Kaija Saariaho\u2019s troubadour-themed \u201cL\u2019Amour du Loin.\u201d In a phone interview, Ms. Saariaho said that Orpheus had not entered her mind when she was working on the opera, but that she had been attracted to a story where music was the central subject matter while also functioning as \u201ca metaphor for many other things.\u201d\n\nIn order to set apart the diegetic music of the troubadour, she created a special mode that evokes medieval music. But his music is only ever heard as sung by a pilgrim.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know, in fact, if it is really as he wanted it to be,\u201d Ms. Saariaho said. Thus the troubadour raises issues of interpretation, dissemination and perhaps even corruption that are ultimately the concerns of a creative artist. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m also reflecting my aims as a composer,\u201d Ms. Saariaho added.\n\nFor Mr. Birtwistle, Orpheus has been something of an obsession. The character pops up in a song cycle based on Rilke sonnets, and in the operas \u201cThe Mask of Orpheus,\u201d \u201cThe Second Mrs. Kong\u201d and \u201cThe Corridor.\u201d That last work, like Mr. Aucoin\u2019s piece, zooms in on the moment before the hero\u2019s fatal turn. In a phone conversation, Mr. Birtwistle said that the fact that the myth was so well known allowed him to be innovative in his settings.\n\nIn his \u201cOrpheus Elegies\u201d for oboe, harp and countertenor, Mr. Birtwistle said, he \u201cfractured the language\u201d until it became subordinate to the music. \u201cIn a sense, the subject matter is the vehicle for music,\u201d he said. In his four-hour \u201cThe Mask of Orpheus,\u201d the multiple and often contradictory versions of the myth are mirrored in a multiplicity of representations, with the principal characters impersonated by a singer, an actor and a puppet.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition, Mr. Birtwistle invented a language made up of the component syllables of the names Orpheus and Eurydice. When Orpheus makes his first utterances in this language, Mr. Birtwistle said, \u201cthe whole piece is a metaphor in the sense that it\u2019s a dawn. And in this dawn, like a child learning to speak, he constructs the word Eurydice.\u201d In this sense, Eurydice becomes more than just the object of Orpheus\u2019s obsession; she is his creation.\n\nThere are no overt Orphean references in Du Yun\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cAngel\u2019s Bone,\u201d a harrowing parable about sex trafficking. But at the heart of the opera is an aria by one of the story\u2019s victims that is uttered in a musical language that, similar to many an Orphic lament, seems to rocket outside the work\u2019s musical orbit. Drawing on Ms. Du\u2019s interest in punk rock, and performed at the work\u2019s premiere by Jennifer Charles, the aria proceeds in sobs, wails and screams.\n\n\u201cVirtuosity is there in a lot of styles,\u201d Ms. Du said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just screaming and no pitch. It\u2019s understanding how the emotion drives the content.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMs. Du described a recent production of the opera that showed graphic sexual violence during that aria. \u201cWhen women are going through those motions on stage, I can\u2019t wrap my mind as a composer around telling them to sing notes,\u201d Ms. Du said.\n\nAnd yet, she added, there was something about the aria that breaks through the layers of craft and professionalism and shakes every performer who sings it to her core. So far everyone who has sung it \u2014 including Ms. Du herself \u2014 has broken down at the end. In the performances with Ms. Charles, Ms. Du said, \u201cwe had to turn off her mike for the next part so we would hear a little bit of sobbing upstage, but not in your ears. But I couldn\u2019t tell her to stop sobbing.\u201d\n\nIn a way, Ms. Du\u2019s lament is a break with the centuries-old tradition of opera turning agony into beauty. Investigating music\u2019s tendency to revel and wallow in pain is also a driving motivation for Mr. Aucoin, who is at work at a new opera focusing on the character of Eurydice. In this piece he sometimes has a countertenor and baritone double up for the part of Orpheus, endowing his voice with a sort of supernatural halo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor me, it was important to reflect the doubleness in Orpheus: the pleasure and pain, the mortal and the divine,\u201d Mr. Aucoin said.\n\nHe said he had been thinking of what he called \u201cthat alchemical transfiguration\u201d of pain into pleasure in the context of the recent fall from grace of the conductor James Levine, who has been accused of abusing young musicians.\n\n\u201cPart of his aesthetic, it seemed, was that no matter how much pain there was in the music, he treated it as if it were all pleasure,\u201d Mr. Aucoin said. \u201cHe was obsessed with the lusciousness, even where that wasn\u2019t the emotional content. I think it\u2019s what made him both better than his musical peers and why there is something disturbing to some Levine recordings.

The inferiority complex that once marked City\u2019s relationship with its neighbor has gone \u2014 mostly \u2014 and in recent years it has felt as if the blue half of Manchester is in the ascendancy and the red in decline.\n\nStill, it would be a stretch to say that, even in the worst period of United\u2019s history for three decades, the balance of power in the city has inverted. United has won three titles since City came into wealth, and made a couple of Champions League finals.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt has proved to be the only team in England truly capable of matching, almost, City\u2019s spending in the transfer market. Its hegemony may have disappeared, but its potency has not. It has not gone quietly into the night.\n\nFinally, this year, City \u2014 and Guardiola \u2014 seemed to have done it, and the second Manchester derby of the season, for a time, appeared to offer proof. United might sit second in the Premier League table, but it is a distant second: as much as 18 points behind at various points of the season, and 16 back before kickoff on Saturday. City was going to win the title earlier than anyone had ever done it, with more points, by a bigger margin, having scored more goals and won more games.\n\nWorse for United, perhaps, is that its coach, Mourinho, has long had the air of a man at odds not only with the club\u2019s vaunted attacking traditions, but also with its self-confidence, its indomitable pride.\n\nHe has set his team up a little too often to stymie high-caliber opponents, rather than to impose United\u2019s style. He has talked a little too often of how United is a faded power, not quite what it once was, a team that should by now be accustomed to not winning championships, or to crashing out of the Champions League, its \u201cfootball heritage\u201d one of misses, near and not so near.\n\nPhoto\n\nCity has always been the Manchester club consumed with self-doubt, and United the one with the peacock strut and the frontman swagger, whatever the weather.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis season, they seemed to have swapped roles, and there were moments on Saturday, in that first half, that encapsulated it all. City pressed and United panicked, the reversal of roles in microcosm, a little window into what the future held: City racing clear, and United playing catch-up.\n\nAnd then, almost out of nowhere, everything snapped back. In the locker room at halftime, Mourinho warned his United players that they did not want to be the \u201cclowns sort of standing there, watching them receive their trophy.\u201d His team responded.\n\nIn the space of two minutes, United was level, two goals created, at least in part, by Alexis Sanchez and scored by Paul Pogba, his hair dyed blue and white. Not long after, Mourinho\u2019s team led, with Chris Smalling tapping home another Sanchez delivery.\n\nIt was, just for a moment, a reminder of how things used to be, of what the real \u201cfootball heritage\u201d of these two teams is: City managing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, what they used to call Cityitis, and United never quite understanding the concept of losing, able to win when other teams would be lost.\n\nIn the short term, of course, it changes little, or nothing. Manchester City will still win the Premier League title. It will simply have to wait a little longer than it had hoped. It cannot claim a third championship in six years against Tottenham next week; it may, in reality, have to wait until the end of April to receive its prize, but it will get it. \u201cThey deserve it,\u201d Mourinho said.\n\nIn the long term, beyond this season, it is a reminder. \u201cNever again, never again,\u201d Guardiola had said, on the eve of this game, when asked if City would be able to dominate the Premier League next year, and the year after, the way it has over the last nine months. This season has been an exception, he said; it should not be seen as a rule.\n\nAt the time, it felt like modesty. During that first half, it felt like misinformation. City was the future; United was just the last relic of the past. The plates had not just shifted, they were drifting apart. Now, though, it looks anything but. This has been City\u2019s year; that will be confirmed soon enough. But United, like Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal, will gather again next year.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "Ryan, by contrast, proposed radical cuts to Medicare, in his various budget blueprints over the years. He proposed the privatization of Social Security. And, in December, even before Congress passed the tax bill, Ryan said that changes to Medicare and Social Security would be his top priority in 2018. He wasn\u2019t afraid of talking simultaneously about tax cuts and spending cuts \u2014 and allowing voters to draw a connection between the two.\n\nThese acknowledgments allowed a more honest debate about tax policy than many other Republicans wanted. But an honest debate is a better one. The reality is that today\u2019s Republican Party supports both big tax cuts for the wealthy and the unavoidable counterpart \u2014 cuts to health care, retirement and other programs for the middle class and poor.\n\nRyan wasn\u2019t honest enough to phrase it like that. And he, like many of his colleagues, made a lot of wild claims about the economic growth that would supposedly be unleashed by tax cuts. (He and I debated that topic several years ago.) So I don\u2019t mean to suggest that he was a truth-teller, and I don\u2019t mean to excuse, in any way, his meek response to Donald Trump\u2019s racism and lawlessness.

{"date": "2018-04-14 00:00:00", "text": "This is not to say that he lacked principles. The frequent descriptions of Ryan as a Jack Kemp acolyte \u2014 a supply-side tax cutter and entitlement reformer and free trader who imagined a more immigrant-welcoming and minority-friendly G.O.P. \u2014 were accurate enough; there was no question that the more a policy reflected Ryan\u2019s deepest preferences, the more Kempist it would be.\n\nBut even there, he came to those principles at a time when they were ascendant within the party \u2014 in the period between the supply-side \u201980s and the late-1990s window when centrist liberals seemed open to entitlement reform. And then as Republicans moved away from them, tacking now more compassionate-conservative, now more libertarian, now more Trumpist, his resistance to the drift was always gentle, eclipsed by his willingness to turn.\n\nThus the Ryan of the George W. Bush era cast votes for the pillars of compassionate conservatism, No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D. Then the Ryan of the Tea Party era championed austerity, talking about \u201cmakers and takers\u201d and tossing out the Ayn Rand references that persuaded many liberals that he was an ideological fanatic. But that Ryan gave way to Ryan the dutiful running mate, which gave way in turn to the more moderate Ryan of Obama\u2019s second term, who negotiated a budget deal with Democrats and moved toward so-called \u201creform conservatism\u201d in his policy proposals at a time when that seemed like that might be the party\u2019s future.\n\nThen came the 2016 election, in which Ryan temporarily resisted Trump and then surrendered lest he break the party (which a party man could never do), and after that the Trump administration, in which Ryan has obviously steered Trump toward standard Republican policies \u2014 but has just as obviously been steered as well. Most of Ryan\u2019s past big-picture goals (entitlement reform, free trade, minority outreach) are compromised or gone, and while he attempted Obamacare repeal and achieved a butchered version of corporate tax reform, he\u2019s accepted spending policies that make a mockery of any sort of libertarian or limited-government goal.\n\nIf you look at all this and see an obsessive ideologue working tirelessly for Randian ends, I think you\u2019re being daft. But it\u2019s equally daft to see this as the story of a great visionary brought low by Trump. The truth is that Ryan probably could have thrived as a legislator in a variety of dispensations: As a Reaganite if he\u2019d been born early enough; as a Kempian or compassionate conservative if the late-1990s boom had continued; as a bipartisan dealmaker in a world where his base supported compromises (the blueprints he drew up with Democrats like Ron Wyden were usually interesting); as some sort of reform-conservative-inflected figure under a President Rubio or Kasich.", "title": "Opinion | Paul Ryan, Party Man", "authors": []}

His Syrian wife, who he said was an accomplice to the crime, remains at large.\n\nThe two were sentenced to death in Kuwait, but the verdict could be appealed.\n\nArman Hernando, head of the group Migrante, which monitors migrant rights, said he was alarmed by the treatment of Filipino workers in Kuwait and the subsequent diplomatic fallout.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead of helping workers, the embassy\u2019s so-called rescue stunt put Filipino citizens \u201cin deeper trouble in the name of media mileage and false posturing.\u201d\n\nThe video, Mr. Hernando said, was meant to create public outrage and its creators did not consider the repercussions it would have on already precarious diplomatic relations.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the Kuwaiti government has now found a way to launch a counteroffensive against the Duterte government which is now in the defensive mode,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hernando said that the government should move quickly and hold to account the officials behind the stunt.", "title": "Philippine Envoy to Kuwait Expelled After So-Called Rescue of Domestic Workers", "authors": ["Felipe Villamor"]}

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "A year\u2019s work, for most artists, would fill just one gallery, if that. Picasso gives us enough for a feast. More than 100 paintings, sculptures and drawings from that year are here, representing just a fraction of his output, and they\u2019re accompanied by copious archival materials \u2014 a butcher\u2019s bill, a family photo album, a manuscript by Andr\u00e9 Breton \u2014 and earlier works that appeared in the retrospectives of that year.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere at the Tate are point-blank masterpieces, above all the plaster and cement busts of his young lover Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter; wonderful and underrated drawings, including a suite of scenes from the Crucifixion translated into strange surrealist tableaux; frankly amateurish sketches of Boisgeloup in the rain; and a hefty amount of cruise-ship Picasso, such as the Tate\u2019s own \u201cNude Woman in a Red Armchair,\u201d with a face only an oligarch could love.\n\nAnd if, like me, you look askance at overly biographical readings of modern art \u2014 not least as regards old male geniuses and the mute, pliant muses who love them \u2014 you will have an extra task in \u201cPicasso 1932,\u201d which in some spots reduces the art into mile markers in the life of a lech. Each work here, dated to the day and even the hour in some cases, serves as a page in a diary. Your mission is to treat them as more than that: to untangle the artist\u2019s interwoven threads, and to reckon with the multiplicity of Picasso\u2019s ann\u00e9e \u00e9rotique in stylistic and social terms that intersect with, but can\u2019t be reduced to, a mere life story.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne painter, one year. He was 50 years old at the start of 1932, and the previous Christmas he\u2019d painted a brace of pictures, on view in a prologue here, that prefigure the dreamlike, indulgent, violent year to come. One, the 1931 oil \u201cWoman With Dagger,\u201d is a riff on Jacques-Louis David\u2019s \u201cThe Death of Marat,\u201d in which the Girondin murderess appears as an ectoplasmic gray lizard, fangs bared as she soars above Marat\u2019s bathtub. The other is a languorous portrait of a woman seated in a striped red chair, her hands an icy lavender, her single breast as round and rigid as a softball, her face liquefied into a heart-shaped squiggle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe subject of that painting is Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who was 22 on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cPicasso 1932\u201d is as much her show as his, and the young Frenchwoman, lithe, athletic, untroubled, appears again and again in uncanny states of bodily deliquescence.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe role she would play in Picasso\u2019s art is visible as early as January. In \u201cLe Repos\u201d (\u201cRest\u201d), painted on the 22nd day of the year, Picasso\u2019s wife Olga lazes in a chair in front of Matisse-echoing floral wallpaper. Olga\u2019s right breast soars creepily upward; her head is thrust to the right, her dark hair rendered as bristling parallel cilia. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, blonde, sits with a look of postcoital bliss in front of the same wallpaper in \u201cLe R\u00eave\u201d (\u201cThe Dream\u201d) from Jan. 24 \u2014 which became world-famous when its previous owner, the now-disgraced casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn, agreed to sell it to the financier Steven A. Cohen and then promptly punctured its surface with his elbow. (Mr. Cohen eventually bought the restored painting in 2013.) \u201cLe R\u00eave\u201d hangs here in a plexiglass vitrine, and you can\u2019t detect any injury, even if you can look away from her closed left eye, transmuted into the glans of a tumescent penis.\n\n\u201cLe R\u00eave\u201d is not a particularly accomplished painting, and indeed many works in this exhibition are garish, hasty and unremarkable. Moments of intense breakthrough \u2014 above all in early March, when he painted the surreal \u201cNude in a Black Armchair\u201d and \u201cNude, Green Leaves and Bust,\u201d which treat Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s mauve flesh as a source of vegetal growth, and the ultradense, psychologically troubling \u201cGirl Before a Mirror,\u201d on loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 coexist with fallow months. (In summer, Picasso really checked out.) That\u2019s not a knock on the curators of \u201cPicasso 1932.\u201d It can be bracing to see Picasso shuttle between triumph and kitsch in the space of a week.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat endures through the year are the erotic and artistic drives to dominate and to reshape: drives that play out, more than anywhere, on the surface of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s body. Endlessly pliable: She sleeps, she stretches, she dives, she undulates. That spring, in \u201cReclining Nude,\u201d Picasso transmutes her into a sunbathing cephalopod, head thrust back in pleasure and flippers cast up to the sky. (The curators have winningly paired it with a 1928 film of a rippling, capering octopus.) In his sculpture studio in Boisgeloup, he turned her face into serene but sexualized busts, with noses that resemble a bodily appendage women do not possess. (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se did not visit the studio; Picasso never worked from life, and indeed they might not have seen each other all that frequently in 1932.)\n\nWhy was Picasso so hyperproductive in 1932? This show stacks the deck in favor of emotional explanations \u2014 his strained marriage with Olga, his new infatuation \u2014 but those of us cursed by the procrastination gene will clock the real reason: He was racing to prepare his first retrospective, at the Galeries Georges Petit in Paris, which opened on June 16 and featured a painting made as late as April 11. Picasso hung that show out of chronological order, and one of the sharpest moves of \u201cPicasso 1932\u201d is its partial reconstruction of this historical exhibition smack in the center of the current one. A Blue Period self-portrait and a proto-Cubist profile of a woman rupture the timeline in a way Picasso, ever a disrupter, would have smiled to see.\n\nPhoto\n\nLater in 1932, after a sojourn in Switzerland, Picasso turned to ink drawing and completed a baker\u2019s dozen of works on paper that reimagined Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald\u2019s Isenheim Altarpiece (1512-1516) as assemblages of acrobatic shapes and body parts. But in September, on the river Marne, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se tumbled out of her kayak and nearly drowned. She was hospitalized; she contracted a viral infection that would cost her her hair. Even those suspicious of such biographical readings will note the darker tones of this show\u2019s later galleries, and the recurrence of scenes of rape, diving and drowning. In the masterly \u201cRescue,\u201d painted on Nov. 20, a gasping woman is pulled from the waters by an equally nude savior, their bodies flattened and distended into supple panels of lilac and blue.\n\n\u201cRescue,\u201d like all of Picasso\u2019s best works from 1932, was born out of desire for Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se \u2014 but it exceeds that desire as well, and exceeds, moreover, the life of any one artist. In the last gallery, we come across a quotation from Michel Leiris, the French ethnologist, whose fatalistic interpretation of art in 1932 rings truer than the first-person-singular orientation that this show both indulges and disclaims. He wrote: \u201cEverything we love is about to die, and that is why everything must be summed up, with all the high emotion of farewell, in something so beautiful we shall never forget it.\u201d\n\nEven Picasso, ensconced in his chauffeur-driven Hispano-Suiza, could not keep the outside world at bay for long. In three years, civil war would break out in his native Spain. The bodies in extremis he painted in the fall of 1932 \u2014 terrified, hungry, surging past their physical limits \u2014 would re-emerge in a Basque village called Guernica.", "title": "Picasso in 1932: Ingenious, Exhausting, Relentless", "authors": ["Jason Farago"]}
{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "The rise of these high-end tequilas has been astonishing. Sales of super-premium bottlings increased sevenfold from 2002 through 2016, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, which represents American producers and marketers. (By comparison, sales of all tequila rose 121 percent during that period.)\n\nMuch of the growth in super-premium tequilas occurred after 2006, when the Tequila Regulatory Council, a Mexican trade organization, created the extra a\u00f1ejo classification; before that, the oldest tequilas were simply labeled a\u00f1ejo, meaning that they had to be aged a minimum of one year.\n\nThe big tequila brands, several of which have been acquired by larger conglomerates in the last year, have noticed. Patr\u00f3n (acquired by Bacardi for $5 billion) and Avi\u00f3n (acquired by giant Pernot Ricard) have both introduced extra a\u00f1ejo tequilas since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really forecast for extra a\u00f1ejo to become so big. Who would have thought?\u201d said Jenna Fagnan, the president of Avi\u00f3n \u201cTwo years ago, we said, \u2018Something\u2019s happening here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCarlos Camarena, the influential distiller of tequila brands like El Tesoro, Tapatio, Villa Lobos and Excellia, estimates that his brands\u2019 extra a\u00f1ejo sales have grown more than 50 percent over the past three years. \u201cIt\u2019s growing faster than any of the other categories,\u201d said Mr. Camarena, who pioneered the aging of tequila in the late 1980s, when he created El Tesoro Paradiso, which was aged for five years in Cognac barrels.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, Mexico consumed more aged Spanish brandy and whiskey than tequila, which was regarded as a lowbrow spirit even its homeland. Five-year-old tequila was unheard-of. \u201cWe were breaking the myth that tequila couldn\u2019t be aged,\u201d Mr. Camarena said.\n\nSince then, he has experimented widely, aging tequila in Sauternes barrels, sherry butts, rum casks and barrels made from Japanese oak. \u201cThe sky is the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut regardless of the aging or the barrel, the consumer has to still perceive the agave. It should not taste like chewing a piece of oak.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWoody tequila is a pet peeve for many purists, who prefer the spicy, complex agave flavors of unaged blanco or lightly aged reposado (\u201crested\u201d for less than 12 months) tequila, and view extra a\u00f1ejo bottles with a gimlet eye.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t age tequila forever,\u201d Ms. Fagnan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t behave the same as whiskey. Eventually it just falls apart.\u201d\n\nSome contend that tequila\u2019s most significant maturation happens under the ground, where the agave plant may grow up to a decade before being harvested and roasted. \u201cThe aging process is in the maturing of the raw material,\u201d said Bobby Heugel, the owner of several high-profile bars in Houston, including Anvil Bar & Refuge and the Pastry War, that have extensive tequila lists. \u201cWhen you cover up that raw material, you\u2019re negating what makes tequila beautiful.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Most of the extra a\u00f1ejo you drink tastes like vanilla and coconut. Often it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s the cask and what is the aging of the agave.\u201d\n\nStill, when the agave and wood are in balance, there is nothing quite like great extra a\u00f1ejo, which offers a distinctly different sipping experience than brandy or whiskey do. \u201cAs long as the oak doesn\u2019t completely cover the agave flavor, you could age it 12 to 15 years,\u201d Mr. Camarena said.\n\nDavid Suro-Pi\u00f1era, owner of the tequila brand Siembra Azul, also used to be an extra a\u00f1ejo skeptic. Born and raised in Jalisco, he migrated to Philadelphia in 1985 and opened his landmark Mexican restaurant, Tequilas, which has more than 100 agave spirits on the menu.\n\nFor a long time, he resisted long-aging his tequilas, and even now insists on barrels made of brand-new French oak, or virgin oak from the Ozarks that he seasons with his own blanco tequila. \u201cI don\u2019t think tequila calls for the help of bourbon or Cognac,\u201d he said. Siembra Azul\u2019s three extra a\u00f1ejos, all aged for five years, seem to back up his point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new experiment for all of us,\u201d Mr. Suro-Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cBut here\u2019s what I do know: The blanco going into the barrel has to be remarkable in order to have a good extra a\u00f1ejo.\u201d\n\nPricey but Worth It\n\nExtra a\u00f1ejo tequila is not cheap. But when the agave and wood are in harmony, there\u2019s nothing quite like the taste. Here are some of the best.

He was vacationing with friends in La Paz, the state\u2019s capital city, two hours north of Los Cabos. \u201cBut for the four days we\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve just been surprised over and over again. To me, the places I\u2019ve seen here are probably in my top five that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my own country.\u201d\n\nThe peninsula seems synonymous with Los Cabos, comprising the cities of Cabo San Lucas and San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, where I stayed, all connected by a 20-mile \u201ccorridor\u201d of resorts and golf courses. For me, the southern tip of Baja turned out to be like an immersive choose-your-own-adventure novel. It asks you the existential question of which unmarked dirt road you\u2019ll take, and has you answer it \u2014 and pay the consequences \u2014 all in real time. Here are a few of those turns, and the resulting ups and downs.\n\nThe West Side\n\nMy directive was to explore the peninsula\u2019s lesser-known East Cape \u2014 but I got greedy. The only time I\u2019ve been to Baja was when I was 12 and, this time around, I wanted to gobble up the whole coastline. That included a visit to the beaches of Todos Santos, an artsy town on the west coast that was not at all on the itinerary. The pit stop, as they are sometimes wont to do when you\u2019re not paying attention, turned into five hours.\n\nThey were five beautiful hours. I wandered around the picturesque Hotel San Crist\u00f3bal, with its infinity pool overlooking Punta Lobos, an active fisherman\u2019s beach that\u2019s non-swimmable, like most of the water on the Pacific side of Baja, because of surf and undertow. Locals drove their 4x4s straight onto the sand; kids played soccer with balls they frequently kicked into the waves.\n\nThe biggest time suck, though, was trying to find Las Palmas Tropicales, a palm oasis where beachgoers can sometimes share space with wild horses. The entrance, I\u2019d been told, was an unmarked dirt road a few minutes past the dirt road I\u2019d taken to Punta Lobos.", "title": "Place 10 of 52: In Los Cabos, Beaches Abound, but So Does Generosity", "authors": []}

Archaeologists have explored only 20 percent, if not less, of the site \u2014 and tourism here didn\u2019t begin in earnest until around 2012.\n\nGetting there can be a bit of a slog.

There were many ways the former spy could have been killed: He could have been shot, or killed in a staged accident.\n\nBut the assassins knew the nerve agent would be identified, and knew it would be linked to Russia, the officials said. That was meant to send a chilling message to others who would think of defecting to, or informing, the West.\n\nAnd by conducting the operation in an historical British town, some distance from London, the attack was meant to indicate that no place was out of reach of Russian assassins, the officials said.\n\nThe boldness of the attack on Mr. Skripal, which took British authorities by surprise, has caused them to reassess Mr. Putin\u2019s use of what has come to be called \u201chybrid warfare.\u201d\n\nThe officials are now viewing those actions as part of a pattern \u2014 one rarely seen in the Cold War \u2014 in which Mr. Putin exerts Russian power in ways that are hard to attribute directly to Russian actors, but leave little doubt in the minds of adversaries about the country\u2019s willingness to use a range of new tactics.\n\nNATO allies are now thinking anew about coordinated responses, which is what the simultaneous ouster of the Russian agents was intended to represent. But it is unclear whether those countries can hold together in a continuous series of confrontations with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEight days after the Skripals collapsed, Prime Minister Theresa May identified the poison as Novichok, developed in the last years of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor an assassin to leave poison on Mr. Skripal\u2019s door handle would require considerable knowledge of the underlying chemistry, said Richard Guthrie, an independent chemical weapons expert and editor of CBW Events.\n\nThe nerve agent would have to be designed so that it would remain on the door handle, and then reliably be transferred to the target\u2019s hand, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge implication, if it was the door handle, because it means someone had to be in the U.K. with the material,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. \u201cAnything you create that would stick to the door handle, you\u2019ve got to make it so that it would be removed from the door handle when it was handled, and not dropped off too quickly.

If the sample is strong enough, this technique could provide scientists with a chemical signature identifying its national source or even the specific laboratory that produced it, said Paul F. Walker, a chemical weapons expert at Green Cross International, a disarmament advocacy group.\n\nThe second element was evidence that Russia had publicly stated its intent to assassinate defectors living abroad. British officials pointed to 2006 legislation passed by the Russian Parliament, which granted Russia\u2019s president expanded powers to use force against opponents living in other countries.\n\nRussia has never acknowledged using the authority under the law, and has denied any role in high-profile deaths, like that of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian K.G.B. officer who was poisoned with a rare and highly radioactive isotope known as Polonium 210 a few months after it was passed.\n\nA third element of the British case against Russia consisted of intelligence \u2014 either human intelligence, intercepted communications or other information \u2014 that the officials would not share.\n\nThe dispute between Russia and Britain deepened last week, after the United States and European allies expelled more than than 150 Russian diplomats suspected of being spies.\n\nRussia\u2019s government has said it \u201cinsists on the right\u201d to visit Ms. Skripal, a Russian citizen. The British foreign office has said it will consider Russia\u2019s request, taking into consideration both international law and Ms. Skripal\u2019s wishes.\n\nRussia also protested the search of an Aeroflot passenger jet on Friday after it traveled from Moscow to London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, and said that the British Border Force had tried to search the plane in the absence of its crew or captain.

Others said they had run when people started shouting that there was a shooter. Two hours after the attack, YouTube employees, including Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive, continued to stream slowly down the hill, away from the office.\n\nFootage broadcast by CNN showed people leaving the building in single file with their hands raised above their heads.

They said they were not releasing it because the department and the state attorney general\u2019s office were still investigating the shooting.\n\nLate Friday, the police released the first details about the four officers who fired at Mr. Vassell, who was black.\n\nThree of the officers were from a plainclothes anti-crime unit in the 71st Precinct, the police said: a white officer with four years of experience; a white officer with six years of experience; and a black officer with five years of experience. They fired nine shots between them.\n\nThe fourth was a uniformed officer from the Strategic Response Group, which handles major events and hot spots of crime. He is Indian, the police said, and has six years of experience. He fired once, the police said.\n\nNone of the officers had been involved in any previous shootings, the police said.\n\nAnother uniformed officer from the Strategic Response Group and a sergeant from the 71st Precinct were also at the scene, though neither fired their weapon.\n\nThe shooting of Mr. Vassell, who had bipolar disorder and was not taking medication, has set off protests in the Crown Heights neighborhood and raised questions about the mental health services he received after previous encounters with the police, as well as whether the responding officers had any alternative to shooting him.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeveral elected officials and civil rights advocates \u2014 among them the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia James; the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr.; and the Rev.

In this instance, he said, there was no time to call for backup from local patrol officers who might have known Mr. Vassell.

But it comes at a particularly sensitive moment for Savannah \u2014 a city of 147,000 people famous for its fine old buildings and Southern charm, but burdened with an outsize violent crime problem, a 25 percent poverty rate, and a police force stained by the 2014 conviction of its former chief, Willie Lovett, on federal extortion, gambling and obstruction charges.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Lovett\u2019s well-regarded replacement, Joseph Lumpkin, reinstilled some public confidence in the police force.

Mr. Boyd\u2019s family has theories about the motive for this slaying, but did not wish to share them publicly.\n\nA 15-year-old was eventually arrested in connection with that killing.\n\nMr. Boyd\u2019s family, meanwhile, has hired a local civil rights lawyer, William R. Claiborne, 40, a white Atlanta native who has emerged as a chief critic of Savannah\u2019s law enforcement culture. There are good officers on the force, Mr. Claiborne said, but over all, he believes the department has not fully reformed or scrubbed its ranks of bad actors.\n\n\u201cEthical and honest policing protects everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that historically, and I don\u2019t think we have that now.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Claiborne won a settlement from the city over a case in which a white officer used a stun gun on a black man whom the police had misidentified while executing a warrant.

Mr. Claiborne believes it is the same BB pistol shown in photos released by the state bureau of investigation.\n\nMr. Claiborne said the family members who watched the police body-camera video did not see Mr. Boyd make any throwing motion before he was shot. \u201cSo how does the gun that he supposedly had move from A to B?\u201d he said.\n\nMs. Smiley said that a Savannah detective has told her that the police do not believe her son killed Balil Whitfield.\n\nMr. Claiborne said he is frustrated that after three months, the authorities have released the name of only one officer involved in the raid \u2014 a sergeant who was shot that morning, apparently by friendly fire.\n\nMr. DeLoach, the mayor, is a white conservative who defeated a black incumbent in 2015 with a campaign focused squarely on fighting crime.

But the city attorney advised them not to speak, and said that the district attorney had said that the video would not be released while it was under investigation by the grand jury.\n\n\u201cAnd ma\u2019am,\u201d the mayor said at one point. \u201cWe are truly sorry.\u201d", "title": "Police\u2019s Shifting Account of Black Man\u2019s Death Raises Questions in Savannah", "authors": ["Richard Fausset"]}

As Alistair Marsh, the chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s Register, which provides consulting services to the shipping industry, said recently, \u201cThe later we leave decarbonization, the more disruptive it will be for shipping.\u201d\n\nFortunately, solutions exist. A 2009 study by the I.M.O. found that \u201ca significant potential\u201d for reducing emissions \u201cthrough technical and operational measures has been identified.\u201d Those measures, according to the study, \u201ccould increase efficiency and reduce the emissions rate by 25 percent to 75 percent below the current levels. Many of these measures appear to be cost-effective.\u201d But impediments, including \u201ccosts, a lack of incentives and other barriers, prevent many of them from being adopted,\u201d the report added.\n\nThe Marshall Islands first proposed an industrywide target to curb shipping\u2019s rising emissions in the lead-up to the 2015 Paris climate conference. The Marshall Islands may be a tiny, climate-vulnerable nation of low-lying islands and atolls threatened by rising seas, but it also hosts the world\u2019s second-largest shipping registry and is almost entirely reliant on sea transportation for food and other crucial supplies. Given all this, perhaps no country is better placed to highlight the need to act, and to do so in a way that is economically sustainable.\n\nIn Paris, the Marshall Islands went on to form a High Ambition Coalition of progressive countries that was pivotal to securing the final agreement. That coalition is mobilizing once again, with the Pacific Island nations, the Caribbean, Latin American countries, Europe and others already working together to ensure a similarly strong outcome next week. While the Marshall Islands may be one of the countries most at risk from climate change, no country will be safe.\n\nWith this in mind, nearly 50 countries have already joined the Tony de Brum Declaration, which has called for urgent action to reduce the shipping industry\u2019s emissions. The declaration, sponsored by the Marshall Islands and President Emmanuel Macron of France at the One Planet Summit in Paris last December, is named in honor of our friend, the former foreign minister of the Marshall Islands and a champion of the Paris Agreement, who died last year.", "title": "Opinion | Polluters on the High Seas", "authors": []}

Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser and a former ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nMr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo both have ties to individuals and groups promoting a worldview that regards Islam not so much as a religion, but as a political ideology that is infiltrating the United States and other Western countries with the goal of imposing Shariah law, the Muslim legal code. These groups believe that the vehicle for this takeover is the Muslim Brotherhood, and they allege that American mosques, civic organizations and leaders and even government officials who are Muslims are suspected of being Muslim Brotherhood operatives.\n\n\n\nMr. Pompeo as a congressman arranged a briefing for one such group called Act for America, or ACT, on Capitol Hill and accepted the group\u2019s National Security Eagle Award in 2016, according to the group\u2019s website. Local ACT chapters have protested the construction of mosques, as well as school textbooks that include information about Islam, and have promoted \u201canti-Shariah\u201d bills in state legislatures. The founder of ACT, Brigitte Gabriel, has written that \u201cthe purest form of Islam\u201d is behind the terrorist attacks: \u201cIt\u2019s not radical Islam. It\u2019s what Islam is at its core.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton is chairman of the Gatestone Institute, a think tank that regularly features articles on its website promoting the notion that pliant European countries, especially Britain, are submitting to \u201cIslamization\u201d by hostile Muslim migrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

In an interview with Herald Radio in 2015, Mr. Bolton said that the proposal by Mr. Trump, at the time a candidate, to ban all Muslims coming into the United States was \u201ccertainly completely wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not consistent with our views about America and how we should operate. I think he\u2019s playing on the frustration and the fear that we see out in the country,\u201d Mr. Bolton said. \u201cOur problem is the radicals, the terrorists. It\u2019s not an entire religion. I think we absolutely have to make that clear. Not because I care about what the rest of the world thinks, but because I care what we think about ourselves.\u201d\n\nBoth Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton have appeared frequently on the radio show of Frank Gaffney Jr., the president and founder of the Center for Security Policy, a think tank that argues that mosques and Muslims across America are engaged in a \u201cstealth jihad\u201d to \u201cIslamize\u201d the country by taking advantage of American pluralism and democracy.\n\nMr. Bolton has occasionally nodded along to some of Mr. Gaffney\u2019s falsehoods. When Huma Abedin, an American Muslim who was a close aide to Hillary Clinton, was wrongly accused of being a secret member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mr. Bolton told Mr. Gaffney\u2019s radio show that he did not see any problem with raising the question, even though a host of senators had denounced it.\n\nOn another show in 2015, Mr. Gaffney said that President Barack Obama displayed \u201ckind of an affinity for, if not the violent beheading and crucifixions and slaying of Christians and all that, but at least for the cause for which these guys are engaged in such activities.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo agreed, saying, \u201cFrank, every place you stare at the president\u2019s policies and statements, you see what you just described.\u201d\n\nMr. Gaffney went on to ask Mr. Pompeo whether he had concerns about Representative Andr\u00e9 Carson, a Democrat of Indiana who is Muslim, and who served on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Carson has \u201cdeep personal ties to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and organizations,\u201d Mr. Gaffney asserted, an accusation that is unfounded.\n\nMr. Pompeo sidestepped the question about his colleague, but said, \u201cThere are organizations and networks here in the United States tied to radical Islam in deep and fundamental ways.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe warned: \u201cThe efforts to expand the caliphate are not limited to the physical geography of the Middle East or other places where there are large Muslim majorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe idea that American Muslims are a subversive fifth column is rejected by mainstream experts. Muslims make up less than 1 percent of the American population and many of those who are immigrants came to the United States to escape authoritarian Muslim countries; imposing Shariah law is not on their agenda. American Muslim leaders have denounced the Islamic State, which has threatened them with death.\n\nWa\u2019el N. Alzayat, who was a Middle East expert at the State Department and senior policy adviser to Samantha Power, the former United Nations ambassador, said of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s comments, \u201cImagine if this stuff had been said about Jews, or African-Americans or Chinese-Americans. And yet, we\u2019re living with an administration that is actually rewarding people with racist views or racist associations with some of the highest positions in our government.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton, a fierce critic of Mr. Obama, wrote the foreword to a 2013 book by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, \u201cThe Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u2019s War on America.\u201d Ms. Geller has said that the only moderate Muslims are secular Muslims, and that allowing Muslims to pray in public schools or workplaces would lead to the \u201cmosque-ing\u201d of America. She led the fight against a mosque near the site of the World Trade Center.\n\nSix liberal Jewish organizations last week issued a statement warning that the appointment of Mr. Bolton was \u201cdangerous.\u201d Among their objections: \u201cThis willingness to support anti-Muslim bigotry violates fundamental Jewish and democratic values of tolerance, equality and respect.\u201d\n\nAs national security adviser, Mr. Bolton does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMany analysts predicted that Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo would push to have the State Department declare the Muslim Brotherhood to be a foreign terrorist organization. The designation would mean that any individuals or organizations accused of association could be subject to investigations, seizure of assets, and other legal actions.\n\nAs a congressman, Mr. Pompeo co-sponsored legislation to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. When he became the C.I.A. director, analysts at the agency warned that such a designation would be ill-advised, Politico reported. But there was still enthusiasm for such action. Mr. Bolton said on Mr. Gaffney\u2019s radio program last July, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the United States get on with the business of declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization?\u201d\n\nArsalan Suleman, the acting special envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation during the Obama administration, said that designating the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist association would be misguided, because the group had morphed into different forms in various countries. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after he took power from a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated president. In Jordan, the group still participates in electoral politics.\n\nAmerican Muslim leaders and policy analysts say that such a move could be used to target Muslim groups and nonprofits \u2014 even those that work to protect civil rights and the victims of hate crimes. Anti-Islam groups like ACT for America and the Center for Security Policy characterize many of the largest American Muslim organizations as \u201cfronts\u201d for the Muslim Brotherhood. But most mainstream experts on American Muslims say that any such connections are so tenuous or old as to be irrelevant, and that the effort to classify them as terrorist affiliates amounts to modern-day McCarthyism.\n\n\u201cThis is just another way of demonizing a broad swath of American Muslims,\u201d said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.", "title": "Pompeo and Bolton Appointments Raise Alarm Over Ties to Anti-Islam Groups", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein"]}

After being introduced to the idea of pop-ups, he brought the concept back to James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., from which he graduated that year. The university\u2019s X-Lab has since held pop-ups in everything from building ukuleles to ice-cream making using liquid nitrogen.\n\nLearning: A Special Section Welcome to the new Learning section \u2014 a deep dive into the joys, excitement, challenges and opportunities in the world of education and learning.

Some classes last a few weeks; others run for a day or weekend. Some are faculty led; others are taught by students, administrators or even local businesspeople. Some are for credit; others are strictly for fun \u2014 or, at least, personal enlightenment. And sometimes the classes are so popular that they return as full-fledged, for-credit courses, which is what happened with the \u201cEssay as Resistance\u201d class.\n\n\u201cOur goal here is to enhance the creative capacity of our students and teach them to navigate ambiguity, and to foster experimental learning,\u201d said Fred Leichter, founding director of the Hive, officially the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity. \u201cThe pop-ups are designed as a way to offer things that are often mash-ups between different disciplines.

That means there\u2019s more eviction notices because it\u2019s easier for landlords to use the court system without opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can inform people of their rights in responding to an eviction notice, we might get more protection to them. To use the process. So the class is a lab \u2014 where my students, legal aid and the court \u2014 help them think through what interventions they can send out to encourage people to take action.\u201d\n\n\u2018Self-Determination: Restoration and Resiliency,\u2019 St. Michael\u2019s College\n\nAntonia Messuri, the assistant dean for academics at St. Michael\u2019s in Colchester, Vt., regularly counsels students who are stuck in their lives. \u201cOften our students are coming from a place of being told what to do, how to do it and when it\u2019s due their whole lives,\u201d she said. This class, which runs through April, \u201cis an opportunity for them to say, \u2018This is my life, my education.\u2019 \u201d Students will read articles on self-determination and Buddhist writings, with a focus on meditation, resilience and grit.\n\n\u2018Drones and Rockets,\u2019 James Madison University\n\nThe bulk of the pop-ups at James Madison are designed to be a mix of science and technology. In this class, on April 20, students learn the basic rules for safe flying, practice flight controls and then test their skills by flying through something they can relate to: a Quidditch course. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to expose them to lightweight drones and the opportunity to take the full drone class where they learn how to use drones to solve real-world problems,\u201d said Nick Swayne, founding director of the university\u2019s X-Lab. \u201cWe will also have small model rockets available for students to try.

{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "In a visit to Chile and Peru in January, the pope made a spirited defense of Bishop Juan Barros Madrid that seemed to disregard the testimony of abuse survivors, who had long claimed the prelate had witnessed and covered up abuse by his mentor, the charismatic priest the Rev. Fernando Karadima. The pope said he had seen no \u201cproof\u201d of a cover-up.\n\nThen, in an attempted apology on the flight back to Rome, Francis made a strange distinction between proof and evidence, and reiterated accusations of \u201ccalumny\u201d against the bishop\u2019s accusers. He revealed that he had twice rejected the resignation in recent years of Bishop Barros, whom he appointed to the small diocese of Osorno in 2015.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI am also convinced he is innocent,\u201d Francis added on the flight.\n\nBut one of the pope\u2019s top advisers, the leader of his commission investigating abuse, Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston, distanced himself from the pontiff. And it then emerged that Cardinal O\u2019Malley had hand-delivered a victim\u2019s letter to Francis with a graphic account of how Bishop Barros had observed abuse by a priest. The letter seemed to contradict the pope\u2019s claim that he had received no evidence.\n\nThe pope\u2019s belief in the bishop\u2019s innocence over the victims\u2019 accusations outraged advocates for abuse survivors, and gave ammunition to those who said the usually politically deft pope had a tin ear when it came to sex abuse.

He wrote that the investigators sometimes felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by \u201cso many victims of grave abuses of conscience and of power and in particular of the sexual abuses committed by various clergymen of your country against minors, who were robbed of their innocence.\u201d\n\nIn Chile, the church hierarchy followed his lead.

{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nTHE ITALIAN TEACHER\n\nBy Tom Rachman\n\n341 pp. Viking. $27.\n\nThe romantic image of a genius who is at best self-absorbed and at worst plainly monstrous in private life is familiar from countless biographies of painters (writers, composers, directors). The annals of art are littered with abandoned women, neglected offspring, heartbreaks and betrayals. Yet Gauguin, after deserting his family, went on to paint his celebrated landscapes of Tahiti, and Picasso \u2014 who fathered four children by three women, juggled mistresses and wives, and helped drive two of them to suicide \u2014 forever changed the face of modern art. Morality and immortality, it must be acknowledged, do not necessarily go hand in hand. In fact, the opposite often seems to be true: To achieve real mastery, the artist must be obsessed with work, fiercely protective of his time, ruthlessly selfish in his dealings with those who would impose upon him \u2014 all the small, needy people who ask for crumbs of his soul yet ask in vain \u2014 for all of it, undivided, is laid on the altar of Art.\n\nSuch a Great Artist, the capitalization almost palpable, is the subject of Tom Rachman\u2019s engaging and subtle third novel, \u201cThe Italian Teacher.\u201d In the opening scene, the aptly named Bear Bavinsky appears to his adoring son as a magnificent giant who, rising from his bath, leans on the 5-year-old for balance, making the boy tremble under his weight. Like many a subsequent episode, this feels both vividly realistic and effortlessly symbolic, foretelling the unbalanced relationships within the family, the man ever a dominant, expansive, larger-than-life figure who will continue to cast his shadow on numerous successive wives and progeny. (We learn the exact head count of Bear\u2019s children only at his funeral; Picasso, who may have served as the inspiration for a few plot peregrinations, had nothing on him.) Painted in bold, convincing brush strokes, Bear strides through life with confidence and vitality, joking, scowling, smoking pipes, spreading his mood, \u201cthe man\u2019s pleasures clapping you on the shoulder,\u201d charming and impregnating young women, discarding them as they get older, mussing his children\u2019s hair, feeding his children\u2019s hopes, crushing his children\u2019s dreams and always thinking about, talking about, breathing art.\n\nPhoto\n\nArt is not, however, the focus of Rachman\u2019s novel. To be sure, art lovers will find a steady scattering of treats \u2014 anecdotes about Giacometti and Picasso, aesthetic judgments (Correggio and Renoir are reviled, D\u00fcrer and Soutine admired), pithy aphorisms (\u201cSuccess in art is 50 percent timing, 50 percent geography. The rest is talent,\u201d a cynical dealer says), and snapshots from the art world, from the elegant Roman gatherings of the 1950s, where \u201cthe moneyed all speak of art, the artists all speak of money,\u201d to the auctions at the turn of the millennium, where Bulgarian crime bosses and Malaysian baby-bottle billionaires snatch up critically sanctified masterpieces. Yet such glimpses are oblique, and profound insights into the nature of artistic greatness are not on offer. While Bear\u2019s genius does not seem to be in doubt, we are given a rather one-note, not to say gimmicky, impression of his work: His wildly colored paintings are all extreme magnifications of this or that body part, \u201ca bare throat filling the huge canvas, or a roll of tummy fat, or a pricked shoulder\u201d; significantly, his portraits never once include a subject\u2019s face.\n\nYet Rachman appears in perfect control of his material. This is not an aesthetic treatise but, first and foremost, a morality tale about fame and family, \u201cthe long, loud effect of fathers.\u201d For Bear Bavinsky, while unquestionably the book\u2019s central presence, is not, in fact, its protagonist. It is his son, Charles \u201cPinch\u201d Bavinsky, whose much more obscure life we follow in its chronological unfolding, from childhood to old age. Pinch\u2019s mother, Natalie, a struggling Canadian potter, is Bear\u2019s third wife, living with him for a decade before being deserted for a new family. Insecure, solitary, unattractive, Pinch loves his father with a fierceness that veers uncomfortably close to worship, and, post-abandonment, he will spend years trying to impress the absent man. As an adolescent, he harbors artistic aspirations of his own, \u201cimagines enduring in history, a major painter, he and Dad recalled together,\u201d but Bear, with casual cruelty, dashes his ambitions in an understated yet gut-wrenching scene. \u201cI got to tell you, kiddo,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not an artist. And you never will be.\u201d Crushed, Pinch turns to art history, styling himself as \u201cthe future critic of renown\u201d who will become famous for writing the definitive biography of Bear Bavinsky. Yet this dream, too, comes apart in due course, not without Bear\u2019s heavy hand in the debacle, and Pinch steps out of his father\u2019s spotlight and slowly fades into adulthood, his life a modest existence of a language instructor at a London school \u2014 the slyly ironic \u201cItalian teacher\u201d of the title.\n\nPinch\u2019s middle years, and the middle of the book, are meandering and seemingly plotless, filled with sadness, disappointment and tenuously formed and lost connections. Yet the quiet story remains engrossing, by turns gently humorous and pathetic, mundane and poignant. Unlike his father, Pinch leaves few traces, forms few attachments, sires no children. Rachman\u2019s gift for characterization, on full display in his first novel, \u201cThe Imperfectionists,\u201d seems oddly underused here, for the characters are fewer, less defined. Apart from Bear, the only figures who stand out in Pinch\u2019s surroundings are his mother, the tormented woman with her own ruined dreams, and his best friend, who has a penchant for pastel scarves, scandalous opinions and hard drinking. This lingering vagueness sounds a curious echo to Bear\u2019s faceless paintings, almost as if Pinch sees the world but dimly, blinded by the glare of his father\u2019s personality, by the light of his father\u2019s art. Indeed, Bear\u2019s presence or absence remains the shaping force of Pinch\u2019s existence well into his later years; but as he ages, the question of his acquiescence, of his volition, begins to hover more and more insistently. Is Pinch really as oppressed by his father\u2019s overbearing (pun intended) will as he appears? Or is he largely culpable for the ending of his mother\u2019s life, the collapse of his one meaningful love affair, the fate of his father\u2019s legacy?\n\nAs \u201cthe grizzled legend,\u201d already in his 80s, nears death, the story quickens, bringing the themes of posterity and accountability to the fore. How precisely are reputations made? What separates the immortals from \u201cthe billions whose inner lives clamor, then expire, never to earn the slightest notice\u201d \u2014 how much of it is luck, how much personality, how much talent? And does talent give one the right to trample others? Bear himself believes so. In an explosive confrontation at the heart of the book, the father says to his son, \u201cYou work for me.\u201d The aftershocks of this emotional eruption ripple through to the end, bringing upheavals and reversals in their wake. As the hour of reckoning draws nigh, the ironies grow thick, and the eventual dramatic resolution feels somewhat forced; while some readers may see a heartwarming message here, I, for one, found it highly ambiguous and not a little horrifying. Yet so apparent are Rachman\u2019s humanity and intelligence throughout that this ambiguity must be fully intended.

Experts are intrigued by the question of what effect, if any, it will have on jurors\u2019 attitudes toward sexual assault \u2014 whether, for example, jurors will be more willing to believe women who come forward to bring complaints than they were in the past.\n\n\u201cSince Cosby\u2019s first go-round, all courtroom participants \u2014 jurors, attorneys, judge \u2014 have been immersed in an intensive course on sexual violation,\u201d Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University and a former prosecutor who specialized in domestic violence cases, \u201cincluding the kind of sexual assault inflicted by mentors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ways in which we evaluate the credibility of survivors has also shifted in important ways,\u201d she said, \u201cfrom a default to doubt, to a greater willingness to believe. And we have been newly schooled in the importance of consent. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out in the courtroom.\u201d\n\nMr. Cosby\u2019s interest in the question is far from academic. His first trial on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004 at his home outside Philadelphia, ended with a hung jury. At least one juror reported some problems with Ms. Constand\u2019s credibility and had a question about why the many women who accused him did not come forward sooner. Now the entertainer\u2019s lawyers say they are worried that the barrage of publicity surrounding bad-behaving men will lead jurors to lump Mr. Cosby in with the others.\n\nPhoto\n\nProsecutors contend that Mr. Cosby, 80, is also a sexual predator, one who abused dozens of women, though Ms. Constand\u2019s case is the only one to result in criminal charges. The prosecution will offer accounts from five other women during the trial who are expected to testify that Mr. Cosby tried to intoxicate them in some way before sexually abusing them.\n\nThe very fact that Judge O\u2019Neill is allowing five additional accusers to testify \u2014 not one, as in the first trial \u2014 is evidence of how the #MeToo moment has influenced the case, said Paula Hannaford-Agor, director of the Center for Jury Studies at the National Center for State Courts. The judge has not explained his reasoning for allowing more accusers to testify this time.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that, I said really, the ground has really shifted,\u201d Ms. Hannaford-Agor said. \u201cThe judge has had to pay attention.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe defense has been arguing, instead, that the prejudicial effect on the jury to have five additional women testify is too much for Mr. Cosby to receive a fair trial, that it will distract from a focus on the facts of the Constand case. He has said the sexual encounter was consensual.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the morning session, Judge O\u2019Neill did some broad surveying of the jury pool and found that more than half of the potential jurors \u2014 68 \u2014 said they had already formed an opinion about the case. They were disqualified.\n\nReporters were barred from the room and relegated to another courtroom where they watched on closed-circuit television, unable to see the jurors or grasp how they were answering the judge\u2019s questions. Judge O\u2019Neil indicated that Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers had objected to allowing the media a broader view of the jury pool.\n\n\u201cThey would object to having every member of the media sitting in the courtroom,\u201d he said. But he seemed to condone it because it would help keep the jurors\u2019 identities anonymous, he said, as they were in the first trial. Several news organizations complained about the exclusion, but the judge never revealed his legal basis for the decision.\n\nThe questioning of individual jurors intensified in the afternoon, and three were asked again about whether they had heard about #MeToo incidents in the entertainment industry and whether they could remain impartial. All said they could. But the defense and the prosecution settled only on one juror Monday, a white man in his 20s wearing a navy T-shirt who said he had heard about #MeToo but that he would not be affected by it.\n\nAll of the 12 jurors and six alternates will remain anonymous throughout the trial. Judge O\u2019Neill said that the trial was likely to last a month and that the jury would be sequestered during that period. The selection process will continue Tuesday.\n\nLast time, the jury was drawn from Pittsburgh and bused here after Mr. Cosby said he was worried that potential jurors in Montgomery County had been affected by pretrial publicity. This time, however, he has made no objections to jurors from the county, where Mr. Cosby, a Philadelphia native, has long owned a home and was among the best-known graduates of Temple University, where Ms. Constand worked as support staff for the women\u2019s basketball team.", "title": "Potential Cosby Jurors Are Asked About #MeToo Bias", "authors": ["Graham Bowley"]}

Still, American officials said the attack was intended as a proportional strike aimed specifically at Syria\u2019s chemical weapons facilities rather than a broader set of targets and was a one-time, one-night assault to punish Damascus for a suspected gas attack last weekend.\n\nIn the days before the strike, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis cautioned against a quick assault without a more thought-through strategy. He expressed concern about the potential for escalating the conflict by drawing Russia and Iran into a deeper confrontation with the United States in a country where all three have forces on the ground. With Russian and Iranian forces supporting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the potential for miscues weighed on military planners.\n\nFor all of Mr. Trump\u2019s tough language this week, the variant he chose made no apparent effort to damage Mr. Assad\u2019s broader war machine or his government\u2019s command and control of its forces beyond its chemical weapons.

Where once she ferried people through perilous, reality-bending portions of space, she now makes a living as a \u201cbrewer of serenity,\u201d synthesizing cocktails of mind-altering drugs that help humans endure the \u201cdeep spaces\u201d she can no longer travel. But when a woman named Long Chau engages her services to study corpses in deep space, the Shadow\u2019s Child finds herself needing to confront portions of her past she\u2019d rather forget.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a tidy transposition of Holmes and Watson into far-future space, for all that the elements of homage (Long Chau is an abrasive self-medicating \u201cconsulting detective\u201d) shine through. The Shadow\u2019s Child is a fully realized character in her own right, and the dislike she feels for Long Chau is sustained and justified. Instead it\u2019s a window onto a beautifully developed world that widens the meaning of space opera, one that centers on Chinese and Vietnamese cultures and customs instead of Western military conventions, and is all the more welcome for it.\n\n\u2666\n\nKelly Robson\u2019s GODS, MONSTERS, AND THE LUCKY PEACH (Tor.com, paper, $14.99) is a story that retells itself. It\u2019s a brilliantly structured far-future novella focused on ancient history: Its locales are primarily Calgary in 2267 and Mesopotamia in 2024 B.C. In one, humanity has ravaged the planet\u2019s surface, moved underground, and has only just begun to make the surface habitable again; in the other, King Shulgi and Susa, a priestess, argue about new stars in the sky and the meaning of portents. The story\u2019s poles are past and future, sky and earth; everything in between thrums with a delicious tension carefully developed among the wonderful characters.\n\nMinh is a senior consultant at ESSA, a firm that specializes in restoring and maintaining surface habitats. Minh herself specializes in restoring rivers and has spent decades wrangling underground banks into funding aboveground projects \u2014 until the invention of limited-use time travel turns bankers away from long-term ecological restoration and toward short-term profits from temporal tourism. But when Minh\u2019s intern Kiki draws her attention to a call for proposals to restore the Mesopotamian drainage basin by traveling into the past to study it, she jumps at the chance.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She writes about strategizing on RFPs and securing funding like planning a heist, with absolutely delightful team-assembling dynamics and fake-it-till-you-make-it bravado. I also loved the dynamic between Minh and Kiki, loosely echoing some of the boomer-millennial rhetoric of our present moment in complex and empathetic ways.\n\nMy only problem with this book is its length; it reads like the first three acts of a perfectly paced and plotted five-act novel, to the point where I wondered if the rest had been cleanly sheared off at the printer\u2019s. It\u2019s a short story\u2019s conclusion to a novel\u2019s worth of development, and while I certainly hope that Robson will write a sequel, I can\u2019t help feeling dismayed by an amazing story that stops instead of ending.\n\n\u2666\n\nA novel that certainly doesn\u2019t skimp on length, Tessa Gratton\u2019s THE QUEENS OF INNIS LEAR (Tor, $26.99) is a high-fantasy transformation of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cKing Lear\u201d set in a world where magic and ecology are intimately connected. On the island of Innis Lear, there is the high magic of reading the stars, and the low magic of wormwork and rootwater; when everything\u2019s in balance, these systems intersect in complex and fruitful ways. But ever since the star-prophesied loss of his wife, Dalat, King Lear has capped the island\u2019s holy wells and devoted himself exclusively to the stars, forbidding the language of trees and roots, and going slowly mad while the island\u2019s crops and climate fail around him.\n\nReading \u201cQueens\u201d is at first a study in finding analogues. While Lear is Lear, his daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia become Gaela, Regan and Elia; Edgar and Edmund are Rory and Ban. But the Shakespearean counterparts are at most touchstones for the fully developed characters Gratton writes. Most notably, Gaela and Regan aren\u2019t petty, scheming villains; they\u2019re grieving daughters who\u2019ve had to wonder for years whether their father murdered their mother.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGratton\u2019s decision to make Dalat black, from the empress-ruled Third Kingdom \u201can ocean and half a continent away,\u201d thoroughly enriches the story.

The singer refused all testing, including having blood drawn and undergoing a urine toxicology report, in what his friends later said was an effort to conceal his addiction to painkillers from the public. Prince, who was known for his privacy, left the hospital without further treatment and returned to his Paisley Park home in Minnesota, according to investigators.\n\nAlexander Stein, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who writes about medical malpractice, said that while \u201cin some states this would be a very difficult case to win,\u201d Illinois tends to be \u201cpro-patient.\u201d\n\nAccording to the investigators\u2019 report, Judith Hill, a singer who was on the flight that landed in Illinois, said Prince had told her he had taken an unidentified pill stored in a Bayer aspirin bottle. Dr. Mancha said that the pills resembled hydrocodone (or Vicodin) and that she sent one to a pharmacy to be identified. The pill, which had the inscription Watson 853, was identified at the pharmacy as hydrocodone, though it was not tested for its authenticity, Dr. Mancha said.\n\nAfter Prince\u2019s death, investigators discovered a Bayer bottle from his nightstand at Paisley Park containing 64.5 pills labeled Watson 853.

In their limited statements to investigators, those closest to Prince in his final years said that the depths of his opioid addiction had been largely concealed from them until his final weeks when they rushed to save him.\n\n\u201cHow did he hide this so well?\u201d Mr. Johnson said to investigators, repeatedly mentioning Prince\u2019s obsession with privacy.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose who had been close to Prince in earlier days told investigators a different story. An ex-wife, a former business manager, a past tour manager and Sheila E., a longtime musical collaborator, each told police that Prince had used prescription painkillers for many years, both discreetly and with a sense of shame. They said Prince had relied on a small network of people to obtain medication while maintaining his privacy.\n\nThis seeming contradiction \u2014 with some of Prince\u2019s associates saying they were aware of his long struggle with pain medication, but others saying they had no idea until the very end \u2014 ultimately frustrated investigators.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the actions of individuals closely associated with Prince will be questioned, criticized and judged in the days and weeks to come,\u201d the Carver County attorney, Mark Metz, said in his announcement that there would be no charges. Mr. Metz noted that \u201cbecause Prince was an intensely private person, he was certainly assisted and enabled by others to obtain\u201d the pills he came to rely on.\n\nBut the investigators could not make a case against anyone for supplying the fatal drugs. \u201cSuspicions and innuendo are categorically insufficient to support any criminal charges,\u201d Mr. Metz said.\n\nDespite an often blurry picture of the singer\u2019s relationship to drugs, Prince\u2019s associates appeared to agree that his pain stemmed from what he loved most: performing. After decades of onstage acrobatics, often in heels, Prince was known to suffer from hip pain and was said to have undergone surgery. The musician also complained sometimes of numbness in his arms and hands, possibly from banging relentlessly on the piano.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview with police about a year after Prince\u2019s death, Theo London, his tour manager and chief of staff between 2011 and 2015, recalled the singer once asking for a painkiller and becoming angry when Mr. London brought him a Tylenol, explaining that he needed something stronger.\n\nManuela Testolini, Prince\u2019s wife from 2001 to 2007, told police that Prince often used narcotic pain pills during that period to manage his bodily aches. Sheila E. said that Prince had always wanted to hide how much pain he was in. Years ago, she told police, people working for the singer would obtain prescriptions for him in their own names to protect his privacy.\n\nInvestigators found that Mr. Johnson had done just that before Prince\u2019s April 14 concert in Atlanta. Dr. Michael Schulenberg told police that he had prescribed Percocet to Prince in Mr. Johnson\u2019s name that day, after a last-minute request to treat the singer. It is illegal to write a prescription to someone knowing the medication is intended for someone else, and on Thursday, Dr. Schulenberg agreed to pay a $30,000 civil settlement with the federal government, in which he admitted no liability.\n\nText messages obtained by police show Mr. Johnson scheduling appointments for Prince with the doctor, including a day before he died, when he appeared to be going through opiate withdrawal. Dr. Schulenberg prescribed drugs in Prince\u2019s name for those symptoms, and he and Prince\u2019s close associates began seeking help.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s lawyer, F.

The bottom line is, if they had thought he\u2019d done something wrong, they\u2019d have charged him.\u201d\n\nAddiction specialists were waiting at the Paisley Park studio and residence on the morning of April 21 when Prince was discovered dead in his elevator.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The refrain that would be repeated throughout the investigation began right away: Prince was a very private person, his confidantes told authorities.\n\nMs. Bekure, in a brief interview with police that afternoon, explained she was uncertain of what she could discuss, having signed a confidentiality agreement. She said the only medication she had procured for Prince was for constipation. (Investigators noted that various bathrooms in Paisley Park contained enemas and other constipation medication: \u201cThis was of interest only because one of the common side effects of narcotics usage is constipation,\u201d documents said.)\n\nOn Friday, Ryan Garry, a lawyer for Ms. Bekure, said that Ms. Bekure \u201ccontinues to mourn Prince\u2019s passing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple of years emotionally and she\u2019s thankful the matter has come to a close,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Johnson told investigators that he was only beginning to understand the depths of Prince\u2019s addiction. Again citing Prince\u2019s privacy \u2014 the singer had no cellphone and had even disabled the security cameras on his property because he feared being watched, he said \u2014 Mr. Johnson also cautioned the authorities that \u201cno one would talk about\u201d Prince\u2019s drug use, perhaps out of fear.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers further removed had fewer reservations about telling investigators what they knew or believed. Crystal Zehetner, a chef for Prince who also worked as his business manager between 2010 and 2015, told Detective Chris Wagner of the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s Office that Prince would frequently complain of hip pain and that she \u201cknew he had a substance abuse problem,\u201d according to a report from Detective Wagner.\n\nMs. Zehetner, who declined to comment on Friday, told the detective that \u201cof course\u201d those around him knew about Prince\u2019s addiction and that if anyone who worked with Prince said they did not know, \u201cthat those people were lying.\u201d\n\nA couple of associates said they had noticed changes in Prince\u2019s demeanor and behavior. In early April, he had canceled shows, citing the flu, and his personal chef, Ray Roberts, told police Prince was eating less, losing weight and \u201cdidn\u2019t seem good.\u201d Judith Hill, one of Prince\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9es who was on the Moline flight, said to investigators that he had been exhausted on the way to Atlanta, even telling her, \u201cOh man, I love sleeping more, maybe it means I\u2019ve done all I\u2019m supposed to do on this earth.\u201d\n\nIt can be difficult to assess whether someone is addicted to painkillers, according to Dr. John Kelly, director of the Recovery Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital. But some telltale signs, he said, were lethargy, irritability, nodding off and perhaps most important, tolerance to medication that leads abusers to seek ever higher doses.\n\nCarver County investigators indicated that they had run into various hurdles while looking into Prince\u2019s death. For instance, a Gmail account belonging to Prince was opened from his MacBook on April 23, 2016, the day of his memorial service, before law enforcement officials obtained a search warrant. \u201cAfter obtaining a search warrant on Prince\u2019s Google accounts, there was no information prior to 4-19-16,\u201d according to a police report, \u201csuggesting the content had been deleted.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, one of Prince\u2019s sisters, Sharon L.

A representative for the family, John Goetz, said of the investigators, \u201cThey certainly dug deep and tried hard.\u201d He added that the family had not ruled out filing a wrongful-death lawsuit.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition to Dr. Schulenberg, investigators had focused on doctors and medical personnel who were trying to treat Prince for an apparent painkiller addiction, as well as Mr. Johnson, an employee of the musician since the 1980s, according to court documents released last April.\n\nThough Prince had been a proponent of sober living, friends said after his overdose that the singer had suffered from chronic hip pain he was trying to manage and perform through. Following his death, dozens of pills were found at his Paisley Park home and studio in Chanhassen, a Twin Cities suburb, Mr. Metz said.\n\nThey were almost entirely counterfeits of Vicodin, many of them kept in bottles marked Bayer and Aleve, Mr. Metz said.\n\nBorn Prince Rogers Nelson, the musician was found dead, at 57, in a Paisley Park elevator on April 21, 2016, by Mr. Johnson and others. A toxicology report, obtained by The Associated Press in March, found high concentrations of fentanyl in the singer\u2019s stomach, liver and blood. Although fentanyl can be prescribed legally, frequently in the form of a patch, it is often used to manufacture counterfeit pills that are sold on the black market as oxycodone and other pain relievers.\n\nPhoto\n\n[ALSO READ: Prince Overdosed on Fentanyl. What is it?]\n\nIn announcing the decision not to charge anyone in Prince\u2019s death, Mr. Metz said that the singer had been in \u201csignificant pain for a number of years\u201d and had been treating himself with painkillers, although he had no known prescriptions for Vicodin or fentanyl in his name.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBecause Prince was an intensely private person, he was certainly assisted and enabled by others to obtain some of these medications,\u201d Mr. Metz said. \u201cThose individuals included, but are not limited to, Dr. Schulenberg and Kirk Johnson.\u201d But Mr. Metz said there was no evidence to tie any specific person to the fatal pills.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Johnson\u2019s lawyer, F. Clayton Tyler, said that Mr. Johnson was \u201crelieved\u201d that no charges had been filed against him. \u201cHe continues to deny that he had anything to do with the death of his close friend, Prince,\u201d the statement said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms his innocence.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson still works at Paisley Park as an estate manager, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has not been questioned since the initial interviews, Mr. Tyler said.\n\nPhoto\n\nPrince, notoriously discreet, did not even have a cellphone, which hindered the investigation, Mr. Metz said. Details of the singer\u2019s life remained shrouded in secrecy even after his unexpected death. Investigators said in court records that those who were present at the home that morning \u201cprovided inconsistent and, at times, contradictory statements.\u201d The musician also left no will, leading to complex and ongoing proceedings among his six heirs.\n\nThere had been signs that Prince\u2019s closest confidantes were concerned with his apparent addiction. Six days before his death, a chartered jet carrying the singer home from a concert in Atlanta \u2014 his final full show \u2014 made an emergency stop in Moline, Ill., where Prince was treated for an opioid overdose, taken to a hospital and released that same day with no further drug testing.\n\n[ALSO READ: How Prince Invented Himself. Over and Over]\n\nThe incident prompted another examination of Prince by Dr. Schulenberg on April 20, during which the doctor prescribed Prince a medication used to treat opiate withdrawals. (An associate of Prince\u2019s also alerted a California-based doctor who specializes in addiction, who put his son on a red-eye flight to Minneapolis to treat the musician.)\n\nAs part of the settlement, Dr. Schulenberg agreed to two years of \u201cheightened compliance requirements for logging and reporting his prescriptions of controlled substances to the D.E.A.,\u201d the United States attorney\u2019s office in Minneapolis said in a statement.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cDoctors are trusted medical professionals and, in the midst of our opioid crisis, they must be part of the solution,\u201d Greg Booker, the United States attorney for Minnesota, said in the statement. \u201cAs licensed professionals, doctors are held to a high level of accountability in their prescribing practices, especially when it comes to highly addictive painkillers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmy Conners, the doctor\u2019s lawyer, maintained in a statement that Dr. Schulenberg never prescribed drugs to Prince in someone else\u2019s name. \u201cAfter he learned of Prince\u2019s addiction, he immediately worked to refer Prince to a treatment facility and to transfer care to a chemical dependency specialist,\u201d Ms. Conners said.\n\nDr. Schulenberg moved to a new job in a different suburb of Minneapolis soon after Prince\u2019s death, and is still a doctor in good standing in Minnesota, according to state licensing board records.\n\nDeaths in the United States involving fentanyl more than doubled from 2015 to 2016, according to government data, amid a sharp rise in drug-related fatalities overall. Prince\u2019s death coincided with a surge in fentanyl on the black market in Minnesota, and the case heightened the level of concern about opioids there. And his was not the only case involving a high-profile musician: In January, Tom Petty was found to have died from an accidental drug overdose involving fentanyl, while Lil Peep, a 21-year-old rapper who died of an overdose in November, had fentanyl, among other prescription drugs, in his system as well.\n\nMost fentanyl overdoses come from illegal versions of the drug bought on the street or on the \u201cdark web\u201d in pill form, said Ken Solek, an assistant special agent in charge of the Minneapolis office of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Because it\u2019s cheap to produce, the drug is often smuggled into the country and sold as pricier prescription pain pills.\n\n\u201cMost of it\u2019s being ordered from China and dealers encapsulate it or press it into pills in a basement,\u201d Mr. Solek said, adding that users may think they are buying pills such as oxycodone, but in reality, they are 100 times stronger.", "title": "Prince\u2019s Overdose Death Results in No Criminal Charges", "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli", "Sheila M.

Negotiators claim that their services protect consumers from unscrupulous dealers, save time and most of all save money on cars both new and used, whether bought or leased.\n\nMr. Weintraub has periodically accepted a public challenge to prove his worth. In August, the syndicated TV program \u201cMoney Talks News\u201d pitted him against the financial services company USAA (a partner of the buying service TrueCar) and the show\u2019s host to buy a Mercedes that listed for more than $46,000. Mr. Weintraub\u2019s total discount of more than $7,200 beat the next best deal by more than $2,000.\n\nBut finding a negotiator can be tricky. There is no standard name for these services \u2014 some call themselves a buying service, others a negotiating service, some a broker, still others a concierge. Each seems to operate in its own way.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Weintraub, a former car salesman, said he worked with buyers from start to finish. He will help them choose a car and negotiate the sales price, finance rate, and aftermarket products like service contacts and wheel and paint protection. He works nationwide and charges $600 to $1,500, depending on the cost of the car. For an additional $300 he will also sell the client\u2019s old car.\n\nMike Rabkin of From Car to Finish in Rockville, Md., does less initial consulting. Clients fill out an online order form for the model, color and options they want. Mr. Rabkin then has dealers bid for their business. Negotiating financing and aftermarket products is left to the client. He charges $250.\n\nGreg Macke, who calls himself \u201cYour Car Angel,\u201d helps clients pick a car, arranges a test drive, negotiates the purchase and accompanies the buyer to a dealership. He even inspects used cars. But he accepts only clients who live near Los Angeles for his $750 service.\n\n\u201cThe key to inspections is laying eyes on the car,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Maloney is a New York-based former fleet director with an Australian accent and a snappy line of patter. He calls his business the Car Leasing Concierge, although he handles new-car sales as well.

Freeman II, the executive manager of Sunset Chevrolet Buick GMC in Sarasota, Fla., said the average profit on a car was 2 percent. On a $30,000 car that would be $600. TrueCar, he said, charges a fee of $300 for each new car sold on a referral.\n\n\u201cWhen we get someone from TrueCar, we have to cut a check,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cThat is factored into the price.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTrueCar is the technology behind 500 buying services, like those of publications like Car & Driver and U.S. News and World Report, and companies like USAA and Sam\u2019s Club. The dealers get their referrals from TrueCar, which displays prices from its member dealerships and allows prospective buyers to compare the out-the-door cost for the vehicle they want. That eliminates haggling \u2014 for better or worse.\n\nThe details of how a dealer reaches the price that TrueCar displays are complex, said Veronica Cardenas, a spokeswoman for TrueCar, but \u201cit\u2019s not a race to the bottom.\u201d She added, \u201cThe idea is you are getting a competitive price.\u201d\n\nThere are competitors that charge dealerships a modest monthly fee, such as Costco and CarGurus, which dealers said gave them more room to discount. (Sometimes, getting the very best deal comes from buying at just the right time. Dealers receive bonuses based on sale quotas, meaning they might give bigger discounts if they\u2019re trying to hit a benchmark. On the other hand, that means dealers might not know how profitable a deal is for them until well after a sale agreement is signed.)\n\nSeveral negotiators warned that competitors took money from dealerships and colluded on deals. The negotiation industry isn\u2019t regulated, nor is it represented by a trade group. Customers have to make a best guess using online reviews to determine if a buying service is a good fit, and that information can be ambiguous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTake, for instance, Mr. Rabkin, who has a spotless A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau. There are two reviews on Angie\u2019s List for 2017, an A and a B grade, and he has a slew of overwhelmingly positive testimonials on LinkedIn and Yelp. But the most recent of those testimonials are dated 2015. Mr. Rabkin pointed out he had no control over when people reviewed his service online.\n\nHiring a pro buyer is likely to save you money, but not more than you can save yourself, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a trade group of consumer lawyers.\n\n\u201cThere is enough information out there today that you don\u2019t have to be the most sophisticated buyer to know what the real cost should be,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a buying service unless you are intimidated by the process, and there are those people.\u201d\n\nFor people who are anxious about car buying, or whose time is too valuable to spend it bargaining over a sticker price, a buying service can be worthwhile. But there are also buyers who hire a professional negotiator because they aim to bully every last nickel out of a dealership. Because of the nature of industry incentives, though, they can never really know if they achieved that goal.\n\n\u201cThose people,\u201d Mr. Rheingold said, \u201cneed to get a life.\u201d", "title": "Professionals Make Car Buying Easy, but You Have to Shop Around", "authors": ["Roy Furchgott"]}

{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "Warm Up\n\nAsk students to listen to their recordings from the previous day using headphones. While they listen, they should write an outline of the recording, like this transcript from the Invisibilia podcast they already listened to. Since their outlines won\u2019t be published, students don\u2019t need to write down everything word for word and they can use plenty of ellipses or shorthand notes. These outlines will be helpful during the editing process. You may need to model for students how to make a very rough transcript or outline efficiently.\n\nStudents will use these sound recordings to practice using editing software.\n\nMini Lesson: Editing Software\n\nEditing software is the tool that will help students turn their sound files into professional-sounding podcasts. With it, they can delete sections of audio, move audio segments around and stitch them together, and add additional sounds. They\u2019ll need to practice using this software before moving forward with the podcast project. Depending on how many computers you have, students might work alone or in pairs.\n\nNote: Classes using Apple computers can use GarageBand, a free audio editing software. Other examples of free online audio editing software that can be used on Windows or Google devices include Soundtrap (free for 14 days, then premium), Audacity and Beautiful Audio Editor. For each of these applications, there are tutorial videos available online. We recommend teachers become familiar with how to use basic features before diving into the editing process with students.\n\nHere are some of the basics of audio editing you should go over with students:\n\n\n\n1. Students will need sound files to edit. They can upload them from their recording devices, they can upload audio files from online or they can use the editing software to record new sound files.\n\n2. The \u201ccut\u201d or \u201csplit\u201d tool enables students to splice one audio segment into two or more segments.\n\n3. The \u201cdelete\u201d tool enables students to get rid of any audio segments they don\u2019t want.\n\n4. The dragging and moving function allows students to reposition audio segments where they want them. Typically students will use the mouse as a cursor to drag and move content.\n\n5. The timeline ruler or grid is the tool that measures the audio. Students use the timeline to assemble various audio segments into one project.\n\n6. Tracks are layers of sound. Podcasts often have multiple tracks of audio playing simultaneously, such as music or sound effects played over spoken word. Students can align the various tracks using the timeline.\n\n7. Volume can be adjusted in each audio segment. Students can also add effects, such as fade in or fade out.\n\n8. \u201cSave\u201d and \u201cExport\u201d are important functions. Students must remember to save their work, and they will most likely want to export their project when they are done.\n\nActivity: One-Minute Podcasts\n\nThe best way for students to get practice using these tools is for them to play with them in a low-stakes way \u2014 thus, we suggest the one-minute podcast assignment. Students should take their three-minute recorded interviews and turn them into one-minute audio stories. They may want to cut out the actual interview questions; they may splice out parts of answers or move around sections; they may add additional narration or sound effects.\n\nWe recommend this assignment as a timed activity \u2014 perhaps only one class period. Since it\u2019s not the final project, the goal isn\u2019t to produce a stellar podcast. Instead, it\u2019s to make sure students become comfortable with the editing software.", "title": "Project Audio: Teaching Students How to Produce Their Own Podcasts", "authors": []}

Mr. Sorrell had come to represent the era of conglomerate-building that followed the boozy, lavish days of \u201cMad Men,\u201d but the industry now faces questions about the role of such huge holding companies in a rapidly changing marketing world. WPP\u2019s shares have plunged in the past year amid questions about its growth, and the company recently reported its worst annual sales since the financial crisis and cut its forecast for the year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the facts behind the investigation,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads. \u201cBut I suspect that if WPP was on the verge of rekindled growth, Martin would have had the wind at his back and might have fought much harder to stay, and the board probably would have taken much more time to force his hand.\u201d\n\nWPP is a colossus. It owns more than 100 marketing and communications firms \u2014 including the likes of J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy, as well as Y&R and Hill+Knowlton \u2014 and has roughly 200,000 employees making ads for companies such as Ford Motor and Dell. It is the biggest of five advertising holding companies that control a significant portion of the world\u2019s advertising, marketing and communications firms. The others are Omnicom and the Interpublic Group in the United States, the Publicis Groupe in France and Dentsu in Japan.\n\nThe emergence and expansion of these companies represented a shift in power from advertising\u2019s creative whizzes to financial minds like Mr. Sorrell. The idea, he told The New York Times in 1989, was essentially that the entrepreneurs who had built marketing firms were not suited to manage their money, which is where WPP came in.

The team looking at Mr. Weinstein also includes prosecutors from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas.\n\nMr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the sexual encounters the district attorney\u2019s office has been scrutinizing were consensual. \u201cThe substantial delay in this investigation has been the result of serious flaws that are apparent with respect to any claim of non-consensual sex,\u201d he said. He also denied Mr. Weinstein had committed any financial wrongdoing, asserting that he had reimbursed his former company for all personal expenditures.\n\nNow the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has turned to Ms. Illuzzi, one of the most successful prosecutors in his office. A veteran homicide prosecutor, she was on the team that won a conviction against Pedro Hernandez for the killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz. In 2016, she ran as the Republican candidate for district attorney on Staten Island, where she lives; she lost to the Democratic candidate, Michael McMahon.\n\nBy turning to Ms. Illuzzi, Mr. Vance has tapped someone with expertise in cold cases in which there is little or no physical evidence and the credibility of witnesses is paramount. But he is also tapping a lawyer who has had to make difficult and politically fraught decisions in high-profile cases.\n\nIn 2011, she led the investigation to determine if Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, had sexually assaulted Nafissatou Diallo, who worked as a housekeeper in the hotel where Mr. Strauss-Kahn was staying.\n\nIn that case, Ms Illuzzi ultimately recommended the indictment be thrown out after evidence emerged undermining Ms. Diallo\u2019s reliability as a witness. The decision was a political setback for Mr. Vance, though he won re-election in 2013 and 2017.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Vance declined to say why he had assigned Ms. Illuzzi to the Weinstein investigation. \u201cThis investigation is active and ongoing,\u201d said Mr. Vance\u2019s spokesman, Danny Frost. \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment on investigative personnel except to say that we are staffing the matter appropriately as it moves forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarrie A.

Ms. Battilana told the police Mr. Weinstein groped her breasts and tried to slide a hand up her skirt during an interview at his TriBeCa office. In a sting operation the next day, she captured audio of him admitting he had touched her breasts.\n\nAlthough the police believed they had a case, Mr. Vance\u2019s office declined to prosecute. Ms. Bashford\u2019s team found Ms. Battilana to be a problematic witness, who had given shifting accounts of a previous sexual assault complaint she made in Italy.\n\nThe decision not to bring charges led to finger-pointing between members of the Police Department\u2019s Special Victims Division, who believed they had evidence of \u201cforcible touching,\u201d and the district attorney\u2019s office, whose prosecutors doubted the case could be won. Ms. Battilana later accepted a settlement payment and signed an agreement not to talk about what happened.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the political atmosphere surrounding sexual harassment has changed since Ms. Battilana made her complaint. More than 80 women, including several big-name actresses, have come forward with accusations against Mr. Weinstein, from unwanted touching to sexual assault. Scores of other women have come forward with stories of harassment in the workplace by other powerful men, leading to a cascade of resignations and firings.\n\nLast fall, as the storm over sexual harassment grew, Mr. Vance found himself on the defensive. Critics suggested he was gun-shy of taking on powerful men accused of sexual crimes after he was forced to drop the charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn.\n\nIn March, the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, responding to calls from a Hollywood advocacy group fighting sexual harassment, directed the attorney general to review Mr. Vance\u2019s handling of Ms. Battilana\u2019s complaint.\n\nMr. Vance has defended the decision, saying his office has a duty to bring charges only when it is convinced the crimes can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cAny other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes,\u201d he said.", "title": "Prosecutor of Patz\u2019s Killer Takes Over Weinstein Inquiry", "authors": ["James C.

Religion, marriage, capitalism \u2014 it was all ripe for their ridicule. Their development as critics, cartoonists and activists came during a golden age of satire in France, when radical freedom of expression had tangible political effects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut beneath this political activism, Mr. Wolinski was a man grappling with deep, human questions. \u201cWhat was really interesting for me was to discover this poetical side of Wolinski that was hidden,\u201d the curator of the exhibition, Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel, said in an interview. \u201cWhen you understand that, actually, all of these drawings were very much informed by the metaphysical questions he was asking himself, you see the motifs of inner conflict.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe 53 drawings at the Palais de Tokyo are arranged into categories around recurring themes and motifs in Mr. Wolinski\u2019s early work: God, cliffs, mountains, flowers, turtles, gender, and the passage of time. The God drawings come first. In one, an exasperated-looking God looks down at Earth from a cloud. \u201cYet another gadget,\u201d he quips. In another, a man holds up a balloon. \u201cHey God,\u201d the man has written on the balloon. In both, the seriousness of the desire to know the divine is made funny by the drawings\u2019 whimsical premises.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wolinski\u2019s lightness and internal investigations might seem like the opposite of radical politics: The drawings care little about ridiculing individuals or about pointing out flawed policies. But at the same time, they suggest the whole world would be altered if we saw ourselves with a little more levity.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe exhibition of Plantu\u2019s work at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, on the other hand, goes straight for the issues. In a recent drawing, which has the words \u201cculture clash\u201d in the background, Plantu draws increasingly zoomed-in depictions of a woman\u2019s thong until it becomes a niqab and her bottom looks like the face of a Muslim woman wearing it. In another, which provoked a lawsuit from a right-wing organization that accused it of provoking hate or violence, the words \u201cPedophilia: The Pope takes a position\u201d appear above an image of Benedict XVI as he violates a boy from behind. (The Court of Appeal of Paris dismissed the lawsuit.)\n\nPlantu started his career at 21 with an illustration criticizing the Vietnam War that was published in the daily Le Monde, and his cartoons have appeared in that newspaper regularly ever since. In 2006, he and Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, formed Cartooning for Peace, an organization that promotes freedom of expression for illustrators.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI do the work of a citizen who\u2019s passionate and politically active,\u201d Plantu said in an interview. \u201cThe difference from other citizens is that I recount my reactions in images.\u201d\n\nPlantu said that his brand of humor, although well intentioned, was also often misconstrued. \u201cThe word irony is incomprehensible to some,\u201d he said, adding that a \u201clack of education and critical training\u201d meant his works were misunderstood more frequently nowadays.\n\nThe directness of Plantu\u2019s satire is markedly different from that seen in Ms. Lamarche-Vadel\u2019s selection of Mr. Wolinski\u2019s works. \u201cWhen you see these works from Wolinski, they make you feel the political environment and settings without even speaking about them directly, which is very interesting and very important,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the B.N.F. is really seeing Plantu\u2019s drawings as more of a comment on the everyday,\u201d she said, referring to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think both are really valuable,\u201d she added.\n\nMs. Lamarche-Vadel\u2019s point seems to be underlined in the two exhibitions. Satire is about shifting the balance of power from the powerful to the powerless. In both, we are encouraged to recognize the absurdity of our political figures, but also, the absurdity in ourselves.\n\nIn an 11-minute animated video illustrated by Mr. Wolinski that plays in the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s underground cinema, a man bumbles through a gray, post-apocalyptic world. He soon finds himself facing a steep hill made of junk. With some effort, he ascends the hill, and is rewarded with a view of yet more junk \u2014 broken cars, a downed airplane. But he\u2019s mesmerized by it all.

The expansion, a project of Enbridge Inc., a Calgary-based energy company, would allow hundreds of thousands more barrels of oil a day to flow through this pipeline to the United States from Canadian tar sands.\n\nThe signoff by the E.P.A. came even though the agency, at the end of the Obama administration, had moved to fine Enbridge $61 million in connection with a 2010 pipeline episode that sent hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan and other waterways.

However, an examination of Capitol Hill rentals suggests that rates typically are considerably higher and generally do not come with a provision, as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s did, that the renter can pay for only the nights stayed at the condo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe E.P.A.\u2019s review of the Alberta Clipper project was one of at least a half dozen regulatory matters before the E.P.A. related to clients who were represented by Williams & Jensen at the time that Mr. Pruitt was living part-time in the Capitol Hill condo.\n\nWilliams & Jensen, for example, was lobbying the E.P.A. early last year, according to its disclosure reports, on behalf of both Oklahoma Gas and Electric, a major coal-burning utility, and Concho Resources, a Texas-based oil and gas drilling company.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe work for Oklahoma Gas involved the effort to repeal or revise the landmark Obama-era rule that pushed states to move away from coal in favor of sources of electricity that produce fewer carbon emissions. An E.P.A. calendar in March 2017 shows that Mr. Pruitt and his chief of staff were scheduled to meet with company executives at the request of a Williams & Jensen lobbyist.\n\nBrian Alford, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gas, said the company had received no favors from Mr. Pruitt. \u201cBy no means has O.G.E. benefited from any living arrangements for Administrator Pruitt,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, Administrator Pruitt did not attend the mentioned meeting.\u201d\n\nConcho, a 2017 lobbying disclosure report shows, hired Williams & Jensen to help it handle matters including \u201cEPA regulatory proposals re: oil and gas operations.\u201d The company\u2019s regulatory filings indicate its concerns included the regulation of methane emissions (a major factor in climate change) from drilling and production operations, as well as rules intended to protect drinking water supplies.

When the pipeline opened in 2010, it was permitted to carry only as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day. The expansion would allow it to move an additional 390,000 barrels through a key three-mile section near the Canadian border.\n\nMichael Barnes, a spokesman for Enbridge, said the project deserved to be approved, noting the \u201cvital service that this existing pipeline provides in delivering secure and reliable supplies of North American crude oil to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe oil it carries comes from the so-called Canadian tar sands, like the oil for the proposed extension of the Keystone XL pipeline. Extraction from tar sands has drawn opposition from environmentalists, given that the process requires more energy than traditional drilling.\n\nPipelines, like this one, that cross an international border into the United States require a presidential permit, which is issued only after the State Department has conducted a detailed environmental review and has taken input from other federal agencies, including the E.P.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this case, the pipeline expansion was further complicated by the fact that a related Enbridge pipeline involved in oil imports from Canada spilled nearly one million gallons of oil in Marshall, Mich., in July 2010 after tape intended to prevent corrosion on the pipeline failed. Investigators later found that employees allowed the oil to continue to flow after wrongly assuming that the alarms sounding were caused by a harmless vapor bubble.\n\nEnbridge has argued it has learned from that accident and taken corrective measures to prevent it from happening again. The settlement with the E.P.A. also requires the company to spend at least $110 million to install advanced leak detection and monitoring measures to prevent spills.\n\nIn March 2017, while Mr. Pruitt\u2019s lease at the Washington condo was in effect, the E.P.A. issued a letter giving the pipeline project the second-best rating it offers out of 10 possible scores. The agency concluded that while the project raised \u201cenvironmental concerns,\u201d the review had adequately examined the alternatives and determined that \u201cno further analysis or data collection is necessary.\u201d\n\nIf the E.P.A. had wanted to more aggressively challenge the project, the agency could have rated it as \u201cenvironmental objections\u201d or \u201cenvironmentally unsatisfactory.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion stands in contrast to a similar evaluation by the agency in 2013 of the Keystone XL pipeline project. That evaluation focused more on the effect that the flow of tar-sands oil could have on the goal of limiting global climate change and gave the project an \u201cenvironmental objections\u201d rating.\n\nWith the signoff by the E.P.A. and the State Department, Enbridge received the expansion permit it needed in October, five years after it first applied for permission. Additional pumping stations have already been built, meaning the pipeline expansion project is already completed, the company said.\n\nMr. Pruitt is separately the focus of an investigation by the E.P.A. inspector general, Arthur A. Elkins Jr., based on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel in early 2017 back to his home state of Oklahoma on government-funded flights, as well as his use of first-class tickets for flights and, at times, costly chartered planes.\n\nDiscussions have already started on Capitol Hill about asking the E.P.A. inspector general to expand his inquiry to include the condo deal. Late Monday, three House Democrats who serve on the committee with oversight of the E.P.A. sent a letter to Mr. Pruitt asking a series of questions about the condo lease, which was first reported by ABC News.\n\n\u201cAs administrator you have taken a number of actions to benefit industries regulated by E.P.A.,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAnd this news raises the possibility that you may have personally benefited from your relationship with industry.\u201d", "title": "Pruitt Had a $50-a-Day Condo Linked to Lobbyists.

But they essentially robbed millions of dollars from people. And nobody went to jail.\n\nWhy is a bank with a culture of blatant robbery even allowed to continue to function?

The bank has also had to defend itself in regulatory proceedings and various civil lawsuits, including class actions filed by wronged customers, and it has had to conduct multiple internal investigations that revealed even more wrongdoing.\n\nIn a windfall for the legal sector, the bank has had to hire a horde of expensive lawyers, consultants and others to handle the fallout, an enormous management task in its own right. Wells Fargo recruited Allen Parker, one of the country\u2019s most highly regarded (and highly paid) banking lawyers \u2014 who recently completed his tenure as presiding partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and \u2014 as its new general counsel to oversee the sprawling legal problems.\n\nWells Fargo hasn\u2019t said how much it has spent in legal fees and related expenses, but it has clearly had a material impact on the bank\u2019s results. The costs show up in its efficiency ratio, which is overhead divided by revenue. Wells Fargo has traditionally aimed for between 55 and 59 percent.\n\nAt the end of last year, Wells Fargo\u2019s ratio was 76.5 percent.\n\nStripping out a $3.25 billion charge the bank took in the fourth quarter last year, it was still an elevated 61.5 percent.

Of course, those tariffs did not quite work as intended, because other countries moved to shield their own economies by raising tariffs, too. Experts now believe those trade policies probably exacerbated the Great Depression.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s bombast is so odd that it has scrambled the usual politics of trade. Many Republican lawmakers, including those who support him on most issues, have come out strongly against him on trade. For example, Pat Roberts, a senator from Kansas, said the impact of the president\u2019s threats against China was \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d and Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said American farmers and ranchers \u201cwould bear the brunt of retaliation\u201d by China. At the same time, Mr. Trump has won praise from some Democrats, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who are opposed to many other Trump policies.\n\nThe big question now is what Mr. Trump will actually do. Some officials \u2014 like Larry Kudlow, the former cable-TV pundit who recently became the top economic adviser in the White House \u2014 are trying to tamp down talk of a trade war, and say the administration is using the threat of tariffs to get China to the negotiating table. To Mr. Kudlow\u2019s way of thinking, the Trump strategy is similar to how President Ronald Reagan got Japan to voluntarily limit exports to the United States in the 1980s by threatening to impose steep tariffs.\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that the United States needs to do all it can to get Chinese officials to change economic policies that have hurt American businesses and workers. For example, officials in Beijing have forced foreign businesses to transfer technology to local joint-venture partners as a condition of doing business in China. China for many years also artificially depressed the value of its currency, the renminbi, against the dollar to make its clothes, electronics and other products more affordable to American consumers.\n\nBut it is hard to see this administration striking an effective and comprehensive deal with China. That\u2019s because Mr. Trump and his officials seem incapable of putting in the time and hard work required to hammer out such agreements with other countries or political adversaries.

Qualcomm declined to comment.\n\nQualcomm has found itself under an increasingly uncomfortable spotlight in China in recent years. By 2013, the company was deriving more revenue from China than any other market, just as the Chinese government began expressing concern that its companies were forced to depend on the network infrastructure of American technology giants like Qualcomm and Cisco.\n\nIn late 2013, Chinese government investigators raided the Beijing and Shanghai offices of Qualcomm. After a 15-month investigation, regulators handed the company a record $975 million fine and declared Qualcomm a monopoly. The firm was forced to slash prices and pledge to move more of its sophisticated manufacturing to China and help boost the technological abilities of Chinese companies. Today, a growing chorus of American companies have complained that China has pressured them into sharing their technology in similar ways.\n\nFang Xingdong, a free speech activist and founder of the think tank China Labs, said their complaints had little merit. \u201cThe pressures on companies such as Huawei and ZTE in the U.S. market are much higher than those of U.S. companies in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. sanctions on ZTE are enough to kill the company.\u201d\n\nIf China wanted to retaliate, Mr. Fang said, the simplest option would be to emulate American actions toward Huawei. \u201cThey could ban products from Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco in government, infrastructure and other areas of the market, based on security concerns,\u201d he added.\n\nIn targeting Qualcomm, China could be seeking to influence the Trump administration by putting pressure on a company that has been politically connected in the United States, often serving as an unofficial liaison between the countries.\n\nOver the years, Qualcomm has lobbied the United States government to further its interests in China, at one point helping to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. In the late 1990s, Clinton administration officials pushed China to adopt American standards for mobile phones on behalf of Qualcomm.\n\nBut Qualcomm\u2019s ability to influence the White House is unclear: The Trump administration has focused on recruiting American companies to build up their businesses domestically, not encouraging them to go abroad.\n\n\u201cYes, the Chinese have a way to squeeze Qualcomm to really hurt their China revenue, and yes, Qualcomm has fought a lot of battles in the U.S. government arena,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe one weakness in the Chinese approach is it\u2019s not clear the Trump administration cares about how much U.S. firms make in China.\u201d", "title": "Qualcomm May Be Collateral Damage in a U.S.-China Trade War", "authors": []}

Also, I\u2019m usually at my lowest when I\u2019m about to make a record, which is when I have the least time to go and see someone. For that reason, when I need to reframe my way of thinking and be clear about the ways I might be sabotaging a process, I consult self-help books. Two recent ones I read were \u201cBattlefield of the Mind,\u201d by Joyce Meyer, and \u201cConfidence: Overcoming Low Self-Esteem, Insecurity, and Self-Doubt,\u201d by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic. Look, his name is literally pre-music.\n\nWhat are the best books about music you\u2019ve read?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick just one or even just five or 10. I get different things from each book. Sometimes I\u2019m looking for out-of-the-way stories. Sometimes I\u2019m looking for practical advice. Greg Tate made me want to be a writer. I was amazed that a musician was so fluid and had enough knowledge to describe and analyze other people\u2019s music so well. I read him in The Village Voice, but his work was collected in books like \u201cFlyboy in the Buttermilk.\u201d", "title": "Questlove: By the Book", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "Also amenable to compromise are some of the automakers, who favor a more moderate approach to a regulatory rollback than the one favored by Mr. Pruitt. But \u201cautomakers are in different positions\u201d on how to proceed, said one person close to their thinking, with some companies more focused on rolling back the standards through 2025, and others more eager to have a broader discussion on a compromise with California and standards through 2030.\n\nA person close to the Trump administration said White House officials were also pushing the E.P.A. toward a compromise with California. The White House, this person said, is more in tune with concerns from some automakers who feel that the rollbacks they lobbied for have triggered an overzealous response from the E.P.A., bringing the federal government to the brink of a battle with California that could throw the entire auto market into disarray.\n\nMr. Pruitt has been a wild card, eager to score a clear victory in dismantling environmental regulations. In one sign of his zeal \u2014 and his apparent disconnect with the position of the auto industry \u2014 he has openly described the planned rewriting of auto emissions standards as a \u201crollback,\u201d much to the chagrin of auto lobbyists who have long said that formulation does not accurately describe the changes they are seeking.\n\nBig obstacles remain to reaching a compromise. California and E.P.A. officials have met at least three times in the last few months to discuss auto emissions regulations. The latest round of talks took place in California last week between Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, and William Wehrum, the E.P.A.\u2019s senior clean air adviser.\n\nImage Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, is negotiating with the E.P.A. Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nA person close to the California negotiators characterized the meeting as \u201chighly non-substantive,\u201d even as he said a compromise remained possible when talks resumed. But a person close to the administration had a more positive take, calling the talks \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high. Introduced in 2012, the federal rules would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. If fully implemented, they would cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations and reduce carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons, according to the E.P.A.\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cClearly, the Trump administration has gained some political capital by looking really tough on this and proposing a reversal of the Obama-era standards,\u201d said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut the Trump administration has also gotten out beyond what the auto industry has wanted throughout, which is substantial flexibility in meeting these standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can now claim to have stood up to California, but they also realize they need to come back to the negotiating table,\u201d Mr. Rabe said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear legal and political combat with California would open up enormous uncertainty. So it sounds like a bit of dialing back.\u201d", "title": "Quietly, Trump Officials and California Seek a Deal on Car Emissions", "authors": []}

A customer holding a bicycle helmet lingered over the iPhones, browsing; a sixtysomething man knelt on the floor, taking a selfie with a German pinscher named Polo; and a young Orthodox man wrapped a customer in tefillin, traditional Jewish prayer straps, while reading him prayers to repeat. \u201cI get an iPhone, and I get tefillin,\u201d said the customer, Harvey Rossel, a chiropractor and longtime local.\n\nAri Kirtchuk, 55, the store\u2019s owner, took in the action from behind his counter. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters from Crown Heights,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the Lubavitch cartel.\u201d A wave of laughter passed through the store.\n\nMany lament the mallification of New York City, with banks, chain restaurants and anonymous cellphone shops rapidly replacing the beloved mom-and-pops of generations past. But for some ineffable reason, there are certain chain stores that contain the warmth, diversity and conversation once associated with Greek diners or soda fountains. The AT&T \u201cauthorized retailer\u201d owned by Mr. Kirtchuk, near the corner of Union Street and Seventh Avenue, is one. At any moment, only about half of the people inside are there for cellphone problems. The others come to talk. Perhaps it\u2019s the two soft black chairs by the front window that encourage conversation, or the frequent presence of Polo, Mr. Kirtchuk\u2019s son\u2019s dog. Or perhaps it is the unique energy of Mr. Kirtchuk, who seems to value jokes, long stories and political debate as much as sales commissions.\n\nElegant and handsome, with a lanky physique that resembles his hero Larry David\u2019s, he has a thin smile, carved cheekbones and a deadpan demeanor. On a given day, he helps seniors, delivery men, teenagers, caregivers, the homeless, celebrity locals such as the actor Peter Sarsgaard and the novelist Nicole Krauss, as well as the brownstone bourgeoisie. Though he has one full-time employee, John Rossello, 27, Mr. Kirtchuk himself comes in six days a week and often seven. \u201cThe reason they come here is because they know me and they need some company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city with a lot of lonely people.\u201d", "title": "Quirks and Gossip in a Corporate Cellphone Branch", "authors": []}

One lives across town, the other across country. Five years ago, I crafted a letter calling for reconciliation without blame. No response \u2014 which hurt. Since then, when people ask if I have siblings, I say no. I used to feel guilty, but now it\u2019s freeing. Some people know I have siblings. I\u2019d hate for them to think I\u2019m a liar, but it feels true to me. And I want to avoid explanations. Thoughts?\n\nANONYMOUS\n\nThe lie I tell most often \u2014 generally on airplanes, where I do my best lying \u2014 is that my mother is still alive: I\u2019m on my way to visit her, or just coming back. She\u2019s been dead for three years. Still, there is comfort in that lie, of living in a world where parents don\u2019t die, where we don\u2019t become estranged from siblings or old friends.\n\nI suspect your lie is similar, so I\u2019m poorly placed to fault you. Denying your siblings\u2019 existence means you never wounded each other. They never ignored your heartfelt letter. And perhaps you find comfort \u2014 or at least, an absence of pain \u2014 in their oblivion.\n\nBut your lie also signals that this conflict weighs heavily on you. Lies are hard work. (And you could easily admit your siblings\u2019 existence without a word of the estrangement.) Here\u2019s my two-pronged advice: Keep lying if it helps. But consider asking the sibling who lives across town to go for a walk with you. No global reconciliation required \u2014 just a walk some day when the weather is fine.

In 2014, a white supremacist killed three people outside Jewish centers in Overland Park. And last year, a man fatally shot one Indian immigrant and wounded another at a restaurant in Olathe after shouting, \u201cGet out of my country.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, the Garden City case has been intertwined with politics. The men were arrested less than four weeks before the 2016 election, and prosecutors say they had planned to carry out the bombing on Nov. 9, the day after voters selected a new president.\n\nKansans voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump, and defense lawyers sought to pick a jury from counties where high percentages of people voted for him. The lawyers said the case was \u201cuniquely political\u201d and that they wanted a pool with more rural, conservative jurors.\n\nThe defendants chose not to testify during the trial, but sat quietly in sport coats, ties and leg shackles as prosecutors showed the mostly white jury the rambling handwritten manifesto. The document contained alarming messages, but also listed grievances that sounded common, and well within the conservative mainstream: Border security was too weak, it said. Jobs had moved overseas. The Obama administration had overreached.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point, Melody Brannon, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, even alluded to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, suggesting that the manifesto called for \u201ccoming together as a nation, making America great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of those statements reflect the political talk in 2016,\u201d Ms. Brannon, Kansas\u2019 federal public defender, said of the manifesto. \u201cThere is nothing in that document that is outside the political talk going on.\u201d\n\nBut prosecutors portrayed the militia group\u2019s views as anything but ordinary. The men, they said, were alarmed by growing populations of Muslim immigrants in places like Garden City and were willing to use violence to force them out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talked about killing Muslims, even babies,\u201d Special Agent Amy Kuhn, who led the domestic terrorism investigation for the F.B.I., said of Mr. Stein, one of the men on trial.\n\nPhoto\n\nGarden City, population 26,700, is an increasingly diverse place where Hispanics comprise nearly half the population and a growing number of residents come from places like Somalia, Myanmar, Mexico and Sudan. It is also a Republican stronghold: Mr. Trump carried Garden City\u2019s county by a 31-point margin, and he won more than 80 percent of the vote in some adjacent counties.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race ramped up, Agent Kuhn said, the vitriol in the militia group increased. At various points, the men considered attacks on Mr. Obama, members of Congress and fellow Kansans who had helped Somalis and Muslims.\n\nEventually, the men, who each lived about an hour\u2019s drive from Garden City, focused on the Mary Street apartments. They started gathering supplies, making homemade explosives and holding planning meetings, which the F.B.I.\u2019s informant recorded, sometimes with country music playing in the background, the agent said.\n\n\u201cThe risk was that the defendants would carry out their plan and a bunch of people on Mary Street would not be alive,\u201d Agent Kuhn said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe apartment complex the men chose as a target was the hub of Garden City\u2019s small Somali community, and the site of its makeshift mosque.

(2014)\n\nIn this book, Teachout, a Fordham University Law professor and one-time candidate for governor of New York, makes the case that throughout this country\u2019s history, lawmakers have gone to great lengths to divide the personal from the political. Teachout notes, for instance, that when Benjamin Franklin was the United States\u2019 ambassador to France and, during one of his visits, received a diamond-studded snuffbox, there was concern that the gift would sway his politics. In her view, Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that loosened restrictions on political spending by corporations, has compromised that work. Our reviewer wrote: \u201cYou have probably heard pundits say we are living in an age of \u2018legalized bribery\u2019; \u2018Corruption in America\u2019 is the book that makes their case in careful detail.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTRUMPOCRACY\n\nThe Corruption of the American Republic\n\nBy David Frum\n\n301 pp. HarperCollins. (2018)\n\nFrum, a writer for The Atlantic, places the Trump administration and the current struggles of the white working class in context. In this book, he argues that any corruption within President Trump\u2019s administration is a symptom of a system in which political figures have been able to leverage their political influence for financial gain. Similarly, the white working class\u2019s current predicament is a natural result of an unequal economic system in which a small group of companies and industries hold most of the country\u2019s wealth. According to our reviewer, \u201cFrum has been writing sharp but sympathetic books\u201d about conservative America for more than two decades, and he calls this is an \u201cexcellent\u201d addition.\n\nPhoto\n\nDARK MONEY\n\nThe Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right\n\nBy Jane Mayer\n\n449 pp. Doubleday.

Though David Koch never pursued public office after running for vice president in 1980, he and his brother, Charles, have contributed vast amounts of money to campaigns, think tanks, media groups and academic institutions aligned with their conservative views. Mayer, a staff writer for The New Yorker, delves into the Koch family\u2019s past, including how they made their fortune and the influences that shaped their beliefs. Neither of the Koch brothers agreed to be interviewed for the book, but Mayer draws from hundreds of other interviews to illuminate how they and other plutocrats have infiltrated politics.", "title": "Read These 3 Books on Government Corruption", "authors": ["Concepci\u00f3n De Le\u00f3n"]}
{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "As far as activity design goes, it\u2019s really very simple. But here are some of the products and outcomes of our discussion and inquiry using \u201cFON, FAIIN, FIIM\u201d:\n\n\u2022 In our very first installment, the memoir \u201cTo Siri With Love: A Mother, Her Autistic Son, and the Kindness of Machines\u201d by Judith Newman was identified by students as a memoir because it appeared to be an individual\u2019s lived experience. The last line of the brief review pointed out that the memoir raises, rather than answers, questions about a larger social phenomenon. Students asked if that was something a memoir did \u2014 and if so, did memoirs do so always (i.e., as a definition of the genre) or sometimes (i.e., as a permissible feature of the genre), an idea we would come back to again and again, especially when we read Mr. Coates.\n\nHowever, the blurb about Ms. Newman\u2019s book also raised ethical questions from my students, comments like: \u201cWait, is it her memoir if she\u2019s writing about his experiences? And did he say it was O.K.?\u201d As we now know, these are among the same important questions that people are raising upon the book\u2019s publication \u2014 including adults with autism and other disability rights activists.\n\n\u2022 In a later installment, students encountered both \u201cWild Things: The Joy of Reading Children\u2019s Literature as an Adult,\u201d by Bruce Handy, and \u201cLittle Soldiers: An American Boy, a Chinese School, and the Global Race to Achieve,\u201d by Lenora Chu. Students categorized both of these as nonfiction, but did not think they were memoirs, as they could not glean from the reviews the author\u2019s relationship to the material: Does Bruce Handy talk about his own reading of children\u2019s books as an adult or merely tout the potential advantages of doing so? Is Lenora Chu a reporter or journalist? A parent? Both? Further research into other reviews and Amazon.com told us that both of these books are \u2014 or, well, might be \u2014 considered memoirs. And then, more questions: Is all nonfiction written in first person memoir? How present must the author be in her story to make a book a memoir?\n\n\u2022 We also find opportunities to suss out thematic similarities or consonances between texts and among genres, given the Book Review\u2019s generally thematic approach to the roundups. For example, in one installment of the game, students pointed out that Herb Boyd\u2019s \u201cBlack Detroit: A People\u2019s History of Self-Determination\u201d and Margaret Wilkerson Sexton\u2019s novel \u201cA Kind of Freedom\u201d both appeared to emphasize resilience and hope and reject deficit-based thinking \u2014 at least according to their reviewers. This observation led students to wonder why books rejecting a damage narrative of potentially marginalized people might be especially sought after by readers in this particular cultural and historical moment.\n\nNeedless to say, this activity provides all kinds of potential avenues for discussion and debate. A teacher who implements this activity will find \u2014 and, I hope, will welcome \u2014 a certain amount of messiness. There\u2019s no telling exactly what aspects of these reviews students will want to react to or question.\n\n\u2022 Several times throughout the semester, we returned to our working definitions of fiction and nonfiction. Students may have begun the semester thinking nonfiction \u2014 especially history \u2014 means \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201cobjectivity.\u201d But when we encountered a book like Frederick Crews\u2019s \u201cFreud: The Making of an Illusion,\u201d which the reviewer described as \u201ccohesive but slanted,\u201d we found ourselves discussing the subjectivity of histories.", "title": "Reader Idea | FON, FAIIN, FIIM?

Mr. Roth writes:\n\nIn my 17 years of educational experience, I have never been one to do the same thing the same way twice. What a great profession teaching is!

We\u2019d like to share some stories of how reading The New York Times has fundamentally changed our students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 classroom experiences.\n\nGenerating discussion and debate in science class, by Christopher Roth\n\nPhoto\n\nBuilding homemade thermometers to measure the classroom temperature; using forensic chromatography to determine which teacher wrote a \u201cransom letter\u201d; constructing miniature roller coasters to study the physics of speed, velocity, mass and friction. These activities are all solid, immersive, highly tactile science lessons which, in the voluntary absence of a classroom text book, have been the heart and soul of our science curriculum for the past eight years.\n\nBut we still found ourselves striving for something more. Then, this year, we were granted a slightly different schedule which allowed us to have three 70-minute classes per week with our science students!\n\nMy co-teacher, Sue Edmondson, and I dedicate our first two blocks to investigative laboratory activities. Our shiny new third block begged to be filled with something wholesome, rich and relevant. We immediately decided to fill it with something we called Article Day. This seemingly unsubstantial moniker would definitely not be the dry, thin, lifeless current events discussion I remembered from middle school. No, this would be different \u2014 much different.\n\nArticle Day would be deep, informative, perhaps controversial and, most importantly, based in real, measurable, reportable facts. It would be a classroom discussion that would sometimes be boisterous and other times reflective and quiet. We would use our brand-spanking-new-out-of-the-box New York Times all-digital-access subscription as the main content source for this portion of our courses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlmost a full school year into it, Article Day boasts all of these traits \u2014 it\u2019s the day that teachers and students look forward to most!\n\n\u201cArticle Day\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nArticle Day typically consists of a combination of three articles, videos or multimedia presentations from The New York Times treasure-trove website. We post this content on Google Classroom, a free web-based service for schools, for all students to read or view before class. The first discussion usually revolves around an article or video pertaining to the lab activity of the week. The second article is an open topic from a student submission. And the third is about the all-important issue of climate change.\n\nOn a recent week, for example, we navigated through the Trilobites article \u201cSea Turtles Use Magnetic Fields to Find Their Birthplace Beach\u201d to discuss how the concept of magnetism plays out in the real world and how human activity is altering and disrupting this magnetic signature. This past week\u2019s student submission led us to the Opinion piece \u201cStanding Up at Your Desk Could Make You Smarter\u201d \u2014 a reference to the fact that our students comment that we are always bouncing around the room (I even fashioned myself a standing desk out of a quirky antique metal table).\n\nVideo\n\nAnd a spirited discussion recently occurred during the presentation of the Op-Doc \u201cSinking Islands, Floating Nation.\u201d At the students\u2019 requests, we must have replayed the section with the model of these \u201cfloating islands\u201d at least five times. The students were fascinated (and so were we)! This documentary generated questions regarding oxygen production and carbon dioxide recycling, the prospect of decreased human vitamin D production due to the filtered sunlight and the possibility of medical counseling for claustrophobia. Quite a diverse response!\n\nAnother memorable class debate occurred as we watched a video of a starving polar bear. Here are just a few of the questions students asked:\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Paul Nicklen (the videographer) save the bear?\u201d \u201cWhy was there a garbage can in the middle of the Baffin Islands?\u201d \u201cWhat was the polar bear eating?\u201d \u201cWhat does climate change have to do with this starving bear?\u201d \u201cWhat would be the consequences if polar bears went extinct?\u201d \u201cIs a warmer Earth a bad thing?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWe also find it fascinating to be able to search The New York Times digital archives to compare points of view from the past to those of the present, as well as view how technology has changed the entire format of the newspaper. We were all enthralled to find an article from Jan. 29, 1922, titled: \u201cNew York\u2019s Hottest and Driest Year.\u201d It was mind-bending to read of the scientific theory from this time period that the world was warming because the sun was getting hotter!\n\nWe have discovered that not only have these discussions allowed us to dive deep into a subject, but they have also taught us much more about who our students truly are than any lab activity alone ever could. The relationship and trust between teacher and student has strengthened significantly after these many candid exchanges.\n\n\u201cAha\u201d moments, from the lab to The Times and back:\n\nPhoto\n\nThe culture that we\u2019ve created in our class is one of true inquiry. One of the requirements of our laboratory activities is a written report at the conclusion of student\u2019s data collection, interpretation and presentation. Many of these labs require that our students create their own experimental design after being given a scope of what needs to be proven. They must provide a justification of why their design included the type of data that was collected. This justification should often include reliable outside sources. After being trained in multiple classes to identify authentic reporting, our students are able to sift through the \u201cfluff\u201d and pick out the scientifically sound content.\n\nDuring a recent lab activity concerning the effects that soluble substances have on the melting and freezing temperatures of water, one student stumbled across an article on the dangers that both natural and chemical salts used as de-icers by homeowners, businesses and municipalities have on the paws of dogs as they are being walked in New York City (\u201cPlease Don\u2019t Make Me Go Out There\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe stopped the lab investigation for a quick and valuable minute for an impromptu conversation about this, which resulted in several students citing this article in their lab reports as evidence of the decrease of a solvent\u2019s temperature (ice water) by the addition of a solute (salt), which causes it to melt \u2014 and an \u201caha\u201d moment in class as the concept almost audibly \u201cclicked\u201d!\n\n_________\n\nContextualizing art in culture, history and contemporary life, by Katie Resch\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the last year I have started to incorporate more art discussions with my students to get them engaged in the arts outside of our classroom. Because my background is in museum and gallery professions with a focus on art history, I feel strongly that our students need to understand the cultural and historical context of art.\n\nEvery class I present an article or image for discussion. The New York Times headline gets their attention right away \u2014 we are a small town nestled in the blueberry fields of southern New Jersey, so New York City is an impressive ideal for them.\n\nI either have a student read segments from an article, or I present the ideas behind the article first and then go into detail. Recently, we discussed the article \u201cAn Invisible Artwork Reminds Austria of Its Nazi Past.\u201d Students had just studied World War II and this was a great connection from a contemporary artist\u2019s perspective.\n\nThese articles not only provide me a way to present art concepts to the students but I also find that we share them professionally. The music, science and art rooms are beside each other in our school and so we often collaborate. I will sometimes print an article and run it over to one of the other teachers so that they can also discuss it with their content area, reinforcing the connections between subjects.\n\n_________\n\nAnalyzing outstanding digital photography composition and technique, by Christopher Roth and Katie Resch\n\nPhoto\n\nTogether, we co-teach a digital photography class. All of our students use a fully manual digital SLR camera with interchangeable lenses for all of their assignments. In this class, students learn to manipulate light, space and color to create compositions \u2014 some basic and some intricate. Here, they also learn about perspective, an extremely important part of any work of art.\n\nA great piece to which we recently exposed our class was \u201cViewing Europe\u2019s Houses of Worship in Wild Detail.\u201d This article told the story of photographer Markus Brunetti, who took thousands of high resolution photographs of many of the medieval cathedrals of Europe. What set this apart from most photographs was something that our students noticed right away when viewing the myriad images \u2014 the photographic perspective of these 10-foot-high images was completely different than most photographs, indeed, much different than one would see even in real life! These images were absent of the usual visual distortion and \u201cleaning\u201d that occurs when tall buildings are photographed from the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTogether, we learned of the techniques that Brunetti used to photograph thousands of small sections of the cathedrals over many weeks and then digitally stitch them together to create a single image to achieve what editing software could not. This was an incredible opportunity for students to see a real-life example of change of perspective in photography.\n\nWe regularly search for photos on The Times website to inspire our students. These photos are often not from the Lens section, but simply outstanding photography from articles in the Science, Arts or World sections, from which we can study the fundamentals of capturing a successful image and the effort that must accompany this.\n\nThe New York Times content has provided our classes with the opportunity to bring our subjects to a level that enlivens and enriches our students\u2019 experiences and outlook on education. We truly appreciate the content and creativity that the reporters, editors and photographers bring to the newspaper, and the immensely positive impact it has had on our classroom.\n\n_________\n\nDo you teach with The Times?

Is there an inborn error in how she metabolizes various forms of sugar or fat to provide her body with the fuel needed to make her muscles move? Or is there some problem with how she makes one or more of the fundamental components of blood and muscle, so that her system is inundated with half-built compounds that can\u2019t perform the required work and clog up the body\u2019s machinery? Others suggested that Angel\u2019s weakness could be caused by her own immune system mistakenly attacking her muscles. Some proposed that her muscle pain and injury is caused by an insidious infection or some unrecognized toxic exposure.\n\nThe comments came from people with all types of knowledge. Doctors from a wide variety of specialties provided their expertise. A few veterinarians noted similarities between diseases that affected other mammals and this patient\u2019s condition and suggested that perhaps her diagnosis is one shared across species. Many people wrote from their own experience \u2014 either with diseases they have experienced first hand or that they recognized from caring for a suffering family member or friend. And many perused the hidden knowledge of the internet, searching for symptoms that matched Angel\u2019s to offer potential answers.\n\nBut in providing these answers, most of you were working alone. Reviewing these thoughtful suggestions, I wondered if giving the opportunity for you to discuss these possibilities would provide additional insights. So, please feel free to start the conversation by commenting directly in this article. We hope to use this conversation as a way to talk about Angel\u2019s case and hopefully generate more diagnoses. As before, responses will be screened and some may be forwarded to Angel\u2019s primary care provider for her consideration.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll provide updates, here, when available.", "title": "Readers Respond to Our Call for Help With a Diagnosis", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}

Anything but \u201cShe is black.\u201d We are not poor. My husband and I have a healthy and loving relationship. Between us, we hold degrees from Northeastern, Spelman and Columbia. I had a breeze of a pregnancy, have excellent health care and benefits and had every expectation of a smooth labor and delivery.\n\nAnd yet nine days after giving birth, I suffered a postpartum hemorrhage that almost took my life. Despite the difference in life outcomes between the article\u2019s subject and me, what connects us is that we\u2019re black. Her story resonated deeply with me because I recognized elements of it in my own: the same dismissive doctors, the same callous treatment, the same near-death experience at the hands of a medical profession that does not prioritize the lives of black women. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for some people to acknowledge the effects of pervasive racism. Alia McCants, White Plains, N.Y.\n\nPhoto\n\nEvery baby deserves the chance to grow up. Our nation\u2019s legacy of racism puts black babies at particular risk \u2014 a fact supported by irrefutable research. Professional birth support (doula care) is one proven method of protecting black infants. Unfortunately, many African-American families are unable to afford the security and assurance that a doula can provide. Only two states, Minnesota and Oregon, offer doula services as a Medicaid-covered benefit, despite the fact that studies show these services not only produce safer and more satisfying birth experiences most of the time but also create potential savings of roughly $985 per birth by preventing complications and further procedures. Expanding Medicaid coverage to doula services is an effective solution that can be quickly implemented. The current situation is unacceptable, and we must act with urgency. America\u2019s babies are counting on us.

When someone has the drop on you, they have the drop on you. Concealed carry mainly works when you\u2019re the first with the most.\n\nAs someone who has had jobs that required the possession, maintenance and use of firearms, and who has used them, I find concealed carry to be a pain in the neck, even with modern handguns. You always have to think about what you\u2019re carrying. It is a nuisance, and not a prescription for a good time or a happy life. Chances are low of using a concealed weapon effectively in a bad situation anyway. Unless you have a job that requires it, I would recommend you avoid concealed carry. Most police officers get at least decent training in the use of firearms, and look at all the trouble some of them have gotten into in recent years, in which they behaved like madmen. Vern Edwards, Portland, Ore.\n\nPhoto\n\nI\u2019ve had guns pulled on me three times in my life. The first by a race-baiting angry vet when I stepped between him and a mixed-race couple in a parking lot; the second by a 19-year-old kid I had cut off in traffic; the third when I happened upon a fight in an alley late at night. Each time I felt the same bottomless fear when facing the muzzle of a handgun pointed in my direction. Each time I wished I had a gun of my own to protect myself and my family. And each time, lacking a gun, I raised my hands and stood passively and spoke softly, feeling utterly powerless and humiliated.\n\nTo this day, years after these events, I fantasize about pulling my own weapon and facing down those threatening me. But I know that if I\u2019d had a gun, I would have used it, and someone would have ended up dead. In each of these cases words trumped bullets, possibly saving my life and the lives of others. Outside of my fantasy life I\u2019ll never carry a gun. Jrsherrard, Seattle\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are lots of individuals who aren\u2019t members of the N.R.A. but who support Second Amendment rights. If we really want to make progress on gun violence, both sides need to compromise. I would suggest that the left agree that there is a constitutional right for sane, law-abiding citizens to own a gun. Despite the notoriety of incidents like the Florida school shooting, rifles, including assault rifles, account for a very small fraction of all gun deaths. Demonizing a specific weapon or the individuals who own them because a small fraction of 1 percent are used in crimes makes no sense. The right needs to agree that any effort \u2014 universal background checks, \u201cred flag\u201d laws, etc. \u2014 to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and violent individuals is constitutional.

There has yet to be invented \u2014 although it is critical \u2014 a way in which every opinion, however apparently awful, can be aired and addressed without turning the discussion space into garbage. People start arguments for a complex variety of overlapping reasons, including trolling. But that does not preclude the fact that many people, trolls not least, may genuinely have these questions and feelings, and that their belligerence may mask, at some level, a desire to be persuaded otherwise.\n\nEvery perspective, even the most small-minded and bitter, shows some angle of truth. If we as a society want self-knowledge, if we want the kind of unity that allows for deep progress, then we need to be able to openly handle and discuss even the most unsavory views, so that what is true in them can be extracted and placed in the right position in the jigsaw puzzle. In the process, their proponents, feeling heard, will be woven into the social fabric. Over time, truth will grow richer while hatred and falsehood will decline \u2014 obviously, never completely.

Previously published data from a randomized controlled trial funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development showed that the 3-year-olds who had received the intervention had improved behavior \u2014 that is, they were significantly less likely to be aggressive or hyperactive than the 3-year-olds in the control group.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The children whose families had participated in the intervention when they were younger were still less likely to manifest those behavior problems \u2014 aggression, hyperactivity, difficulty with attention \u2014 that can so often make it hard for children to do well and learn and prosper when they get to school.\n\nSome children were enrolled in a second stage of the project, and the books and toys and videotaping continued as they visited the clinic from age 3 to 5; they showed additional \u201cdose-response\u201d effects; more exposure to the \u201cpositive parenting\u201d promotion meant stronger positive impacts on the children\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in hyperactivity is a reduction in meeting clinical levels of hyperactivity,\u201d Dr. Mendelsohn said. \u201cWe may be helping some children so they don\u2019t need to have certain kinds of evaluations.\u201d Children who grow up in poverty are at much higher risk of behavior problems in school, so reducing the risk of those attention and behavior problems is one important strategy for reducing educational disparities \u2014 as is improving children\u2019s language skills, another source of school problems for poor children.\n\nBut all parents should appreciate the ways that reading and playing can shape cognitive as well as social and emotional development, and the power of parental attention to help children flourish. Dr. Weisleder said that in reading and playing, children can encounter situations a little more challenging than what they usually come across in everyday life, and adults can help them think about how to manage those situations.\n\n\u201cMaybe engaging in more reading and play both directly reduces kids\u2019 behavior problems because they\u2019re happier and also makes parents enjoy their child more and view that relationship more positively,\u201d she said.\n\nReading aloud and playing imaginative games may offer special social and emotional opportunities, Dr. Mendelsohn said. \u201cWe think when parents read with their children more, when they play with their children more, the children have an opportunity to think about characters, to think about the feelings of those characters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey learn to use words to describe feelings that are otherwise difficult and this enables them to better control their behavior when they have challenging feelings like anger or sadness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe key take-home message to me is that when parents read and play with their children when their children are very young \u2014 we\u2019re talking about birth to 3 year olds \u2014 it has really large impacts on their children\u2019s behavior,\u201d Dr. Mendelsohn said.

Its first season, best summarized as \u201cX-Men\u201d meets \u201cShock Corridor\u201d by way of \u201cInception,\u201d was invigoratingly unpredictable, mixing the expected superhero mythmaking with wildly experimental cinematography, anything-goes storytelling, and frequent, brassy musical breaks.\n\n\u2018Legion\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAcross eight episodes, Season 1 blasted viewers with visions, nightmares, simulated realities, alternate dimensions, memories and memories within memories; a year later, even the most attentive viewer might need a refresher on who\u2019s who and what they\u2019re up to. Here\u2019s what you need to know ahead of Season 2:\n\nSo Crazy He\u2019s Sane?\n\nMuch of the inaugural season of \u201cLegion\u201d was devoted to unraveling the mystery of its lead protagonist, David Haller (played by Dan Stevens, who is ideally cast as the handsome leading man with a touch of madness). When we first meet him, he\u2019s a recovering addict and a long-term patient at the Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, where he is being treated for paranoid schizophrenia. But that diagnosis doesn\u2019t explain his ability to move objects with his mind. So his new girlfriend Syd (Rachel Keller) breaks him out and gets him to the Summerland facility, where he\u2019ll learn what he can do, and what he\u2019s capable of.\n\nWhen Schizophrenia Is Simpler\n\nOver the course of the season, it becomes clear that David is a mutant with shockingly powerful telekinesis (and, occasionally, telepathy to complement it). (As Clark, the Division III interrogator, later says of David, \u201cHe may be the most powerful mutant we\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d) But his is not a simple \u201clearn your abilities and save the world\u201d sort of situation \u2014 the show\u2019s shifting planes of reality leave open the distinct possibility that this is all in his head. In the first episode, David asks: \u201cIs this real? What if we\u2019re still back at the hospital? What if none of this ever happened?\u201d By the end of the season, he is still asking. The difference is, by then there\u2019s a sense of desperation to his questions, as if he\u2019d prefer that none of it were real. It would certainly make things much simpler.\n\n0\n\nSummerland\n\nAlas, by that point, there\u2019s little question about the gravity of his situation, or the risks being taken by those around him. Syd is obviously the most invested in his well-being, though theirs is rather a complicated relationship \u2014 primarily because she\u2019s unable to have any physical contact with anyone, as that causes their souls to switch bodies. (She and David do this at the beginning of the season, and it does not go well.) Summerland is run by Dr. Melanie Bird (Jean Smart), who is keenly aware of both the advantages offered by David\u2019s powers and the dangers of them. Those views are shared, to varying degrees, by her team: Ptonomy Wallace (Jeremie Harris), the memory specialist who gets a look at David\u2019s abilities and declares, \u201cHe\u2019s a bomb\u201d; Cary Loudermilk (Bill Irwin) and Kerry Loudermilk (Amber Midthunder), the scientist and the savant who often share the same body; and Melanie\u2019s husband, Oliver (Jemaine Clement), who has spent decades alone on an astral plane. They\u2019re a fairly ragtag bunch, especially considering the forces they\u2019re up against.\n\nDivision III\n\nExternally, the biggest threat to David \u2014 and all mutants \u2014 is Division III, a shadowy government agency dedicated to the tracking, capture and study of mutants. Their primary representative is Clark (Hamish Linklater), who seems to suffer a fiery death during David\u2019s breakout in the first episode, only to make a surprise reappearance, badly burned and looking for revenge, at the end of the season.\n\nThat Yellow-Eyed Man-Baby\n\nAnd yet, for all the firepower of their soldiers, Division III is no match for David, who can dispatch them with a wave of the hand. The more serious threat to him \u2014 and, consequently, to humanity \u2014 is the Shadow King, a force of pure evil that has taken up residence in his head like some sort of monstrous parasite. It takes on many forms: a swollen, jaundiced demon; a physical manifestation of the title character of \u201cThe World\u2019s Angriest Boy in the World\u201d (the world\u2019s most terrifying children\u2019s book this side of \u201cThe Babadook\u201d); and most effectively, in the body of Lenny (Aubrey Plaza), David\u2019s old junkie buddy and fellow patient at Clockworks. Syd accidentally kills Lenny during her body swap with David, but Lenny keeps reappearing in flashbacks, in alternate realities, and finally as the sneering, terrifying force of evil that is not leaving David\u2019s head without a fight.\n\nA Messy Eviction\n\nThat attempt at extracting the Shadow King is the big event of the Season 1 finale, and its mixed success is the motor for the season to come. Cary works up a theory that, because David and the Shadow King are putting out parallel brain waves, his team should be able to grab the bad guy and pull him out. The actual procedure results in some complications (to put it mildly), putting David on the verge of mental and physical destruction. In an attempt to save him, Syd takes the bullet \u2014 or to be more precise, the monster \u2014 planting a full kiss on his lips that pulls the Shadow King first into her body, then into Kerry\u2019s, and then into that of poor Oliver, who had just made his way off the astral plane and was beginning to remember his life and his wife. Tough timing, that.\n\nThe Shadow King Calls Shotgun\n\nSo Oliver hits the open road, with the Shadow King figuratively in the passenger seat \u2014 and then literally, in the form of Lenny. \u201cWhere should we look first?\u201d he asks, to which Lenny replies, \u201cSomeplace warm.\u201d Meanwhile, with this evil on the loose, the previously antagonistic Clark and David appear to come to an understanding. As David puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to work together now.\u201d\n\nAnd thus it seems \u201cLegion\u201d has given us a fairly standard end-of-season cliffhanger, until (in true Marvel form) a post-credit sequence, in which a tiny floating ball appears out of nowhere to kidnap David and float away. What was that? Who sent it? Where is it going? Maybe we\u2019ll find out Tuesday night. Or maybe they\u2019ll spend an entire episode spinning the characters into an alternate timeline, where they\u2019ll engage in elaborately choreographed dance numbers to beloved pop songs. With \u201cLegion,\u201d it could kind of go either way.", "title": "Ready for Season 2 of \u2018Legion\u2019? Here\u2019s What to Remember.", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nIt was hard to keep up with HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d week to week through its first season (or even scene to scene). So the news that the series will pick up where it left off when it returns on April 22 isn\u2019t all that reassuring. In broad strokes, Westworld is a futuristic theme park where android \u201chosts\u201d cater to people\u2019s violent and sexual whims in an artificial Old West environment \u2014 until the hosts turn on the guests at the end of Season 1. From there, the broad strokes won\u2019t get you too far.\n\nvia Giphy\n\nThe second season dives right back into the overlapping timelines, philosophical musings and narrative puzzles that have defined the show from the beginning, only now with the added uncertainty of a power struggle over control of the park. (Read The Times\u2019s Season 2 review here.) Much like Westworld itself, the show is a sprawling narrative sandbox that no one can know completely \u2014 not even the Man in Black (Ed Harris), who spends decades trying to sort through its mysteries. Still, there\u2019s plenty we do know, and revisiting the big ideas and twists ahead of Season 2 is crucial; here\u2019s a spoiler-heavy breakdown of where we left off:\n\nTruth\n\nTalulah Riley and Jimmi Simpson in Season 1, Episode 2 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d HBO\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t tell, does it matter?\u201d \u2014 Angela\n\nThis question is posed to William (Jimmi Simpson), a guest, shortly after he arrives at Westworld. He wants to know if the beautiful woman escorting him to the park (a host named Angela, played by Talulah Riley) is human or android, and this is her answer. In the original Michael Crichton film from 1973, the designers of the androids could never get the hands right, so if guests wanted to know if they were dealing with a human or a robot, they could examine the crude ridges around the joints. In this \u201cWestworld,\u201d the androids are not only humanlike, but in some ways more layered and sympathetic than the guests and engineers who exploit them so mercilessly.\n\nConsequences\n\nSidse Babett Knudsen and Jeffrey Wright in Season 1, Episode 2 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d HBO\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want anything disturbing our guests from their rape and pillage.\u201d \u2014 Theresa Cullen\n\nThen again, there\u2019s a cost to abusing the hosts. The sharp rejoinder above comes from Theresa (Sidse Babett Knudsen), the park administrator, who\u2019s struggling to contain a series of host malfunctions while carrying on an affair with Bernard (Jeffrey Wright), the head programmer, whom she later discovers is one of them. For wealthy clients, the appeal of Westworld is being able to indulge in Old West lawlessness without consequences, but the effect is morally corrosive. In one of the first season\u2019s biggest twists, William and the Man in Black are revealed to be the same person, separated by 30 years. In that time, he has progressed from a white-hat type who is reticent to participate in the park\u2019s darker temptations to a vile black-hat who is willing to commit unspeakable violence in order to find the answers he seeks.\n\n0\n\nReveries and (R)evolution\n\nJames Marsden and Evan Rachel Wood in \u201cWestworld.\u201d John P. Johnson/HBO\n\n\u201cI feel spaces opening up inside of me, like a building with rooms I\u2019ve never explored.\u201d \u2014 Dolores Abernathy\n\nWhen we first meet Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), she\u2019s a wholesome frontierswoman whose day begins with optimism, as she greets her father and meets up with Teddy (James Marsden), an android with whom she\u2019s programmed to be romantically linked. It typically ends, however, with the horror of guests murdering her parents and often having their way with her, too. The park has Dolores and the other hosts on a story loop, but they\u2019re starting to evolve. For one, Westworld\u2019s dead co-creator, Arnold, has installed \u201creveries\u201d in the hosts\u2019 code, which enhance their behavioral authenticity by giving them foundational memories, often from previous versions of themselves. But the reveries lead Dolores and Maeve (Thandie Newton), a seasoned madame, to start breaking out of their loops and gaining true consciousness. This makes them increasingly hard to control and dangerous, but also more fully humanlike.\n\nComplex Trauma\n\nJeffrey Wright in Season 1, Episode 2 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d HBO\n\n\u201cThis pain. It\u2019s all I have left of him.\u201d \u2014 Bernard Lowe\n\n\u201cWestworld\u201d shares an important principle with \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d the 2004 metaphysical romance about a man attempting to erase the memory of a failed relationship: It is better to have painful memories than no memories at all. In the above line, Bernard is refering to his dead son, but he is stung later by the bitter irony that this memory has been programmed into him. Teddy has a memory of a massacre perpetrated by a mysterious man named Wyatt. Dolores and Maeve also have false memories built into their hardware, but as they learn more about their true identities, they wind up embracing the agonizing facts of their creation \u2014 and, later, weaponizing it against the humans who wronged them.\n\nLive by the Code, Die by the Code\n\nTessa Thompson in Season 1, Episode 7 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d HBO\n\n\u201cThis place, the people who work here, are nothing.

Dr. Ford\u2019s true \u201cnew narrative\u201d unleashes the android rebellion, which commences as Dolores shoots him in the head and the hosts ambush the Delos executives who worked so hard to undermine him.\n\nThe Maze Wasn\u2019t Meant for You\n\nFrom left, Izabella Alvarez, Clifton Collins Jr. and Ed Harris in Season 1, Episode 2 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d HBO\n\n\u201cFollow the blood arroyo to the place where the snake lays its eggs.\u201d \u2014 Lawrence\u2019s Daughter, to the Man in Black\n\nThe Man in Black spends decades searching for \u201cthe center of the Maze,\u201d which he presumes will tell him some deeper truth about the park\u2019s creation. But the whole puzzle is a big red herring for him. The Maze is really intended as a metaphor for the hosts, planted by Arnold, who covertly designed Dolores and the other androids to evolve into real, self-aware beings. In the finale, we learn that the massacre in Teddy\u2019s memory took place in Escalante, a beta-testing site for the hosts. We also learn that Arnold fused Dolores\u2019s character with that of another, still under development at the time, named Wyatt, and then arranged to have Dolores/Wyatt massacre all the hosts and him \u2014 a kind of mass murder-suicide by android. Arnold lives on in the identical form of Bernard, whose implanted memories of his son are cribbed from Arnold\u2019s.\n\nRising Up, Weighted Down\n\nEvan Rachel Wood in Season 1, Episode 5 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d John P.

Neither is Maeve. Neither is Bernard. They\u2019re all immersed in a bloody uprising against their exploiters, for one, but more broadly, they have the freedom (and the burden) of defining themselves as evolved beings, capable of writing their own narratives. As any flesh-and-blood human can tell them, that\u2019s no easy task.\n\nWho\u2019s Who, and Where Did We Leave Them?\n\nFrom left, Thandie Newton, Angela Sarafyan and Rodrigo Santoro in Season 1 of \u201cWestworld.\u201d John P. Johnson/HBO\n\nDolores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood): Leader of the uprising! The original! Mother of dragons! (Wait, sorry, that\u2019s another show.) Last seen shooting Dr. Ford in the back of the head and opening fire on the party guests.\n\nMaeve Millay (Thandie Newton): Last seen making a daring and bloody escape from Westworld, only to turn around and go back. Despite knowing that her back story is a fiction, she seems determined to find her daughter nonetheless.\n\nTeddy Flood (James Marsden): Dolores\u2019s boy toy in their story loops, but it remains to be seen if their relationship works outside of them. Last seen looking uncomfortable with Dolores\u2019s mass-murdery side.\n\n0\n\nBernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright): Westworld\u2019s head programmer and chief sad sack. He\u2019s an android replica of Arnold, but he only just learned as much.\n\nDr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins): Former co-founder and creative director of Westworld. \u201cFormer\u201d because Dolores initiated the Android uprising of his design by shooting him in the head.\n\nThe Man in Black (Ed Harris): Last seen properly wounded (shot) by a host for the first time. Thrilled by it. Also drunk.\n\nWilliam (Jimmi Simpson): See the Man in Black.\n\nHector Escaton (Rodrigo Santoro): Maeve\u2019s boy toy out of their loops. As a host, he was Westworld\u2019s \u201cMost Wanted\u201d outlaw, so he\u2019s the ideal choice to serve as her muscle, too.\n\nCharlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson): Delos brass. Cool, calculating and focused on executing the company\u2019s hidden agenda. Last seen looking concerned about the shots being fired by Dolores in her general direction.\n\nTheresa Cullen (Sidse Babett Knudsen): Westworld\u2019s head of quality assurance and Bernard\u2019s lover on the side. Murdered by Bernard, at Ford\u2019s behest, when she and Bernard discover that he\u2019s a host.\n\nLawrence (Clifton Collins Jr.): Saved from hanging by the Man in Black and dragged along, sometimes literally, in the Man\u2019s search for the center of the Maze. Last seen entertaining guests at the gala.\n\nEl Lazo (Clifton Collins Jr.): A past version of Lawrence, encountered on William\u2019s timeline before William becomes the Man in Black. Runs a brothel in the seedy town of Pariah, joins William and Dolores on their adventures.\n\nClementine (Angela Sarafyan, Lili Simmons): Another character split over two timelines, played by different actresses. First encountered as a Sweetwater prostitute under Maeve\u2019s watch, then later revealed as one of the park\u2019s oldest hosts. Last seen outside the gala, blasting William in the arm with shotgun.\n\nWyatt (Sorin Brouwers): A deranged mass murderer in Teddy\u2019s back story, having laid waste to the town of Escalante. Obsession of the Man in Black. See also: Dolores.\n\nArmistice (Ingrid Bolso Berdal): Outlaw woman covered in a snake tattoo, whose family was massacred by Wyatt/Dolores. Last seen cutting off her own arm and attempting to escape the park with a machine gun.\n\nThe Confederados (Various): A band of ex-Confederate soldiers who make trouble as mercenaries in the outer fringes of the park. Slaughtered by the Ghost Nation warriors.\n\nGhost Nation warriors (Various): Confederados slaughterers.\n\nLee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman): The smug author of Westworld\u2019s tacky narratives. Marginalized by Dr. Ford when his latest canned adventure is rejected. Discovers that the hosts down in cold storage are gone in the Season 1 finale. Likely pouring himself another drink somewhere.\n\nElsie Hughes (Shannon Woodward): Bernard\u2019s right hand in the behavior and diagnostics lab. Bernard learns later, to his horror, that he apparently strangled her.\n\nFelix Lutz (Leonardo Nam): One of the technicians who was working on Maeve behind the scenes when she suddenly gained consciousness. Will do anything she says. Near-paralyzed with fear at all times.\n\nLogan (Ben Barnes): William\u2019s future brother-in-law, part of the family that owns Delos. Shows William the ropes at Westworld. Acts like an entitled, sadistic yahoo. Last seen tied naked to a horse, galloping away to destinations unknown.", "title": "Ready for Season 2 of \u2018Westworld\u2019? Here\u2019s What to Remember", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"]}

She\u2019s also keenly aware that the residents of her tightknit block are white and the nannies, housekeepers and handymen who work for them are not.\n\nThis factors into the story when her handyman, Ricky, inadvertently blocks access to the parking lot and a neighbor with well-established anger management issues takes a 3- iron to his van, shattering the handyman\u2019s leg when he intervenes.\n\nCharlie witnesses the incident; Nora happens upon it, returning from a jog. And when Charlie sides with the neighbor, a crack develops in the neighborhood\u2019s facade, affecting everyone, but none more than the Nolans.\n\nCharlie isn\u2019t, by any stretch, a terrible husband. He isn\u2019t having an affair with a much younger woman and he\u2019s not engaged in financial shenanigans. When the twins were younger, he was an attentive father. But he can\u2019t shake the feeling that Nora settled for him when they married, and he\u2019s frustrated by his inability to be somebody in the business world. Perhaps only in New York would a man\u2019s climb up the ladder be permanently halted when he\u2019s thought to be too decent: \u201cOver the years his colleagues had waited for the shark to emerge from behind the nice guy, the wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing to make an appearance, the open-faced mask to drop. Nora suspected that when they realized it was not a mask at all, they had begun to value Charlie less.\u201d\n\nNora\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is passivity. She has let life happen to her rather than make the life she once wanted. She didn\u2019t choose a career so much as allow it to choose her. When a pregnant supervisor was put on bed rest while Nora was working a summer job in the development office at Williams, she was asked to take on more responsibility, and when her boss was later hired in New York, she brought Nora along.

Jackson\u2019s character in \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d says he\u2019ll never learn whether sewer rat tastes like pumpkin pie. But when I read that people on both the right and the left were incensed about the gender-nonconforming grandchild of the title character, I decided to take a cautious peek back into Lanford, Ill., where the beloved sitcom characters of the 1990s have been resurrected, in Donald Trump\u2019s America, a little worse for wear but still devoted to one another.\n\nMy colleague Roxane Gay suggested that, despite the series\u2019 charm, it wasn\u2019t worth the effort to watch it, because of the way it normalizes Mr. Trump and endorses the false narrative that it was white working-class families who elected him. At the same time, I\u2019m reluctant to conclude that the popularity of the new \u201cRoseanne\u201d proves growing support for the president any more than the imminent reboot of \u201cLost in Space\u201d suggests a national yearning for a trip to Alpha Centauri.\n\nBut the controversy around the grandchild, Mark, drew my attention. Nine years old, he wears skirts to school, paints his nails and on the whole prefers \u201ccolors that pop.\u201d And yet, Mark is not transgender \u2014 he says, quite firmly, that he\u2019s a boy. When Roseanne tells him that you have to pick your battles in life, and she asks exactly how important this all is to him, Mark replies, bravely and succinctly, \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s a boy who loves being femme, who\u2019s willing to suffer what the world has in store for him as a result, but who we are told clearly is not trans, and whose interest in glitter and miniskirts, according to him, has nothing to do with actual gender dysphoria.", "title": "Opinion | Real Families and the Fictional Roseanne", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "When did you make the transition from scripted programs to reality?\n\nI was working in comedy for the most part, and I wanted to be a producer. Reality was really starting up. I\u2019d done the first two seasons of \u201cThe Real World\u201d already as an editor years back. So I thought, Wow, it\u2019s really taken off. I had an opportunity and jumped over to some of your classics: \u201cThe World\u2019s Deadliest Volcanoes,\u201d \u201cWhen Good Pets Go Bad,\u201d those clip shows and things.\n\nI did a show called \u201cBreaking the Magician\u2019s Code: Magic\u2019s Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed.\u201d That created a stir and gave me a little more profile; it was a Fox show. So I ended up doing a lot of Fox stuff and ABC stuff and did that for a while until Mike Fleiss and I, he kind of broke away from that and started his own company, and he called me and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a show I want you to do.\u201d And that show happened to be \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nA lot of people see shows like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cJersey Shore\u201d as humorous \u2014 something to mock, or to hate-watch. How do you see these programs?\n\n\u201cThe Bachelor\u201d kind of speaks for itself. Just the longevity of it, the fact that it\u2019s been on for 30 seasons and still going strong. I think what keeps people watching is that they love to see who that guy\u2019s going to end up with and what that decision\u2019s going to be at the end.\n\nThe journey is still a fantasy \u2014 basically a soap opera, which Lisa Levenson, my other co-executive producer, brought to \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d She had experience in soap opera, and so we kind of molded the show into a fantasy sort of soap opera world and created, with all the candles and the limousines and the champagne and flowers, this kind of fantasy world that everyone wished their relationship could be like. And I think that caught on at the time. It was a good time for that \u2014 just after 9/11.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs someone who doesn\u2019t idealize weddings or fantasize about a perfect match, I still find it entertaining. Why do you think so many women who are feminist-identifying and happily single enjoy \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d?\n\nI think it\u2019s living vicariously through someone. There\u2019s usually somebody, especially in \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d because there\u2019s multiple bachelorettes, who women can relate to. And I think relatability is important. I wanted to bring a virgin on \u201cAre You the One?\u201d We really wanted to have that. I hadn\u2019t seen it. And it just spoke to a different group of people, and I think each individual on the show speaks to somebody\u2019s personality out there and their own personal issues with relationships.\n\nThe casting is much more diverse on \u201cAre You the One?\u201d than the casting on \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t had a black Bachelor yet, have we?\n\nNo, we have not.\n\nAnd why? Why is the question. I would have liked to have had a black Bachelor back in the mid-2000s. I think it would have shown that ABC was conscious about diversity and ahead of the game. And yet they still haven\u2019t done that. I heard that they\u2019ve toyed with it, but still none. Viacom and MTV are very conscious about their diversity. They like to \u2014 and I like to, as a producer \u2014 have a more diverse crowd.\n\nI think diversity is important today. Look at the population. We have to emulate our population. And for shows that aren\u2019t, I think that\u2019s a mistake.\n\nI know that a lot of people were upset with Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d because there was a suitor who had, deep in his Twitter history, tweets that were openly bigoted. I wonder how far antics, or missteps, like that can go. How much tolerance does the audience have for that kind of thing?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. With this administration, I think we\u2019ve all found out that racism\u2019s still out there, and it\u2019s still very prevalent. I think it has been squelched over the last 20 years or so, and this administration has allowed people to speak up again and feel empowered with their racism. And that\u2019s part of the problem.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s tough to discuss really intense racial issues on networks. They\u2019re just kind of afraid of it. People tend to handle those discussions with kid gloves. And I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that decision either. I think these things need to be discussed in reality TV and across the board, particularly now. I\u2019d love to see the networks kind of loosen up and let these conversations happen and let these things be discussed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is that a good cast, a representative cast, is diverse and relatable to viewers. To what extent are you involved in the casting process, and has that been different from one show to another, or one network to another?\n\nAbsolutely, yes. I\u2019m involved deeply in casting, particularly \u201cAre You the One?\u201d \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d I was. You\u2019re talking about the difference between ABC and MTV. And there is a difference, there\u2019s a cultural difference there. ABC is a Disney-owned network, and although they do go for diversity in their casting now, more so than when I was there, they haven\u2019t highlighted it. I think they should.\n\nIn \u201cAre You the One?,\u201d we try as much as we can to be as diverse as we can. We try to not let race play a part in it. What we want is to find really good matches, based on our criteria. We want romantic and personality traits that are highly compatible and that would provide the best relationships. While also looking for great characters, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. There may be somebody that may be a 95 to 98 percent match, but we may do a 92 percent because that person\u2019s a much better character for the show.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow valuable do you think shock and deception continue to be in reality television? \u201cAre You the One?\u201d doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination, whereas on \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d much is insinuated.\n\nThat\u2019s part of why I\u2019m not at \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d anymore, why I decided to produce louder and more honest shows. We\u2019re showing you what a relationship is like in a bubble, of course. We\u2019re not insinuating anything.\n\nOn \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d we always had to cut to a closed door and assume that they\u2019ve slept together or whatever you want to think they were doing. On \u201cAre You the One?\u201d there\u2019s never closed doors. There\u2019s the camera, the Boom Boom Room. I think that\u2019s just more honest. Is it more shocking? Absolutely.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

How do you grapple with the ethics of putting people in isolation, where they\u2019re left more vulnerable emotionally?\n\nThat\u2019s called the bubble. You don\u2019t have reality television without the bubble. You take away outside influence, you take away family, friends, relationships. You take away telephones. And that\u2019s how they focus on each other and on a relationship. They\u2019re sucked into that bubble within a day or two; it\u2019s all they think about. Do they miss home? Sure, but there\u2019s 21 other guys and girls there, get over it, you signed up for this and this is how it works.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey handle it quite well actually. Many of them will tell you, after it\u2019s over, God it was so nice not to have a cellphone. They really learn to communicate, to talk, to be honest with each other. When you break up with somebody and they\u2019re living in the same house, that\u2019s not easy. You\u2019re going to have to face the music. You have to explain yourself with your words. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about to me. It\u2019s not about torturing anybody. These people aren\u2019t being tortured; they\u2019re signing up for a reality television show, they\u2019re looking for a relationship, these are the ground rules, and we lay them out in the beginning. And they get into that bubble and they live in it and they\u2019re fine with it. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re being psychologically tortured.\n\nThese contestants, they\u2019re entering a contractual relationship that\u2019s consensual. Still, I wonder if there are any moments that you produced on any of the shows you worked on where you felt that you went a little too far. Do you have any regrets?\n\nNo, I have zero regrets. I have regrets that some people who have worked with me may have pushed things too far without my permission or knowledge. Our producers are there daily, 12 to 16 hours a day, and sometimes they get a little excited about something that might happen. And they push a little too hard or give away something they shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m all over that; I don\u2019t like it.\n\nI\u2019m a very strict producer when it comes to how you produce. Telling people to do things is not my style. And I\u2019m very cognizant of sexuality on set and where they take it and that there is consent on both sides. Never would I allow anybody that\u2019s not consenting to go into the Boom Boom Room or have sex if there isn\u2019t full consent, and we\u2019re very aware of it and we have ears on everybody all of the time. And we\u2019ve pulled people apart multiple times. \u201cLook, she\u2019s not into it, sorry, you\u2019re pushing too hard. Go to bed.\u201d\n\nYou mentioned earlier that a part of the reason you left \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d was because you felt that it was operating in ways that you didn\u2019t agree with. When was that?\n\nAbout 2005. It was after Season 7 of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d It wasn\u2019t necessarily that was the only reason. There were more opportunities out there. Things were just beginning to get to the point where they wanted to push things a little hard in producing.\n\nLook, we produce hard, trust me. We can make a girl cry in an interview after a rose ceremony at the drop of a hat, and there\u2019s ways to do that and you can get the tears. But bringing in a character to be a character wasn\u2019t our style back then.\n\nWhat would you say to people who are hypercritical of your line of work, the industry at large?\n\nA lot of people love to watch it. Chances are, you actually watch, too. Most people who are anti-reality have to tune in and watch something. You find out that if you talk to them for a while \u2014 and look, my skin is thick as a rhinoceros\u2019s, you can\u2019t offend me \u2014 I\u2019ve had people tell me directly, Oh my God, you do that trash? And I say, absolutely I do, it\u2019s called Daddy\u2019s Little Meal Ticket. That\u2019s what puts dinner on my table.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrankly it\u2019s a passion. I love being on set with these kids. I enjoy every minute of my job. It\u2019s something that is going to be around. Look, if it\u2019s not for you, there\u2019s probably something out there that is. Try Discovery Networks, try A&E. There\u2019s some really great shows with some good content on those networks, if you don\u2019t care for the MTV flavor or the \u201cBachelor\u201d flavor.

{"date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "The case, amid recurring episodes of deadly mass violence, has drawn an intense response. When the lawsuit reached the Connecticut Supreme Court, gun control advocates, school officials and emergency doctors who treated victims of assault rifle fire submitted amicus briefs in favor of the lawsuit.

The process could be expedited because the company is using a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, which could be completed as early as May.

The $48 billion fund, Cerberus Capital Management, eventually folded Bushmaster into Remington along with other gun companies. Remington is also the target of another high-profile case, a federal class-action lawsuit claiming that trigger defects have caused some of its shotguns to accidentally discharge.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before the 2016 presidential election, the gun industry had maintained a robust manufacturing operation. But gun sales have plummeted since President Trump won the election; many attribute the decrease to gun buyers believing that the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would be less inclined to pursue tougher gun-control measures.\n\nRemington recently hired Lazard, a financial advisory firm, as the company devised its restructuring plans and searched for financing for its reorganization. Lazard approached more than 30 potential lenders on Remington\u2019s behalf before finding financial companies willing to give them a loan, according to court filings. A Lazard representative wrote that many lenders \u201cindicated that they were reluctant to provide financing to firearms manufacturers.\u201d And even some of the ones who ended up lending Remington money had their names redacted from court documents.\n\nSusheel Kirpalani, a bankruptcy lawyer who has been consulting the Sandy Hook families\u2019 legal team, said that he and others had been scouring Remington\u2019s voluminous filings and disclosure documents, looking for anything in the complex financial transactions that might affect the Sandy Hook lawsuit. The company\u2019s filings indicate that creditors, including the Sandy Hook plaintiffs, would be \u201cunimpaired\u201d by the Chapter 11 process, which means that the lawsuit can resume after the reorganized Remington emerges from bankruptcy.\n\nEven so, beyond the bankruptcy, the Sandy Hook lawsuit has faced long odds of success.\n\nCongress granted gun companies industrywide immunity from blame when one of their products is used in a crime. But the law, enacted in 2005, includes exceptions for sale and marketing practices that violate state or federal laws and instances of so-called negligent entrustment, in which a gun is carelessly given or sold to a person posing a high risk of misusing it.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Remington \u2014 along with a wholesaler and dealer, which were also named in the suit \u2014 erred by entrusting an untrained civilian public with a weapon designed for maximizing fatalities on the battlefield. It also asserts that the companies relied on advertising, with messages of combat dominance and slogans like \u201cConsider your man card reissued,\u201d that appealed specifically to disturbed young men like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.\n\nThe gun companies contend that federal law shields them from the families\u2019 claims, and a lower court judge agreed, dismissing the lawsuit in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, the families believe that the companies bear a measure of responsibility. \u201cThe families\u2019 ultimate goal in filing the lawsuit is accountability,\u201d Ms. Mesner-Hage said.", "title": "Remington\u2019s Bankruptcy Stalls Ruling in Sandy Hook Families\u2019 Suit", "authors": ["Kristin Hussey", "Rick Rojas"]}

People who live in a county where only one insurer offers Obamacare-compliant health plans now can get an exemption to the law\u2019s individual mandate penalties right away. (They\u2019ll go away for everyone next year under legislation passed as part of the tax overhaul.) The administration is allowing older plans that predated Obamacare and that don\u2019t follow all its rules to stick around another year. It\u2019s also allowing health plans to cover a slightly less robust set of benefits, although those changes are mostly marginal.\n\nBigger changes are coming. The administration has proposed regulations that would allow so-called short-term health plans to be offered for nearly a year of coverage. Those plans aren\u2019t subject to any Obamacare rules in most states, and are likely to be marketed aggressively. They are likely to cover fewer health services and be available only to the healthy \u2014 but at a lower price. Another pending rule would expand the availability of association health plans, a form of group insurance purchasing that may be attractive to small businesses looking for cheaper, less comprehensive options.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict precisely who will choose what. The administration wrote in its rule proposals that it didn\u2019t anticipate either the short-term or association plans to be very popular, even as it lauded them as important alternatives to the current options under the health law. The new options may mostly attract people who are uninsured now, because they were priced out of the current market. Outside experts think the alternatives could siphon away a substantial percentage of healthy people from the Obamacare markets.\n\nPeople buying those plans may face some unpleasant surprises. The plans are likely to require applicants to fill out detailed health histories, and to exclude those with prior illnesses. They also are likely to exclude or limit services \u2014 like addiction treatment, maternity care or prescription drugs \u2014 that all Obamacare plans require. Association plan buyers have tended to have problems with fraud. And some short-term plans have a history of declining to pay for serious illnesses after the fact.", "title": "Republicans Couldn\u2019t Knock Down Obamacare.

{"date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "But the mere fact that Republicans are talking by early spring about running on an impeachment threat reveals the depth of their challenge going into this fall\u2019s election. The first midterm campaign of a new administration is typically difficult for the president\u2019s party. But the tempestuous Mr. Trump has compounded the Republicans\u2019 difficulties by generating an unending stream of made-for-TV controversies that overshadow their policy achievements and the health of the economy.\n\nThere are voices in the Republican Party who believe that it is too soon to sound the alarm, and that doing so will come off as overly panicked. Indeed, what is striking about the politics of impeachment is that both parties are divided over how to navigate the issue in the midterm campaign.\n\nPolls show most voters are not supportive of impeachment at the moment, but if Mr. Trump were to fire the White House special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the country would become about evenly divided on the question.\n\nIn January, 66 House Democrats, over a third of the caucus, voted to begin impeachment proceedings. That was eight more than the total number who voted for a similar measure in the House a month earlier.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s committed impeachable offenses,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, adding that waiting for the special counsel is risky because Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry may never \u201csee the light of day.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leadership, though, has sought to tamp down these impulses. They believe Republicans are setting a trap and are irritated that the billionaire donor Tom Steyer, who recently said he wants to host a series of primary debates this year, is trumpeting the issue. These Democrats argue that the party needs to focus on a substantive agenda and assure voters that they will exercise sober and reasonable oversight of Mr. Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Democratic campaign organization released a memo based on an internal poll that urged candidates to \u201cexpress a willingness to work with the president when his agenda might help the district.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf impeachment becomes a political tool instead of the end result of a credible investigation, then you are as guilty as Trump, in some ways, of taking a hammer blow to institutions,\u201d said David Axelrod, former President Barack Obama\u2019s onetime chief strategist, adding that it would also create risks in swing districts. \u201cTo say I\u2019m for impeachment come hell or high water is to promise chaos.\u201d", "title": "Republicans Seize on Impeachment for Edge in 2018 Midterms", "authors": []}

Flynn, who served briefly as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. It disclosed, for example, that before traveling to Moscow in December 2015, Mr. Flynn and his son met privately with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, at his Washington residence. Mr. Flynn\u2019s son later emailed the Russian Embassy that the meeting had been \u201cvery productive.\u201d\n\nIn a newly disclosed June 2016 email, Mr. Flynn also seemed to give a Trump campaign aide a preview of the release of stolen emails that would prove highly damaging to the Clinton campaign. \u201cThere are a number of things happening (and will happen) this election via cyber operations (by both hacktivists, nation states and the DNC),\u201d he wrote to an unnamed communications adviser.\n\nMr. Flynn sent that email after disclosures that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russian operatives but before WikiLeaks began releasing the stolen emails.\n\nBut the committee never interviewed Mr. Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador during the transition and is now cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team. For the most part, the Republicans cast communications between Trump associates and Russian officials or intermediaries as simply misguided.\n\n\u201cWhile the committee found that several of the contacts between Trump associates and Russians \u2014 or their proxies, including WikiLeaks \u2014 were ill advised, the committee did not determine that Trump or anyone associated with him assisted Russia\u2019s active-measures campaign,\u201d the Republicans wrote.\n\nIn one finding \u2014 mocked by the Democrats as particularly convoluted \u2014 the Republicans asserted that \u201cpossible Russian efforts to set up a \u2018back channel\u2019 with Trump associates after the election\u201d indicated campaign officials did not collude with Russians because otherwise a back channel would have already existed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Republicans criticized the Obama administration for a \u201cslow and inconsistent\u201d response to Russia\u2019s covert interference.

Although Mr. Page did not represent the campaign on that trip, the lawmakers said, \u201cthe committee is concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans accused the intelligence agencies of failing to use \u201cproper analytic tradecraft\u201d as they crafted a key conclusion of a January 2017 assessment of the Russian campaign. In the portion in question, intelligence officials had concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted to harm Mrs. Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. The Republican report does not explicitly contest that conclusion but implies that the Russians\u2019 primary intention was to sow discord, not to help Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd they admonished Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee for hiring Fusion GPS, a research firm, to investigate ties between Trump associates and Russia. The firm in turn hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, who produced a salacious dossier outlining a conspiracy between the campaign and the Russians based, in part, on Russian sources.\n\n\u201cThey were very forceful in saying that the Clinton campaign actually did contribute to Russia, so maybe somebody ought to look at that,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House, underscoring the political opportunity the report handed him. \u201cBut what we really should do is get on with our lives.\u201d\n\nDemocrats accused the Republicans of \u201coften risible attempts to explain away inconvenient truths\u201d while turning a blind eye to obvious leads.\n\nFor example, the Democrats were eager to determine whether in June 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had called his father to discuss his coming meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who was supposed to deliver dirt on Mrs. Clinton. But they said that Republicans stymied their efforts to obtain the phone records for the president while he was a candidate, so a call from Donald Trump Jr. to a blocked number remained a mystery.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deception surrounding these meetings \u2014 first denying they took place; then, when discovered, denying their content; and then denying their significance \u2014 suggests a consciousness of wrongfulness, if not illegality,\u201d the Democrats wrote of the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey complained that the Republicans refused to expand the investigation to look at whether the president or his aides had obstructed justice or abused their power, despite \u201cimportant evidence\u201d before the committee.\n\nThe Democrats also disputed the Republicans\u2019 claims about the January 2017 intelligence assessment. They said that the Republicans cited no evidence to support their claim of improper tradecraft and that Democrats\u2019 own review showed that the analysis met standards. Information that has become public since has only clarified Mr. Putin\u2019s intention to help Mr. Trump, they said.\n\nThey also dismissed an assertion by Republicans that Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia before the 2016 campaign provided no basis for collusion. The Republicans would have no way of reaching such a conclusion, they Democrats said, because they never studied Mr. Trump\u2019s pre-campaign business dealings.\n\nThe lawmakers split deeply over whether James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, had leaked sensitive information to the news media. Republicans said Mr. Clapper gave \u201cinconsistent testimony\u201d about his contacts with a reporter about Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier; Democrats accused Republicans of trying to \u201csmear\u201d Mr. Clapper without a shred of evidence.\n\nRepublicans had released key findings from the report in March. The full report, heavily redacted by the intelligence agencies, includes recommendations on issues as diverse as cyber and election security, as well as a call for the executive branch to consider administering mandatory polygraph tests to political appointees with top-secret security clearances unless they are confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThough they absolved the Trump campaign, the Republicans warned that Mr. Putin\u2019s government would be back unless the United States mounted significant efforts to deter his agents.\n\n\u201cUnless the cost-benefit equation of such operations changes significantly, the Putin regime and other hostile governments will continue to pursue these attacks against the United States and its allies,\u201d they wrote.

The five-year, $70 million agreement, which was signed in 2015, involves I.T.F. events ranging from the Davis Cup, a men\u2019s team tennis event, to Futures tournaments, the lowest rung on the men\u2019s professional tennis ladder.\n\nThe expansion of live data rights to those lowest, most vulnerable levels of competition has incubated corruption, the report said, adding that the risks of the deal were not adequately considered.\n\n\u201cWhilst these deals have generated considerable funds for the sport, they have also greatly expanded the available markets for betting on the lowest levels of professional tennis,\u201d the panel said. \u201cThe I.T.F. did not appropriately assess the potential adverse effects of these agreements before entering into them.\u201d\n\nThe report cited a veteran investigator for the Tennis Integrity Unit who estimated that \u201chundreds of matches at Futures level (both singles and doubles) are not being played fairly, with the numbers reducing as you move upwards through the ranks of the professional game.\u201d\n\nThe available evidence, including a significant increase in the number of alerts sent when a match had unusual betting patterns or other suspicious circumstances, showed that the problem had worsened after the sale of the data rights. In 2012, there were only three match alerts at the Futures level; by 2016, that number had increased to 240. (From 2009 to 2017, men\u2019s matches were responsible for 83 percent of T.I.U.\u2019s alerts.)\n\nThe dissolution of the data deal was the first of the 12 recommendations in the report.\n\n\u201cDiscontinuing the sale of official data at these lowest levels of tennis is a necessary, pragmatic and effective approach to containing betting-related breaches of integrity,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the panel did not recommend restricting data at the next tier of men\u2019s events, the ATP Challenger Tour, where the rate of suspicious match reports is more than twice what it is at the Futures level. Data rights on that tour are owned by IMG, the sports and entertainment management company.\n\nLive data from these tournaments can be used by gambling sites, particularly for wagers that can be made on elements of a match as it progresses.\n\nAlex Inglot, a spokesman for Sportradar, called the proposal to end the company\u2019s agreement with the I.T.F. for data rights at Futures events \u201cunrealistic,\u201d \u201cpotentially unlawful\u201d and \u201cheavy-handed.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Pre-match betting will remain available; unofficial data will be collected; generally available match statistics can be used by betting operators anyway; the risk of data fraud and ghost matches will increase; and there will be no clear contractual basis by which operators will be bound to reporting and transparency requirements. This will almost certainly encourage black market activity.\u201d\n\nDavid Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., has said that the Sportradar deal is a symbiotic arrangement that helps increase oversight of betting patterns in the sport. He has argued that it is as much in the betting companies\u2019 interest to eliminate corruption as it is in tennis\u2019s interest.\n\nBut the review panel disagreed, citing the increased volume of betting on the lower levels of the sport, which has proved to be the most vulnerable to match fixing. It also suggested that the sport at large should help compensate the I.T.F. for the lost revenue if it follows the panel\u2019s recommendation and ends the Sportradar deal.\n\nThe panel insisted that the lucrative nature of the data sales should not be used as justification to continue the practice, saying that \u201cthe resolution of significant integrity concerns cannot be driven by the question of financial return \u2014 even when much of it is redistributed to the sport.\u201d\n\nThe panel also recommended eliminating sponsorships from betting companies.\n\nThe report said the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was established in 2008 to investigate betting-related corruption, should be reorganized to give it independent oversight apart from the sport\u2019s governing bodies: the ATP, the WTA, the I.T.F. and the four Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nA statement released on behalf of those governing bodies said, \u201cWe confirm our agreement in principle with the package of measures and recommendations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe panel scrutinized the sport\u2019s responses to integrity concerns before the investigative unit was established, including a 2003 case in which the ATP encouraged a player to retire to avoid facing discipline for match fixing. Still, the panel said it had not found evidence of the cover-up, which was alleged in a 2016 article by the BBC and Buzzfeed that ignited a firestorm over match fixing.\n\n\u201cThe panel has not in that investigation discovered any evidence establishing a cover-up of breaches of integrity by the international governing bodies, by the T.I.U. or by anyone else in relation to these matters,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHowever, the panel has discovered what it considers to be errors made and opportunities missed by tennis in relation to these matters.\u201d\n\nMany of the recommendations announced Wednesday were similar to those proposed by Richard Ings in a 2005 report on corruption and match-fixing allegations produced for the ATP Tour.\n\nThe panel called for the Tennis Integrity Unit to have greater transparency in its proceedings and better cooperation with law enforcement. It also criticized the T.I.U. for lacking personnel with expertise in betting or tennis; many employees of the integrity unit are former police officers.\n\nThe panel also recommended wider training for players, better security around players at tournaments, and methods to prevent online abuse. There were also recommendations to reform the pathway players take through the lower tiers of tennis to shore up \u201cincentive problems\u201d that exist when players earning little prize money are vulnerable to selling matches.\n\nMany of the proposed changes have been carried out in some form over the past two years. Tennis has already pulled back from several major betting sponsorships, with the Australian Open ending a deal with William Hill and the I.T.F. ending a partnership with Betway. The integrity unit has increased its staff and its budget, and has begun regularly releasing information about its activities in an effort to be more transparent.\n\nThe I.T.F. has also announced reforms at the lowest levels of the sport, instituting a \u201ctransition tour\u201d for the 2019 season in the hopes of culling the number of professional players.\n\nSome of the proposed changes could affect top players as well. The panel suggested that appearance fees should be made public and that tanking in a match could be considered an integrity offense even without an intentional connection to a betting outcome.", "title": "Review Finds \u2018Tsunami\u2019 of Fixed Matches in Lower Levels of Tennis", "authors": ["Ben Rothenberg", "Christopher Clarey"]}

Set in Alice Springs, Australia, in 1929, the movie tracks the fate of Sam (a fine Hamilton Morris), an Aboriginal stockman forced to flee after killing a white farmer in self-defense.\n\nAround this spare story, though, the director Warwick Thornton constructs a searing indictment of frontier racism as remarkable for its sonic restraint as its visual expansiveness. The opening shot might be a metaphorical mallet \u2014 a cauldron of water slowly coming to the boil while a violent, slur-slathered argument plays out offscreen \u2014 but the coarseness is in keeping with the movie\u2019s pointed, symbolic style.\n\nVideo\n\nWrapping colonialism in the cloak of the western (and revisiting themes explored in his 2010 film \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d), Mr. Thornton stirs those familiar genre tropes into new patterns. As Sam and his wife (Natassia Gorey-Furber) trek across desert and salt flat \u2014 painted in vivid swaths of ocher and ice \u2014 he outwits his pursuers at every turn. Tricked into entering tribal lands, the small posse, led by a stoically vengeful Bryan Brown, is repelled by vicious warriors. But even Sam isn\u2019t safe here: for men like him, virtually enslaved, their only home is the in-between.\n\nSoulful and still, but never inert, \u201cSweet Country,\u201d like its setting, has little time for women\u2019s voices. Yet the movie has a mythic thrust that\u2019s partly due to its almost playful manipulation of time, its silent flash-forwards lending the story a feeling of futility and predetermination. As foreboding and memory rub shoulders, we can\u2019t help feeling that, for Sam and his ilk, no amount of guile will ever be enough.", "title": "Review: 1920s Australia Is No \u2018Sweet Country\u2019 for Aboriginal Australians", "authors": ["Jeannette Catsoulis", "Steven Mcgregor", "David Tranter"]}
{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "When Don Diego de Zama stands on edge of the New World, what does he see? He sees a group of naked women bathing and chattering. It is the late 18th century, and he also sees native people walking along the crystalline water and under the endless, sheltering sky. Mostly, Zama \u2014 an official of the Spanish empire born in the Americas yet proudly, insistently Spanish \u2014 sees himself, as if gazing into in an enormous mirror. He sees a noble husband, father, magistrate, would-be lover and defender of the crown. He sees a world that is being remade in his image, not grasping that his mirror is cracked.\n\nLucrecia Martel\u2019s cinematic marvel \u201cZama\u201d tells the dreamlike story of Don Diego (a wonderful Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho), a proud if beleaguered agent of Western colonialism. When you first meet him, Diego is waiting for a transfer from a desolate outpost. He has been waiting a long time. Over this pleasurably eccentric movie, Diego \u2014 with his noble head held high, his tragically ill-fitting wig and slow-growing despair \u2014 continues to wait, while simultaneously being assailed by slights, insults, rejections, humiliations, a comically inquisitive llama and catastrophic physical violence. Diego\u2019s tribulations are almost worthy of a Christian martyr except that he is suffering for sins of his own making.\n\nIn \u201cZama,\u201d colonialism shapes every scene, exchange and body; it is the air that people breathe. Soon after the movie opens, Diego oversees the interrogation of a bound, near-naked prisoner. The scene is brief, restrained; and its meaning \u2014 as is sometimes the case in this movie \u2014 seems oblique. The man\u2019s crimes remain unstated, though you infer that his great offense may be his skin color. When he doesn\u2019t confess, Diego decides to release the man, who runs right into a wall. He then haltingly speaks of a fish that swims to and fro, \u201cfighting water that seeks to cast it upon dry land.\u201d The water rejects it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe prisoner disappears, but his story\u2019s allegorical power takes root. This elliptical approach is a familiar one for Ms. Martel, a well-regarded Argentine director (\u201cLa Ci\u00e9naga,\u201d \u201cThe Headless Woman\u201d) who conveys Diego\u2019s story piecemeal. What joins the seemingly disconnected parts in \u201cZama\u201d \u2014 what ties a sensual glance to a strange barking to a thief in the night to a desperate struggle \u2014 is Diego or rather his adamant, increasingly desperate request for a transfer. His desire to leave propels and all but defeats him. It also becomes the narrative through line, connecting Diego to everyone and everything, tethering him to the past and inexorably pulling him toward his fate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cZama\u201d is based on the brilliant 1956 novel by Antonio di Benedetto (1922-1986), only recently translated into English.

Ms. Martel\u2019s \u201cZama,\u201d for which she wrote the screenplay, departs in detail from the novel, though the two are more spiritually alike than not. What\u2019s striking is how she conveys the novel\u2019s singular first-person voice, one that is described in the introduction as \u201ca certain abject nobility.\u201d On the page, that voice is at once imperiously self-aggrandizing and unconsciously preposterous, with di Benedetto\u2019s ironic detachment reverberating in each of Zama\u2019s utterances.", "title": "Review: A Cinematic Marvel, \u2018Zama\u2019 Brilliantly Tackles Colonialism in the New World", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Lucrecia Martel"]}

Don\u2019t expect the life and times of the recluse of Massachusetts, either \u2014 though we do get bees, a regular feature in Dickinson\u2019s writing, encased in an observation hive with a microphone so we can hear the poet\u2019s \u201cbuccaneers of buzz.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFans of the avant-garde Italian director Romeo Castellucci will be in familiar territory here. The piece unfurls as a succession of visually astonishing tableaus; you could freeze-frame any second of the show and have a picture-perfect composition. A figure in a white hood and red mask shoots arrows upward. Actors parade in long black or white aprons and Puritan-style hats, their faces hidden by veils. Joseph Merrick, a.k.a. the Elephant Man, is there, too, along with two women in identical red dresses evocative of Dickinson\u2019s time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSometimes there is pin-drop silence; sometimes there is Bach; and sometimes there is a punishingly loud electronic drone.

A celestial character named the Starkeeper (the great Shakespearean actor John Douglas Thompson) assumes new visibility throughout, taking on the role of Billy\u2019s angelic supervisor.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry that flesh and blood will not be given their due. Julie and Billy may be mere mortal specks in a divine scheme. But they also pulse in the foreground of a palpable here and now, in which people exult in the pleasures afforded the body, from lingering kisses to hard-eating clambakes.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe same is true of the other supporting humans in this unselfconsciously colorblind \u201cCarousel,\u201d as vibrant a team of courters and sparkers as you could wish for. Lindsay Mendez and Alexander Gemignani turn in expertly crafted and beautifully sung performances as Carrie, Julie\u2019s best friend, and her fish-scented swain, Mr. Snow.\n\nAs Jigger Craigin, Billy\u2019s pal and nemesis, the ballet dancer Amar Ramasar makes an electric Broadway debut. Margaret Colin offers a razor-sharp take on toxic possessiveness as Billy\u2019s boss and older paramour. And the fabled opera star Ren\u00e9e Fleming is a delightful, refreshingly hedonistic Cousin Nettie. (Oh, she can sing, too, and makes fine, purifying work of that enduring sentimental war horse \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d)\n\nIt is gloriously clear throughout that what animates these disparate souls, who wear Ann Roth\u2019s handsome period costumes as easily as if they were track suits, is the mating instinct. What\u2019s bustin\u2019 out all over in June, to crib from the show\u2019s sunniest set piece, is sex. And Mr. Peck, the resident choreographer of New York City Ballet, has channeled that urge into some of the most thrilling and original dancing seen on Broadway in years.\n\nThat includes, as you might expect, the opening fairground number, in which dancers become both the horses and riders of the titular carousel, and that spirited serenade to the merry month of June, in which lust seems to spread across the stage like an epidemic.\n\nBut Mr. Peck\u2019s great choreographic coup comes, unexpectedly and exhilaratingly, toward the end of the first act with, of all things, \u201cBlow High, Blow Low.\u201d That\u2019s the song with the repeated lyrics, \u201ca-sailin\u2019 we will go,\u201d which usually comes across as a blustery, hokey ode to the maritime life.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Santo Loquasto\u2019s picturesque, deliberately artificial sets suggest that the world is but a provisional stage in a larger, more mysterious universe.\n\nYou either go with its natural flow, or you don\u2019t. And it is Billy and Julie\u2019s misfortune that they are opposites in this regard. Ms. Mueller (who won a Tony as Carole King in \u201cBeautiful\u201d) uncannily combines strength and serenity, quiet joy and accepting sadness, qualities that flow through her liquid soprano. She is about as close to Zen incarnate as a down-home New England Christian gal can be.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Henry (\u201cViolet,\u201d \u201cThe Scottsboro Boys\u201d) portrays Billy as a figure of agitated, unceasing rebellion. He refuses to let himself relax into his genuine love for Julie. In the \u201cBlow High, Blow Low\u201d number, he\u2019s the dancer who can\u2019t find his feet.\n\nBilly\u2019s great solo, \u201cSoliloquy,\u201d performed with a heaven-rumbling voice by Mr. Henry, is a battle of conflicting feelings. You are always aware of this man\u2019s anger, and where it comes from.\n\nThat rage propels him to commit the crime in which he loses his life and, most notoriously, to hit Julie. This act of violence is not seen but described, and it is echoed in an awkwardly muffled encounter in the play\u2019s second act.\n\nThat\u2019s when Billy\u2019s ghost returns to earth years later to visit his unhappy teenage daughter, Louise (Brittany Pollack). The mother-daughter dialogue that falls so abrasively on contemporary ears \u2014 about it being possible to be hit loud and hard and \u201cnot hurt you at all\u201d \u2014 is delivered quietly and unconvincingly, almost as if hoping to pass unnoticed.\n\nA similar queasiness pervades much of the rest of the second act, especially in the scenes set in heaven, which looks like a rough draft of a starry paradise by Rockwell Kent, inhabited by angels who quaintly bring to mind arty Denishawn dancers of the early 20th century.\n\nEven back on earth, Mr. Peck\u2019s usually sure hand feels a bit shaky. The danced sequence in which Louise is rejected by prim Maine society and seeks comfort with a vagabond fairground worker doesn\u2019t entirely track. (It was only then that I started to miss Agnes de Mille\u2019s more lucid story ballets for the original.) I always squirm through the undeserved uplift and optimism of the final scene, and this time was no different.\n\nFor its first two-thirds, though, this \u201cCarousel\u201d tingles with the rapture of life in all its contradictions. And the chemistry between this show\u2019s leading, mismatched couple is so charged, that when tree blossoms fall mysteriously over their first meeting on a windless night, it makes perfect sense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe real spinning carousel in this production is love.

(Even women have a go at it, as Glenda Jackson did in London a year and a half ago.)\n\nThe most magnetic performance on the Harvey Theater stage, however, is that of Paapa Essiedu as Edmund, the cunning bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester (David Troughton). A rising star in Britain, Mr. Essiedu brings to the role a cold deliberateness, a chillingly vacant stare. This Edmund is a sociopath incapable of empathy, a man executing Machiavellian calculations when everybody around him is governed by impulses.

The grown children, in fact, are the most compelling element in a show that one might partly describe as a cautionary tale about fatherhood gone horribly wrong. Gloucester is all too quick to believe Edmund\u2019s lies and cast off Edgar (Oliver Johnstone), the son who actually loves him. And that I started rooting for Goneril and, to a lesser extent, Regan is indicative, perhaps, of the unconscious influence of our current national mood. After all, the sisters may have endured Lear\u2019s arbitrary whims for years, and they have seen him reject his youngest daughter, Cordelia (Mimi Ndiweni), after she refused to praise him.

In that work (widely known among cinephiles for Max Oph\u00fcls\u2019s ravishing 1950 film adaptation), one character from each scene becomes a part of the next, giving unsettlingly fleshly resonance to the idea that we\u2019re all connected.\n\nMs. Nottage makes deft and fleet-footed use of the Schnitzler prototype of overlapping lives. The production traces the movement of Mlima\u2019s tusks from the elephant\u2019s death through their sale and subsequent smuggling out of Kenya until their final, grim apotheosis as an exquisite ivory set in the penthouse of a rich connoisseur.\n\nEach of the people involved in this sequence of plunder and commerce is played by one of three enjoyable, mutable performers. They are Kevin Mambo, Jojo Gonzalez and Ito Aghayere, who keep reincarnating themselves via quick changes of costume (by Jennifer Moeller), stance and accent.\n\nThose portrayed include the Somali poachers who kill Mlima; the corrupt police chief who first sells the tusks and his unwitting nephew, a park warden; a media-savvy Kenyan bureaucrat; a Chinese businessman; a ship captain; and a master ivory carver. Each character, inhabiting a rung on an ascending ladder of power, is very clearly defined but without grotesque caricature.\n\nSuch restraint is appropriate, since Ms. Nottage has not set out to create a gallery of predatory villains. All those involved in Mlima\u2019s slaughter and the sale of his tusks have understandable motives for acting as they do.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimilarly, even the most seemingly noble among them are ultimately tainted by self-serving motives.

Most disturbingly, we see him alone in the cargo hold of a ship, inevitably summoning thoughts of African people of earlier years abducted into barbaric slavery.\n\nAfter Mlima\u2019s death, Mr. Ngaujah smears his torso and face with white paint, evoking the ritual body painting of African tribes. That paint has a way of transferring itself, as an emblem of complicity, onto everyone with whom Mlima comes in contact.

Ms. Netrebko, who over many years has been moving from the lighter, bel canto fare into weightier dramatic roles, could have chosen a less prominent stage to try out Tosca.\n\nMs. Netrebko knew what she was doing. She was a magnificent Tosca. From her first entrance, Ms. Netrebko, one of the opera world\u2019s genuine prima donnas, seemed every bit Puccini\u2019s volatile heroine, an acclaimed diva in the Rome of 1800, seized in the moment with jealous suspicions over her lover, the painter Mario Cavaradossi. As she hurled accusations at Mario \u2014 Why was the church door locked? Who were you whispering with? I heard a woman\u2019s rustling skirt! \u2014 it took a couple of minutes for Ms. Netrebko\u2019s voice to warm up fully. By the time Tosca, having pushed doubts aside, beguiles Mario into a rendezvous at his villa that night, Ms. Netrebko\u2019s singing was plush, radiant and suffused with romantic yearning.\n\nHer Tosca is a woman used to getting her way. That she loves Mario so deeply rattles her. Having been reassured by Mario\u2019s sweet talk, Tosca, with a touch of mock despair, sings, \u201cYou know how to make me love you.\u201d With melting sound and disarming vulnerability, Ms. Netrebko made this crucial line seem especially revealing, a moment of helpless resignation.\n\nIt must have lent Ms. Netrebko confidence to have her husband, the Azerbaijan tenor Yusif Eyvazov, singing Mario. (The Met announced this month that Marcelo \u00c1lvarez would not sing the role in this six-performance run, specifying no reason.) Mr. Eyvazov is a husky-bodied man with a voice to match.

The style is attractive; a 1960s compromise between ballet and modern dance, it has a middle-of-the-road mellifluousness, full-bodied yet careful. The structures are solid, even classical in their adherence to the rules of some old choreographic handbook. It isn\u2019t a question of what\u2019s there, but what isn\u2019t: the mysterious quality that makes you feel that the top of your head has been taken off or any of the other metaphors that try to pinpoint the difference between verse and poetry, between admirable craft and inescapable art.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor decades, critics like me have been noting this absence. And for decades, other critics and audience members have reacted differently, as attested by the many lifetime achievement awards that Mr. Lubovitch has been racking up lately. Mr. Lubovitch has defended himself (humbly, not aggressively) as a contrarian conservative, a romantic defender of old-fashioned beauty unafraid of sentimentality.

All the dancers are quietly confident and individual: Erez Milatin, who joined the company last year and dances the Summer duet with Alexis Branagan, has a particular glow.\n\nYou can see why the three items by Robbins \u2014 \u201cSeptet\u201d (1982), \u201cRondo\u201d (1980), \u201cConcertino\u201d (1982) \u2014 have long since been omitted from retrospectives of his works by larger companies. None of them is an obvious hit, or tries to be. And yet I suspect none of the 20 Robbins revivals at New York City Ballet this May will do nearly as much to extend our knowledge of Robbins as these three. (As with all of Theater Ballet\u2019s repertory, I wish these works could have been seen on a stage at least four times the size; they were all made for the Lincoln Center theater now called the David H. Koch, to which Robbins had been long accustomed.)\n\nThese short pieces, made for small casts, demonstrate the most generally overlooked side of Robbins: the pure-dance craftsman who analyzed musical scores, the composition of dance phrases and the alchemy with which the two could join. \u201cSeptet\u201d and \u201cConcertino\u201d were both made for City Ballet\u2019s 1982 Stravinsky Festival. \u201cSeptet,\u201d for three men and two women, is set to Stravinsky\u2019s two-piano reduction of his 1952 score of that name. \u201cConcertino,\u201d for one woman and two men, is to the composer\u2019s \u201cConcertino for String Quartet\u201d and \u201cThree Pieces for Clarinet Solo.\u201d \u201cRondo,\u201d for two women, is to Mozart (the Rondo in A Minor, K511 for solo piano).\n\nAll of these draw your attention to Robbins\u2019s ability to shape a seemingly artless dance phrase and to build a work fluently from often short phrases. They also show not only his fondness for community onstage but also the understated subtlety with which he was developing same-sex partnering. As with most Theater Ballet programs, we\u2019re the wiser for this fare.", "title": "Review: At New York Theater Ballet, Safe Bets Become Bold", "authors": []}

This month he programmed two engagements a couple of weeks apart: a restaging of his 1973 solo \u201cTime Out\u201d and an engrossing new work for him and eight younger members of Douglas Dunn and Dancers, \u201cTandem,\u201d which opened on Monday.\n\nOne pleasure of watching performances at Mr. Dunn\u2019s loft \u2014 in a building he once shared with his fellow dance postmodernists Lucinda Childs, Trisha Brown and David Gordon (who still lives downstairs) \u2014 is seeing work created specifically for that space, with its wide wooden floor and spare theatrical trappings.

It\u2019s not that the movement looks effortless; Mr. Dunn, who danced for Merce Cunningham from 1969 to 1973, shares Cunningham\u2019s penchant for flirting with the impossible. But even in the visible struggle to balance on one leg while the torso unpredictably swerves and tilts, or to lower a partner soundlessly and incrementally to the floor, the dancers maintain an equanimity, immersed in doing the work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBalancing humor and hyper-concentration, Mr. Dunn allows \u201cTandem\u201d to undulate between slow, introspective states and flurries of manic activity.

At the end, as if exhausted by his own tenacity, he collapsed to the floor.\n\nThe solo was the first of five to take shape \u2014 and then deflate \u2014 on the stage of New York Live Arts, in a two-act work dealing with fantasy, friendship, loneliness, sexuality and the trauma of growing up gay in America. Assembling a cast of his well-known dancer friends, Mr. Ferver asked each to channel a childhood idol. Lloyd Knight, of the Martha Graham Dance Company, chose Graham. The Broadway performer Garen Scribner chose the figure skater Brian Boitano. Reid Bartelme, who with Harriet Jung designed the work\u2019s artful collection of sheer and slinky costumes, threw a curveball with his selection of My Little Pony. Mr. Ferver, whose danced and spoken soliloquy makes up the second act, chose Catwoman in \u201cBatman Returns.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Ferver began his monologue by explaining that he was injured; two weeks ago in a rehearsal, he tore his calf muscle. His physical therapist, he said, advised him to imagine new choreography and, \u201cmost confining of all,\u201d to not travel forward. It\u2019s unclear to what extent this unexpected limitation shaped the work. But if \u201cEverything Is Imaginable\u201d feels fractured, its two acts inhabiting separate planes, that might be more intentional than accidental, reflecting the themes of isolation and self-fragmentation that come up in Mr. Ferver\u2019s largely autobiographical text.\n\nThe solos in Act 1 \u2014 Mr. Whiteside\u2019s ode to Garland; Mr. Knight\u2019s scything, devotional sequence of classic Graham vocabulary; Mr. Scribner\u2019s skating in socks to the sound of blades on ice; Mr. Bartelme\u2019s starry-eyed, mane-tossing embodiment of My Little Pony \u2014 build to a bacchanalian cross between a pas de deux and a nightclub orgy as the four dance together. When Act 2 begins, Jeremy Jacob\u2019s cartoonishly grandiose set \u2014 four columns and a fake chandelier framing the stage \u2014 has shrunken to dollhouse size. The petite Mr. Ferver, his back to the audience, towers over it. But what at first seems like his presiding powerfully over a world soon reads as his detachment from it. He is mostly alone, joined briefly by Mr. Bartelme in a duet to what sounds like a horror-movie score on repeat.\n\nAs he scoots and staggers through empty space, assuming deliberately awkward positions, recollections from his past pour forth. We hear about harassment by a high-school bully and a newspaper critic, the two conflated into one. Reality and illusion blur in stories of losing touch with himself and the people he loves.

The sexual tension in their relationship (Garc\u00eda Lorca was gay; Dal\u00ed didn\u2019t like to be touched) has been explored in books and in the 2008 film \u201cLittle Ashes,\u201d but the source that Ram\u00edrez Sansano cites are the letters (playful but not explicit) between the men.\n\nThe dance has none of the boldness of either artist. Yet it is a sincere portrait of tortured intimacy. At the start, each man (Chris Bloom as Garc\u00eda Lorca, Omar Rom\u00e1n De Jes\u00fas as Dal\u00ed) hesitates before walking through a door frame, and the remainder of the work maintains a jerky rhythm of emotional vacillation.\n\nIn Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s bedroom and then in Dal\u00ed\u2019s studio (where he paints as if engaging in mixed martial arts), the two men actually read letters, silently. That\u2019s not too exciting as drama, even if it leads to a kiss. The dance later finds poetic resonance, though, by setting a duet on a mat printed with script, as if the men were inside their letters. Garc\u00eda Lorca makes a move, and Dal\u00ed gives in but then resists: The dynamic repeats with diminishing returns, but the pathos of repression comes through.\n\nThe premieres aren\u2019t knockouts, and it\u2019s smart of the company to frame them with Annabelle Lopez Ochoa\u2019s stylish \u201cL\u00ednea Recta\u201d (2016) and especially with Michelle Manzanales\u2019s \u201cCon Brazos Abiertos\u201d (2017).

If the history play \u201cHenry V\u201d hasn\u2019t insinuated itself into popular culture as easily as some plays \u2014 hi, Hamlet! \u2014 it lends itself to carting around, however small the carpet swatch. It\u2019s a brisk and straightforward history play with a plot that doesn\u2019t do the twist.

Though the play isn\u2019t as on-the-nose jingoistic as some interpretations insist, it\u2019s still a provocative choice in a volatile political moment.\n\nWell, Mr. O\u2019Hara, who is also a playwright (\u201cBootycandy,\u201d \u201cBarbecue\u201d), doesn\u2019t mind provoking, but while he complicates the script in several ways, it takes a long time to figure out what he wants to do with it. The nine actors speak the prologue as a chorus, then spend the next 100 minutes running from one side of the room to the other, tugging on red accessories when they\u2019re playing the English and blue ones for the French. (Only a few costume pieces and props are used, and there\u2019s no set except for that carpet and a throne.)\n\nHaving the same actors play opposing sides undercuts our desire to cheer for the English, subverting the play\u2019s nationalism.

It was a performance that approached the piece as an insoluble, involving mystery, rather than as a familiar totem. In the first movement, Mr. Dudamel allowed some dynamic shifts to come seemingly out of nowhere \u2014 anticipating some of the finale\u2019s electrically strange transitions. The pulse of the scherzo was insistent in a nervy, exciting fashion that contrasted well with the luxurious way Mr. Dudamel lingered over the third movement\u2019s airier meditations.\n\nThe expressive wildness of the final movement was rousing. (Rarely does Beethoven\u2019s oddball interjection of bassoon sound more perfectly ingenious.) The vocal soloists didn\u2019t always sound ideally blended during some ensemble passages. But thanks to some powerful work from the Concert Chorale of New York, the overall journey toward a crashing climax had plenty of dramatic heft.\n\nEven better was Shostakovich\u2019s Fifth on Friday. The political commentary intended by its composer has long been a subject of speculation. Just how satirical is the Stalin-mandated triumphalism? How drearily compelled should it sound?\n\nThe Los Angeles players managed to subvert some of this dichotomy, opting for a \u201cboth-and\u201d style, rather than \u201ceither-or.\u201d There was some parodic parading in the second movement, reminiscent of acidic touches in Shostakovich\u2019s opera \u201cThe Nose.\u201d But Mr. Dudamel and his players brought out the sincere, deep feeling of Shostakovich\u2019s mournful Largo equally well. By the conclusion of the finale, it was possible to detect both genuine civic pride and the tragic political developments of its moment.\n\nWas it unfair to want more than this potent subtlety from the Philharmonic? It\u2019s only because of the quantity of singular events this orchestra engineers for Walt Disney Concert Hall, at home in Los Angeles, that I was left hoping that it had incorporated more of those tricks into the road show.

Mr. Wadsworth\u2019s staging is characteristically period-conscious, and balances the high stylization of Rameau\u2019s time \u2014 down to the grandeur of the gestural vocabulary \u2014 with the more casual naturalism of ours.\n\nIt was, as this repertory should be, restrained without a chill. The second act, in which Th\u00e9s\u00e9e is stranded in the underworld, is at Juilliard simultaneously poised, savage and persuasively sexy. (And there is a DVD of Jonathan Kent\u2019s 2013 production for the Glyndebourne Festival, set in and around a giant refrigerator, if you want something a bit more adventurous.)\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Mr. Wadsworth has been conscientious, a \u201cHippolyte\u201d staging would ideally share even more of Rameau\u2019s revolutionary, luxurious energy; Zack Winokur\u2019s choreography is particularly bland. But the modest sets, designed by Charlie Corcoran, are genuinely elegant, a reminder of how impressive painted backdrops can be, especially when sensitively lit \u2014 as, here, by David Lander. Those backdrops conjure the neoclassical obsession with ruins, the melancholy gaze on the past by artists like Piranesi and Hubert Robert.\n\nI seriously question the decision to cut the prologue, which establishes the opera\u2019s stakes by setting up a battle between Love and the chaste Diane that reaches the human realm in the form of Ph\u00e8dre\u2019s mad love for Hippolyte. Instead, Mr. Wadsworth has added a short, stodgy spoken introduction contrasting the chaste Diane and the lecherous, self-satisfied Th\u00e9s\u00e9e; perhaps the idea is to gently tug the opera into a #MeToo-ish battle of the sexes.\n\nThis start is echoed at the end. There, the bizarre interpolation of a slow, reflective instrumental excerpt from a later Rameau opera, \u201cLes Bor\u00e9ades,\u201d accompanies a tableau of the broken Th\u00e9s\u00e9e and the quietly triumphant Diane.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019m all for a reminder that the work\u2019s happy ending is coming at the expense of a man, once powerful, who has lost everything. But this doleful conclusion doesn\u2019t feel right for an opera that so daringly mixes tragedy and exhilaration, nor with Juilliard\u2019s stated desire to hew closely to Rameau\u2019s intentions.", "title": "Review: France Once Fought Over This Opera.

In 1975 they recorded the song \u201cLove to Love You Baby,\u201d which in a 17-minute, 22-orgasm dance mix became her first hit and made her world famous.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe story of Ms. Summer asking the two men to dim the lights and close their eyes while she writhes on the studio floor singing the hypersexed number is too good not to stage, and yet apparently not too good to stage poorly. The director Des McAnuff, who with Colman Domingo and Robert Cary also wrote the musical\u2019s book, skitters away from it after about 10 seconds, just as the show over all skitters away from almost everything even slightly awkward or troubling \u2014 and thus interesting \u2014 about Ms. Summer\u2019s life and career.\n\nIt totally botches, for instance, her relationship with the gay community, which instantly embraced her on the radio and the dance floor for reasons the show doesn\u2019t explore. Comments that Ms. Summer later made about God not creating \u201cAdam and Steve\u201d (let alone others she denied making about AIDS as a punishment for sin) left many gay men feeling betrayed \u2014 a betrayal they attributed to her resurgent Christianity.\n\nRather than dramatizing this fascinating conflict head on, the musical brushes it aside as an ancient misunderstanding and uses Ms. Summer\u2019s gay publicist as an alibi. (Singing \u201cFriends Unknown,\u201d she mourns his death to show she couldn\u2019t have been homophobic.) It does not even mention her 1979 announcement that she was born again; she sings \u201cI Believe in Jesus\u201d instead.\n\nSimilarly, \u201cSummer\u201d sketches years of sexual abuse by her pastor with little more than a leer, a shoehorned number (\u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d) and a few vague remarks. It\u2019s dramaturgy by song hook.\n\nAt the core of all of these missed opportunities is the split between Ms. Summer\u2019s manufactured image as a sex goddess and her self-image as a good girl. The musical makes its only stab at conceptual expressiveness by dividing Ms. Summer into three avatars to theatricalize that split: the mature Diva Donna (LaChanze), the young adult Disco Donna (Ariana DeBose) and, a bit desperately, the preteen Duckling Donna (Storm Lever).\n\nThis is hardly new. \u201cLennon\u201d gave us five John Lennons; \u201cThe Cher Show,\u201d scheduled to open on Broadway in December, has three title characters.

Occasionally, amid the chanting and banner waving, a fan will approach to praise Godard\u2019s early-60s movies like \u201cBreathless\u201d and \u201cContempt.\u201d The devolution of the director\u2019s response from awkward politeness to outright nastiness is a sign of his creative, ideological and emotional crisis.\n\nGodard wants to find an approach to filmmaking that will answer to his sense of political urgency, an insurgent cinema that will be adamantly critical of everything conventional and bourgeois. Nothing is easier, at present, than to mock this ambition, and much of the politicized art of the late \u201960s must have seemed na\u00efve, pretentious or overstated even at the time. But the notion that film might offer more than capitalist entertainment and reflect impulses beyond individual self-expression \u2014 that it might provide a weapon against oppression or a route to collective imagination \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. Godard\u2019s post-68 experiments, lazily evoked here as a dead end, could more productively be seen as a road not taken.\n\nThis version of Godard must choose between cinema and politics, a predicament that would be more credible if Mr. Hazanavicius had a credible conception of either term. As for love, the ostensible focus of the movie, it represents another squandered opportunity. No one would argue that Mr. Godard is a nice guy. Misanthropy has been part of his persona since his days as a film critic, and his biography is littered with broken friendships and burned bridges.

She loves her husband until he makes it impossible. He is narcissistic, professionally jealous and sexually possessive, freaking out when his wife is cast in an Italian movie that requires her to appear naked. His reaction leads to a scene in which Mr. Garrel and Ms. Martin, in their birthday suits, debate the ethics and aesthetics of on-camera nudity.

When we meet the teenage Joan as she begins her crusade to rout the English, her country is a collection of squabbling dukedoms, with the runty Dauphin, the late king\u2019s despised and uncrowned son, holed up in Touraine. (In Jane Greenwood\u2019s witty costumes, Adam Chanler-Berat looks like Little Lord Fauntleroy after a mugging.) To fulfill her vision of unification, Joan must first work her way into his court, then around his reluctance to take action.\n\nShaw structures \u201cSaint Joan\u201d as a picaresque chronicle: six scenes and an epilogue that mark turning points in Joan\u2019s life and reputation. The play is also picaresque as to genre, sampling theatrical styles along the way. It begins with light comedy, as Joan outwits or browbeats squires, soldiers, courtiers and even an archbishop into letting her have her way.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn these arguments \u2014 the whole play is argument \u2014 Ms. Rashad\u2019s Joan is always relaxed, never riled or cowed. She stares straight into the faces of her superiors, even the military captain (Patrick Page) who stands bare-chested in front of her, trying to intimidate her with machismo. He fails miserably as Joan twists his words to prove her points, all the while gesturing with just one hand as if using both would be wasteful.\n\nBut as is often the case with Shaw, fidelity to his intentions is not unequivocally good for productions of his plays. So although it\u2019s a relief to experience a phlegmatic instead of a violent Joan, it\u2019s also a perplexity because the choice robs her of psychology. A hero and genius she may be, but somehow also inert: not much different from a statue if it were blessed with leadership abilities.\n\nThat blank quality in Ms. Rashad\u2019s Joan leaches the play of drama as the scenes darken from comedy to adventure (she helps raise the successful Siege of Orl\u00e9ans) to pageant (the crowning of the Dauphin) to legal procedural. And if her calm perseverance suggests well enough how she manages to convince the king and the generals, it provides little evidence of how she could inspire the troops and, beyond them, the populace.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This makes the trial more dangerous, not less, because the ridiculous charges against her are so easily dismissed. We can take it as mere comic relief when the spectacularly dimwit assessors played by Robert Stanton and Maurice Jones keep saying that she is a witch, that she stole the Bishop\u2019s horse and, worst, that her voices speak in French instead of English.\n\nAs a result, her complete vulnerability to the graver charges of sedition, idolatry, disobedience, heresy and pride is more harshly revealed. She is fatally unprepared by her sincere innocence to understand the moral danger that the presiding Bishop (Walter Bobbie) and Inquisitor (Mr. Page, again) instruct her to acknowledge and that even her most sympathetic supporter, a liberal Dominican played powerfully by Max Gordon Moore, must beg her to resist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat danger is, in essence, presumption: \u201cWhat other judgment can I judge by but by my own?\u201d Joan asks, casually assuming supremacy over churchmen and kings. From this idea comes not only the necessary sentence of a perfectly fair proceeding but also, in the fullness of time, Protestantism, nationalism, individualism and, as Shaw would have it, the Great War, which had recently concluded as he started writing the play.\n\nThe brilliant scene in which he winds all of these ideas into a noose can hardly fail if it is done properly, and here it is a marvelous highlight. Mr. Page, never better, makes of his rumbling basso something that is somehow both terrifying and loving; he uses every theatrical trick in his arsenal to convince Joan to spare herself by recanting. And Ms. Rashad, as if the weight of her fate were only now hitting her, along with the weight of the play itself, finally explodes in emotion. It\u2019s devastating.\n\nPhoto\n\nI can\u2019t tell whether the withhold-and-release effect is deliberate; not much else about the production suggests a focus on the big picture. Certainly not Scott Pask\u2019s set, a phalanx of cheap-looking organ pipes that regroup to indicate different locales. Worse, they lead you to hope for thrilling toccatas and fugues when all you get from Bill Frisell\u2019s music is misty watercolor pop.\n\nNor does much that\u2019s thrilling emerge from most of the cast save Ms. Rashad and Mr. Page. Not that the characters aren\u2019t neatly defined \u2014 notably John Glover as the tart archbishop, Daniel Sunjata as Joan\u2019s comrade Dunois and Jack Davenport as the wheedling Earl of Warwick. But they all seem strangely conflict-averse as they promote or subvert the Maid among them. By the time you get to the surreal epilogue, it\u2019s as if they were in a low-stakes sitcom called \u201cOh That Joan!\u201d\n\nMr. Sullivan\u2019s deference to Shaw\u2019s anti-theatrical style is somewhat surprising from the director who gave us a blisteringly reframed (and successful) \u201cMerchant of Venice\u201d in 2010. But it does have the salutary feminist effect of highlighting competence instead of hysteria. If the production as a whole made up for the diminished dramatics with ample attention to its intellectual grandeur \u2014 as it does in the trial scene \u2014 it might even have seemed bracingly modern.\n\nInstead it just seems modest: surely the last thing any one ever accused Shaw or \u201cSaint Joan\u201d of being.", "title": "Review: In Shaw\u2019s \u2018Saint Joan,\u2019 a Sane and Sensible Martyr", "authors": ["Jesse Green"]}

Amid the introductions and sneers \u2014 the kidnapped C.I.A. agent has been taken by a very active, murderous terrorist group \u2014 some of the Americans give Mason the stink eye and a jittery C.I.A. operative (Rosamund Pike) settles in for perilous babysitting duties. (The fine supporting cast also includes Larry Pine, Shea Whigham and an appropriately unsettling Jonny Coyne.)\n\nThe director Brad Anderson adeptly handles the story\u2019s many parts, the dealing and dealers, the jittery car trips and late-night machinations. Some of this is very familiar, namely the white American abroad who, while navigating the churn of dangerously competing interests (largely American, Israeli and Palestinian), is unpacking a lot of personal baggage in a world that never comes into satisfying, humanizing focus. For the most part, the non-Israeli Middle Eastern characters (one exception is given a pulse by Idir Chender) are relegated to negligible roles. They\u2019re the anonymous passers-by, partygoers and guards overseeing the city\u2019s makeshift checkpoints with machine guns.\n\nThe absence of Arab voices beyond those of the terrorists further flattens a movie that never fully takes satisfying shape. Part of the problem is that the story keeps slinking away from politics, opting to poke around in American geopolitical self-interest while always returning to its protagonist, who\u2019s as much a casualty of that self-interest as a perpetrator. Mr. Hamm certainly makes it easy to care for Mason and all that he signifies, and it\u2019s a pleasure to watch him just silently nurse another drink, a lifetime of regret weighing on him. Yet as Mason sits alone, the shadows closing around him, you also catch sight of a character whose past \u2014 including a cozy association with Henry Kissinger \u2014 suggests a tougher, harder and more interesting movie than the one you are watching.", "title": "Review: In \u2018Beirut,\u2019 a War-Torn Backdrop for American Spy Games", "authors": []}

He and his friend are burned by bosses who think Amir (Ishaan Khattar) has gotten too bigheaded. (His offense: asking to be paid.) Running from cops, he finds his sister Tara (Malavika Mohanan) at a bazaar.

Hitting him with a brick to defend herself, Tara winds up in prison, where she, like all criminal suspects in this system, can be held without bail until a trial.

Even so, I wish the production, directed by Will Davis, achieved better control of its tone, which seems to wander wherever it wants instead of heading beelike toward its goal.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Davis makes the most of the small Black Box space, configured by the set designer Arnulfo Maldonado as an encompassing corn crib. Mr. Davis also does right by the play\u2019s moments of highest tension and emotion, neither pushing them toward unwarranted resolution nor batting them away. He thus keeps us engaged in the unanswerable questions it is a dramatist\u2019s job to pose. Why does grief work so differently in different lives? Why is life so impossible for some people?\n\nQuestions are not enough, of course. Plays are also about characters, and most of the ones in \u201cBobbie Clearly\u201d are too contradictory for the cast to act convincingly. That it survives the problem is largely thanks to Constance Shulman, recently seen to hilarious effect in \u201cBarbecue\u201d at the Public Theater and as Yoga Jones on \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Here she shines as Darla London, Milton\u2019s only police officer and, it appears, only sensible citizen.

Outside of the third hour, which covers the 1968 presidential campaign, he\u2019s a supporting player in the dramas of other people: his brother John, Joseph McCarthy, George Wallace, Martin Luther King Jr., Lyndon Johnson. The series often looks like a general social and political history of the 1960s that\u2019s only loosely tied to Kennedy.\n\nHe even gets elbowed aside by the former colleagues, friends and aides who make up the show\u2019s relatively small stable of interview subjects. Activists like the congressman John Lewis, Marian Wright Edelman and Dolores Huerta relate their experiences with Kennedy while we see them with him in the archival photos and film, looking like their glamorous younger selves.

The copious footage \u2014 including scenes from pioneering documentaries by Robert Drew like \u201cCrisis\u201d and \u201cPrimary\u201d \u2014 conveys Kennedy\u2019s seriousness, intelligence and, in the wake of John\u2019s 1963 assassination, overriding sense of melancholy.

By considering Jesus more as a cultural phenomenon than as a divine figure, and by exhibiting as much sympathy for Judas as for the man he betrayed, Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice delivered an interpretation of the Passion Play as radical in its way as director Martin Scorsese\u2019s much-protested film \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d did in 1988.\n\nNBC\u2019s version showed reverence primarily toward the original musical, which for decades has told an ancient story in a way that pushes the audience to reconsider its relevance to the world today. Directed by David Leveaux and Alex Rudzinski, it respected the source material\u2019s sublime ambiguities, which many nonreligious fans have interpreted as subversive \u2014 just as some pop-culture-savvy Christians have clung to it as a refreshingly tuneful, exultant expression of how faith can triumph over doubt.\n\nAs Jesus, Mr. Legend delivered where it counted, putting his rich, soulful voice to work in seamless performances of well-loved songs like \u201cEverything\u2019s Alright\u201d (in duet with the equally accomplished Ms. Bareilles) and \u201cGethsemane (I Only Want to Say).\u201d Mr. Legend was less impressive as an actor.

Given what \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d ultimately says about idols and the people in their shadow, it is appropriate that this production was dominated by a Broadway veteran best known for replacing Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr in the Tony-winning smash \u201cHamilton.\u201d This show has always been less about the titular \u201csuperstar\u201d than about the people surrounding him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But by urging the crowd to go bananas every time Mr. Legend sang or even moved, the creative team reinforced the idea that perhaps the masses gathered around Jesus weren\u2019t paying close attention to his actual message.\n\nThe set design and costuming were effectively minimalist, with a vaguely post-apocalyptic \u201cMad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\u201d feel. Exposed scaffolding, freshly painted graffiti and a teeming horde of shabby-looking extras added to the overall vibe of controlled chaos.\n\nThat mayhem occasionally gave way to moments of startling clarity, including: Alice Cooper\u2019s magnificently scenery-chewing performance of \u201cKing Herod\u2019s Song\u201d; Mr. Dixon\u2019s rousing take on the show\u2019s big anthem, \u201cSuperstar\u201d; and a miraculous bit of stagecraft during the crucifixion, in which Mr. Legend\u2019s Jesus seemed to disappear into another dimension.\n\nGive a lot of credit to the network, and to Mr. Legend, who was one of this broadcast\u2019s executive producers (along with Mr. Lloyd Webber, Mr. Rice, and the televised theater veterans Neil Meron, Marc Platt and Craig Zadan).

A male gender-studies student (Jonathon Ryan) and the casually bigoted university dean, along with the girls\u2019 brew-chugging boyfriends, are the well-meaning misogynists confused by the new reality, while the big donor Harry Stefani (pronounced cheekily close to Aristophanes) nefariously seeks to quash Liz\u2019s movement.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom the show-opening, tongue-in-cheek trigger warning to Liz\u2019s hashtag-branded revolution, \u201cms. estrada\u201d positions itself as a knowing response to the current moment with a decidedly millennial spin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even when the show\u2019s present-day updates are shrewd, its comic ideas are haphazardly flung about. \u201cIt\u2019s a show about feminism, there\u2019s a lot to unpack,\u201d one lyric goes, and it\u2019s true \u2014 too much, in fact.

The girl whose picture is briefly glimpsed might be his latest victim. An aura of dread and violence is summoned by the off-center images, the syncopations of the editing and the relentless hum and throb of Jonny Greenwood\u2019s score.\n\nBefore long we understand that Joe is a rescuer and avenger rather than a predator: a survivor of war and child abuse who now specializes in delivering young women from evil.

He is capable of gentleness \u2014 with his fragile, half-senile mother (Judith Roberts) and with Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), a girl he tries to save from sex traffickers \u2014 and also of ferocious cruelty, directed at himself and his targets. \u201cI hear you can be brutal,\u201d a potential client says.

His lines would probably fit on an index card, and none of them are especially memorable. But the sound of his breathing, his groans of frustration and his gasps of panic, his occasional squalls of weeping are hard to forget.

The theater itself is little more than a large studio, which gives the performances the unfancy atmosphere of a school recital, with the important distinction that the guy in charge is one of the greatest choreographers in the world.\n\nThis company can wow in opera houses, but performances at its home bring out some of its most valuable qualities. It\u2019s not just the intimacy, the chamber-music closeness to the appealing dancers and the excellent musicians who are always part of a Morris experience. It\u2019s the ethos of the place, the liberating conviction that an unpretentious, egalitarian attitude is completely compatible with the highest standards of elite musicianship and art.\n\nAccordingly, it\u2019s appropriate that the two programs this season seem modest. The single official world premiere is technically a half-premiere, and the other selections run mainly to small pieces and pieces made up of many small parts. The modesty is deceptive, though, for these same two programs encompass a nearly new knockout, a major revival and the kind of career-spanning variety that other companies save for big anniversary events.\n\nPhoto\n\nProgram A does commemorate a centennial, that of the composer Lou Harrison.

The flammability quotient here is never very high.\n\nBut if you\u2019re willing to forgive the absence of miracles, this \u201cSeafarer\u201d offers a lucid and straightforward reading of a play that seems to grow only richer with increased acquaintance.

Olivia is both bookish and feral, the kind of smart girl whose confusion has led to an adolescence filled with Allen Ginsberg and full-time pajamas.

We never learn what she does to get by \u2014 she may be an artist or a welder or both \u2014 or what really happened with Olivia\u2019s father. That he doesn\u2019t appear seems fair enough, but that he is vilified in absentia opens up questions the text isn\u2019t prepared to answer.\n\nAt other times it answers questions that didn\u2019t need to be asked. Though some of the women\u2019s adventures are pertinent to the theme \u2014 for an undocumented immigrant, a minor traffic stop quite naturally becomes an existential problem \u2014 too much time is turned over to diversions apparently meant to be distracting or, worse, heartwarming.\n\nSo in Skokie, Ill., mother and daughter meet a retired gay couple (Michael Mulheren and David Patrick Kelly) who are partway through their project of getting married in all 50 states.

And a side trip to Yellowstone National Park, where one of Olivia\u2019s blog followers is a junior ranger, is the kind of scene that is justified only by the authors\u2019 needs, not by the characters\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that the musical numbers arising from these detours fall flat. Ms. McKeown, a folk-rock artist who borrows liberally from many genres, has produced a full AM-FM spectrum of contextual styles, but for the most part they lack the structural underpinnings that let musical theater songs do the heavy work asked of them. The lyrics are too often wet and purple, with mushy off rhymes that are particularly problematic in up-tempo numbers (like the gay couple\u2019s \u201cMy Bell\u2019s Been Rung\u201d) that need the snap of precision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Rubin-Vega, with her rough charisma, and Ms. Jim\u00e9nez, with her youthful loveliness and blue-sky voice, generally make you forget all that.

Ms. deBessonet, the creator of the marvelous Public Works series and the director of a bubbly production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d at the Delacorte last summer, is usually expert at keeping tonal balance. Here she leans into rather than minimizes a tone that is often thick and even mawkish, a problem exacerbated by a physical production (by the set designer Riccardo Hernandez) that feels harshly minimal and \u2014 until a powerful, on-the-nose gesture at the end \u2014 too vague.\n\nIt may be that \u201cMiss You Like Hell,\u201d which evolved from Ms. Hudes\u2019s 2009 drama \u201c26 Miles\u201d and had its premiere as a musical at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2016, just needs more time.

{"date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "Whatever the combination of all the above, Mr. Domingo didn\u2019t stop. Having naturally lost flexibility in his high notes, and no longer able to convincingly portray boyish lovers, he moved into the baritone repertory, specifically the brooding patriarchs of Verdi: Simon Boccanegra, Nabucco, Rigoletto, Germont in \u201cLa Traviata.\u201d\n\nAnd now, at the Met through April 21, Miller in the underrated \u201cLuisa Miller,\u201d a relative rarity but passionate and full of arresting experiments in structure and sonority, a gateway to Verdi\u2019s breakthrough works of the early 1850s (\u201cRigoletto,\u201d \u201cIl Trovatore,\u201d \u201cTraviata\u201d). The Met hasn\u2019t put on \u201cLuisa\u201d in over a decade \u2014 and not this excitingly since well before that.\n\nWhat Mr. Domingo is doing is not atypical. It\u2019s unprecedented in opera history. For him to be even credibly appearing in leading parts on the world\u2019s major stages, and adding new ones each year, is as if Roger Federer, today already an ancient champion at 36, were still winning Wimbledon a decade from now.\n\nMr. Domingo\u2019s baritonal period hasn\u2019t been conflict-free; he\u2019s been dogged by polite suggestions and outright calls to give it all up. But he has turned out not to be experimenting or dabbling. It\u2019s been over 10 years. And there remain things to be skeptical about.\n\nPhoto\n\nLarge swaths of his voice are still uncannily preserved, but the low part crucial to a baritone\u2019s range tends to grow vague for him. And in fast music, that part in particular turns blustery and cloudy, making Mr. Domingo sound awkward in, for example, Miller\u2019s big cabaletta, \u201cAh! fu giusto,\u201d which should be an early showstopper.\n\nAt the start of the finale to the first act, Miller \u2014 a sturdy retired soldier whose country-girl daughter tragically seeks to marry above her station \u2014 indignantly says that an innocent like Luisa shouldn\u2019t have to bow before a powerful man, but only before God. The steadiness and magnetism of this line are key to establishing the opera\u2019s stakes \u2014 so those stakes suffer a bit when Miller delivers it, as Mr. Domingo did, without evenness or glamour.\n\nBut on Thursday, he eventually warmed and settled, his voice taking on increased presence if not ideally hale glow. \u201cLuisa Miller\u201d plays on one of Verdi\u2019s favorite themes: the conflict between romantic and filial love \u2014 or, depending on how you look at it, between romantic love and filial obsession.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Domingo brings out a father\u2019s concern and pain more than his obsession. He is a straightforward singer, as he always has been, with straightforward feelings. His relationship with Luisa doesn\u2019t have much complexity, but it has earnestness and poignancy.\n\nHis voice sounds healthy; he moves with fluency. If he\u2019ll never be a true Verdi baritone, and always an aging tenor in baritone\u2019s clothing, it is still a display not to be missed: someone of Mr. Domingo\u2019s stage of life taking on a new Verdi role at a great opera house and doing himself no small degree of honor with it. You almost don\u2019t believe your eyes or ears.\n\nThat this implausible achievement isn\u2019t this revival\u2019s main attraction speaks to the quality of the performance. Sonya Yoncheva, also new to her role, seems more comfortable as Luisa than she did as Tosca at the Met this winter. The clear, smoothly slicing quality of her soprano makes special impact in this opera, in which Luisa stands out in a field of dark male voices.\n\nMs. Yoncheva has imagined the character as less innocent than spunky and sensual. When her lover, Rodolfo, enters to kill her in the final act \u2014 she\u2019s trapped in a lie of betrayal that she thinks will save her father \u2014 she seems unsurprised, as if she\u2019d expected him to come: There is always a sense of fatalism, of death calmly awaited, in Ms. Yoncheva\u2019s portrayals.\n\nPiotr Beczala, in yet another role debut, gave the rash Rodolfo his trademark poise and elegance. There\u2019s little traditional Italian-tenor wildness in Mr. Beczala (for that, check out Vittorio Grigolo, at the Met in \u201cLucia di Lammermoor\u201d) but he brings ample heat as the plot thickens.\n\nThe bass Alexander Vingradov made a fine Met debut as Count Walter, Rodolfo\u2019s father, sonorously and suavely balancing this intriguing character\u2019s combination of sympathy and violence. (Think Claudius in \u201cHamlet.\u201d) In one of Verdi\u2019s ingenious inventions, he combined beautifully in a rare bass-bass duet with Dmitry Belosselskiy, imposingly oily as the malevolent Wurm.\n\nThe warm-toned mezzo-soprano Olesya Petrova (as Federica, the noblewoman who loves Rodolfo) meets her role\u2019s most important requirement: She strides commandingly down the gigantic staircase of Santo Loquasto\u2019s sturdily old-fashioned set. Rihab Chaieb sounded fresh and youthful as the village girl Laura.\n\nLeading a spirited performance, the conductor Bertrand de Billy was a replacement for James Levine, fired by the Met last month amid accusations of sexual misconduct. This revival was to have been a special reunion: Mr. Domingo and Mr. Levine\u2019s first collaboration here was \u201cLuisa Miller\u201d in 1971. (Mr. Domingo, back then, sang Rodolfo.)\n\nAs it happened, this tenor-improbably-turned-baritone was forced to return to the opera on his own. He did it in memorable style.", "title": "Review: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Takes On a New Role at the Met Opera. (His 149th.)", "authors": ["Zachary Woolfe"]}

Having shown us individuals fixated on the screens in their hands rather than on other people around them, the piece concludes by projecting a sentence that says recent studies link an increase in teenage suicides to hand-held personal devices. (No suicide seemed to happen in the choreography.) Jean-Marc Puissant\u2019s d\u00e9cor shows images of distant trees, as if the action occurred in a public park.\n\nAt times, the compositional skills that Mr. Wheeldon shows with ensembles and solos in \u201cBound To\u201d seem unsurpassable. Apart from his long-established gifts with patterns and steps, he has recently developed a sense of fluent expressionist gesture (evident in his full-length 2014 ballet \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale,\u201d danced by the Royal Ballet and National Ballet of Canada). Long passages in the male solos, for Angelo Greco in \u201cWavelength\u201d and for Lonnie Weeks in \u201cTrying to Breathe,\u201d show how eloquently he can construct dances that unfold compellingly as both formal choreography and expression.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wheeldon has given himself two particular challenges here: a few ensembles of same-sex couples (something he has seldom, if ever, tackled); and exclusive use of soft-shoe footwork (thus avoiding any of the sublimity that pointwork can bring to ballet). He passes both assignments easily. I wish, though, he would give himself a third challenge: to make duets in which the two people are not involved in constant physical contact and partnering.\n\nAnd his thought becomes labored when he keeps hammering home how some people need to keep staring at their portable screens: notably a pas de deux for Yuan Yuan Tan (staring at hers) and Carlo Di Lanno (trying to fit in). The ballet is accompanied by Matt Naughtin\u2019s commissioned orchestration of work by the English folk-rock musician Keaton Henson; it\u2019s not hard music to listen to, but Mr. Wheeldon\u2019s response leads me no deeper than its surface.\n\nThe program ends with Mr. Peck\u2019s \u201cHurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming.\u201d This ensemble work is set to electronic music by M83 (Anthony Gonzalez, Yann Gonzalez, Bradley Laner and Justin Meldal-Johnsen) \u2014 a score I would otherwise resist, but Mr. Peck draws me into it.\n\nIt could be seen as a companion to \u201cThe Times Are Racing,\u201d a hit Peck creation in 2017 for New York City Ballet set to Dan Deacon music. As in that, the mood here is urban, with the dancers all in sneakers and an assortment of street wear (by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung); whereas that dance was made from tap and pedestrian movement, this one features two duets whose fluent phraseology and stretched lines owe far more to ballet. As in Mr. King\u2019s \u201cCollective Agreement,\u201d these duets \u2014 beauties both \u2014 are deliberately contrasted: Sarah Van Patten and Luke Ingham are impersonally harmonious, while Dores Andr\u00e9 and Wei Wang are shown as separate beings whose meetings are part of independent lives.\n\nMr. Ingalls\u2019s lighting for \u201cHurry Up\u201d includes, in the group sections, amber lights directed at the audience. Even though there is no glare, it\u2019s an alienating effect. Though the \u201cHurry Up\u201d duets emerge from a social context, it\u2019s not one that makes a clear impression.

Mr. Stoppard possesses the enthusiasm of an eternal student, both arrogant about what he knows and humble about what he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThis sensibility is filtered through the backward-looking perspective of good old Carr (based on a real person), a thoroughly middle-class British consul who claims to have been in Zurich at a magic moment when Joyce (Peter McDonald), Tzara (Seth Numrich) and Lenin (Dan Butler) were all in residence. Carr is in his dressing gown and his dotage when we first meet him, thinking up ways to transform this improbable slice of history into a book.\n\nJoyce \u2014 who is working on his novel \u201cUlysses\u201d \u2014 and Lenin \u2014 nearing the end of his exile from Russia \u2014 can be found in the Zurich library, along with Lenin\u2019s wife, Nadya (Opal Alladin). Tzara, chief exponent of the art of poetic anarchy, is there, too, because he has a crush on Joyce\u2019s assistant, Gwendolen (Scarlett Strallen). Overseeing, and regularly shushing, the others is a librarian, one Cecily Cardew (Sara Topham).\n\nGwendolen and Cecily are the names of the rivalrous heroines of Wilde\u2019s \u201cEarnest.\u201d And much of the dialogue in \u201cTravesties\u201d takes its cues from that masterpiece of elegant absurdism. You see, Joyce is involved in a local production of \u201cEarnest.\u201d He recruits Carr to appear in it as Algernon. The collaboration ends badly, because of an altercation over the cost of Carr\u2019s costumes.\n\nThe elderly Carr doffs his bathrobe to become his younger self to participate in his encounters with the others, who also include his manservant, Bennett (Patrick Kerr), who harbors revolutionary sympathies. Many of the scenes are enacted in several variations, as history stops and starts and never exactly repeats itself.\n\nOur leading men face off in duels of words about the purpose and nature of art. Carr, a Gilbert and Sullivan fan, takes the conventional bourgeois view of it as a collection of worthy monuments. Lenin has no use for art, though his wife describes him as being unnervingly moved by a Beethoven sonata. Tzara, the Dadaist, is a desecrater of traditional art, and is seen cutting up a sonnet by Shakespeare into a bowler hat, the better to randomly reassemble its words.\n\nThe hat belongs to Joyce, who later pulls a rabbit out of it.

Her fluency and expressiveness make the English speakers around her seem, as one of them actually calls her, dumb.\n\nPhoto\n\nPerhaps the novelty of that idea helped to make the original Broadway production of \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d which opened in 1980, a hit. Today its dramaturgy seems creaky, even when the argument is crackling.\n\nNaturally, the conceit of the play requires Sarah, who now works at the school as a custodian, to face a persuasive combatant in the form of her latest teacher, James. Rather less naturally, it requires her to fall in love with him.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it: James is not only a fan of spoken English, but also a fan of his own voice. He\u2019s glib and lordly and \u2014 giving credit to a lovely performance by Joshua Jackson \u2014 charming, too. He almost makes you forget that he\u2019s browbeating Sarah into the denial of something she sees as a central, positive element of her personhood.\n\nTo her, as to many deaf people today, deafness is an identity, not a defect or a curse imposed by a lesser god. (The play\u2019s title comes from Tennyson\u2019s poem \u201cIdylls of the King.\u201d) And for Sarah, if not Orin (who speaks and lip-reads), sign language is the unique expression of that identity.\n\nAt least on the page, \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d seems skeptical of Sarah\u2019s conviction, painting her refusal to speak as a form of hysteria, with abuse and cold parenting in the background. (Her mother is played, implacably, by Kecia Lewis.)\n\nBut Ms. Ridloff\u2019s blistering performance, like Phyllis Frelich\u2019s in the original and Marlee Matlin\u2019s in the 1986 movie, contradicts that skepticism. We see in front of us that A.S.L. is not just a different language, but also a different way of thinking in which \u201cveal\u201d might be rendered as \u201ccowbaby\u201d and change the way you feel about it.

Dialogue that seems banal in English \u2014 as the production\u2019s supertitles frequently make plain \u2014 is as gorgeous and physical as sculpture when signed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn any case, the story no longer reads, if it ever did, as simply the conflict between a smug hearing person and a defensive deaf one.

Along with her husband, Shaun Bengson, she has written the music and lyrics for \u201cThe Lucky Ones,\u201d and, with Sarah Gancher, its book. Their approach to the function of music in a musical is eclectic: It is sometimes simply presentational, as in a concert, sometimes narrative, sometimes (as with the use of hymns and folk songs) diegetic and sometimes a blend of all three.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis works quite well in the first part of the show, before the intermission, as I imagine it did in an earlier autobiographical Bengsons work, \u201cHundred Days,\u201d about the first months of the couple\u2019s marriage. \u201cThe Lucky Ones,\u201d directed by Anne Kauffman, has a bigger cast and a hard-working ensemble (choreographed by Sonya Tayeh) to characterize the family and school community in small bites of song and recitative that get passed around like hors d\u2019oeuvres. Myra Lucretia Taylor as Ms. Bengson\u2019s mother, Ashley P\u00e9rez Flanagan as her sister Emily and Maryann Plunkett as her aunt do especially fine work making these archetypes specific.\n\nBut the story gradually focuses on Ms. Bengson\u2019s cousin Kai (Damon Daunno) and Emma (Adina Verson), the new girl at school. (The names of almost all the characters, as well as some details of the plot and setting, have been altered.) Kai is the cool, questing stoner everyone crushes on; Emma is the wounded bird he finally falls for. Naturally, his family being so accepting and oblivious, they embrace the relationship even as it becomes clear that Kai is losing his grip.\n\nBoth Mr. Daunno and Ms. Verson are excellent, he pulsating with over-the-top teenage excitement, she shyly blinking in the glow of her good fortune. But as the first part of the show drags into the second, and nearly comes to a standstill in the third, the material falls out from under them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The music, played by Abigail and Shaun \u2014 along with their band mates Dani Markham on drums and Pearl Rhein on keyboards, fiddle and accordion \u2014 has a pleasantly droning quality that forestalls harmonic development. The ruminative, repetitive lyrics similarly stunt the drama.\n\nAnd then, too, the tale and its manner of telling take strange turns after the intermission, including a leap into the Bengsons\u2019 own romance and a long section created from what we are told are verbatim transcripts of interviews with the family years after the events described. That these detours give the cast a chance to polish its naturalism does not make them useful in creating the feeling of a unified work. It\u2019s a musical, after all.\n\nMs. Kauffman\u2019s astute staging in the unusual Connelly space \u2014 it was once an orphans\u2019 choir hall \u2014 does what it can to jury-rig a feeling of depth. She has an uncanny way of layering action, in this case not only within the proscenium but also in the former choir loft behind the audience. And Ms. Tayeh\u2019s gestural dance language also supports the idea that something big and emotional is happening here.\n\nBut the storytelling is as yet too impulsive, and at times too self-indulgent, to be corralled in those ways. Perhaps with strong parenting \u201cThe Lucky Ones\u201d will one day emerge more successfully, as \u201cHundred Days\u201d did after a long development period.

On its opening two nights, Thursday and Friday, viewers were rewarded with an encore in which Mr. Forsythe, a sprightly 68, came onstage for a brief, carefree boogie.\n\nIt was a coup for Tamara Rojo, artistic director of English National Ballet, to secure this commission, Mr. Forsythe\u2019s first creation for a British company in more than 20 years. It was presented on a program, \u201cVoices of America\u201d (through April 21), with works by Jerome Robbins and Aszure Barton, and another recent piece by Mr. Forsythe.\n\nMr. Forsythe built his reputation by breaking the mold of classical ballet while remaining embedded in its tradition. When he began choreographing in the 1980s, he was vilified as much as praised for his exactingly physical and often highly intellectualized experiments. But Mr. Forsythe was soon in demand from ballet companies around the world, eager for a revitalizing shot of innovation. After a period in which he worked on a smaller scale and in a contemporary dance idiom, he has recently returned to the classical style that he considers his home ground.\n\nBut he remains a mold breaker. \u201cPlaylist\u201d looks as if Mr. Forsythe had asked himself what was the one most powerful force in dance today, and answered: hip-hop. Wisely, he does not imitate it, but lets its spirit infuse the choreography. In the opening scene \u2014 or \u201ctrack\u201d \u2014 the 12 dancers in the all-male cast are put through their classical paces, first in a series of formal poses, then in flashy sequences of beaten jumps and turning circles.

A look at recent trends in where graduates of top M.B.A. programs go to work reflects this increasing antipathy toward large firms.\n\nUntil recently, upward of 60 percent of graduates from top M.B.A. programs headed to investment banking or management consulting jobs. Nowhere has the decline in the attractiveness of these industries to M.B.A.s been starker than my alma mater, Stanford Business School, where only 1 percent of the most recent graduating class went into investment banking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGiven that Stanford is in the heart of Silicon Valley, it should be neither surprising nor worrisome that today almost as many graduates decide to start their own company as those who go into consulting (20 percent).\n\nBut the preference for small business extends well beyond Stanford. At a recent symposium of leading business schools held at Columbia Business School, the dean of Harvard\u2019s Business School revealed that 60 percent of its graduates now elect to work for companies with no more than a few hundred employees. This shift toward smaller companies as employers of preference seems to be encouraged by the business schools themselves.

It plays fair with the viewer, and among fans of its genre, it has a rabid following.\n\nDeveloped for television by Eric Overmyer from novels by Michael Connelly, the show accommodates the modern serial drama\u2019s requirements for psychology and back story. Bosch\u2019s daughter and ex-wife are significant characters, and the unsolved murder of his mother (with its echoes of the Black Dahlia case) continues to haunt him in Season 4.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "I admit that I approached \u201cChappaquiddick\u201d with a measure of skepticism and a tremor of dread. The ongoing, morbid fascination with all things Kennedy is an aspect of American culture I find perplexing and somewhat dispiriting. Compulsive Kennedyism encourages our unfortunate habit of substituting mythology for history, of dissolving the complexities of American political life into airy evocations of idealism and tragedy. The lives and deaths of Kennedy family members provide grist for endless conspiracy theorizing, tabloid salaciousness, celebrity-worship and superstition. A movie about one of the sadder, tawdrier episodes in the saga could only feed this syndrome.\n\nBut it turns out that \u201cChappaquiddick,\u201d directed by John Curran from a script by the first-timers Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, is more diagnosis than symptom. Forsaking sensationalism for sober, procedural storytelling, the film examines the toxic effects of the Kennedy mystique on a handful of people involved in a fatal car crash in the summer of 1969.\n\nThe basic facts are hardly obscure. Late on the night of July 18, an Oldsmobile driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy ran off a bridge on an island near Martha\u2019s Vineyard and plunged into a pond. Mary Jo Kopechne, a former aide to the senator\u2019s brother Robert, died inside the car. Kennedy waited until the next day to report the incident and provided an account that was, to put it mildly, less than fully credible.\n\nExactly what happened remains unknown, and the gaps and ambiguities in the record provide the filmmakers with room for speculation and embellishment. (A recent article by Jenna Russell in The Boston Globe performs a sensitive and thorough fact-check.) In this version, Kopechne (played by Kate Mara) stays alive while trapped in the car, fighting for air as Kennedy (Jason Clarke) dawdles. Nothing beyond a close collegial friendship between them is implied. They were drawn together by shared grief over the death of Robert Kennedy, who had been assassinated the year before, and left a party together for a heart-to-heart talk.", "title": "Review: \u2018Chappaquiddick\u2019 Revisits a Grim \u201960s Kennedy Scandal", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nOne of the quiet charms of \u201cDuck Butter,\u201d a sweetly funny, sometimes tough little movie about a woman on a journey into self, is how its modest scale works in its favor. Directed by Miguel Arteta, it mostly takes place over a single day and night, and not much happens by conventional movie standards. Two strangers hook up and, while giddily enjoying their postcoital high, decide to try to cram an entire relationship \u2014 a world of togetherness \u2014 into the next 24 hours. So they talk, eat, drink and talk some more, regularly taking time out to turn each other on.\n\nNaima (Alia Shawkat) and Sergio (Laia Costa) have sex every which way, in bed and out, in clothes and out, swept away by desire. They also share other parts of themselves, willingly but also inadvertently \u2014 and not necessarily in sync. One cuts loose; the other raises an emotional barrier. Letting it all hang out proves easy for Sergio, a sublimely untalented singer whose free-spirited ways can feel calculated, as when she calms down (and delights) a hostile audience by kissing surprised female patrons. Given that Naima sleeps with her arms crossed and fists clenched, it seems as if she might be immune to Sergio\u2019s charismatic offensive. Not a chance.\n\nVideo\n\nYou might find yourself more resistant to Sergio\u2019s enthusiasms despite Ms. Costa\u2019s energetically earnest performance. Much depends on your tolerance for excitable personalities like Sergio who eagerly turn life into self-aggrandizing drama, as if living their personal truth entails punctuating every sigh and statement with exclamation points. \u201cI want to know you, for real,\u201d Sergio tells Naima while they\u2019re cooking up their 24-hour pact. Someone less stoned on sex might have wondered what \u201cfor real\u201d means, might have hit pause. But Naima is wowed and flattered and \u2014 as we gradually learn \u2014 she has a need that she can\u2019t yet express, even to herself.\n\nThere\u2019s always a danger when a movie effectively locks you up with two characters so that you experience their every hot breath in squirming, claustrophobic intimacy (like in \u201cBug\u201d and \u201cRoom\u201d). If you don\u2019t fall in love with at least one of the two, your attention can spiral into impatience or stray into indifference. There\u2019s little chance of that in \u201cDuck Butter\u201d because of Ms. Shawkat, an intensely appealing performer who\u2019s a veteran of the TV series \u201cArrested Development.\u201d In a show crowded with genius, Ms. Shawkat always manages to stand out, partly because you can always see her working the angles even when comically flailing. The same holds true here.\n\nIn \u201cDuck Butter,\u201d Ms. Shawkat \u2014 who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Arteta \u2014 creates a character whose consciousness lurches into existence one modest and momentous encounter at a time. Naima labors (struggles) as an actress, and the story clicks in on her first day on an indie production (alongside an amusing Kumail Nanjiani and Lindsay Burdge) being directed by Mark and Jay Duplass. Appearing as themselves, the Duplasses drop in only briefly, but they make a sly, barbed impression \u2014 and give the movie a sharp meta-moment \u2014 as professional nice guys whose chill vibe instantly evaporates when Naima, with a supreme lack of self-awareness, challenges their authority.\n\nMuch of \u201cDuck Butter\u201d takes place after Naima\u2019s humiliating experience working with the Duplasses. She more or less runs straight into Sergio\u2019s arms, which can be read as a metaphor for female self-reliance (with tinges of panic and fear) or appreciated as a bit of storytelling expediency. Ms. Shawkat, who also has an executive producer credit here, has appeared in her share of indie productions. She and Mr. Arteta, a sensitive observer of life\u2019s everyday churn (his credits include \u201cBeatriz at Dinner\u201d), do some lovely work in a movie that reminds you that sometimes all you need in realist fiction is a glimpse into another person\u2019s being \u2014 but with heart and intelligence, good craft and technique.", "title": "Review: \u2018Duck Butter\u2019 and the 24-Hour \u2018for Real\u2019 Relationship", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Miguel Arteta", "Alia Shawkat"]}
{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "Professor Satia examines these changes not only across time but across cultures. Although much of this exploration is fascinating, the detail can be numbing. Tracking the exhaustive catalog of Quaker family intermarriages and gun part transactions that characterized the 18th-century armaments trade, for instance, is quite a slog.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of \u201cEmpire of Guns,\u201d however, is how little detail there is on the history of gun culture in the United States and its deep hostility to government regulation. The contrast with Britain \u2014 and, indeed, all other developed nations \u2014 is so striking that it begs for some kind of explanation, particularly given that Britain was historically more economically reliant on this sector of its economy.\n\nAlthough Professor Satia does include a discussion of the role of guns from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the Revolutionary War, she focuses on the use of guns in the colonists\u2019 interactions with Native Americans and various competing European powers. In the last pages of the book, she does include a critique of the historical myths underpinning the sweeping 2008 Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The short discussion is provocative but seems disconnected from her writing on colonial life, which didn\u2019t mention early state gun regulation or the Second Amendment at all: \u201cThe Second Amendment was not about protecting Americans from federal government [gun] seizure; it addressed the practical danger that militias might be disarmed by federal inaction, providing reassurance that if the federal government neglected to arm the militias, state governments might do so.\u201d\n\nUnder this view of the framers\u2019 intent, the \u201cissue was not self-defense, but national defense.\u201d Even if Professor Satia is correct about the problem originally targeted by the Second Amendment, \u201cEmpire of Guns\u201d provides few clues as to how or why the focus has shifted so drastically in America over the ensuing centuries.\n\nDespite mounting a vigorous public defense, Mr. Galton was ultimately unsuccessful in escaping rebuke from the Quakers. Many of the arguments he proffered have parallels to those made by contemporary gun rights advocates. Professor Satia has shown how the revolutionary changes in the very nature of guns and their role in society and the economy require those arguments to be considered in a very different light. To do that effectively at this time of national debate over our political, social and moral relationship to the modern gun, more work must be done to fully understand the source of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d when it comes to our attitudes toward guns.", "title": "Review: \u2018Empire of Guns\u2019 Challenges the Role of War in Industrialization", "authors": []}

Season 2 begins Tuesday with the agonized cries of Pablo Picasso\u2019s mother as she gives birth to the great artist. The background music of male genius, apparently, is female screaming.\n\nThe Einstein season of \u201cGenius\u201d drew more attention than anyone expected for a costume drama on the National Geographic Channel, including 10 Emmy nominations. The production values were surprisingly high and Geoffrey Rush was, not surprisingly, fun to watch as the older Einstein.

(Someone should feel free to make either or both of those.) \u201cBloodlight and Bami\u201d is all v\u00e9rit\u00e9. The director Sophie Fiennes began filming Ms. Jones in the mid-2000s and simply observes her on stage and off. She follows her home to Jamaica, where the diva mellows, almost unconsciously, into a daughter, sister and parishioner. She watches her record her 2008 album \u201cHurricane\u201d and become a grandmother.\n\nThere\u2019s a trip to church where Ms. Jones\u2019s brother, Noel, preaches and her mother sings \u201cHis Eye Is on the Sparrow.\u201d There\u2019s a night spent clubbing. Ms. Jones was in her mid-50s when the movie finds her and turns 70 next month. So for someone whose hits include the 1981 masterpiece of metaphor, \u201cPull Up to the Bumper,\u201d and who was a fixture at New York\u2019s Studio 54, her partying seems less like a splurge and more like a form of exercise.\n\nMs. Fiennes makes the same investment in Ms. Jones that she\u2019s made in the artist Anselm Kiefer and twice with the cultural philosopher Slavoj Zizek. This new movie isn\u2019t as handsome or haunting as those. A lot of it feels caught on the fly. But Ms. Fiennes\u2019 rigor operates in a different, more intimately transparent way. She enjoys Ms. Jones and her big, complicated family but is careful not to insert herself \u2014 or too much technique, for that matter \u2014 into family meals and various reminiscences between, say, Grace and a niece. Ms. Fiennes deploys her effects strategically, like for that night life sequence, which unfolds in slow-motion and without natural sound. Ms. Jones is at her most vampiric but also her most free.\n\nWe\u2019re not given any kind of chronology. We\u2019re left to guess about what year it is or what city the shows are in. But concepts of time, space and location might actually be besides the point when your movie stars a Grace Jones who\u2019s determined to look inward the way she does on \u201cHurricane,\u201d the most obviously personal and autobiographical of her albums. There\u2019s a long, lovely passage built around the conjuring, recording and live performance of the song \u201cThis Is.\u201d And we watch Ms. Jones ruminate about the source of all that scariness and intimidation in her stage persona. It\u2019s her abusive stepfather, and he\u2019s got a hold on her still. This particular return to Jamaica appears to have stirred up a lot for her.\n\nMs. Fiennes shrewdly juxtaposes all of that inner work with its outward expression, moving from conversations to concerts. At the shows, the camera is positioned from a distance that lets you take in all of Ms. Jones, whether she\u2019s hula-hooping or stalking around the stage, in headdresses, helmets and masks. That low voice only seems to have gained power, weight and complexity. And the high point of experiencing the full of psychological effect might be during a performance of \u201cWarm Leatherette,\u201d a crashing, revved up rock song with a dance undergirding. Ms. Jones does it wearing a velvety bathing suit and a glittering mask while wielding a pair of giant cymbals that look a lot like shields.", "title": "Review: \u2018Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami\u2019 Finds the Model, Singer, Actress, Person", "authors": []}

Yet I mean it as the highest praise when I say that the show doesn\u2019t look expensive.\n\nOr rather, it seems expensive only in the way of a custom-made little black dress, one with endless tricks up its deceptively simple sleeves. \u201cCursed Child,\u201d which has a deeply symbiotic cast of 40, shimmers with beguiling richness, but you\u2019re never conscious of its seams or the effort that\u2019s gone into the making of it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis effect is evident as soon as you step into the lobby of the Lyric Theater, which has been transformed from a too big, ungainly show barn into a cozy yet sumptuously appointed environment that seems to have been exactly as it is for many, many years. On the stage, open for your inspection, looms the vaulted central hall of Harry Potter\u2019s alma mater, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nThis stately mansion is the work of the ace set designer Christine Jones and has been shrouded in beckoning, velvety and inventively concealing shadows by Neil Austin\u2019s lighting. The scenery at this point consists mostly of suitcases and trunks. But watch out for the gliding staircases that will soon become a crucial part of the mise en sc\u00e8ne.\n\nLuggage and staircases are appropriate motifs for a show that turns out to be all about traveling, in the broadest sense of the word, and unpacking the conflicted feelings that are part and parcel of the long-distance journey of growing up. Overseeing everything from above, like an inescapable eye, is a palely glowing clock.\n\nBeneath this formidable timepiece, a series of scenes melt into one another, approximating cinematic cross-cutting, while managing to feel both epic and intimate. The story begins where the final novel in the Potter series, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d ended.\n\nHarry (an irresistibly anxious Jamie Parker) is an adult now (which doesn\u2019t mean he has entirely grown up), employed by the Ministry of Magic, which is run by his old school chum (and partner in fighting the forces of darkness), Hermione Granger (the marvelous Noma Dumezweni). Harry and his wife, Ginny (Poppy Miller), are seeing their sons off to school from King\u2019s Cross Station in London.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt will be the first year at Hogwarts for their younger boy, Albus (Sam Clemmett), who is understandably ambivalent about going to the place where his student father became \u201cthe most famous wizard in the whole world.\u201d Hermione and her prankster husband, Ron Weasley (Paul Thornley, delightful) are there, too, with their daughter, Rose (Susan Heyward).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso on the platform: the platinum-haired Draco Malfoy (Alex Price), once Harry\u2019s sinister rival, and his nerdy son, Scorpius (Anthony Boyle, who leads with his adenoids in a show-stealing performance). Scorpius and Albus are destined to bond, both as outcasts in the young wizarding world and as allies in a quest that may lead them into the realms once occupied by the ultimate dark lord, Voldemort.\n\nTheir insular friendship, which opens up enough to include a determined young woman named Delphi Diggory (Jessie Fisher), will be sorely tested, as will their contentious relationships with their dads. And yes, the script has more variations on father issues than the entire canon of Greek tragedy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(In this sense, her fiction resembles that of Stephen King.) And this show more than honors that dichotomy.\n\nThat everyone who sees \u201cCursed Child\u201d is implored to \u201ckeep the secrets\u201d relieves me of the onerous burden of parsing the byzantine but only occasionally tedious plot. Those who have read the Potter novels, or seen the blockbuster film adaptations, should not feel that the carefully appointed logic of Ms. Rowling\u2019s fictional prototype has been violated.\n\nThe uninitiated may be confused when the mere mention of certain names (Dolores Umbridge, Neville Longbottom) draws gasps from the audience. But I can\u2019t imagine anyone ultimately not feeling strangely at home within the show\u2019s magical flux.\n\nThis state of enchantment is sustained through Steven Hoggett\u2019s balletic movement direction of the large ensemble and Katrina Lindsay\u2019s wittily transformative costumes. Working with Ms. Jones and Jamie Harrison (credited with illusions and magic), they summon an alternate universe of a world gone fascist, for the show\u2019s darkest and most uneasily topical sequences. And do watch out for the phantasmal Dementors.\n\nThe leading cast members, most of whom I first saw in London, have relaxed into looser but completely detailed performances. (Mr. Parker, Ms. Dumezweni and Mr. Thornley cut loose delightfully to portray their characters as inhabited by young\u2019uns.) It is impossible not to identify with most of the people \u2014 and creatures \u2014 onstage, who memorably include a fabulous centaur (David St. Louis) and that great, giggling ghost of the first-floor girls\u2019 bathroom, Moaning Myrtle (Lauren Nicole Cipoletti).\n\nFor this slyly manipulative production knows exactly how, and how hard, to push the tenderest spots of most people\u2019s emotional makeups. By that I mean the ever-fraught relationships between parents and children, connections that persist, often unresolved, beyond death.\n\nTime-bending, it turns out, has its own special tools of catharsis in this regard.

The movie is seriously suboptimal, but she is such a force for good \u2014 for comedy, for women \u2014 and the laughs land often enough that you can go, if somewhat begrudgingly, with the messy flow. But dear lord she needs to work with better material, with funnier, sharper, far smarter scripts and with directors who can do something, anything, with the camera. There\u2019s more cinematic intelligence in the best bits on her Comedy Central show \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d than in her three starring vehicles.\n\nIn her last one, \u201cSnatched,\u201d Ms. Schumer played the clueless, often beleaguered yet fundamentally decent and finally (of course) triumphant character that is a familiar comedic type. The character was a kind of holy fool, a very weak variation on the title disaster that she played in \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d her breakout, a movie \u2014 notably \u2014 she also wrote. The big idea in \u201cSnatched\u201d is the constancy of mother love (Goldie Hawn played Mom), which is tethered to a wincing story that trades on the clich\u00e9s about dangerous foreigners. It\u2019s a clunker not least because its you-go-girl ethos is delivered through the spectacle of white women imperiled by villains with (other) accents and darker skin.\n\nIn \u201cI Feel Pretty,\u201d Ms. Schumer again embraces the part of the lovable not-quite-losers, women who are always trying hard to fit in but who invariably stand out because they\u2019re sometimes falling splat on their faces. Her Renee Bennett works for Lily LeClair, a big beauty company with fancy Fifth Avenue digs. For some reason, she toils in a decrepit basement office in Chinatown with one taciturn co-worker (Adrian Martinez). Renee is an exile at work (an existential situation that worked better in Mike Judge\u2019s movie \u201cOffice Space\u201d), but when she is summoned to LeClair headquarters she glimpses another world.\n\nIt\u2019s heaven on earth, or so she believes, an exotic realm filled with long-legged stunners who look like they\u2019re cat-walking on a Paris runway even when strolling down an office hall. They leave Renee agog, none more so than the boss, Avery LeClair, played by Michelle Williams with a thick schmear of makeup and the stunned look of a recent accident victim. Working a delectably funny, unsexy squeak \u2014 a somewhat adenoidal version of Marilyn Monroe baby-breathiness \u2014 Ms. Williams slips off with the movie whenever she totters onscreen. Avery is a cartoon of conventional feminine beauty; Ms. Williams\u2019s performance also suggests that she\u2019s a casualty of that same convention.\n\nVideo\n\nThere\u2019s a kernel of a bright idea in that paradox, but, alas, the movie isn\u2019t about Avery, or especially bright. It\u2019s about Renee, who\u2019s appealing partly because Ms. Schumer is and because the character has been calculated to trigger anyone who\u2019s ever felt like one of life\u2019s losers. That doubtless means most of Earth\u2019s population, even if Renee\u2019s feelings of inadequacies specifically involve how she looks, which the story largely frames as a problem of self-confidence.

Beginning with Andreas-Salom\u00e9\u2019s youthful renunciation of eroticism and following her through the affairs that would change her mind and make her famous, the movie fights to establish this controversial figure as an integral part of intellectual life in her time.\n\nAs Andreas-Salom\u00e9 grows from a youthful iconoclast to become the first female psychoanalyst in Europe, she is played by four actresses, each portraying her at a different age.

They watch old videos of memorable rides, and their refusal to feel sorry for themselves makes their scenes together all the more heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cThe Rider,\u201d for the most part, resists both the urge to wallow in sadness and the impulse to deny it. There are a few scenes in which the dialogue does work that would have been better left to the faces of the performers and the details of their environment. We don\u2019t need to hear Brady say to Wayne, \u201cI hope I don\u2019t end up like you.\u201d The fear that he might is present in every glance that passes between father and son. But so is the understanding that Wayne is not only a cautionary figure, battered by loss and disappointment, prone to drinking and gambling and squandering money. He is also a role model, who understands the value of love, loyalty and letting things slide from time to time.\n\nWhat Brady will become is an open question, a source of considerable suspense and emotion. Wayne falls back on the gambler\u2019s truism about playing the hand you\u2019ve been dealt, but that advice is more complicated than it sounds, and in any case rodeo isn\u2019t like poker. You can\u2019t really bluff or fold.

The ambitious, potentially heart-stirring elements are all in place here. Yet they have been assembled with a disjointedness that taxes our belief. And the performances, perhaps inevitably, lack emotional continuity.\n\nSet in a shabby apartment building in a New England town (Dane Laffrey did the impressive two-story set), \u201cThis Flat Earth\u201d begins resonantly in the dead of night, when Julie wakens to cry out, \u201cAre you there?\u201d Her father, Dan (Lucas Papaelias), who works for the local water company, comes in to reassure her that there is nothing to fear in the sounds she hears \u2014 the wind, the rain, the traffic and, most ominously to Julie\u2019s ear, a recording of a Bach cello suite being played upstairs.\n\nIt gradually emerges that on that very day Julie has attended the reopening ceremony of her public school, where a shooting occurred not long before. (The time frame is kept vague, as are the details of the killing.)\n\nThe one student who died whom Julie knew was Noelle, a rich girl who played the cello. Julie didn\u2019t particularly like Noelle, which makes dealing with what happened all the more complicated.\n\nNoelle\u2019s grief-addled mother, Lisa (Cassie Beck), shows up at Julie\u2019s apartment, after Dan agrees to hold on to some boxes belonging to the dead girl. And Julie, it emerges, had earlier bought Noelle\u2019s designer discards at a Goodwill store.\n\nWhile Julie and her friend Zander (Ian Saint-Germain) hide out in her room, watching horror movies on his laptop and innocently flirting, all escapism is only provisional. It doesn\u2019t help that Cloris (Lynda Grav\u00e1tt), the old woman who lives upstairs, keeps playing that cello record. (The music is performed live by the cellist Christine H. Kim.) Or that, for reasons that have nothing to with the recent tragedy, Julie may soon have to leave her school.\n\nThe assorted plot elements and themes, which include social and economic resentment, are presented spasmodically. And while it may be Ms. Ferrentino\u2019s point that people behave atypically in extreme situations, the disjointed and inconsistent behavior of most of the characters keeps you at a perplexed distance.", "title": "Review: \u2018This Flat Earth\u2019 Traces Childhood Fears No Parent Can Allay", "authors": []}

(Donyale Werle designed the leafy-tree-framed convertible set.) Everyone is on a short fuse, and David\u2019s efforts to prep Cristofer and Clarence for their interviews the next day result in the sort of clashes that send people bolting into the snowy night to cool down.\n\nClarence pretends not to have met Cristofer before. But each knows uncomfortable details about the other\u2019s past, an awareness that initially keeps them at a coiled remove.\n\nThe cast is rounded out by Leon Addison Brown as Geoffrey Dean, a pompous professor of literature who is assigned to assess Clarence, and Samantha Soule as Rosie McNulty, the hard-shelled rugby coach who vets Cristofer. In both encounters, the interviewers wind up talking as much about themselves as their interviewees do, and Coach McNulty\u2019s session with Cristofer improbably degenerates into an all-out psychological striptease.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will it be Clarence, whose interview seemed to go so smoothly, or Cristofer, who self-imploded in his?

The camera provides a view of both the mother\u2019s bedroom and the bathroom. Kyra slowly moves her halting mother into the bathroom, undresses her and helps her into the tub.\n\nThere\u2019s very little light in the shot. (The cinematographer is Bradford Young, whose low-key approach has paid dividends in recent films like \u201cArrival\u201d and \u201cA Most Violent Year.\u201d) Much of this movie is literally hard to see, and deliberately so. Remember \u201cdirty realism,\u201d the label some critics applied in the 1980s to the work of writers like Richard Ford and Jayne Anne Phillips? \u201cWhere Is Kyra?\u201d operates in the realm of begrimed realism \u2014 its dark depths are purgatorial, if not outright hellish.\n\nIt\u2019s when Kyra\u2019s mother dies that her own story really begins.

She soon acquires a hardscrabble but kind new boyfriend (Kiefer Sutherland) but keeps her struggles from him.\n\nDespite the realism of its milieu and the events, this film is highly stylized. The opening title doesn\u2019t appear until 20 minutes into it, in big block letters. Some scenes are scored to bursts of harsh electro-acoustic music. The underpopulated bar where Kyra meets Mr. Sutherland\u2019s character seems desolate enough to be the set for a staging of \u201cNo Exit.\u201d These touches need to be calibrated with exactitude, lest they come off as arty affectations.

Now, 11 months after its 35-millimeter print was said to have been retired, it returns to the Quad Cinema for a run in a crisp, new 4K digital restoration.\n\nThe movie, whose title was a slang term for heroin invented by the filmmakers, is set amid the drug-addled, fashion-crazed, sexually jaded habitu\u00e9s of New York\u2019s downtown demimonde.

Adrian\u2019s sneering onstage persona suggests a bizarre misreading of the downtown luminaries Laurie Anderson and Klaus Nomi, but the movie\u2019s prize scene is a rooftop fashion shoot featuring a trash-talking, mean-sex showdown between Ms. Carlisle\u2019s two characters.\n\n\u201cLiquid Sky\u201d originally opened in New York at the Waverly (now the IFC Center), onetime home of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d and its costumed cult members.

{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "In conversations and email exchanges with The New York Times, some prominent social-media figures and companies selling Rhodesia-themed merchandise denied trafficking in white-power messages, or said they had done so unwittingly. A few said their affinity for Rhodesia derived from the government\u2019s supposed anticommunist stance.\n\nBut outside observers of this Rhodesia revival cite a far more disturbing inspiration for it: Dylann Roof, the American white supremacist who killed nine black parishioners in a Charleston, S.C. church in June 2015. Roof, who was sentenced to death last year, had penned an online manifesto, which appeared on a website called The Last Rhodesian, with photographs of himself wearing a jacket with a patch of the green-and-white Rhodesian flag.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemand for Rhodesian-themed apparel has since increased. Today one retailer, the Commissar Clothing Company, offers \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d hoodies and T-shirts and others that read \u201cBe a Man Among Men,\u201d a Rhodesian Army recruiting slogan now used by hate groups. The online store was taken down in March, but its merchandise is still available on the company\u2019s eBay storefront.\n\nAnother retailer of Rhodesia-themed goods, the Western Outlands Supply Company, which is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a \u201cwhite nationalist hate group,\u201d was formerly known as Right Wing Death Squad and sold similar fare, in addition to apparel featuring Crusader crosses and medieval symbols like those seen at the Charlottesville \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nCommissar goes further, offering shirts that say \u201cSlot Floppies,\u201d a phrase that is sometimes used as a hashtag on Instagram and other social media platforms to promote Rhodesian-themed posts and messaging. \u201cFloppy,\u201d in 1970s Rhodesia, was the equivalent of an unprintable racist epithet in the United States, while \u201cslot\u201d was Rhodesian military slang for \u201cshoot.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen The Times asked Instagram whether #MakeZimbabweRhodesiaAgain and other hashtags violated community standards, the social-media company issued this statement: \u201cWe have blocked these hashtags for violating our hate-speech policies,\u201d it said, \u201cand they will no longer be searchable on Instagram.\u201d\n\nIf such symbols and slogans, for a North American audience, lack the instant shock effect of a Confederate or Nazi flag, that is part of the point. Commissar Clothing\u2019s website, now shuttered, explained its products\u2019 wink-and-nod appeal: \u201cWe think you should be able to tell the world about you without saying a word,\u201d it read. \u201cThe great thing about most of our designs is that they are essentially inside jokes and references that the general public will not understand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen reached by email, Commissar Clothing\u2019s owner, Alexander Smyth, said, \u201cI do not support or condone racism of any sort.\u201d\n\nThe online apparel company FireForce Ventures, whose website is registered to the Canadian Army reservist Henry Lung, offers reproduction Rhodesian flags, recruiting posters and various patches of the Rhodesian security forces. Lung, who is of Chinese descent, told The Times, \u201cI see the veteran community, the Rhodesian community, as one to be honored,\u201d but insisted that he was not a white supremacist, and that he was \u201cjust trying to make a little bit of extra cash.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHeidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, said the uptick of pro-Rhodesian messaging is a purposeful amplification of the ideology and practice of \u201cracist colonial regimes\u201d \u2014 and possibly even an exhortation to war.\n\n\u201cAll the talk right now among people in the alt-right and the broader white supremacist movement is about the need for a white ethno-state,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you praise Rhodesia, in this context, what you\u2019re praising is violence to that end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were no defenses for apartheid regimes and colonialism 20 years ago,\u201d Beirich added. \u201cAnd now all of a sudden we\u2019re seeing this stuff pop up.\u201d\n\nSouthern Rhodesia was established in 1923 as a British colony named for Cecil Rhodes, who made his fortune in consolidating diamond mines. By the 1960s, as much of Africa rapidly decolonized around it, the colonial government faced pressure from London to hold free elections and accede to majority rule.\n\nThe colonial government refused. In 1965 it renamed itself Rhodesia and broke from the United Kingdom with the express purpose of maintaining white rule. The new government was led by Ian Smith, who declared that \u201cthe white man is master of Rhodesia. He has built it, and he intends to keep it.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s government soon found itself at war with a black insurgency, fighting for representative government and self-rule. Many of the fighters received weapons from China or the Soviet Union. Rhodesia\u2019s government labeled them \u201ccommunists\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d said Gerald Horne, author of \u201cFrom the Barrel of a Gun\u201d and a professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Houston. \u201cBut of course the apartheid side knew what sold in Washington, so they portrayed it as a battle against communism because it got pulses racing in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe battle for perception is playing out again now on social media, which pro-Rhodesia accounts or commenters are using to rewrite Rhodesian history in gentle tones. On Jan. 27, the Instagram page @historicalwarfareinc posted the photo below, claiming it depicted an army officer deciding the fate of a prisoner.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe photograph is well known. It was taken in September 1977 by an Associated Press photographer, J. Ross Baughman, who was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for capturing the brutality of the Rhodesian Army.\n\nThat Instagram caption provides far less context than the version submitted for the Pulitzer, which read: \u201cLt. Graham Baillie raps a small wooden bat against his leg after using it to beat Moffat Ncube, a local teacher, political leader and now a bound, unconscious prisoner slumped against the wall of schoolhouse, 20 September 1977.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cNcube reportedly later died after three days of brutal, nonstop torture.\u201d\n\nAs of April 6, the photo with the more anodyne caption had nearly 1,850 likes.\n\nSome pro-Rhodesia voices on social media are not so subtle.\n\nLast December Joseph Smith, a 22-year-old resident of Rexburg, Idaho, who told The Times he had not heard of Rhodesia until 18 months ago, posted a YouTube video that he said offered \u201ca quick rundown\u201d of Rhodesian history. The video has received more than 180,000 views.\n\nGot a confidential news tip for At War? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with the At War team.\n\nComments on it included calls for Rhodesia to return, claims that the West betrayed Rhodesia and outright hostility to the idea of black-majority rule. With more than 1,700 comments in just the last three months, the discussion quickly devolved into a stream of racial and ethnic slurs against African-Americans and Jews, calling for them to be shoved into gas chambers and ovens.\n\nIn an email to The Times, Smith wrote that he felt persecuted and that he has found Rhodesian themes compelling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware these days being a conservative heterosexual white male is rather unpopular in the eyes of many,\u201d and that \u201cthis is the demographic that caused Rhodesia to thrive as well as it did for as long as it did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe insisted, however, that his attraction to Rhodesian nostalgia was not racist. \u201cI do not think that it\u2019s a race issue though,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPartly I just feel like white people like having a team to root for these days.\u201d\n\nAn examination of retailers and social-media accounts showed a varied understanding and mixed approaches to addressing the meanings in the pro-Rhodesia messaging.\n\nThe Selous Armory, a Massachusetts apparel company run by Sean Lucht, a Boston firefighter and Marine veteran, sold a red-and-white \u201cMake Zimbabwe Rhodesia Again\u201d patch online until recently. The site also sold T-shirts with sayings like \u201cRhodesians Never Die\u201d and \u201cApply Violence\u201d with the Rhodesian Foreign Legion logo, in addition to \u201cBe a Man Among Men\u201d posters. When The Times reached out to Lucht for comment about the business in March, all the merchandise was stripped from the website and an announcement was published on its home page saying, \u201cThe Selous Armory was always a place for military history/humor and never a place for hate.\u201d The announcement added that the Selous Armory had ceased all operations. Lucht did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Instagram account of retired Delta Force master sergeant Larry Vickers also displays an affinity for Rhodesia.\n\nWith roughly 900,000 followers on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, Vickers \u2014 a marksmanship instructor who says he trains special-operations forces, law enforcement and civilians \u2014 attracts a social-media audience with an interest in military history and firearms.\n\nOn Instagram, Vickers first publicly professed his fondness for Rhodesian history in September 2014, posting a photo of Rhodesian soldiers returning from a raid. Since 2017, he has shared many photos of Belgian FAL rifles painted in the splotchy yellow-and-green camouflage favored by Rhodesian troops in the Bush War of the 1970s.\n\nThe caption on one photo from last year expressed reverence: \u201cRespect and remember,\u201d it read.

I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d\n\nWhen told that the Rhodesian rifle had become a totem for American white supremacists, Selvaggio pleaded ignorance. \u201cWhat I remember of it is seeing pictures of the FALs on the guys over there fighting.

There are a lot of those parents around.\n\nA: No. 1, I would ask the parent to go visit the school. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen parents \u2014 even in my short tours here in New York so far, but also in places I\u2019ve worked before \u2014 where parents have an image or a perception of a school, and they\u2019ve never gone to the school. They\u2019ve never really met anybody at the school, but they\u2019ve heard about the school. It\u2019s important for you to actually go to the school.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s really important that we as a system are looking at schools where the educational opportunity is not what we would like. My personal, very personal belief system around schools, and how schools serve students, is that I\u2019m not going to be satisfied if I wouldn\u2019t be able to send my child to a particular school. If it\u2019s not good enough for my child, it\u2019s absolutely not good enough for anyone else\u2019s.\n\nQ: There is a city\u2019s worth of homeless children in New York City\u2019s schools. Do you support the idea of creating a deputy chancellor for highly mobile students?\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure about the title, but I do think that work has to live somewhere, and I think you do have to have somebody whose responsibility it is, in a large system like we are, to work on that every single day they\u2019re at work. I do think that somebody needs to own it, somebody needs to champion it. Obviously, as the chancellor, I ultimately own everything, but I do think it\u2019s an important role to have in the system.\n\nQ: Segregation. How open are you to centralized, systemwide approaches, as opposed to plans that bubble up from individual schools or small districts, which is what we have had so far?\n\nA: I think the broader question should be, how much do we value diversity in New York City? And I would say by all apparent evidence that I\u2019ve seen, diversity is important to the residents of New York City. So if that\u2019s the case, and public schools belong to the public, then we have not only an obligation but a responsibility to look at: Do we have system and structures and processes that inhibit diversity in our schools? But also, do we have systems, structures and policies that inhibit diversity in our programs, like gifted and talented? That\u2019s important, too. You can\u2019t look at one without looking at the other. And then I think it\u2019s important to also look at, do we have the same system, structures and policies, and mind-sets that also cause us to have certain subgroups of students that are disproportionately affected by issues of suspension, issues of identification for special education services, etc. So I think diversity is a much broader theme than sometimes gets talked about out in the public.", "title": "Richard Carranza: \u2018As the Chancellor, I Ultimately Own Everything\u2019", "authors": []}

At the time, at least in the early years, most Wall Street firms were still focusing on big stocks for individual investors.\n\nInstitutions began showering D.L.J. with commissions at a time when commission rates were still fixed at high levels and portfolio managers were beginning to trade more frequently.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe hit a gusher,\u201d Mr. Jenrette wrote.\n\nD.L.J. made its precedent-setting public stock offering in early 1970, and the considerable profits it reaped very likely contributed to the demise, about five years later, of fixed commissions, pressure for which was already building.\n\nMany securities firms followed with public offerings of their own, giving rise to criticism that publicly owned firms took on more risk than they would have had they remained private partnerships.\n\nWhen Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Lufkin left the firm, Mr. Jenrette became chief executive and, after surviving a severe downturn in 1974, restored high profitability and sold D.L.J. to Equitable Life for $440 million, twice its book value, in 1985.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike his houses, Mr. Jenrette said, \u201cI considered D.L.J. a restoration job.\u201d\n\nMr. Jenrette was induced to join Equitable as vice chairman and as president and chief executive of the Equitable Investment Corporation, the holding company for Equitable\u2019s investment-oriented subsidiaries, including the D.L.J. brokerage firm and its Real Estate Group. The investment corporation thrived, and in 1987 Mr. Jenrette was named chairman of Equitable.\n\nEquitable, then a 140-year old insurance grande dame owned by its policyholders, had gotten into debilitating financial trouble with a flawed version of a product called guaranteed investment contracts, and it had suffered reverses in junk bonds and real estate.\n\nMr. Jenrette\u2019s capital-raising solution was the industry\u2019s first significant demutualization \u2014 the process by which a customer-owned mutual organization is transformed into a joint stock company. Accomplished in two years, the process led to a highly successful public stock offering. Mr. Jenrette retired in 1996.\n\nHis basic precept as a manager was to \u201chire people smarter than you are,\u201d he said, and he often used handwriting analysis and color charts to evaluate candidates. He also expressed more than a passing interest in astrology, to which he devoted 16 pages of his memoir, providing the signs of dozens of prominent business, political and sports figures.\n\nMr. Jenrette indulged a passion for meticulous record-keeping. He weighed himself daily, kept a diary for the bulk of his adult life and even in his advanced retirement years calculated the value of his liquid assets every day.\n\nAt the same time, he was building a far-ranging reputation involving what he called his hobby: buying and restoring historic American homes, more than a dozen of which he lavishly decorated and furnished with period antiques.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably better known for old houses and antiques than for Wall Street,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Jenrette said in an interview for this obituary in 2012.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe setting for the interview was the high-ceilinged octagonal library at Edgewater, his six-columned home built in 1824 on a Hudson River peninsula just north of Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County, N.Y. He bought the home in 1969 from the author Gore Vidal, who had done his writing in the library. It still housed a large collection of Mr. Vidal\u2019s books.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jenrette \u201chad a major impact on preservation,\u2019\u2019 probably as much as any single individual, said David J. Brown, executive vice president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nMr. Brown cited in particular two Jenrette rescues in Charleston: the elegant Mills House hotel and the Roper House, on the Battery overlooking the harbor and Fort Sumter. Those restorations, Mr. Brown said, helped spark the city\u2019s renaissance as a destination for what has become known as heritage tourism.\n\nA self-acknowledged \u201chouse-aholic,\u201d Mr. Jenrette explained his interest by saying that it was probably inspired by \u201ca dozen too many\u2019\u2019 viewings of \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d as a child.\n\nMr. Jenrette\u2019s renown in historic restoration circles led to his hosting world dignitaries, including the emperor and empress of Japan and Charles, the Prince of Wales, who wrote the foreword to Mr. Jenrette\u2019s 1995 book, \u201cAdventures With Old Houses.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also assembled what was believed to be the largest private collection of Duncan Phyfe furniture; many of the pieces are now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nRichard Hampton Jenrette was born on April 5, 1929, in Raleigh, N.C. His father, Joseph, was a successful local insurance salesman. His mother, Emma,was an avid gardener and lived to 101, according to the publication New York Social Diary.\n\nRichard was still in public school when he took a summer job as a sportswriter on The Raleigh Times. His boss was Jesse Helms, who would serve six terms in the United States Senate. Mr. Jenrette later moved to The News & Observer in Raleigh, the state capital.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of North Carolina, where he majored in journalism and edited The Daily Tar Heel, Mr. Jenrette reluctantly apprenticed as an insurance salesman, taking after his father.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe didn\u2019t relish a career prospecting for clients, he said, though what he called \u201ca great two-year sales experience\u2019\u2019 gave him credibility four decades later when he found himself chief executive of Equitable Life.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith the Korean War on and his draft board hovering, Mr. Jenrette started a two-year active stint with the North Carolina National Guard. As a sergeant assigned to counterintelligence duty, he met a group of Harvard graduates.\n\nHaving heard that Harvard Business School was seeking to become more diverse \u2014 \u201caffirmative action in 1951 was a Southern white male,\u201d he remarked \u2014 he secretly applied to the school without telling his family that he hoped to quit the insurance business.\n\nAfter graduating with a master\u2019s in business administration and weighing various job offers, he joined Brown Brothers Harriman, the very model of an old-time Wall Street firm, whose oak-paneled ambience included roll-top desks, a large coal-burning fireplace and oil paintings of the founders.\n\nHe spent two years there as a portfolio manager \u2014 one client was Greta Garbo \u2014 before leaving at 30 to start his own firm with Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Lufkin.\n\nMr. Jenrette\u2019s partner, William L. Thompson, died in 2013. He is survived by a nephew and nieces with whom he was close: Dr. Joseph M. Jenrette III, Helen Wooddy, Betty Romberg and Nancy Reynolds.\n\nIn his later years Mr. Jenrette had owned several historic houses, all of which were to go to his Classical American Homes Preservation Trust. In addition to the Roper House, they included Millford Plantation in Pinewood, S.C., Ayr Mount in Hillsborough, N.C., and Cane Garden on St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands.\n\nIn Manhattan, his townhouses at 67 East 93rd Street and the adjacent No.69, which was his office, once belonged to George F.

At the Almeida, the classics are ripe for reinvention, and rarely look or sound as they have before.\n\nWhen the leading lady Patsy Ferran steps toward a microphone in the opening moments \u2014 a stage direction not found in Williams\u2019s script \u2014 you might feel as if you have stumbled into the latest avant-garde project from New York\u2019s Wooster Group, which also uses amplification to illuminate characters\u2019 private thoughts, in a sort of aurally enhanced stage whisper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In an instant, we are drawn into the variably fragile and frantic psyche of Alma Winemiller (Ms. Ferran). Here is someone given to impulse and intuition who, like the production in which she finds herself, won\u2019t be kept in check.\n\nAlma, we\u2019re informed, is \u201cSpanish for soul,\u201d which may account for the stirrings that this minister\u2019s daughter feels for John Buchanan (Matthew Needham, excellent), the heavy-drinking doctor\u2019s son who lives next door. By turns attentive and cruel, John engages with Alma only to push her away, and Ms. Ferran\u2019s saucer-eyed trembling hints at the character\u2019s scarcely contained hysteria.\n\nWritten a year after \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire,\u201d and doomed to exist in its shadow, \u201cSummer and Smoke\u201d offers a smaller-scale study in female entrapment and loneliness. And it concludes with an unexpected eleventh-hour encounter of which Blanche DuBois would have surely approved.\n\nThe supporting cast includes one actor (Forbes Masson) playing both the play\u2019s two fathers, and Anjana Vasan in a quartet of roles as part of the gently absurdist landscape that Ms. Frecknall, the director, favors. Here, the fast-rising Ms. Ferran \u2014 first admired on the London stage as the klutzy maid in a starry Coward staging of \u201cBlithe Spirit\u201d in 2014 \u2014 is all open-faced gawkiness: a child-woman teetering on the abyss of tragedy.\n\nThose onstage pianos are there, meanwhile, to lend musical counterpoint or contrast to events that unfold with a deliberate lack of place and only minimal props; there\u2019s a doorbell, for instance, but no door. Instead, Ms. Frecknall finds in this lesser-known work by Williams a lacerating tone poem that, like its rapture-prone heroine, has no time for the literal as it hurtles tenderly, tentatively toward love.", "title": "Ripping Up the Rule Book on the London Stage", "authors": ["Matt Wolf", "London Theater Reviews"]}

He bought the restaurant premises in 2005, originally with the idea of a salami business, before opening the restaurant in 2007.

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Reich also calls for a greater emphasis on civic education, including two years of mandatory public service, and efforts to resurrect truth from the miasma of political deceit and fake news. Perhaps the most distinctive measure Reich proposes is the redeployment of honor and shame. Rather than honor people for their wealth or celebrity, we should honor those who display genuine virtue, like whistle-blowers, firefighters, social workers and soldiers \u2014 people who perform hard or risky tasks that serve the common good. And we should shame those who, however wealthy, achieve their status through exploitative business practices or morally dubious financial dealings.\n\nInterestingly, in developing this theme, Reich favorably cites so-called \u201cvirtue conservatives\u201d of the 1980s and 1990s. For example, he quotes William J. Bennett, the education secretary in the Reagan administration, who warned that \u201cnonjudgmentalism \u2026 has permeated our culture, encouraging a paralysis of the moral faculty.\u201d He also cites the conservative political scientist James Q. Wilson, who argued that neglecting broken windows in poor communities conveys a message of moral license, leading to an unraveling of social restraints and increased crime. Reich contends that people who get rich by exploiting norms of social trust \u2014 by evading taxes, say, or devising barely legal schemes of financial trickery \u2014 generate a similar unraveling.\n\nAgainst the grain of much liberal thinking, Reich acknowledges that promoting civic virtue requires being judgmental about what moral attitudes and qualities of character our public life should affirm and promote. This recognition of the role of moral judgment in politics is an important corrective to the liberal wariness of bringing morality into the public square.\n\nReich\u2019s proposals would make a good starting point for a new progressive political project. What is puzzling, however, is his insistence that a politics of the common good can or should be nonpartisan. Time and again, he draws a sharp distinction between the common good he wants to revive and the competing conceptions of the common good at stake in everyday political debate \u2014 about tax policy, health care, the environment and so on. He insists his book is not about what messages Democrats or Republicans should convey or what policies they should pursue, but rather about restoring our shared commitment to democratic norms and principles. \u201cIt\u2019s our agreement to these principles that connects us, not agreement about where these principles lead.\u201d\n\nReich seems to believe that the common good describes ground rules for a decent society, not the policies and purposes that citizens should pursue within these ground rules. But is it really possible to separate the two? Is the debate over how vigorously to regulate Wall Street about the ground rules of democracy or a policy on which Democrats and Republicans may reasonably disagree? Or consider immigration. Reich argues that the common good is \u201cnot about securing borders, erecting walls and keeping others out \u2026. To the contrary, the common good is about inclusion \u2014 joining together to achieve common goals.\u201d But inclusion of whom \u2014 existing citizens of the country, Dreamers, other immigrants who hope to be admitted? Partisans on all sides of this raging debate invoke competing conceptions of the common good to support their position.\n\nAs these examples suggest, the nonpartisan, above-the-fray conception of the common good that Reich proposes may be too high-minded to reinvigorate American public discourse in the way he wants. In the face of President Trump\u2019s serial violations of democratic norms, it is tempting to appeal to Americans, whatever their party or political persuasion, to reaffirm certain principles that all can share. But such principles, if truly detached from debate about where they lead, are so abstract that they can only serve as hortatory fare for commencement addresses and the Fourth of July. The best hope for reviving the common good is to invigorate moral argument in the messy, contentious domain of democratic politics.", "title": "Robert B.

His approach to critical thinking planted a seed in me that grew during my years at Harvard and throughout my life. The approach appealed to what was probably my natural but latent tendency toward questioning and skepticism.\n\nI concluded that you can\u2019t prove anything in absolute terms, from which I extrapolated that all significant decisions are about probabilities. Internalizing the core tenet of Professor Demos\u2019s teaching \u2014 weighing risk and analyzing odds and trade-offs \u2014 was central to everything I did professionally in the decades ahead in finance and government.\n\nAt the same time that I was processing Professor Demos\u2019s class, one of the big ideas floating around coffeehouses in Cambridge, Mass., was existential philosophy. In time, I arrived at my own interpretation of that way of thinking. To me, existentialism is an internalized sense of perspective. I came to believe that on one hand, the present matters a great deal, but on the other hand, in the totality of space and time, the here and now becomes insignificant.\n\nI\u2019m asked from time to time which undergraduate courses best prepared me for working at Goldman Sachs and in the government. People assume I\u2019ll list courses in economics or finance, but I always answer that the key was Professor Demos\u2019s philosophy course and the conversations about existentialism in coffee shops around campus. For me, embracing these two perspectives brought me a sense of calm in what were incredibly stressful situations.\n\nThere was a point in the early 1980s when the Goldman Sachs arbitrage department, which I led, lost more money in one month than it had made in almost any one year, driven by severe declines in the equity markets. Given the vicissitudes of markets, there was no way to tell whether we\u2019d reached the nadir and recovery was around the corner \u2014 or whether we were about to go over a cliff. Despite the immense pressure, and the emotional state of the markets, I drew on an existential perspective, and my colleagues and I made careful, probabilistic decisions to adjust our portfolio, and we weathered the storm.", "title": "Opinion | Robert E.

The professional mismatch was apparent. (Sartorially, it was even more obvious when he wore a madras sport coat to work on a warm day.)\n\nBut college had not been for naught. He was student there when he met his future wife, Nicole Challamel, who became a French teacher and translator. She survives him, along with their sons, Thomas and Philip; and two grandchildren.\n\nAnd the one art course he took at Williams \u2014 \u201cThe Development of Modern Art: From Goya to the Present,\u201d taught by Fred Licht, now a curator at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice \u2014 had left an impression so enduring that he abandoned banking to pursue a master\u2019s degree in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and make museums his career.\n\nHe worked his way from the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio to a job as a curator at the Washington University Gallery of Art in St. Louis before joining Albright-Knox in Buffalo in 1969 as assistant director. He was named its director in 1973.\n\nIn stepping down from the Brooklyn Museum in 1996, Mr. Buck said he wanted to become more involved in art itself and less in administration. He was named sales director of the Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan and then became director of Exhibitions International, a nonprofit service, until he retired in 2004.\n\nWhen he was a museum director, he lamented that he spent more time raising cash than elevating culture. \u201cDirectors are like classy beggars with golden cups,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt board meetings, he recalled, \u201cmost trustees go over the financial reports and then look at you with disappointed faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like the board was playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey and I was chosen to be the donkey,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Buck also had to struggle with some built-in handicaps.

In an unusual move, it urged the justices to grant review in the case, Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission, No. 17-130, even though it had won in the appeals court.\n\nThe Justice Department also asked the court to consider the separate issue of whether statutory restrictions on removing the judges from office are permissible. On Monday, Jeffrey B. Wall, a deputy solicitor general, urged the court to insist on a \u201cclear line of accountability.\u201d\n\nWere the court to address that issue, Justice Stephen G.

The full appeals court agreed to rehear the case, but its judges deadlocked 5 to 5.\n\nAfter the solicitor general switched positions in the case, the commission issued an order ratifying the appointments of the in-house judges. Mark Perry, a lawyer for Mr. Lucia, said his client nonetheless deserved a new chance to argue his case, saying that he had been the subject of \u201can unconstitutional proceeding.\u201d\n\nOn this point, Mr. Wall, arguing for the administration, parted ways with Mr. Perry, saying the commission\u2019s order \u201csolves the problem.\u201d\n\nSeveral justices expressed concern that a ruling for Mr. Lucia would have vast implications for countless executive branch employees, including ones who consider claims for social security and veterans\u2019 benefits.\n\nJustice Kagan said that there was something odd about Mr. Lucia\u2019s insistence that the in-house judges be accountable to executive branch officials.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where we have adjudications, where we typically think we want the decision maker to be insulated from political pressures,\u201d she said. \u201cSo wouldn\u2019t putting those decision makers even closer to the political body only exacerbate the problem that you\u2019re complaining of?\u201d\n\nJustice Anthony M.

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Rosenstein has continued to appease Mr. Trump and his congressional allies in matters small and large. In June, following back-to-back stories that Mr. Mueller was specifically investigating both Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Mr. Rosenstein warned that \u201cAmericans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations.\u201d In November, Mr. Rosenstein praised the president\u2019s \u201crespect for the rule of law,\u201d citing his appointments to the Department of Justice and F.B.I.\n\nIn December, following reports that the F.B.I. agent Peter Strzok had been removed from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team because he had exchanged text messages criticizing Mr. Trump with a colleague with whom he was said to be having an extramarital affair, Mr. Rosenstein provided the messages to Congress.\n\nCommenters noted that further exposure of their texts could subject them to embarrassment and ridicule; one slammed Mr. Rosenstein for an \u201caggressive act of betrayal.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Rosenstein once again had little choice and made the best of a bad situation. Normally, when a federal agency is on solid ground to resist a congressional document request, it enjoys the White House\u2019s full support. Here, however, Mr. Trump was loudly siding with Congress, eager to dig up dirt to discredit the F.B.I. and Mr. Mueller. Caught in this pincer, Mr. Rosenstein could hope only to mitigate the damage. The department provided a broad set of texts to Congress and shared them with reporters, who could then write stories that made clear that Mr. Strzok criticized everyone, not only Mr. Trump.\n\nThe unprecedented alliance between the Republican-controlled Congress and the president against the Justice Department \u2014 which now includes calls for Mr. Rosenstein to be held in contempt of Congress or even impeached \u2014 has forced Mr. Rosenstein to share documents relevant to the criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Playing a weak hand, Mr. Rosenstein has made Congress spend time and energy to obtain documents, while aiming to live to fight another day.\n\nHas Mr. Rosenstein always calibrated correctly the benefits of compromise against its costs? Probably not; no human could. But he has been right to look at both sides of the ledger.\n\nWeeks before his firing, Mr. Comey disparaged Mr. Rosenstein in a private conversation with Mr. Wittes of Lawfare, saying he had \u201cconcerns\u201d because Mr. Rosenstein is a \u201csurvivor.\u201d In Mr. Wittes\u2019s paraphrase, Mr. Comey feared that \u201cyou don\u2019t get to survive that long across administrations without making compromises.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes the best way to do justice is to compromise with those who would deny it. By surviving, Mr. Rosenstein has preserved not just his job but also the integrity of an investigation into, among much else, possible wrongdoing by the president.

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "Touring the Met\u2019s archives a couple of years ago, Mr. Beczala mentioned that his dream was to record some arias under early-20th-century conditions. He wanted to learn firsthand how faithful \u2014 or far-off \u2014 the results would be.\n\nPeter Clark, the company\u2019s archivist, mentioned Mr. Beczala\u2019s fantasy to Jonathan Hiam, the curator of the performing arts library\u2019s Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound; Mr. Hiam then contacted Jerry Fabris, from the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in New Jersey, who knows a collector in Illinois who makes wax cylinders like those Edison once produced.\n\nSo on his day off from the Met\u2019s revival of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLuisa Miller,\u201d Mr. Beczala got together with Ms. Phillips and the technical team to try out the vintage operation.\n\nVerdi, the old way Audio\n\nVerdi, the new way Audio\n\nThe library owns Edison cylinder machines, as well as an early Berliner gramophone \u2014 a competing technology that used flat discs. In 1912, Mr. Fabris explained, flat-disc phonographs finally outsold the cylinder ones and before long took over the market.\n\nMr. Fabris had brought similar equipment from New Jersey: an Edison Home Phonograph with a large black bell horn, a rotating holder for the wax cylinders and a hand-crank device to wind up the internal springs; and a similar-looking Edison Fireside Phonograph to play back the recordings. Both machines date from around 1909.\n\nThe material surrounding the wax cylinders is not really wax, he said, but something called metallic soap. Before using the cylinders, he had to warm them up under a light to make the material soft enough for the stylus to cut grooves as the disc spun.\n\n\u201cYou want it to be like butter,\u201d Mr. Fabris explained.\n\nMozart, the old way Audio\n\nMozart, the new way Audio\n\nThe process is better at recording midrange sounds and has trouble with high frequencies. (Ms. Phillips was warned that it tends to favor tenors over sopranos.) Wide dynamic variables also test the machine\u2019s capacity: Not knowing this, Ms. Phillips had prepared \u201cPer piet\u00e0,\u201d an aria from Mozart\u2019s \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte\u201d that moves through extremes of high and low, loud and soft.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Beczala was first up, singing \u201cQuando le sere al placido\u201d from \u201cLuisa Miller,\u201d accompanied by Gerald Moore, who played on a small upright piano so as not to compete with the voices. Putting the cylinder in place, Mr. Fabris was careful not to touch the surface: Even a slight thumbprint can create an impression. While Mr. Beczala sang, Mr. Fabris held a small brush in one hand and a little squeezable air bag in the other to disperse the dustlike shards of wax that are created when the stylus cuts into the cylinders.\n\nSince the machine has no meter to check levels, Mr. Beczala tried out the opening of the aria twice, the second time moving closer to the machine. Both times, the ringing, virile quality of his sound came through fairly well, though dynamic variations essentially disappeared. Mr. Beczala was most rattled that his intonation sounded off \u2014 though this was a flaw of the equipment, not of his solid technique.\n\nFinally, it was time to record the aria \u2014 or at least the first half or so, since each cylinder can hold only a little more than two minutes of music. \u201cIt\u2019s like a black hole,\u201d Mr. Beczala said, staring at the bell horn. \u201cIt takes you in.\u201d\n\nListening to the playback, he commented that the resonance was not bad and that the high notes were O.K. But his softer singing sounded faint and distant, and the consonants, he said, \u201care nonexisting,\u201d though in the room his diction was excellent.\n\n\u2018Carmen,\u2019 the old way Audio\n\n\u2018Carmen,\u2019 the new way\n\n\u201cThe Flower Song,\u201d from Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen,\u201d came through more clearly. \u201cI tried to sing more crisp than usual,\u201d Mr. Beczala said.\n\nWhen Ms. Phillips tried out the faster section of \u201cPer piet\u00e0,\u201d full of florid runs and roulades, she proved a quick study at the skill of leaning forward for soft passages and way back for louder ones, standard practice during Caruso\u2019s era.\n\n\u201cYou have to romance the horn,\u201d she said.\n\nTo end the session, the two singers tried out some of the Act I love duet from Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia di Lammermoor.\u201d The machine is \u201cnot forgiving,\u201d Ms. Phillips said, adding: \u201cThe tone quality changes, but not the dynamic. That\u2019s infuriating to me.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between their big, healthy voices and the crackly, thin recorded playbacks was stark. It proved just how difficult \u2014 indeed, impossible \u2014 it was to capture the sounds of the legendary singers a century ago.\n\nYet context is everything. For opera lovers in the 1910s, it must have seemed simply miraculous that the great voices could appear at will, however flawed their sound, in your living room.", "title": "Romancing the Horn: Opera Stars Record Like It\u2019s 1900", "authors": ["Anthony Tommasini"]}

He survives her.\n\nAnother research fellowship, in 1963, sent them to N.Y.U. Intended to be a temporary relocation, it became a permanent one after a military coup in Brazil in 1964 made it too uncomfortable for them to remain in that country. Dr. Nussenzweig, however, did complete her Ph.D. work at the S\u00e3o Paolo university in 1968, and the couple continued to maintain ties there until her death.\n\nThough their research sometimes coincided, the Nussenzweigs had separate labs at N.Y.U. several blocks apart. Ruth was early to focus on malaria, which is caused by a parasite that is spread to humans by mosquito bites. The disease kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOne of Dr. Nussenzweig\u2019s first big advances in her research came in 1967, when she discovered that irradiating infected mosquitoes weakened the parasites, or sporozoites, enough that they might trigger an immune response when transmitted to humans rather than cause the disease itself. This suggested the possibility of a vaccine.\n\nHer work later focused on a protein on the sporozoites.\n\nThe quest for a vaccine has proved exceedingly difficult because, among other factors, the parasite goes through various stages in an infection, and there are multiple strains of malaria. Several times over the years a vaccine seemed imminent, only to have trials fail or deliver disappointing results.\n\nYet the work by Dr. Nussenzweig, her husband and other scientists helped clarify how the parasite does its damage and at what stage it might be stopped, and it has helped draw funding to the cause from well-heeled sources, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nJeffrey Weiser, chairman of the department of microbiology at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine, said by email that the Nussenzweigs \u201cdiscovered the major target for a malaria vaccine: a protein on the surface of malaria sporozoites called circumsporozoite, or CSP.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir unrelenting perseverance and dedication to this topic,\u201d he added, \u201claid the groundwork for the first licensed vaccine against malaria in 2015 based on CSP.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis year, a pilot vaccination program, drawing on Dr. Nussenzweig\u2019s work and endorsed by the World Health Organization, will give the vaccine to children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi.

But at the end of the day, he said, \u201cthe base is expecting a lot more.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s personal story is well known: His father died when he was 16, forcing him to grow up fast. He took a job at McDonald\u2019s and became class speaker in the same year, experiences that helped shape his belief in individual responsibility and his conservative outlook.\n\nHe took a job as a legislative analyst in Washington after college and found a mentor in Jack Kemp, the former congressman who in 1996 ran on the Republican ticket for vice president. In 1998, at 28, he was elected to Congress, where he quickly became known as a good listener and a master of policy details \u2014 two traits that became a hallmark of his tenure, as a chairman of the Budget and Ways and Means Committees, and later as speaker.\n\nHe was also viewed as a straight shooter and as someone who could work across the aisle with Democrats, as he did in 2013, when as Budget Committee chairman he reached a budget deal with his Senate counterpart, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Ryan hosted some of his most trusted lieutenants in the House for lunch, as a way of thanking them and saying goodbye. Those who attended said he spoke very movingly of his family, talking about the death of his father and his desire to spend more time with his own children.\n\nMr. Cole, for one, said he took Mr. Ryan at his word, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of speakers surrendering power and walking away.\u201d", "title": "Ryan Found Himself on the Margins as G.O.P.

If President Trump, who is close to Mr. McCarthy, weighs in, his endorsement could seal the election for the majority leader. But until Election Day, members will not know which top leadership slot will open. If Republicans lose the majority, the next speaker will be a Democrat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to be having these kinds of conversations, completely premature,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is retiring. \u201cIf we retain the majority, that would be an argument for continuity of leadership. In the event we lose the majority, then members might say, \u2018Hey, we need to go in a different direction with a clean slate.\u2019 That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s very unhelpful for members to be jockeying for leadership right now.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some of his colleagues appear ready to show Mr. Ryan the door, despite his vow to \u201crun out the tape.\u201d Some House members, especially members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, suggest it is highly unlikely that he will do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be running for re-election or election, and what\u2019s the vision?\u201d said Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania and a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cWhen you make that investment of your vote, you want to know who is going to be embodying that vision.

If the race is for speaker, which requires the votes of a majority of the entire House, the candidate will need the backing of the Freedom Caucus, which has about three dozen members.\n\nBut a race for majority leader, which simply requires the votes of a majority of the Republican conference, can be won without the Freedom Caucus\u2019s support.\n\nRepresentative Tom Rooney, Republican of Florida, who is retiring, said that the current situation, in which the Freedom Caucus \u201ccan basically sink any bill at any given time,\u201d was untenable, and that he hoped the next leader of the Republican conference would be able to put an end to it.\n\n\u201cWe can agree that the sky is blue and then at the last second, for some reason, it won\u2019t be blue enough, and then we have to go to Pelosi to get votes,\u201d said Mr. Rooney, referring to the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThat can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nA number of Republicans said they would be equally comfortable with Mr. McCarthy or Mr. Scalise. Mr. McCarthy is regarded as an affable presence in the House, a hard worker who is available to listen to members\u2019 concerns.\n\nWhen he sought the speakership in 2015, he was also damaged by a televised gaffe: He suggested on Fox News that the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was intended to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential prospects. That clumsy moment did not inspire confidence in his ability to be the face of the House Republican conference, nor did an uncharitable assessment of the outgoing speaker \u2014 \u201cI think John Boehner deserves a B-minus\u201d \u2014 or a series of disjointed foreign policy interviews.\n\nBut Mr. McCarthy has rebounded thanks in part to his personal connection to Mr. Trump, who at a luncheon once called him \u201cmy Kevin.\u201d Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said Mr. McCarthy \u201cis a better majority leader today than he was when he was seeking speaker.\u201d\n\nMr. Scalise, who as the whip is in charge with rounding up votes to pass legislation, may be the sentimental favorite, given his struggle to overcome the grievous injuries he suffered when he was shot during a congressional baseball practice last year.

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "The S.E.C.\u2019s proposal includes three parts. First, it would require brokers to put their customers\u2019 interests first when making investment recommendations. Second, it would require registered brokers and registered investment advisers to provide a brief summary of their relationship with clients. And last, it would reaffirm and clarify the existing rules of conduct for investment advisers, who are held to a higher standard than brokers.\n\nConsumer advocates said they had yet to go through the details of the roughly 1,000-page proposal, but they were worried that the rule did not make it clear what the best interest standard meant, and that it could potentially confuse consumers.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t define that best interest requires the broker to recommend the best available investment option \u2014 based on reasonable assumptions and a careful assessment of the needs of the investor and the characteristics of the investor \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be called a best interest standard,\u201d said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. \u201cIt is a step in that direction, but not a true best interest standard.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rules would also restrict certain brokers from calling themselves advisers, so that investors are not misled into believing a broker is a registered investment adviser, which must act as a fiduciary, an even higher standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt might seem that requiring financial professionals to put customers first would gain universal support, but the battle to get such rules passed has been long and arduous. The financial services and insurance industries have aggressively opposed such rules, arguing that they curtail investor choice and increase compliance costs.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the Labor Department passed consumer protections, drafted over six years, that required financial professionals, including brokers and insurance agents, to act in their customers\u2019 best interests, but only when handling their tax-advantaged retirement money. It took partial effect in June last year, but its full execution was delayed by the Trump administration.\n\nIn March, a federal appeals court panel ruled that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement accounts, had overstepped its authority and struck down the requirement. Its fate depends on whether the Trump administration appeals the decision \u2014 something it must do by the end of this month \u2014 or whether the full appellate court decides to hear the case, consumer advocates said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Peirce, an S.E.C. commissioner who voted in favor of the proposal, said at the meeting on Wednesday that the proposed best interest standard was actually an enhanced version of the status quo. It would be better to acknowledge that the agency is offering \u201ca suitability-plus standard,\u201d she said.\n\nBased on their reading of the proposal thus far, advocates said, the rule is not as strict as the Labor Department\u2019s and relies too much on disclosure. At a minimum, brokers would be required to disclose and \u201cmitigate\u201d conflicts, but the rule would not require them to broadly eliminate them.\n\n\u201cThe standard of conduct the agency has articulated appears ambiguous at best,\u201d Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t simply ban the sales quotas and other compensation practices that lead brokers to put their clients into high-fee, lower-yielding investments.\u201d\n\nOver the years, it has become more difficult for consumers to understand where the loyalties of their advisers lie, especially as product-pushing brokers have started to rebrand themselves as full-fledged financial advisers. Under that guise, many investors assume that the brokers are acting in their best interest, much as a doctor or lawyer might.\n\nKenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group whose members include large Wall Street firms, said in a statement that the organization was pleased that the S.E.C. had initiated the process to create \"a heightened best interest standard\u201d and would share its views during the comment process.\n\nThe American Council of Life Insurers said that it was also encouraged by the proposal, and that it would support \u201creasonable and appropriately tailored rules that require all sales professionals to act in consumers\u2019 best interest.\u201d\n\nWhat form that should take, however, will be the subject of debate in the months ahead.", "title": "S.E.C.

Under the artistic direction of Helgi Tomasson, San Francisco has long been among the world\u2019s most elegant and refined companies \u2014 but sometimes in past seasons it has seemed too polite, demure, withheld. Not so with \u201cUnbound.\u201d\n\nIndividual dancers have been outstanding; so has the larger ensemble. Though from a wide variety of backgrounds, the dancers share the same virtues of intensely elegant clarity, high refinement and fervent commitment. New York has two influential ballet companies, New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater, to both of which San Francisco Ballet owes debts. (Mr. Tomasson created roles for both George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins as a City Ballet principal, and his company\u2019s repertory contains works created for both New York companies.) But the limpid sophistication of the San Francisco style is apart from either.\n\nEight of the 12 commissions turned out to be vividly distinct examples of dance theater.

If enforced fully, they could eliminate a full 90 percent of the country\u2019s total exports in dollar terms.\n\nEspecially painful was the decision last December to limit the North\u2019s imports of refined petroleum products to half a million barrels a year, a 90 percent reduction from the previous year.\n\nNorth Korea can still extract 1.2 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and kerosene from the four million barrels of crude oil a year it is allowed to import, mostly from China, said an energy analyst, Lee Jong-heon. But the combined 1.7 million barrels of refined petroleum would be less than half the amount needed to run all of the 280,000 cars in North Korea, much less heat homes and meet other needs, Mr. Lee said.\n\nExperts said the sanctions, and China\u2019s apparent willingness to enforce many of them, had dealt a blow to one of the few bright points in the North Korean economy: trade with China, which had been an eager market for ore and other North Korean natural resources.\n\n\u201cProduction has sharply decreased, if not come to a compete halt, in coal, iron, zinc and copper mines,\u201d said Jiro Ishimaru, who runs Asia Press, a Japan-based website that monitors North Korea with the help of informants inside the country. \u201cMany miners don\u2019t report for work because management can\u2019t provide rations or pay wages.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean exports to China, which account for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade, plunged by one third to $1.65 billion last year, with volumes dropping by 60 to 95 percent in recent months. Its official trade deficit against China more than doubled last year to $1.68 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPetty traders from the North who used to cross into China in the morning on foot or in small cars and then returned in the evening with auto parts and food to sell on the black market no longer come,\u201d said Wu Qiang, a North Korea expert in China.\n\nThe sanctions have also led China and other nations to send home tens of thousands of North Korean workers, cutting off another key source of hard currency for Mr. Kim\u2019s government.\n\nWithout foreign currency, North Korea will struggle to finance imports of consumer goods for its people and raw materials for its factories. It will also be unable to import fertilizer in time for the planting season, raising the specter of a return of food shortages, said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University.\n\nHumanitarian aid workers who have recently visited the country warn that food shortages could be exacerbated by the lack of fuel, which could hamper North Korea\u2019s ability to transport grain from areas of surplus to places where there is not enough. Trucks that used to carry goods twice a day now run only once a day on some routes, though some are extending their decks to carry more loads.\n\nRecent visitors also describe shortages of medicine.

{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "According to several officials, the White House did not inform Ms. Haley that it had changed course on sanctions, leaving her to hang out alone.\n\n\u201cIt damages her credibility going forward and once again makes everyone, friend and foe alike, wonder that when the United States says something, approves something, calls for something, opposes something, is it for real?\u201d said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cShould we wait to see what Trump does the next day?\u201d\n\nThe clash was reminiscent of various occasions when Mr. Trump has directly undercut subordinates, as when Mr. Tillerson broached the idea of negotiations with North Korea and the president scolded him on Twitter not to waste his time. Many in Washington and at the United Nations were riveted by the sharp exchange on Tuesday between the White House and its senior international diplomat.\n\n\u201cShe got ahead of the curve,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s national economics adviser, told reporters at a briefing in Florida before Mr. Trump welcomed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to his Mar-a-Lago estate. \u201cShe\u2019s done a great job. She\u2019s a very effective ambassador, but there might have been some momentary confusion about that.\u201d\n\nMs. Haley took umbrage. A few hours later, she spoke with Dana Perino of Fox News, who quoted her response on air: \u201cWith all due respect, I don\u2019t get confused.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow then called Ms. Haley to apologize. \u201cShe was certainly not confused,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told The New York Times by telephone. \u201cI was wrong to say that \u2014 totally wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs it turns out, she was basically following what she thought was policy. The policy was changed and she wasn\u2019t told about it, so she was in a box.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe argument that Ms. Haley had merely gotten out ahead of a decision was undercut by the fact that the White House itself had sent out word to surrogates on Saturday \u2014 the day before her remarks \u2014 letting them know that it had already decided to take punitive action against Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe also intend to impose specific additional sanctions against Russia to respond to Moscow\u2019s ongoing support for the Assad regime, which has enabled the regime\u2019s atrocities against the Syrian people,\u201d said a document distributed by the Republican National Committee that was titled \u201cWhite House talking points.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Haley\u2019s aide replied that her office was considering a correction, but none was ever released. Instead, the White House was left to say the next day that no sanctions had been approved.\n\nSuch conflicts leave foreign governments in a bind as they try to interpret American moves.\n\n\u201cCoordinated messaging by our government on matters as serious as these is very important, so it is best that an episode such as this one not be repeated,\u201d said John Negroponte, a former ambassador to the United Nations. He added that he was confident that Ms. Haley \u201chas absolutely no interest in undercutting, contradicting or getting out in front of the White House.\u201d\n\nBeyond the immediate disconnect, though, is a deeper strain between Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley, according to administration officials and other insiders. Ms. Haley has been perhaps the most hawkish voice on Russia on a team headed by a president who has emphasized his fervent desire for friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nAt times, that serves the president\u2019s interests because she can say what he will not. But at other times, he has grown exasperated by her outspokenness.\n\nAt one point recently, he saw Ms. Haley on television sharply criticizing Russia over its intervention in Ukraine. \u201cWho wrote that for her?\u201d Mr. Trump yelled angrily at the screen, according to people briefed on the moment. \u201cWho wrote that for her?\u201d\n\nA former governor of South Carolina, Ms. Haley has assumed a more prominent role than most of her predecessors, at times eclipsing the secretary of state. And along the way, Mr. Trump has grown suspicious of her ambition, convinced that she had been angling for Mr. Tillerson\u2019s position and increasingly wondering whether she wants his own job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans close to the White House whisper about the prospect of an alliance between Ms. Haley and Vice President Mike Pence, possibly to run as a ticket in 2020.\n\nAides to both scoff at such suggestions, but the slightest hint of such a pairing would be likely to enrage Mr. Trump, who has made it clear that he plans to run for re-election. The talk was exacerbated in recent days when Mr. Pence named Jon Lerner, Ms. Haley\u2019s deputy, as his new national security adviser, while allowing him to keep his job at the United Nations.\n\nThat plan collapsed within 48 hours when Mr. Trump grew angry at reports that Mr. Lerner had made anti-Trump ads for the Club for Growth, an economic conservative advocacy group, during Republican primaries in 2016. Mr. Lerner stepped down from the job in Mr. Pence\u2019s office.\n\nMs. Haley draws strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. In Republican circles, she is a favorite of neoconservatives and national security hawks like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, but viewed skeptically by the more isolationist wing that sees Mr. Trump as a champion. Among Democrats, she has respect from those who see her as a voice of reason and scorn from others who see her as overly combative.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley is a neocon in her view,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California. \u201cBasically, she\u2019s a parrot for the McCain-Lindsey Graham worldview of \u2018Let\u2019s go bomb Iran, let\u2019s go fight another cold war with Russia, let\u2019s go use force around the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Connolly, on the other hand, described her as an important counterpoint to Mr. Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s been a little island of some sanity in this otherwise dysfunctional, irrational, volatile White House when it comes to foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s now getting the Tillerson treatment.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Well into the 1990s, it was not unusual for the highest-drafted running back to go before the highest-drafted quarterback. Several running backs went No. 1, including future stars like O.J. Simpson, Earl Campbell and Bo Jackson.\n\n\u201cThe guys that were taken high in the first round ended up being really good,\u201d Garrett observed.\n\nThat trend flipped at about the time of the Carter pick. In the 22 drafts since then, a quarterback has been selected first overall 14 times. Many of those players became franchise signal-callers like Peyton and Eli Manning, Michael Vick, Matthew Stafford, Andrew Luck and Jared Goff. Notable highly drafted running backs during this period include LaDainian Tomlinson (No. 5); Adrian Peterson (No. 7); and one of the biggest busts in recent years, Trent Richardson (No. 3).\n\nJust how highly desired Barkley is Thursday night may come down as much to the specifics of his talent as to its raw abundance. Barkley is a so-called \u201cthree-down back,\u201d able to contribute whether it is first-and-10, second-and-short or third-and-long. He can run all kinds of rushing plays; pass-block; make catches out of the backfield; and even line up as a wide receiver and run traditional routes.\n\n\u201cHe does everything,\u201d Casserly said. \u201cHome-run ability with speed, ability to run inside with quickness. He\u2019s got some power to him, can change directions.

Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension last year for domestic violence provided a natural experiment of sorts: since picking Elliott, the Cowboys have gone 19-7 with him and 3-3 without him. Elliott\u2019s apparent importance is a strong argument for Barkley\u2019s.\n\nIn a recent interview, Dilfer all but drew up plays for Barkley, fantasizing about bringing him out of the backfield before the snap and matching him up against a too-slow opposing linebacker.\n\nPlayers like Elliott and Barkley, Dilfer said, make \u201ceveryone\u2019s job easier.

Polling suggests that only a minority \u2013 and probably a declining minority \u2014 of the public considers the Trump tax cut a good idea. Most people don\u2019t see any benefits from the tax cut in their paychecks. And Republicans have pretty much given up campaigning on the tax cut.\n\nVoters are, of course, right to have negative views about TCJA. It\u2019s a mess of a bill; it will do little for economic growth, while increased deficits will create pressure to cut social insurance programs that affect many more people than the relative handful of wealthy stockholders who will win big. But voters should have been negative about the Bush tax cut too. Why do voters seem so much more woke? Why is this time different?\n\nOne possible answer might be that Trump is doing even less for ordinary voters than Bush. But I don\u2019t think the numbers support that argument. The initial effect of the tax cuts in TCJA will be to raise income for the middle quintile by 1.4 percent; for EGGTRA, the first Bush tax cut, that number was 2.2 percent, but that was an overall bigger tax cut relative to the economy. Distributionally, the two tax cuts were broadly similar \u2013 as I said, big stuff for the rich, plus what amount to loss leaders for the middle class.\n\nAnother answer might be that the Bush tax cut was pushed through in a very different fiscal environment. Readers of a certain age may recall that when Bush ran in 2000, the U.S. actually had a budget surplus \u2013 which he claimed simply to be giving back to voters. But during the Obama years voters were subjected to constant scare talk about deficits and debt \u2013 some from centrist scolds, some from the very Republicans who rammed through their tax cut. This may have made voters more aware of the downside to big tax cuts for the rich, even if they got a bit themselves.\n\nFinally, many people \u2013 rightly \u2013 don\u2019t trust anything associated with Trump. Now, Bush officials were systematically deceptive in everything they said about tax policy (and much else); but Bush didn\u2019t tweet out four or five blatant lies every day, and it took both the Iraq debacle and Katrina to finally wake up voters and the media to the Bush administration\u2019s relatively subtle although deep dishonesty.\n\nAnyway, whatever the reason, the tax cut is looking like the political loser it deserves to be.

T.S.A. has also enacted stricter passenger screening measures to prevent terrorists from boarding planes.\n\nWith a small work force, air marshals are able to protect only a small fraction of the more than 42,000 flights in the United States each day.

{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "S.P.: Yes, and I respond that denying progress can make us fatalistic: If all our efforts at improving the human condition have failed, why throw good money after bad? More generally, people are so jaded by the narrative of decline that they can\u2019t think coherently about progress; the concept just doesn\u2019t compute. I\u2019m regularly confronted with an example of something that has gone wrong, like the opioid epidemic or a rampage shooting, as a refutation of progress \u2014 as if progress meant that everything gets better for everyone everywhere always. That wouldn\u2019t be progress; that would be magic. Progress consists of solving problems, and problems are inevitable. So of course things can get worse for some people sometimes. A more sensible way to think about progress is the framing by Barack Obama, presumably channeling John Rawls: If you had to choose a time to be born and you didn\u2019t know who you\u2019d be or where you\u2019d be, what time would you choose? The answer is now.\n\nD.B.: Of the advances you cite in the book, what three strike you as the most important?\n\nS.P.: The components that go into the Human Development Index, namely being healthy, wealthy and wise. We live longer: Life expectancy at birth worldwide is now 71 years, and in the developed world, 80 years; through most of human existence it was around 30. Global extreme poverty has declined to 9.6 percent of the world population; 200 years ago, it was at 90 percent. In just the last 30 years, extreme poverty has declined by 75 percent \u2014 a stupendous achievement that is almost entirely unappreciated. Equally unappreciated is the fact that 90 percent of the world\u2019s population under the age of 25 can read and write, including girls. In most of the history of Europe, no more than 15 percent could read and write, mostly men.\n\nD.B.: Do you think a reluctance to point to progress inhibits our ability to achieve more progress?\n\nS.P.: Yes, particularly among liberals, who in joining the chorus of decline have unilaterally disarmed in the fight for judicious regulation and social spending. Take pollution. Since the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, air pollution (aside from carbon dioxide) has fallen by 60 percent, even as Americans have become more populous and richer and have driven more miles. But because many liberals today can\u2019t bring themselves to acknowledge progress, they have cleared the field for opponents of regulation like Scott Pruitt to claim that the regulations have done no good and have only cramped our lives and dragged down the economy. Rather than saying \u201cEnvironmental regulation has improved the environment while allowing the economy to grow,\u201d they have said, ineffectually, \u201cIf you oppose regulation, you\u2019re a bad person.\u201d\n\nThe same is true with poverty. Ronald Reagan famously wisecracked, \u201cSome years ago, the federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won.\u201d Few liberals would disagree. But Reagan was mistaken. If you factor in government social spending, such as the earned-income tax credit, rates of poverty have declined significantly. But here again liberals hand their opponents a weapon: the conclusion that all social programs are ineffective.\n\nD.B.: Journalists typically write about sudden rather than gradual changes. But progress unfolds slowly. How could the news better reflect it?\n\nS.P.: If I were an editor, I\u2019d impose a rule that before a pundit writes about any putative change or trend, he or she must compare the present to the past. Commentators should be more data-oriented, especially now that data are so much more widely available. Also, I\u2019d put the kibosh on a pernicious journalistic habit: reporting a small reversal in a trend (because it\u2019s \u201cnews\u201d) while ignoring the far more numerous year-by-year improvements (because they\u2019re not news). This is journalistic malpractice, because it gives readers an impression that is opposite to reality.\n\nD.B.: You\u2019ve noted that our perception of reality is subject to a number of cognitive biases, such as the \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d and \u201cnegativity bias.\u201d What can we do about it?", "title": "Opinion | Scared by the News?

If this new book lacks some of the range and depth and allusiveness of that earlier book, well, she has battened down certain hatches.\n\nThe most memorable lines in \u201cLife on Mars\u201d were perhaps these, and they linger too over Smith\u2019s new book:\n\nThe worst thing you can imagine has already\n\nZipped up its coat and is heading back\n\nUp the road to wherever it came from.\n\nIn 2018, you are nobody without an acronym. If Smith, America\u2019s PLOTUS, has a new book out, so does PEONY \u2014 that is, the poetry editor of The New Yorker. Kevin Young is still relatively new in that influential position; he is also the director of Harlem\u2019s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese poets are friends. They attended Harvard two years apart. Young wrote the introduction to Smith\u2019s first book of poems, \u201cThe Body\u2019s Question\u201d (2003). They are very different writers.\n\nYoung is a maximalist, a putter-inner, an evoker of roiling appetites. As a poet of music and food, his only rival is Charles Simic. His love poems are beautiful and sexy and ecstatic.\n\nHe mostly wears his politics lightly but regularly sinks hooks into you that cannot easily be removed. His book of selected poems, \u201cBlue Laws\u201d (2016), is as indispensable as any volume this decade. It is a delivery system for many varieties of complicated and uncomplicated joy.\n\nYoung produces so much that his audience can become stupefied. He writes books of cultural criticism, edits anthologies and composes so much poetry that he sometimes issues what he calls outtakes and remixes from earlier work.\n\nKeeping up with him is like trying to keep up with Bob Dylan or Prince in their primes. Even the bootlegs have bootlegs. His manic-impressive productivity can lead to soft spots in his work, which is why \u201cBlue Laws,\u201d a judicious paring down, is so valuable.\n\nYoung\u2019s new book, \u201cBrown,\u201d is vital and sophisticated without surpassing anything he\u2019s done before. It\u2019s a solid midcareer statement.\n\nA few of its poems are explicitly political. One is about Trayvon Martin; another is titled \u201cA Brown Atlanta Boy Watches Basketball on West 4th. Meanwhile, Neo-Nazis March on Charlottesville, Virginia.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nYoung has long been investigating the lives, art and lingering meanings of black cultural figures. He seems to know everything and everyone. Playlists and bookstore receipts and theater stubs and archive call slips seem to spill from his pockets. Indeed, he once referred to what he called \u201cmy magpiety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this book there are excellent poems that name-check or investigate more closely people like Lead Belly, Tracy Chapman, Hank Aaron, the painter Jacob Lawrence and the jazz guitarist Charlie Christian. One poem is titled, after the rapper, \u201cOde to Ol Dirty Bastard.\u201d\n\nOther poems in this book revisit the author\u2019s childhood in the Midwest: dodgeball games, RC Cola, Atari, wrestling coaches, health teachers and casual and not-so-casual racism.\n\nYoung evokes his \u201cbaby dreads, tortoiseshells, tight fade.\u201d He cannot help but be a poet of micro-felicities. Watching Arthur Ashe on television, he observes:\n\nYour hair a microphone cover\n\nto help keep\n\nthe static down.\n\n\u201cWe were black then, about to be / African American,\u201d he writes about his school days, before adding that he and his friends had\n\ngiven the campus cops the slip\n\nwhenever they quizzed or frisked us\n\nfor studying while black.\n\nThe key to a certain kind of songwriting, it\u2019s been said, is to deliver blues in the verse and gospel in the chorus. There\u2019s not a lot of gospel in these two books \u2014 just a strong, wary sense of watching and waiting.", "title": "Scorching, Sophisticated New Work From Two of America\u2019s Leading Poets", "authors": ["Dwight Garner", "Books Of The Times"]}

While shell companies are legal, they often obscure the people who have an interest in them, and none of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s financial disclosure filings in Oklahoma mentioned the company or the proceeds \u2014 a potential violation of the state\u2019s ethics rules.\n\nThe Oklahoma City deal, which has not been previously reported, was one of several instances in which Mr. Pruitt appeared to have benefited from his relationships with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Wagner while in state politics.\n\nDuring his eight years as a Republican state senator, Mr. Pruitt also upgraded his family residence in suburban Tulsa from a small ranch-style home to a lakefront property in a gated community. In addition, he bought a sizable stake in a minor league baseball team, and took a second job at Mr. Wagner\u2019s corporate law firm. Mr. Kelly\u2019s bank, SpiritBank, would be there for much of it \u2014 providing financing for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s Tulsa home and his stake in the baseball team, as well as the mortgage for the Oklahoma City house.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s interactions with SBC also show that his blurring of lines with lobbyists has roots in his Oklahoma years. One of the issues at the E.P.A. that has gotten Mr. Pruitt in trouble with government watchdogs involved his renting a room in Washington for $50 a night from the wife of an energy lobbyist who has had business in front of the agency.\n\nLobbyists and others in Oklahoma state politics who encountered Mr. Pruitt recalled him as a tough competitor who always had his eye on a higher office. Some called him a \u201cBoy Scout\u201d who was stingy with his money, while others said privately that he had exuded a sense of entitlement \u2014 that rules did not apply to him.", "title": "Scott Pruitt Before the E.P.A.: Fancy Homes, a Shell Company and Friends With Money", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "Julianna Goldman of CBS News reported yesterday that Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, wanted to use his car\u2019s sirens and lights to get through traffic one day last year in Washington. The agent in charge of his security detail said that the siren was only for emergencies. \u201cLess than two weeks later that agent was removed from Pruitt\u2019s detail,\u201d Goldman reported.\n\nAnother scoop, in The Times, reports that revenge is a pattern for Pruitt: \u201cAt least five officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, four of them high-ranking, were reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs in the past year after they raised concerns about the spending and management of the agency\u2019s administrator, Scott Pruitt.\u201d\n\nThese are further signs of Pruitt\u2019s unethical selfishness. He is also under fire for getting a sweetheart deal on renting a Capitol Hill apartment, among other things. His top policy adviser has decided to resign, and his chief of staff has pondered doing the same, The Times reported yesterday.\n\nIf the Pruitt story feels familiar, there\u2019s good reason. It is strikingly similar to that of several other Trump cabinet officials. \u201cPruitt is in many ways the perfect embodiment of the Trump administration,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Waldman wrote this week, \u201ccombining blatant personal corruption with an appalling policy agenda utterly inimical to the interests of the country.\u201d In Pruitt\u2019s case, the policy agenda \u2014 which will damage air quality and the climate \u2014 is particularly worrisome.\n\nIn the early months of the administration, I would have voted for Tom Price, then the secretary of health and human services, as the worst cabinet member. He has a history of using government jobs to enrich himself, and he was trying to take health insurance away from millions. But Price\u2019s fondness for private jets did him in, and Trump forced him out. So I\u2019ll vote with Gail now: Pruitt has the top spot.\n\nElsewhere: In New York magazine, Jonathan Chait argues that the corrupt self-dealing of Trump and his aides should be a central campaign theme for the Democrats in the midterms.\n\nChait\u2019s piece is titled \u201cCorruption, not Russia, is Trump\u2019s greatest political liability.\u201d He writes: \u201cHistorically, corruption \u2014 specifically, the use of power for personal gain \u2014 has played a central and even dominant role in American political discourse.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Scott Pruitt Doesn\u2019t Stop for Traffic Lights", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "In addition, he tripled the size of his security detail, also at taxpayer expense. He ordered bodyguard coverage 24 hours a day. He insisted on flashing lights and sirens to take him to the airport and to restaurants, a perk customarily reserved for the president and vice president. He rented a room at $50 a night, well below market rates, in a Washington condominium co-owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before Mr. Pruitt\u2019s agency.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get everything he and his team wanted: a bulletproof sport utility vehicle, for instance, equipped with special tires designed to keep moving even when hit by gunfire; a $100,000-a-month contract to fly on private jets. But heaven help the E.P.A. staff members bold enough to challenge these demands. The Times reported this month that five agency officials \u2014 including Mr. Chmielewski \u2014 who objected to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s costly requests and security upgrades were dismissed, reassigned or demoted.\n\nOne frequently overlooked truth about Mr. Pruitt amid these complaints is that for all his swagger he has actually accomplished very little in terms of actual policy \u2014 a wholly desirable outcome, from our standpoint. While hailed as the administration\u2019s foremost champion of deregulation, he has yet to kill or even roll back any significant regulations that were in place when Mr. Trump came to office. (The Obama administration\u2019s important Clean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants had already been blocked by the courts.) He has delayed a few rules, but even these delays have been overturned or challenged. Most of his actions are in the proposal stage, and many will not be finalized for years, if ever.\n\nThat does not mean Mr. Pruitt has been without baleful influence. He helped spearhead the effort to get Mr. Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change, a major insult to every other nation on earth, all of which have agreed to limit planet-warming greenhouse gases.\n\nBy endless repetition, he has reinforced in the public mind the lie that Republicans have peddled for years and Mr. Trump\u2019s minions peddle now, that environmental rules kill jobs, that limiting carbon dioxide emissions will damage the economy, that the way forward lies not in technology and renewable energy but in digging more coal and punching more holes in the ground in search of oil. And, on the human level, he has been in the forefront of the administration\u2019s shameless effort to delude the nation\u2019s frightened coal miners into thinking coal is coming back, when any comeback is unlikely not because of regulation but because of strong market forces favoring natural gas and renewables.\n\nShould Mr. Pruitt choose to depart \u2014 even some Republicans are complaining about his behavior \u2014 or by some miracle should Mr. Trump fire him, the administration\u2019s appalling environmental policies are unlikely to change. The recently confirmed deputy administrator, Andrew Wheeler, is a former coal industry lobbyist who shares Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deregulatory zeal and fealty to the fossil fuels industry. Mr. Wheeler was for many years chief of staff for James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and long the Senate\u2019s most determined denier of the accepted science on global warming.", "title": "Opinion | Scott Pruitt Has Become Ridiculous", "authors": []}

Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation was fiercely opposed by Democrats, environmentalists and even E.P.A. employees. Since taking the helm of the agency, Mr. Pruitt has worked to strip the E.P.A. of funding, reduce its staff and curb its ability to develop new regulations on fossil fuel pollution.\n\nNo E.P.A. director in history has achieved Mr. Pruitt\u2019s level of notoriety. Since the agency was formed, its administrators have been second-tier Washington figures. But Mr. Pruitt\u2019s antagonism toward climate science has made him a nationally-prominent and divisive figure.\n\nCritics said that more than the ethical and spending issues, the real damage to the E.P.A. has been Mr. Pruitt\u2019s systematic weakening of the agency\u2019s ability to protect the environment and public health. While Mr. Pruitt\u2019s performance in Thursday\u2019s hearings may make or break his future within the Trump administration, many said his legacy was already set.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a flagrant, shameless series of calculated decisions to dismantle the country\u2019s most successful domestic enterprise,\u201d William K.

Mr. Pruitt has said the decision was taken by his chief of staff, Ryan Jackson.\n\n\u201cDid you authorize Mr. Jackson to sign those documents for you?\u201d Mr. Tonko asked.\n\n\u201cI was not aware of the amount and I was not aware of the bypassing that was going on,\u201d Mr. Pruitt replied.\n\nEven some Republicans criticized Mr. Pruitt for repeatedly blaming his staff.\n\n\u201cIf you say give me a phone booth, and your staff does it, you should say, I\u2019m at fault,\u201d said Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the House Energy subcommittee, speaking to reporters after the morning hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s never good to blame your staff. Or at least do it behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nAnd Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat, used her turn at questioning to try to get Mr. Pruitt to accept culpability. \u201cYou have a solid record of violating ethics rules from the state level to the federal government,\u201d she told Mr. Pruitt. \u201cI think it\u2019s an embarrassment.\u201d And then she asked, \u201cDo you have any remorse?

I\u2019ve made a change from first class to coach travel.\u201d Ms. Eshoo returned to her call for a yes-or-no answer, and asked Mr. Pruitt whether he would reimburse the government. He launched into a long response, but she cut him off.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, I may be elected, but I\u2019m not a fool,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not \u2018dodge-question\u2019 day.\u201d", "title": "Scott Pruitt, on Capitol Hill, Deflects Blame for Ethical Lapses", "authors": ["Coral Davenport", "Lisa Friedman"]}

Years later, Dwight Eisenhower set aside as wilderness several million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

They feature some familiar civil rights voices, most notably those of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee activists John Lewis and Diane Nash, and reveal how King\u2019s relationships with the news media and the movement waned dramatically in his final years.

He said artificial light can bring out colors an artist never considered, which is why, even now, restorers normally work in natural light and museums traditionally put their painting galleries on the top floor, beneath skylights.\n\n\u201cThe old masters would have been painted in that kind of light,\u201d Mr. Christiansen said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t meant to be shown heavily spotlighted. The ideal is to simulate the kind of light they were painted under.\u201d\n\nBetween the skylights in the roof and the glazed ceilings (known as laylights) above the galleries is a world that art lovers never see. But it affects what they see in the art they love, because it affects the light that reaches the paintings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis unseen world has wide louvers that are supposed to open and close, depending on the time of the year and the path of the sun. \u201cAlmost all of them don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Christiansen said.\n\nIt is a world with \u2014 yes \u2014 rows of spotlights that are supposed to simulate the natural light. \u201cOn a good day, you can leave them off,\u201d Mr. Christiansen said.

In a typical year, Manhattan has 131 days when clouds cover 80 percent of the sky, and another 127 days that are cloudy but less so.\n\nIt is this hidden world that Mr. Christiansen is working to rebuild. It is easily the length of a couple of football fields and taller in places than the goal posts at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. It has metal columns and beams that look like components from a giant Erector Set, painted white.\n\nIts age is showing: Some panes have leaked, staining the louvers. \u201cSome of the louvers have deteriorated to such a point that the light is entering unfiltered,\u201d Mr. Christiansen said. \u201cThis means that in some galleries, we get too much light; in other galleries, insufficient light.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Christiansen said that Gallery 637, the current home of \u201cAristotle With a Bust of Homer,\u201d is in the too-much-light category, with the brightness exaggerating the contrasts Rembrandt intended.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat means that seasonal variations in the sun\u2019s path over the Met, and in the light reaching the galleries, cannot be controlled, and that during the spring and summer, \u201cthe light levels actually exceed what we would consider appropriate.\u201d (\u201cAristotle\u201d will move twice during the renovations \u2014 first to temporary quarters, then to the Robert Lehman Wing downstairs. Another 75 canvases from the European paintings galleries will go to the Lehman Wing in October for the exhibition \u201cIn Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at the Met.\u201d It will bring them together with some of the Met\u2019s greatest paintings of the Dutch Golden Age.)\n\nBack on the second floor, the famous Goya \u201cManuel Osorio Manrique de Zu\u00f1iga\u201d will look somewhat richer and more vivid. It has been in Gallery 612, which Mr. Christiansen said receives little natural light during the winter months.\n\n\u201cThere will be a real gain in the visibility of the picture,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Christiansen said he was treating all the moves that will put familiar paintings in unfamiliar galleries and groupings as the prelude to \u201can experimental period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interim hanging presents us with an opportunity to think about the collection in new configurations, with new juxtapositions,\u201d he said. Where the arrangement of the paintings used to be \u201cbased primarily on geography and chronology, this takes us away from that. Now we\u2019re looking for cross-national dialogues.\u201d\n\nAnd so \u201cThe Meditation on the Passion\u201d by the Venetian Vittore Carpaccio, is going next to \u201cVirgin and Child With Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara\u201d by Hans Memling, who was born in Germany, died in Belgium and is remembered as an early Netherlandish painter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all looked at them and said there\u2019s a kinetic energy going on that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting two people together whom you know very well but who\u2019ve never sat down together before, and there\u2019s a fantastic conversation.

Women have made great gains in orchestras in recent decades, especially since the advent of blind auditions, in which job applicants try out behind screens. But racial diversity has been slow to come to American orchestras, which are looking less and less like the cities in which they play.\n\nOrchestras remained 85 percent white in 2014, according to the league, and most of their modest rise in racial diversity in recent years was driven by an increase in the number of musicians of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage. Hispanic musicians made up only 2.5 percent of orchestra players in 2014, up from 1.8 percent in 2002. Small orchestras were more racially diverse than large ones.\n\nMany factors have been cited as contributing to the problem, from the lack of diversity at the conservatories that make up the pipeline of trained musicians to blind auditions, which helped with gender equity but make it harder for orchestras to choose talented players of color. The new initiative, supported by a four-year, $1.8 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, aims to help black and Hispanic musicians navigate the challenging audition process \u2014 where it is not uncommon for hundreds of talented, well-trained candidates to find themselves competing for a single opening.\n\nThe program, being called the National Alliance for Audition Support, will begin in June, when 18 string players will go to Miami to train with the New World Symphony, a renowned orchestral academy, at a three-day intensive course in preparing for auditions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good bit of that that\u2019s musical training, but there\u2019s also psychological training,\u201d said Howard Herring, the president of New World, who said that the players would all sit through mock auditions that seek to replicate real ones.\n\nThe Sphinx Organization, a national group based in Detroit and devoted to fostering diversity in music, will administer the program, and give concerts to showcase the musicians to the industry. Afa S. Dworkin, the president and artistic director of Sphinx, said in a statement that it was \u201ca critical time for all of us to act with renewed commitment and drive to help our orchestras to be more reflective of their communities.\u201d", "title": "Seeking Orchestras in Tune With Their Diverse Communities", "authors": []}

However, legal experts say the government could be less successful in bringing such cases without the guidance from a government agency saying the practices are viewed as improper.\n\nA 2011 report from the Center for Responsible Lending analyzed loan level data and found that African-Americans and Latinos were receiving higher numbers of interest rate markups on their car loans than white consumers. The bureau issued guidance in 2013 urging auto lenders to curb discriminatory lending practices and used that guidance to justify lawsuits that they brought against auto finance companies.\n\nIn late 2013, Ally Financial agreed to pay $98 million to settle accusations that it discriminated against minority borrowers who were charged more than white customers for auto loans by car dealers. The consumer bureau, along with the Department of Justice, also scored big settlements from American Honda Fifth Third Bank.\n\nThe settlements rankled Republicans who argued that the consumer bureau was using \u201cjunk science\u201d to make the case that auto lenders were discriminating against customers on the basis of race.\n\nThe Senate vote comes as companies face increased scrutiny for discriminatory practices.

But Mr. Graham \u2014 or, at least, someone in his office \u2014 already appeared to have some fluency in both platforms. After Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Graham posted his statement on the hearings to Facebook and uploaded a screenshot of his statement to Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, early in the hearing, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked Mr. Zuckerberg, \u201cHow do you sustain a business model in which users don\u2019t pay for your service?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg responded, providing a basic fact that\u2019s central to Facebook\u2019s operations.\n\nMr. Hatch (whose office later said on Twitter that his remarks were intended to make a point about transparency) has had a Facebook page since 2009 and has posted there 188 times in the past year.\n\nThough many of the questions the 44 senators asked Mr. Zuckerberg suggested some confusion over how his company operates, all of those senators still use his platform as an important communication tool.\n\nFacebook, on a section of its website addressing politicians and government institutions, says its tools \u201chelp increase two-way conversations between government officials and the people they represent.\u201d It encourages elected officials to build a following by sharing behind-the-scenes content and engaging with fans and constituents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe senators who questioned Mr. Zuckerberg on Tuesday appeared to take that advice to heart.

In a 2014 survey, about 80 percent of Americans said they didn\u2019t feel secure using social media to share private information. And a survey released in 2017 found that close to half of Americans didn\u2019t trust social networking sites like Facebook to protect their information.\n\nDespite those attitudes, Facebook remains widely adopted in the United States, and the gulf between opinions about the site and the behavior of its users has led some to posit that Facebook may be too ubiquitous for users to quit.

Senegal, a peaceful West African democracy, offered to take them in, and both were resettled there in April 2016.\n\nResettlement agreements typically included a promise by the receiving country not to let former detainees travel abroad for two years. Mr. Kassem said he and his client, called Omar Khalifa Mohammed Abu Bakr in Defense Department documents, understood that the resettlement offer was for permanent residency, although officials familiar with such agreements said they are ambiguous about longer-term prospects.\n\nLast week, the two former detainees received the notices, written in Arabic, that they would be deported to Libya, prompting Mr. Kassem to begin raising alarms.\n\nA phone call from Mr. Wolosky, who stepped down in January 2017, may have helped stop an attempt to deport Mr. Khalifa for now. Mr. Wolosky reached out to the diplomat last week after a Times reporter called him about the issue, and said his inquiry appeared to bring to the attention of high-level Senegalese officials that midlevel civil servants were trying to send both men to Libya. The Intercept also published an article on Saturday about Mr. Khalifa\u2019s feared deportation.\n\nOn Sunday, Omar Bald\u00e9, an official with the Senegalese ministry of communications, said Mr. Khalifa was not going to be deported.\n\nStill, in the interview over orange juice on Tuesday morning at Mr. Khalifa\u2019s apartment, both men said they had not been told the deportation was off. While Mr. Ghereby said his family ties would probably protect him from violent militias in Libya, Mr. Khalifa said he had no such connections and feared for his life. He also said he was engaged to a Senegalese woman.\n\nIt was unclear why Senegalese officials wanted to deport the men, but both had many complaints about their life in Senegal. They had also repeatedly visited the United States Embassy to air grievances, including a desire for larger meals. Neither man had been issued identification papers, which they had been promised, they said, and would allow them greater flexibility for travel.

His voice is heard everywhere, in cafes, homes and government offices across the land.\n\nHis favorite recipe: attacking people his supporters love to hate, be it the United States, European leaders or the liberal elite.\n\nTo his support base, Mr. Erdogan talks like a father, a brother, or the man next door. \u201cHe is one of us,\u201d supporters often explain. And he says what he thinks, in salty, everyday language, just like them.\n\n\u201cAnd now they have a foreign minister \u2014 oh, my God \u2014 what a disaster,\u201d Mr. Erdogan railed to supporters in the western region of Denizli last summer, at the height of his country\u2019s tensions with Germany.\n\n\u201cHe never knows his place,\u201d Mr. Erdogan continued. \u201cWho are you \u2014 Ha! \u2014 speaking to the president of Turkey? You are talking to the foreign minister of Turkey. Know your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he attempts to give us a lesson. What is your history in politics? How old are you?

He drops his voice with reverence to honor fallen soldiers, and then raises it to stir national pride.\n\nThe religious sermonizing is very much part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s training. He studied at a religious school for prayer leaders and preachers, learning among his courses Islamic preaching.\n\nLiberals and secularists have often criticized his divisive speech, and his introduction of religion into politics, yet it is what most of his pious Muslim followers want to hear.\n\n\u201cFor conservatives this is someone defending their lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said.\n\nA smooth practitioner with a teleprompter, he has a well-honed rhetorical style. In almost every speech there is a moment when he shakes up the audience, suddenly switching gears.\n\nHe turns from declarative speech to address directly, in imperative or interrogative style, whoever is the target of the day.\n\nHe has been particularly irritated by the United States\u2019 alliance in Syria with the People\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., a Kurdish group that Turkey says is linked to terrorism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHey America!

As the agency\u2019s special prosecutor, she was one of its highest-ranking officials, and after months of feeling that the agency\u2019s acting director had created a \u201cfrat-house culture,\u201d including having an inappropriate relationship with a staffer, she confronted him.\n\nThe retaliation was immediate, according to Ms. Gunning. In June of that year, after the director, Jay Kiyonaga, shouted at her so loudly that several colleagues sent her emails afterward asking if she was all right, she reported him to the Justice Center\u2019s general counsel.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry found that \u201ceveryone confirmed\u201d Ms. Gunning\u2019s account of Mr. Kiyonaga \u201craising his voice and swearing at you,\u201d according to a recording of a conversation, obtained by The Times, between Ms. Gunning and the counsel, Robin Forshaw.\n\nBut the incident \u201cdidn\u2019t raise with us the idea\u201d that it needed to be reported further, Ms. Forshaw said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve told him he should just watch it, and not do that kind of thing,\u201d she said.\n\nThe agency had written a memo about the incident, but it would not go in Mr. Kiyonaga\u2019s file. If Ms. Gunning wanted to continue pursuing the complaint, Ms. Forshaw said, she could \u201cmake a report of discrimination or retaliation with our affirmative action officer, the Division of Human Rights, the E.E.O.C.\n\n\u201cYou could also, I guess, potentially make a workplace violence complaint, if that\u2019s what your concern is,\u201d Ms. Forshaw added.\n\nUnder a 10-step procedure devised by the governor\u2019s office for state agencies, internal complaints are supposed to be investigated by an affirmative action officer. But Ms. Gunning said she did not speak to the Justice Center\u2019s affirmative action liaison until after Ms. Forshaw\u2019s call.\n\nMs. Gunning contacted the liaison herself, and the liaison referred the complaint to the Governor\u2019s Office on Employee Relations. Investigators there, working with the Office of General Services, determined the complaint was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d according to Christine Buttigieg, a Justice Center spokeswoman. (Ms. Gunning said she was never informed of the results of that investigation.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Gunning then approached the governor\u2019s office directly. In an Oct. 26, 2017, letter to Mr. David and the governor\u2019s secretary, Melissa DeRosa, she asked them to review her complaint, offering to share the recorded conversation. Mr. David replied to say he had referred her inquiry to the inspector general.\n\nThat investigation is still open. Ms. Gunning said she had heard from the inspector general\u2019s office only twice since October.\n\n\u201cHere you have the governor talking about all this stuff, but you don\u2019t see many state employees coming forward, right, because why would you?\u201d Ms. Gunning said. \u201cGiven that I was at the top of my agency \u2014 if you witnessed what happened to me, why would you ever come forward?\u201d\n\nMr. David said it was inaccurate to suggest that the state was trying to skirt accountability by referring complaints to different agencies.\n\n\u201cIf an agency conducts an investigation, and they make a determination that the claim is unsubstantiated, the reason why the case is referred to another agency is because the complainant doesn\u2019t like the result,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ms. Gunning said she had no choice but to bring her story to multiple agencies, because no single one provided a fair, thorough investigation.\n\n\u201cI literally had no idea where to go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe burden should not be on victims of sexual harassment, discrimination or abuse to wade through multiple inconsistent and unsafe options.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo Inquiries, Two Findings\n\nAt the Division of Criminal Justice Services, after complaints surfaced against a senior official there, the referral order was reversed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast December, the state inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, wrote a letter informing the criminal justice agency\u2019s deputy commissioner that the official, Brian J.

The inspector general\u2019s office found that Mr. Gestring, the director of the agency\u2019s Office of Forensic Science, had told employees they needed to \u201chump more\u201d and had threatened to hurt a female employee. It recommended that the agency \u201ctake action as you deem appropriate\u201d against Mr. Gestring, according to the letter, which was first reported by The Albany Times Union.\n\nThe criminal justice division\u2019s investigation, in contrast, concluded that the allegations were unsubstantiated, according to an agency spokeswoman, Janine Kava.\n\nOne employee who had testified against Mr. Gestring, Kimberly Schiavone, was transferred to another office within the agency, and another, Gina Bianchi, was fired and then reinstated to a demoted position. Mr. Gestring remained in his position.\n\nAfter the women announced their intention to sue the state for retaliation and equal protection violations, Mr. David said he referred the retaliation claims to the Governor\u2019s Office of Employee Relations; the harassment claims, as well as the conflicting findings of the two previous investigations, went to the Joint Commission on Public Ethics. Both of those inquiries remain unresolved.\n\nJohn W. Bailey, a lawyer for the women, said the inspector general\u2019s findings should have stood.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that certain people are not happy with the inspector general\u2019s report,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want someone else to say, \u2018We\u2019ve taken a look at this, and we don\u2019t agree.\u2019\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s statutes offer little guidance as to how these various investigative bodies are to coexist, and which might get priority over another.\n\nThe public ethics commission is responsible for investigating violations of the state\u2019s public officers law, which does not explicitly refer to sexual harassment but requires officials to follow a \u201ccourse of conduct which will not raise suspicion among the public.\u201d The inspector general\u2019s office investigates allegations including \u201cabuse\u201d in executive agencies. The Division of Human Rights prosecutes \u201cunlawful discriminatory practices,\u201d and the Governor\u2019s Office of Employee Relations \u201cpromotes and maintains a safe and healthy workplace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach state agency is also required to have its own procedures for addressing discrimination complaints.\n\nKarl Sleight, the former executive director of the now-defunct New York State Ethics Commission, compared the development of state ethics bodies to the accumulation of shale.\n\n\u201cYou have layer upon layer upon layer, and it\u2019s reactionary. It\u2019s by virtue of something happening \u2014 some kind of scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these laws developed, how these agencies developed, and how their jurisdiction developed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually not with a clear central purpose. It\u2019s to deal with the crisis du jour.\u201d\n\nMr. David said that in the case of concurrent complaints, one agency might postpone its investigation until another\u2019s had finished. But he acknowledged the potential for conflict.\n\n\u201cIt may create confusion for an agency to do the same investigation where it\u2019s interviewing the same people, reviewing the same documents, soliciting the same information,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd despite its investigative muscle, which includes subpoena power, the inspector general\u2019s office has no enforcement authority; it can only recommend action. The public ethics commission can issue fines, but only for specific violations, such as improper financial disclosures. For others, including conduct that might \u201craise suspicion,\u201d it too makes recommendations.\n\nMr. David conceded that the myriad complaint venues could have inadvertently negative effects. If two agencies arrived at different conclusions, complainants could lean on the one in their favor \u2014 \u201cbut be aware,\u201d Mr. David said, that defendants could do the same.\n\n\u201cIf you file a complaint with 30 different agencies, it may actually hurt you,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nTurning a Blind Eye\n\nIn the third case, Lisa Marie Cater, an employee of the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles, dealt with multiple authorities after accusing Sam Hoyt, a regional president of the Empire State Development Corporation, New York\u2019s main economic development arm, of sexual harassment and abuse. Ms. Cater filed a federal lawsuit against Mr. Hoyt and Mr. Cuomo in November, alleging the governor\u2019s office had turned a blind eye to her complaint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hoyt, a former assemblyman from Buffalo, had previously been sanctioned after having an affair with an intern.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ms. Cater tried several times to report Mr. Hoyt\u2019s harassment to the governor\u2019s office but was consistently ignored.\n\nEventually, she was contacted by a lawyer with the Office of General Services, Noreen VanDoren. Ms. VanDoren, the lawsuit said, referred Ms. Cater to the inspector general\u2019s office. From there, she was put in touch with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office, which has denied any wrongdoing, says it referred Ms. Cater\u2019s complaint to the public ethics commission after she refused to cooperate with the inspector general\u2019s office. It has consistently pointed to the multiple investigations as evidence that the lawsuit is baseless.\n\n\u201cThe state launched three separate investigations in this matter, and any assertion to the contrary is patently and demonstrably false,\u201d Mr. David said after the suit was filed.\n\nThe lawsuit is still active. The other complaints, too, remain unresolved.\n\nMs. Gunning resigned from the justice center last August. Ms. Schiavone and Ms. Bianchi remain in their demoted or transferred positions at the Division of Criminal Justice Services. Ms. Cater is on unpaid sick leave from the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nMr. Kiyonaga is now executive deputy commissioner of the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, the state\u2019s second-largest agency. Mr. Hoyt resigned from the state development corporation; after he announced his departure, top state officials, including the lieutenant governor, praised his work record.\n\nMr. Gestring, at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, was fired on March 22 \u2014 but not because of the inspector general\u2019s findings, according to an agency spokeswoman.\n\nHe was fired, she said, for a separate set of \u201cinappropriate remarks.\u201d", "title": "Sex Harassment Complaints in New York Fall Into an Enforcement Maze", "authors": ["Vivian Wang"]}
{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "Among those who identify with the \u201cincel\u201d movement, there is a pathological fixation on sex and women, and there is a self-pitying perception that everyone else, except the community of \u201cincels,\u201d is having sex. Women are craved, but they are also reviled for what the incels believe is their selective promiscuity: They seem to be having sex with everyone but them. This is internalized as a grave personal insult. The function of the \u201cincel\u201d movement is to transform that personal grievance into an ideology that casts women as despicable sexual objects.\n\nThe core emotion that animates \u201cincels\u201d is sexual shame. It\u2019s not just that these men are sexually frustrated; it\u2019s that they are ashamed of their sexual failure. At the same time, they are resentful of the sexual success of others, which amplifies their own sense of inadequacy. This explains why they gravitate toward an online subculture that strives to rationalize their shame and redirect the blame for their failure onto women.\n\nLike incels, jihadists similarly crave sex, but the circumstances surrounding its consummation are closely regulated by their religious norms, which prohibit sex outside of marriage and same-sex couplings. Among jihadists, even masturbation is frowned upon, although Osama bin Laden famously issued a masturbation fatwa, permitting it in times of urgent need.\n\nThis repressive attitude toward sex and sexuality has led some commentators to suggest a connection between sexual frustration and the murderous rage of jihadist suicide bombers. The evolutionary biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins, for example, suggested that far from being motivated by thoughts of injustice, the Sept. 11 hijackers were driven by thoughts of sex. Referring to the \u201cmartyr\u2019s reward of 72 virgin brides,\u201d he asserted that \u201ctestosterone-sodden young men too unattractive to get a woman in this world might be desperate enough to go for 72 private virgins in the next.\u201d Developing this theme further, the late Christopher Hitchens wrote that the jihadists\u2019 \u201cproblem is not so much that they desire virgins as that they are virgins.\u201d Or as the sociologist Mark Juergensmeyer once put it: \u201cCan\u2019t get married, can\u2019t have sex, so they blow things up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss these observations as reductive caricatures in their portrayal of Muslims as sexually repressed. And, of course, jihadist violence is about far more than just sexual frustration. But there is too much anecdotal evidence about the sexual torment of jihadists and their ideologues to reject the connection outright. For example, Sayyid Qutb, the grandfather of jihadist ideology, was disgusted by Americans\u2019 sexual license during the 1950s, yet he was clearly viscerally excited by its spectacle. Mohammed Atta, the leader of the Sept. 11 hijackers, instructed in his will that his body be prepared for burial by \u201cgood Muslims\u201d and that no woman was to go near it, presumably because he found them dirty and spiritually contaminating. This aversion to women didn\u2019t stop him from visiting a strip club just before the attack, but it did prevent him from shaking women\u2019s hands. One extremist reportedly told the terrorism scholar Jessica Stern that he was \u201cvaginally defeated.\u201d\n\nAccording to Professor Juergensmeyer, \u201cNothing is more intimate than sexuality, and no greater humiliation can be experienced than failure over what one perceives to be one\u2019s sexual role.\u201d Furthermore, he argues, such failures \u201ccan lead to public violence,\u201d which is performed to cancel out feelings of shame and reassert the claim to manhood.", "title": "Opinion | Sex and Shame: What Incels and Jihadists Have in Common", "authors": []}

He returned Saturday afternoon with his family, including Shaquill, with whom he stood for photos wearing a light blue sport jacket and eyeglasses under a Seahawks cap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing just to be here right now; I couldn\u2019t ask for more,\u201d Shaquem Griffin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road coming, but I\u2019m glad I had the opportunity to be here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really good experience. I would have been crazy to turn an experience down like this. I\u2019m just glad I was one of the selected few to be here.\u201d\n\nGriffin had one of the more unusual ways of finding out he was chosen.\n\n\u201cI was using the restroom and my brother came and tackled me with my cellphone, saying, \u2018Answer it, answer it,\u2019 and I looked, and that\u2019s when tears started pouring down,\u201d he said. \u201cI literally went to use the restroom, and that\u2019s when my brother busted in and tackled me. I think I was more scared of him tackling me in the bathroom and not knowing what was happening than anything.\u201d\n\nGriffin received, by far, the biggest cheers of the day \u2014 louder even than when the Cowboys\u2019 selections were announced. And he made a promise: \u201cGreat things are coming to Seattle.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGriffin\u2019s selection early in the fifth round enlivened a day in which most picks are little known. Not all, though.\n\nMichigan defensive tackle Maurice Hurst was taken one spot in front of Griffin by the Oakland Raiders. An all-American, he would have gone much earlier, but a heart condition was discovered at the combine, dropping him far down draft boards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe had five and a half sacks as an interior rusher and led all nose tackles and defensive tackles with 49 total quarterback pressures, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He\u2019s not considered quick, but he is active and seemed to be in on every tackle for the Hawkeyes.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Michigan State extended its streak of having at least one player selected to 78 years when Brian Allen went to the Rams early in the fourth round. Only Michigan and Southern California have longer streaks: Both extended them to 80 years in the first two days of the draft.\n\nThe Giants took the first quarterback of the third day, Richmond\u2019s Kyle Lauletta, at No. 109. The Giants passed on trying to get their quarterback of the future to replace Eli Manning in the first round, taking running back Saquon Barkley at No. 2 over all. Lauletta doesn\u2019t have a big arm, but he showed good athleticism and accuracy in college. In the fifth round, with the 139th overall pick, the Giants chose defensive tackle R.J. McIntosh out of Miami.\n\nAnother quarterback, Western Kentucky\u2019s Mike White, went to Dallas in the sixth round. Dallas acquired wideout Tavon Austin from the Rams in a trade on Saturday.\n\nThe Jets, picking 107th, chose tight end Chris Herndon, also of Miami, in the fourth round.\n\nCleveland used a fourth-round pick, No. 105 over all, to take one of the draft\u2019s most talented but troubled wide receivers: Florida\u2019s Antonio Callaway. He had multiple suspensions while playing with the Gators, missing all of last season because of his part in a credit card fraud scheme.\n\nWisconsin tight end Troy Fumagalli, who is missing the index finger on his left hand, went to Denver in the fifth round.\n\nThree punters were taken in the fifth round. Michael Dickson, the Australian from Texas, was picked 149th over all by Seattle. Alabama\u2019s J.K. Scott was drafted 172nd over all by Green Bay, a pick before Oakland took Johnny Townsend from Florida. Townsend was the N.C.A.A. leader last season with a 47.5-yard average on his 64 punts.", "title": "Shaquem Griffin Finally Hears His Name at N.F.L. Draft", "authors": ["The Associated Press"]}

Mr. Oswell, 27, who was in the Army, was medically discharged, and the couple were headed back to their home state, South Carolina, where they planned to live with her parents in Columbia, the capital.\n\nAfter Ms. Oswell boarded the plane and sat down in her window seat, she called her mother to check in and said she would call again when they landed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for their connecting flight. But the next call came from her husband.\n\n\u201cI could detect in his voice that it was very different,\u201d Ms. Starks said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Ms. Starks, something happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithin several hours, her parents were by her hospital bed in the intensive-care unit of a Dallas-area hospital. Ms. Oswell had limited brain activity and was unconscious and on life support, her parents said.

The doctor on board, who was not named in the lawsuit, told them about her frustrating attempts to use the plane\u2019s faulty medical equipment and to get the pilot to land.\n\nAfter Ms. Oswell collapsed in the lavatory, the doctor attempted to take her blood pressure, but the cuffs did not work, the lawsuit says. Then the pilot summoned the doctor to the cockpit, where she relayed the severity of Ms. Oswell\u2019s condition and recommended the plane be diverted, according to the suit.\n\nAt that point in the flight, the lawsuit says, the plane was over New Mexico, with about two hours remaining in the flight. Her parents argued on Friday that the plane should have diverted to Albuquerque.\n\nSoon after the doctor left the cockpit and returned to Ms. Oswell, she stopped breathing and lost a pulse, the lawsuit says. The doctor opened the plane\u2019s automated external defibrillator, attached the pads to her chest and tried to revive her with a shock, the lawsuit says. But despite three attempts, the device did not deliver a shock.\n\nThe lawsuit does not explain why the defibrillator malfunctioned.\n\n\u201cThe doctor on board the plane informed us that the equipment was not operational,\u201d a lawyer for the family, Bradford W.

She had insisted that would not be improperly pigeonholed. In her 1936 job acceptance letter to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, she made clear she wouldn\u2019t \u201crevert to \u2018woman\u2019s-point-of-view\u2019 stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives me immense satisfaction to break a precedent, and even more to know that The Times at last wants me where I have long felt I belong,\u201d she wrote to Mr. Sulzberger.\n\nHer earliest work indicated she had superlative news judgment. In one of her first Times articles, dated June 24, 1921, she attended an address by Victor Emmanuel III, the king of Italy. But a different politician who had attracted little notice from other journalists caught her observant eye.\n\n\u201cMore interesting than the speech of the King was the sudden emergence of the new party of the Extreme Right. \u2026 Benito Mussolini, founder and leader of the Fascisti, was among the parliamentary debutants; and, in one of the best political speeches I have heard, a little swaggering, but caustic, powerful and telling, he called upon the Socialists to disarm their spirits.\u201d\n\nShe would go on to have several interviews with the dictator. Adolf Hitler agreed to meet with her, and she sat with Joseph Stalin for an unprecedented six hours. She interviewed Franklin Delano Roosevelt weeks before his death in 1945.\n\nAt first, she traveled along with her husband, who had an import/export business. But as her stature skyrocketed, he quit his job to travel with her, according to \"Women of the World: The Great Foreign Correspondents,\u201d a 1988 book by Julia Edwards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Ms. McCormick was the first woman to win a Pulitzer for journalism in a major category, a student at Columbia, Minna Lewinson, won the Newspaper History Award for a research paper in 1918, the second year of the Pulitzers.

It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s, after the Civil Rights Act, that more women had a chance at so-called \u201chard news\u201d jobs.\n\nMs. McCormick \u201cconsidered herself apart from other women journalists of the day,\u201d declining invitations to women-only press events by Eleanor Roosevelt, Ms. Beasley said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Andrea, by contrast, keeps her own feelings at arm\u2019s length while permitting herself to slink around with him, out of view of her censorious and gossip-loving friends.\n\nWhen Andrea learns she\u2019s pregnant, she decides to keep the baby, and for lack of other viable options (she still lives hand-to-mouth, piecemealing an income from different part-time jobs), she and Ryan try on the costume of heterosexual couplehood. \u201cI began to see billboards and advertisements in a new way,\u201d she observes. \u201cA family frolicked on an afternoon-gilded lawn, a woman threw her arms around a man\u2019s shoulders and they gazed at a screen together, everyone grinning and buying, grinning and selling. \u2026 Versions of the relationship I was now in played out in everything ever written, acted, sung, sold, declared. \u2026 There was so much written and sold about the love and trouble between men and women that if you lined it all up end to end the whole world would be wrapped as thickly and totally as a rubber-band ball.\u201d\n\nThis is another of the novel\u2019s delights \u2014 how clearly Johnson delineates the psychosexual dualities and prejudices of our culture, how effortlessly she instructs even as she entertains. As Andrea puzzles out the alarming reality of her life and her attraction to Ryan, tenuous as it might be, we too are wondering if it\u2019s possible to be both straight and gay (bisexuality is scorned as a provisional space, more fiction than nonfiction). In due course, Johnson offers us her answer, but I won\u2019t spoil the pleasures of that discovery.\n\nIn its final section, the novel fast-forwards to 2009 and shifts from first person narration to an alternating close third person point of view. Here the momentum falters a bit. Andrea\u2019s perspective is so fresh and funny, her voice at once self-effacing and arch, that the move to third person is both jarring and a bit of a letdown. Johnson presumably employs this tactic in order to access Ryan\u2019s thoughts and those of their 9-year-old daughter, Lucia. I don\u2019t know if this shift was necessary, but it\u2019s understandable why the author chose to make it. At its heart, this book is about risk-taking, and Johnson should be admired for taking the ones she does.", "title": "She\u2019s Here, She\u2019s Queer, She\u2019s Figuring Out What That Means", "authors": []}

If so, what was that like for you?\n\nIn \u201cStarbucks Arrests, Outrageous to Some, Are Everyday Life for Others,\u201d Elizabeth Dias, John Eligon and Richard A. Oppel Jr. write:\n\nThe video of the police arresting two black men in a Starbucks, viewed more than 10 million times online, quickly prompted a full-blown crisis: accusations of racism, protests both in and around the cafe, and a corporate apology on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d But to some black Philadelphia residents who venture into Rittenhouse Square, the neighborhood where it happened, the treatment depicted in the video was a frustrating reality of everyday life. Christian Hayden, 30, recalled a security guard searching his bags as he left a nearby Barnes & Noble. The guard found his copy of Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s memoir \u201cThe Beautiful Struggle,\u201d and would not let him leave until the staff had checked the shelves to make sure no copy had been stolen. Trevor Johnson, 27, a bike courier, recalled being arrested in the square four years ago after an officer asked him to turn off his music and he got up to walk away. And earlier this year, Michele Bradshaw, 49, said she left a Nordstrom Rack not far from the Starbucks after she noticed a security guard following her through the aisles of clothing. In fact, statistics show that Rittenhouse Square, with its hotels, boutique museums and upscale shops, has the highest racial disparity in the city when it comes to police pedestrian stops. Although black people account for just 3 percent of the residents in that police subdistrict, they made up two-thirds of the people stopped by the police in the first half of 2017, according to figures collected by the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt is clear that African-Americans are not welcomed in that part of the neighborhood, period,\u201d said Jordan A. Harris, a representative in the state house and chairman of the state\u2019s legislative black caucus.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "In HOW TO THINK LIKE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST (Princeton University, $29.95), an affable introduction to the discipline, the anthropologist Matthew Engelke describes \u201ctwo key features\u201d of work in the field. The first is \u201cparticipant observation,\u201d the practice of deeply immersing yourself in another culture \u2014 but not to the point of \u201cgoing native.\u201d Engelke concedes there can be \u201ca fine line\u201d between the two states of engagement. But the important difference is that \u201cgoing native\u201d undermines \u201cthe critical distance you need to make an analysis.\u201d An example of what this distinction looks like in practice is Verdery\u2019s strenuous effort, having been the victim of Romanian state surveillance, to keep her personal judgments at some remove from her attempts to fathom the workings of that system.\n\nThe second of Engelke\u2019s two pillars of anthropological work is \u201ccultural relativism.\u201d By this phrase he does not mean the philosophical view that there are no moral truths and therefore no culture\u2019s values are better or worse than any other\u2019s. Rather, he means a methodological commitment to a \u201cself-awareness that your own terms of analysis, understanding and judgment are not universal and cannot be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nHere, again, Verdery is an exemplar. When she first read her file and discovered that many of her Romanian friends were working with the secret police, she felt betrayed. These individuals, after all, had made a decision to violate a mutual trust. Or had they? Wasn\u2019t it possible, Verdery came to wonder, that they were \u201coverwhelmed by a greater exigency to which I was insignificant?\u201d Namely: the need to protect their families and social networks, whose possible infiltration by the secret police always had to be assumed. To learn to see the world like a Romanian, Verdery had to \u201cdrop my very American tendency to think largely in terms of autonomous individuals\u201d as well as her very American tendency to see friendships as things that can form quickly, simply on the basis of good conversations and \u201ca sense of interpersonal charisma.\u201d Accusing her friends of cowardice made less sense \u2014 not just morally, in terms of outrage, but also descriptively, in terms of comprehension \u2014 once she abandoned these assumptions.\n\nVerdery notes that her circumspection would not suit all her fellow anthropologists, especially those who \u201cfind they work better in situations that make them angry.\u201d Indeed, some anthropologists believe they do better research when they embrace and act on their moral reactions to the world they are trying to understand. This is a trend in the field that has become more pronounced over the past two decades. In ENGAGED ANTHROPOLOGY: Politics Beyond the Text (University of California, paper, $29.95), the anthropologist Stuart Kirsch aims to show how research that is deliberately mobilized for political purposes makes for good scholarship. Examples of the sort of action he is talking about include \u201cparticipation in social movements, collaborating with activists and nongovernmental organizations, advising lawyers, writing affidavits and producing expert reports.\u201d\n\nKirsch\u2019s book is a series of case studies: an extended consideration of his own career as an engaged anthropologist. He fell into this sort of work by accident in the late 1980s, while studying ritual, sorcery and magic in a Yonggom village in Papua New Guinea. He started to worry about pollution from an Australian-owned gold and copper mine nearby, and he grew involved in both a political campaign and a lawsuit against the mine, advising lawyers, collaborating with nongovernmental organizations and providing expert reports. This political work led him to pursue research questions about the Yonggom that he otherwise might have overlooked, such as how they conceived of the pollution situation, which they viewed not as a \u201ctechnical problem\u201d but rather as a manifestation of \u201ca failed social relationship with the mining company.\u201d Given how much anthropologists depend on reciprocity with the people they study, Kirsch argues, helping \u201ctheir informants work toward achieving their political goals\u201d is only fitting.", "title": "Should Anthropologists Judge the People They Study?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "text": "Another view is that only humans can be persons because only humans have the ability to use language and reason in abstract and sophisticated ways. Kiko and Tommy can do many impressive things, including communicate with others and pursue goals in a creative, intelligent manner. But they cannot do these things in the same kinds of ways that many humans can.\n\nHowever, this view of personhood is unacceptably exclusionary. We all lack the ability to use language and reason in abstract and sophisticated ways early in life, some of us lose these abilities later in life, and some of us never develop them. Yet while humans might not have moral or legal duties when we lack these abilities, we can clearly still have moral and legal rights. This is why many judges and legal experts now rightly reject this exclusionary view of personhood as fundamentally at odds with contemporary standards of human rights.\n\nBut now suppose we accept a more inclusive view of personhood, according to which humans are persons because we have some or all of the features mentioned before: conscious experience, emotionality, a sense of self or bonds of care or interdependence. This view is more plausible than the opposing view, in part because it includes all humans within the scope of personhood. At the same time, it includes some nonhumans too. For example, Kiko and Tommy are conscious, emotional, intelligent, social beings whose lives are deeply entangled with our own, their current state of isolation notwithstanding. As a result, they count as persons on any view inclusive enough to meet contemporary standards of human rights.\n\nThe idea of nonhuman personhood does raise difficult questions. One question is which rights nonhumans can have. For instance, if Kiko and Tommy can have the right to liberty, can they also have the right to property? What about the right to free expression or association, or the right to political representation or participation?\n\nAnother question is which nonhumans can have rights. For instance, if Kiko and Tommy can have rights, can bonobos and gorillas have rights too? What about cats, dogs and fish? What about chickens, cows and pigs? What about ants or sophisticated artificial intelligence programs?\n\nThese questions are unsettling. They are also reasonable to ask. After all, we might think that we need to draw the line somewhere. So if we decide not to draw the line at species membership \u2014 if we decide to accept that at least some nonhumans can have at least some rights \u2014 then it is not immediately clear where to draw it instead, or even, on reflection, whether to draw this particular kind of line at all.\n\nHowever, it is important to keep two points in mind. First, the fact that a question is unsettling is not a justification for avoiding it. We should not ignore injustice out of fear of what it might mean to recognize it.", "title": "Opinion | Should Chimpanzees Be Considered \u2018Persons\u2019?", "authors": []}

In November, we paid a $750-a-year amenity fee to use the gym, pool and outdoor space because we were told that all the features \u2014 including a business center, party room, dog run and roof deck \u2014 would be available soon. But it took months for some of these features to open, and some, like the roof deck, still aren\u2019t ready. Our lease does not hold the owner liable for delays, and the agreement, which we signed with the company that operates the amenities, does not list completion dates. Yet we\u2019re paying for services we cannot use. Do we have any recourse to recoup the $750 fee we paid?\n\nA: In the rush to open a new building, developers frequently start signing leases before the paint dries on roof decks, doggy runs and billiard rooms. \u201cThe amenities always lag behind,\u201d said David J. Maundrell III, Citi Habitat\u2019s executive vice president of new developments for Brooklyn and Queens. Knowing that schedules are in flux, owners sometimes waive the amenity fee the first year. But yours didn\u2019t. In hindsight, it might have been a good idea to wait until all the services were available before you paid, but regardless, you paid in good faith and the owner didn\u2019t deliver.

Your sister-in-law, as the ex, is probably not going to be regarded as a highly reliable source of information in any case. Still, if she and the girlfriend are communicating, she should feel free to pass on what she knows. She would be telling her ex-husband\u2019s new partner only what he should have told her anyway.\n\nI am employed by a large nonprofit organization. A year ago, my division supervisor asked if I would be willing to receive additional training, with expenses covered by one of the organization\u2019s special-purpose funds (SPF). I agreed to participate, and I was reimbursed from the SPF. Last month, it was discovered that the SPF could not cover all its anticipated expenses. My department head informed me that the major benefactor of the SPF was unhappy that funds were used to support my tuition and then asked me to donate some of my banked vacation time to the SPF to cover the projected deficit. (In my organization, we are allowed to bank vacation time, which we can donate to SPFs or cash out, if we leave our job with sufficient notice.) I feel I am being asked because my tuition reimbursement is this year\u2019s largest ticket item, and I have the most banked vacation time. I do not want the benefactor to stop supporting the fund, nor do I want others to be denied access to training programs, but I feel I should not be responsible for SPF mismanagement. Is it ethical for the department head to make this request? Is it ethical for me to say no? Name Withheld\n\nSomeone made a mistake here, and it wasn\u2019t you. Now you\u2019re being asked to cover the cost. What could possibly justify this? The use of funds by your organization is governed by whatever legal rules cover them and by whatever policies have been set by management and the board. A properly managed nonprofit will have a clear understanding with donors about what kinds of things the funds they give will be used for. Had this tenet been followed, the benefactor\u2019s beef would be with the policies that the board has set for the special-purposes fund. If the benefactor\u2019s continued support really is at stake, the organization can try to defend the staff-development policy to him, or it can cover the costs from elsewhere. Either way, your boss shouldn\u2019t have tried to renegotiate the deal you were offered and claw back resources from you; and so, ethically speaking, you may decline. If you do decide to comply, you have the consolation of knowing that you\u2019re now better equipped to do a job you obviously care a great deal about.\n\nI have a health condition that requires that I take an intramuscular antibiotic two to five times a year. I always go to my doctor for this injection. Depending on my insurance and whether the doctor keeps this medication on hand, I either buy it at the pharmacy and bring it to the doctor\u2019s office or go to the doctor, who supplies the medication. I pay a co-pay for the medication and/or the nurse or doctor visit, without generally looking at the full bill. The other day, I got a bill for a negligible balance, which I paid, but it drew my attention to the details. I researched the CPT codes and realized that insurance was being double charged for the medication, because I bought it at the pharmacy, but the code they used covered both the injection and the medication. I\u2019m sure my doctor wrote an accurate note about what she did (intramuscular administration of this particular medication), and the billing office coded it as administration and medication. I don\u2019t think this is fraud if it was inadvertent, although it may reflect a systemic problem in which doctors provide services and the billing offices they use, and with which they have little connection, look to maximize income.\n\nAm I ethically obligated to bring this to someone\u2019s attention? It does not affect me financially, but I assume it contributes to the high cost of medicine in our country. I\u2019m inclined to let my doctor know what happened so that she may decide how to proceed, because it\u2019s her relationship with the corporate medical organization, of which her practice is a part, that is at stake.

The F.E.I., the governing body of the sport, allows jumps in grand prix events at five-star, or top level, competitions to reach a height of 1.6 meters, about 5 feet 3 inches, for the top level competitors.\n\nKonickx sees himself similar to a movie director when he is creating a course, working to introduce dramatic elements throughout and building tension, eventually reaching a climax by the end.\n\nWithin the course is a complex understanding of the physics of horse and rider: A single gallop stride for the average horse covers about 12 feet of ground, with takeoff and landing each accounting for about half a stride. Course designers space jumps at odd distances from one another, forcing the riders to shorten or lengthen their horses\u2019 strides accordingly, adding another degree of difficulty. This tests the agility of the horses as well as the rider\u2019s ability to make choices about how they set up their horse for a clean approach, takeoff and landing.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a well-designed course, about 20 to 25 percent of riders have clean rides, according to Ellenbruch, while the rest accrue faults or are disqualified if they exceed the time limit, jump the course out of order, their horse refuses a jump more than once or if they fall off their horse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe top show jumpers spend most of the year traveling to high-level competitions, accumulating points toward rankings and aiming to qualify for the highest level competitions \u2014 just a small step above the Masters in difficulty and prestige \u2014 such as the World Equestrian Games, to be held this year in Mill Spring, N.C., in September, and the Olympics.\n\nKent Farrington competed in the Olympics in 2016 and helped the United States team capture a silver medal. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line for course designers to make something that\u2019s very difficult so that it\u2019s a strong competition without setting the course so hard that nobody can complete it,\u201d said Farrington, 37, who withdrew from the Masters after he injured his leg falling off his horse during a competition in February.\n\n\u201cIt is very easy to build a nice course where everybody goes clear, but that\u2019s not necessarily the idea,\u201d said Ellenbruch, who as a judge works closely with the course designer to ensure that horses and riders are safe and that the course adheres to the rules.\n\nThe competition ultimately rests on the ability of the designer to set a challenge that requires the horse and rider to be completely in sync. When a course designer successfully walks that tightrope, the result is a thrilling competition that excites spectators and showcases the horse-rider teams.\n\n\u201cIt is always satisfying when you see a class and the course suits them,\u201d Konickx said, especially \u201cwhen they get more confident and proud and you helped bring them to that level.\u201d", "title": "Show Jumping Courses Are Puzzles for Horse and Rider to Solve", "authors": ["Hannah Wulkan"]}

He has begun the process of moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, won the confirmation of numerous judges and a Supreme Court Justice who seem likely to advance their anti-abortion cause, moved against transgender protections throughout the government, increased the ability of churches to organize politically and personally supported the March for Life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone who has worked the evangelical community more effectively than Donald Trump,\u201d said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which this year plans to devote four times the money it spent in the 2014 midterms.\n\nIn essence, many evangelical leaders have decided that airing moral qualms about the president only hurts their cause.\n\n\u201cHis family can talk to him about issues of character,\u201d said Penny Young Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, an evangelical organization that is framing the midterm elections to potential donors as a civilizational struggle.\n\nSo far, the decision by most conservative evangelical leaders to double down on their support for Mr. Trump is playing out like most of the other moments when skeptics of the president believed he had finally undermined himself with his base.\n\nA poll released last week by the Public Religion Research Institute found white evangelical approval for Mr. Trump at its highest level ever: 75 percent. Only 22 percent said they had an unfavorable view of the president.\n\nMuch as in the 2016 presidential campaign, Christian conservative events are designed to be highly visible and to convey the movement as one united voice. Hundreds of evangelical leaders plan to gather in June at the Trump International Hotel in Washington for a conspicuous show of support for Mr. Trump. The event will be part pep rally, part strategy session.\n\nPhoto\n\nPaula White, a pastor for Mr. Trump for more than 16 years, has facilitated events for conservative evangelicals to meet senior White House officials, including a gathering for women and another for pastors of megachurches in recent weeks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pray there\u2019s not apathy,\u201d Ms. White said.\n\nIn the states, leading religious and socially conservative groups will be propped up by the Republican National Committee, which will encourage voter registration at churches and schedule round tables with local pastors and evangelical liaisons close to the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, leaders of the movement plan to lean hard into a message that fans fears and grudges: that the progressive movement and national media mock Christian life and threaten everything religious conservatives have achieved in the 15 months of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cShow the left that you can put labels on us, you can shame us. But we\u2019re not giving up,\u201d said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, who explained that many conservatives of faith see attacks on Mr. Trump as an attack on their judgment.\n\nThe Family Research Council has already activated its network of 15,000 churches, half of which have \u201cculture impact ministries\u201d that organize congregations to be more socially and civically engaged. The group\u2019s efforts will gear up with voter registration drives around the Fourth of July and voter education that will focus on a half-dozen states that could determine control of the Senate.\n\nTheir tactics are almost identical to the work they used during the presidential campaign to unite a fractured evangelical base. The June meeting in Washington is a follow-up to a gathering in New York in the summer of 2016 that soothed tensions after it became apparent that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee.\n\nLeaders of the Christian right have not only largely accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s flaws and moved on; they seem to almost dare the president\u2019s opponents to throw more at him. Ms. Nance said she heard a common sentiment from volunteers and supporters who did not seem bothered by the allegations of Mr. Trump\u2019s infidelity. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking for a husband,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were looking for a body guard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConcerned Women for America\u2019s fund-raising pitch claims, \u201cThis is our Esther moment,\u201d referring to the biblical heroine whose resourcefulness saved Persia\u2019s Jews from annihilation hundreds of years before Jesus.

The president has helped devalue character, morality and fidelity as essential qualities in political leaders, they say.\n\nA meeting of evangelical leaders in Illinois last week featured a frank and candid discussion of the president\u2019s failings, prompting some pro-Trump attendees to walk out.\n\nBut for evangelicals loyal to Mr. Trump, the criticism is irrelevant. They say that as challenging as the political realities may be, they remain hopeful that voters understand what is at stake. \u201cWe are living in unusual times,\u201d said Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest evangelical supporters. \u201cAnd after what happened in 2016, I think anything is possible.\u201d", "title": "Shrugging Off Trump Scandals, Evangelicals Look to Rescue G.O.P.", "authors": ["Jeremy W.

Uber is now worth $68 billion.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of the biggest-name privately held tech companies have recently made moves that position them to go public in the next year or two. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said he plans to take the company public next year. Lyft has held talks with investment banks to explore going public. And Airbnb has begun bringing independent directors onto its board, a move that is typically part of the preparations for becoming a public company.\n\nA wave of tech I.P.O.s would have implications for Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem. Once start-ups go public and their employees pocket some of the wealth, executives and engineers may leave with more resources to begin their own start-ups. That gives venture capitalists a fresh set of companies to invest in, renewing the cycles of innovation and experimentation that sit at the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe I.P.O.s will also earn the venture capitalists big returns \u2014 and bragging rights. According to an annual ranking of venture capitalists by CB Insights, a research firm that follows start-ups and venture capital, many of the top-ranked investors backed companies with 2017 I.P.O.s, including the software maker MuleSoft; Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service; and Snap.

And some start-up executives are eager to prove themselves as public company chief executives after founders like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey have said going public improved their discipline and focus on profits.\n\n\u201cAt all levels, there are more and more companies who are thinking about should we go public this year or next?\u201d said Noah Wintroub, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vice chairman of investment banking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an environment now that\u2019s conducive to asking that question, and also a lot of companies that have scaled up to the point where they can go now.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMatthew Kennedy, an I.P.O. analyst at Renaissance Capital, said nearly all private companies valued at more than $1 billion were strong candidates to go public in the next two years. He said he expected more immediate activity among midsize start-ups, such as Slack, the maker of corporate messaging software, which is valued at $5.1 billion, and DocuSign, an e-signature company valued at $3 billion that filed I.P.O. paperwork last month.\n\nLarge private Chinese firms may also be nearing I.P.O.s, Mr. Kennedy said, including Xiaomi, a smartphone maker valued at $46 billion, and Meituan Dianping, an e-commerce firm valued at $30 billion.\n\nOnce this generation of start-ups goes public, investors said, it will ease the anxiety of the wealthy families, pension funds and university endowments that finance the venture capitalists\u2019 investment funds. Those so-called limited partners have been itching for their returns, venture capitalists said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re certainly eager for cash back,\u201d said Mr. Pressman, the Zuora investor. An I.P.O. boon would be good for the venture capitalists, too.\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business to make money for our investors, but we make money when our investors do.\u201d\n\nThe Top 20 Venture Capitalists\n\nCB Insights analyzed investors\u2019 exits (I.P.O.s, stock sales and acquisitions) the value of their current holdings and other factors to rank the top 100 venture capitalists.

Previously chaste characters masturbated furiously, plain-Jane sentences were buffed to a brilliant sheen and a nameless department-store mannequin was christened \u201cRonald\u201d \u2014 after Ronald Hingley, a Russian scholar who had recently displeased Nabokov. \u201cFrom the way Ronald held his racket,\u201d Nabokov wrote in the revised text, \u201cit was obvious he could not hit a single ball \u2014 even an abstract ball in his world of wood.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an exhilaratingly petty sentence. (Was this what you had to do when you wanted to attack someone before Twitter \u2014 bury a cryptic insult in a 40-year-old novel?) But Nabokov isn\u2019t the only artist who has used his early work as a sort of pneumatic tube for delivering his manias-of-the-moment. After a string of personal tragedies, Mary Shelley rewrote key passages of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d for an 1831 edition that reframed Victor Frankenstein as a hapless victim of destiny.

W.B.

Lucas was at the vanguard of this movement, but I wonder if his example \u2014 compulsively adding CGI dewbacks to \u201cA New Hope,\u201d battling apoplectic fans over Greedogate, failing to produce the \u201clittle personal films\u201d he often alludes to \u2014 has had a chilling effect on would-be revisionists.

Here are some of her tips to travel smoothly with a disability:\n\nAsk Your Airline for Help\n\nAsking your airline for assistance, either at the time of booking or a few days before your trip, will make your time at the airport much easier. Many airlines will designate an employee to meet you curbside when you arrive or at check-in with a wheelchair (if you need one) and guide you through security. You can also request assistance when you land at your destination.\n\nThere is usually no charge for this service, but policies vary by airline and may depend on available staff and your disability, so be sure to clarify with your carrier before you fly. Also, many carriers allow guide dogs on board free of charge for passengers who are visually-impaired (as long as you make a reservation for your guide dog at least 48 hours in advance of your flight).\n\nPlan With Your Hotel in Advance\n\nMost hotels in all price ranges welcome travelers with disabilities, according to Ms. Bliss. However, it\u2019s key to give them a heads up about what your needs are if there\u2019s anything specific. If you\u2019re in a wheelchair, for example, get measurements for the front, guest and bathroom doors in advance of your stay. Most hotel concierges will be happy to provide you this information, any many list it online. Ms. Bliss said that some her clients\u2019 wheelchairs are too large for many properties, even if they claim to have accessible rooms and facilities. Also, if you\u2019re visually impaired and find buffet breakfasts or continental breakfast bars challenging, ask your hotel\u2019s concierge to fill your in-room fridge with breakfast items, or deliver them to your room instead.", "title": "Six Simple Tips for Smooth Travel With a Disability", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "On Sex Clubs \u2014 And How to Cover Them\n\nBy Adam Nagourney, Los Angeles bureau chief\n\nIt was a world that thrived in the shadows of New York \u2014 late at night, hidden on dark streets behind barely-marked doorways, typically guarded by a man sitting on a stool under a light bulb. What took place inside ranged from questionable to outright illicit: the full-service bar that kept serving drinks after 4 a.m., the open use of cocaine and marijuana and, in many cases, the anonymous and often marathon sexual encounters among gay men. Sex clubs, bathhouses, back rooms, movie theaters, after-hours bars, dance clubs \u2014 places like Alex in Wonderland and the Mine Shaft and the New St. Marks Baths, all part of New York in the 1970s and early 1980s. This was a culture that was known to some of gay New York, but arguably not most of it. And it certainly was not known to most of straight New York.\n\nThe AIDS epidemic changed all that. Almost overnight, as panic spread and Governor Mario M. Cuomo issued regulations in late 1985 to close down establishments where unsafe sexual activity took place, this underground world came crashing to the surface. A battery of city inspectors, police officers and reporters went in undercover to see for themselves what was going on behind those doors \u2014 and shared their findings with the public. \u201cThe Case for Closing Bathhouses: Night Visit by Post Reporter Reveals Shocking Evidence,\u201d read a New York Post headline over a 1985 story that described, in considerable detail, what the reporter saw and heard as he moved through the dark warren of a bathhouse. It was part of stream of columns and editorials \u2014 not to mention grainy video from local news cameras that had been secreted into the clubs \u2014 that was turning up the pressure on public officials.\n\nAnd while The New York Times was sluggish on reporting the first stirrings of the AIDS epidemic, it quickly jumped on the train as the story became something of a frenzy: voyeuristic and yet significant at the same time. \u201cGuests paid a $12 \u2018membership\u2019 fee and were asked to sign a form pledging to engage only in \u2018safe sex\u2019 involving no exchange of bodily fluids,\u201d read a 1985 Times report on a club known as the Hell Fire that catered to a straight and gay crowd with an interest in sadomasochism. \u201cSigns on the walls listed the club rules, which included \u2018no bullwhips, electric prods or animals\u2019 and \u2018no touching without permission.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese were uncomfortable times for many of the people drawn into this: There were the city inspectors who spent hours compiling firsthand reports that were detailed if at times unnerving. (\u201cTwo of the inspectors said they heard sounds of whipping and moaning, but did not investigate \u2018for reasons of personal safety,\u2019 a 1985 Times story said.) There were the elected officials, who had to explain \u2014 and justify \u2014 evolving policies as they navigated a politically fraught epidemic transmitted by sexual activity, with terrifying questions around every corner.\n\nIt was challenging for news organizations as well, drawn to the story for legitimate reasons (a health crisis) and perhaps less noble reasons (sensationalism) as they struggled with just how explicitly detailed the reports needed to be. And no less discomfited were many in the city\u2019s gay and lesbian community, concerned that raising the curtain on a world that most people did not know existed could threaten the gay rights movement after a decade of progress. Some gay leaders decried the city crackdown as an assault on privacy. \u201cConsensual sexual activity by adults out of public view should always be beyond the eye and the arm of government,\u201d said Thomas B. Stoddard, the executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, in 1988. Others considered it a legitimate response to a health emergency. \u201cIs compulsive sexuality freedom?\u2019\u201d Jim Fouratt, one of the city\u2019s earliest gay activists, said a few weeks before the city cracked down. \u201cI would argue it\u2019s not. All we got was a lot more alienated sexually, and a lot more disease.\u201d\n\nCuomo, whom I covered at the time as a Daily News reporter based in Albany, would seem at times astonished \u2014 even ashen-faced \u2014 as he learned about this side of New York from inspectors and aides struggling to advise the governor about which kind of sexual practices the state might regulate. Down in the city, Mayor Edward I. Koch was already facing criticism that he was slow to act in combating the epidemic; gay political leaders contended that it was because the mayor, who never married and lived in Greenwich Village, was gay. (At various points in his life, Koch said he was not, or would not answer the question.)\n\nAs the mayor and governor were at odds about what to do (sound familiar?), Cuomo\u2019s health advisers, after much debate, recommended shutting down establishments that permitted unsafe-sex practices. City Hall pushed back, as many of Koch\u2019s aides argued that a crackdown would simply push this kind of behavior into darker corners, making it harder to regulate. Cuomo finally moved, essentially ignoring the mayor as he issued state regulations that would close clubs that permitted these kinds of activities, and leaving it to cities to enforce. Koch resisted at first, contending the order was poorly drafted and difficult to implement: He was obviously aware of how many gay activists viewed this as a civil rights issue, a setback at a time when gay rights seemed to be on the advance.", "title": "Six Times Journalists on the Paper\u2019s History of Covering AIDS and Gay Issues", "authors": []}

Too much white space to be filled in, for one thing. Then there was the fact that they mostly appear late in the week and the clues were not as helpful as they were in the early week puzzles.\n\nThat was before I learned to lean heavily on the crossings. Put some of those crossings in and you can take an educated guess at most long entries, so don\u2019t run away from a good stack.

It\u2019s not that hard to come up with lively long entries if you are paying a reasonable amount of attention to the world around you; what\u2019s trickier is making sure that every single one of those crossings that runs through the stack is workable and, if the crossword gods are merciful, not a gluey bit of crosswordese. It\u2019s much harder than it sounds, especially if you make things more difficult for yourself by increasing the width of your grid by one column.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what David Steinberg has done, but he does it reasonably well. I liked the top triple stack, although any long entry with the word ONE\u2019S in it (like A RUN FOR ONE\u2019S MONEY) tends to give puzzle makers a fit of the giggles because phrases like A LOT ON ONE\u2019S PLATE popped up often a while back.

A lifelong Republican, Professor Benjamin said he was so disturbed by President Trump\u2019s record that he recently dropped his enrollment in the party. Yet he still plans to vote for Mr. Faso. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply experienced, smart and wonky and totally informed on a range of issues,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Rhodes is nonetheless optimistic that voters will turn against Mr. Faso on issues ranging from health care to gun control, and expects that his own exhaustive tour of the district will win him votes. \u201cThis district is enormous: 7,900 square miles,\u201d he told the small audience here. \u201cI\u2019m doing town-hall meetings.

(Others feel the institution reinforces an unfair hierarchy that privileges matrimonial coupledom above all other forms of romantic coupling.)\n\nDr. David Schwartz, a psychoanalyst and psychologist who has spent his decades-long career thinking about the ways in which gender and sexuality get constructed, however, isn\u2019t so sure eschewing traditional parental labels is good for L.G.B.T. parents or their kids. While he\u2019s all for challenging the gender norms that inform the mommy and daddy dyad, he pointed out that children of L.G.B.T. parents are already steeped in a heteronormative culture that stigmatizes their families, and it would be doubly hard for them to have to explain why they call their parents some unusual names. \u201cAnd,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cyou certainly don\u2019t want to do anything to devalue your family,\u201d noting that the legitimacy, visibility and value of L.G.B.T. people as parental figures is often called into question already.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a disadvantage,\u201d Dr. Goldberg said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a challenge. It requires a lot of explanation and clarification, maybe even pushback from schools in certain geographical contexts, less gay-affirming areas of the country, like, \u2018What do you mean you go by \u2018Maddie\u2019?\u201d \u2014 an amalgamation of mommy and daddy. \u201cNobody is going to know what that means. How do we explain that to other children?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor families who decide to adopt atypical terms and want to minimize the potential risk of social discomfort, Dr. Goldberg suggested some parents might consider giving children the freedom to call them mom or dad \u201cin certain settings and at certain ages,\u201d adding, \u201cthey may become more comfortable with alternative language as they grow older.\u201d\n\nMs. Kahn guessed that the reason the vast majority of participants in Dr. Goldberg\u2019s study stuck with labels derived from mother or father is because becoming a parent was beyond the community\u2019s reach for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s so powerful to be a parent,\u201d she said, \u201cto have the title mom or dad. A lot of us want that because for decades it seemed like it wasn\u2019t on the table for us to build a family, so there\u2019s almost like a privilege in finally being able to say \u2018I\u2019m a mom\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a dad.\u2019\u201d\n\nEric Rosswood, author of \u201cThe Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads\u201d and \u201cJourney to Same-Sex Parenthood,\u201d said we shouldn\u2019t get too hung up on parenting terms as a means of upending the status quo: \u201cWe\u2019re already defying labels and challenging gender stereotypes regardless of what we call ourselves.\u201d\n\nDr. Goldberg agreed: \u201cThe label is not the role. Being a parent is being a parent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite interesting that we don\u2019t have a de-gendered parenting label in English, but in the 21st century our roles are far less gendered.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Davidson \u2014 and 26 percent of the participants (14 lesbians and seven gay men) in Dr. Goldberg\u2019s study who believe that their parenting labels could change over time \u2014 \u201cnaming is fluid and subject to infinite riffing.\u201d She cataloged a list of her many nicknames, which play off her first name, Amanda: Manzo, Manzers, Man and Sissy Man, among others. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll riff, invent and gather up new words,\u201d Ms. Davidson said, \u201cFelix will surely contribute some of his own.

The moment is so deliberate and messy and startling \u2014 the hotel sequence is for the most part hushed and austere \u2014 and yet so arbitrary. In other words, it reeks of symbolism. What was Mr. Kubrick\u2019s point in punctuating his visionary film with something so quotidian?\n\nThis is something many critics have chewed over \u2014 and me too. I have read that the broken glass was meant to echo the splintered animal bones that become weapons of war in the prehistoric \u201cDawn of Man\u201d sequence that begins the movie, or that it symbolizes the fragility of existence, or the shattering of the \u201csubject-object\u201d rationality with which homo sapiens traditionally view the world. One essayist divines a reference to \u201cthe broken glass of the Judaic marriage ceremony,\u201d a symbol of \u201cthe end of one way of life and the beginning of a new one.\u201d\n\nBut these kinds of interpretations have always struck me as overcooked; Mr. Kubrick was a filmmaker, not a cinema studies student looking for a Ph.D. thesis. On the other hand, I\u2019d never come up with anything better on my own.

It just hit me: Mr. Kubrick\u2019s point was to underscore Bowman\u2019s humanity just as he\u2019s on the precipice of transcending it. He knocks over a glass. He errs. Therefore, he\u2019s human. Of course!\n\nHAL, the film\u2019s homicidal, vainglorious computer, has a lot to say about human error earlier in the picture, so this seemed a nicely tied bow. I can\u2019t say my interpretation was original \u2014 the essayist quoted above also takes it out for a spin \u2014 but in the moment it was new to me (perhaps fatherhood, and my son\u2019s good-humored indulgence of being dragged to a \u201cboring\u201d movie, had got me thinking about human fallibility) and I bought it.\n\nBack to Mr. Dullea\u2019s anecdote: \u201cOriginally, Stanley\u2019s concept for the scene was that I\u2019d just be eating and hear something and get up. But I said, \u2018Stanley, let me find some slightly different way that\u2019s kind of an action where I\u2019m reaching \u2014 let me knock the glass off, and then in mid-gesture, when I\u2019m bending over to pick it up, let me hear the breathing from that bent-over position. That\u2019s all. And he says, \u2018Oh, fine. That sounds good.\u2019\n\n\u201cI just wanted to find a different way to play the scene than blankly hearing something,\u201d Mr. Dullea concluded. \u201cI just thought it was more interesting.\u201d Ergo, the broken wine glass had no meaning whatsoever; it was just a prop for a bit of actor\u2019s business.", "title": "Opinion | Sometimes a Broken Glass Is Just a Broken Glass", "authors": []}

(At the time, it was under Japanese occupation.) He graduated from Yonsei University in Seoul in 1959 and then, like many other young Koreans, went to the United States to study. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles, and received a master\u2019s degree in acting and playwriting there.\n\nHis list of television credits began in 1965 with small roles on \u201cI Spy.\u201d The bit parts he played early in his career hit pretty much all the stereotypes of the time \u2014 a houseboy on both \u201cThe Invaders\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d in 1967, a servant on \u201cIt Takes a Thief\u201d in 1969, and so on.\n\nBut from the beginning he was looking for more substantive projects, if not on the screen then onstage. He and others mounted a production of \u201cRashomon\u201d that coalesced into the founding of East West Players in 1965. The founders included, in addition to Mr. Oh, the Japanese actor Mako and the Chinese-American actors James Hong and Beulah Quo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe company, now in its 52nd season, started out playing to largely Japanese-American audiences.

In 1992, concerned about the societal divisions revealed by the riots in Los Angeles that year, he reconstituted that company as the Society of Heritage Performers, with a new sense of urgency.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Mr. Oh sought to hand that troupe off to a younger generation, and a group that included Mr. Kong took it on and turned its framework into the Lodestone Theater Ensemble, which promoted innovative works for the next decade.\n\nMr. Oh\u2019s theater career also included a notable Broadway appearance in \u201cPacific Overtures,\u201d the 1976 Stephen Sondheim musical.

But they will never demand that their own roles be replaced by someone of a different gender or race.\n\nInclusion riders shift the burden of equality, essentially requiring that the very parties who the riders are claiming to protect (the marginalized and disempowered \u2014 the silenced) do the work of enforcement.\n\nSay a major Hollywood celebrity is working on a movie and he has negotiated an inclusion rider. There are two ways he might discover that the rider has been violated. One is by doing his own investigation, somehow finding out the details of every level of every hiring decision on every element of the production, like editing, cinematography, sound and costuming. The other is being informed by people covered by the rider who had managed to get hired despite the non-inclusionary methods of the production, or who were passed over for a job.\n\nIt\u2019s not feasible for that celebrity to know and be involved in every minute level of the production, so the second scenario is much more likely, although in reality just as improbable. This is how inclusion riders shift the burden from the studios to the people the policy is claiming to empower. The idea that the only black boom operator should police the diversity of a set and then report to the star where the diversity is lacking is improbable and unfair.\n\nThe questions presented by inclusion riders are the stuff of law professors\u2019 dreams and judges\u2019 nightmares: Who will enforce the agreement? How will damages be measured? To whom will they be paid?

These sorts of souvenirs stretch back to the earliest of journeys, when pilgrims brought home dirt from holy places as a religious souvenir.\n\nOver time, intellectual curiosity became the driving motivation for personal travel. Yet even as travelers began collecting historical and scientific mementos, not just religious items, the things they brought home had echoes of sacred objects. In the 1700s, when Thomas Jefferson and John Adams carved slivers of wood off a chair in Shakespeare\u2019s home in Stratford-upon-Avon, it was \u201cas much an attempt to commune with the Bard\u2019s aura as it was to commemorate a moment of travel,\u201d writes Mr. Potts. (The wood chip said to have been taken by Jefferson is at his former home, Monticello, in Virginia where slicing off pieces of the furniture is not allowed.)\n\n\u201cSouvenir\u201d reminds the reader that plundering was not unusual tourist behavior into the 20th century, especially with industrialization and better transportation allowing travel to flourish \u2014 not only among the wealthy, but also the middle-class. In the 1800s, \u201cbreaking off pieces of Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts was such a common practice that a nearby grocery kept a hammer and chisel on hand for tourists,\u201d Mr. Potts tells us. During the 1876 American centennial, \u201ctourists visiting the Capitol snipped off swatches of the gallery curtains (and carved off chunks of the Speaker\u2019s desk) in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nBy the close of the 19th century, cheap mass-market souvenirs were becoming alternatives to objects plundered from historical sites. And by the end of the 20th century, Mr. Potts writes that in tourist areas around the world, imported keepsakes had become the standard \u2014 and mass-produced souvenirs were a global industry.\n\nScholars group these souvenirs into different buckets, including \u201cmarkers\u201d (location branded items like T-shirts and teacups); \u201cpictorial images\u201d (postcards and posters), and \u201csymbolic shorthand\u201d (for example, Statue of Liberty key chains), with the latter two categories being emblematic of, though not exclusive to, mass tourism. The bulk manufacturing of such items underscores the relationship, or the lack thereof, between the souvenir and the place.

Alexander\u2019s verse, although slightly more subdued than in \u201cThe Crossover,\u201d maintains energy and momentum, and Charlie\u2019s sadness is skillfully counterbalanced by occasional pages of graphic novel panels (illustrated by Dawud Anyabwile), as well as by fast-paced basketball sequences and pop culture references.

Her body now \u201ctakes up more room\u201d than her voice and has become a target for relentless catcalls from boys and insults from girls. Her once adored mother has become a constant source of rules and disapproval, and the church that was once a place of joy now feels like a house that is \u201cno longer one I want to rent.\u201d Xiomara struggles to find a voice in this strange new world and resorts to using her fists instead of words.

No Netflix titles were among them: After a disagreement last year, Cannes toughened its competition rules, and the streaming service announced on Wednesday it was boycotting the festival entirely.\n\nThis year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or contenders include Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d about an African-American police officer who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan, and \u201cLe Livre d\u2019Image\u201d (\u201cThe Image Book\u201d) by Jean-Luc Godard, the pioneering filmmaker of the French new wave. Also getting its world premiere at Cannes, though outside the official competition, is \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d a spinoff from the franchise, directed by Ron Howard. The festival runs May 8-19, and the Australian actress Cate Blanchett is the chairwoman of the main jury.\n\nLast year, two Netflix movies were in the running for the top prize. But a rule now requires all competition titles to be released in French movie theaters. France protects its film industry through a system of subsidies and regulations, and one regulation forbids cinema releases from being streamed in the country on services such as Netflix for three years.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s Paris news conference, the festival\u2019s artistic director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, said he had asked to include two Netflix films this year: One in competition, which he did not name, and the other out of competition, the Orson Welles movie \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind,\u201d which was unfinished at the time of his death and only completed in 2018. Mr. Fr\u00e9maux said it was \u201ca shame\u201d that the Welles film in particular was being kept out of the festival, as the director had been a Palme d\u2019Or winner and a jury president.", "title": "Spike Lee and Godard Films to Compete at a Cannes With No Netflix", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe buds of pussy willow are a welcome communiqu\u00e9 from friendlier, warmer months ahead. Waving in the wind, they represent the spring we all imagine, beautiful and productive. Though these buds had been tucked into watertight protective scales all winter, by the middle of March, they have swollen to their maximum girth. By now, the earliest have begun to burst open in all their hairy glory, and by the first or second week of April they are in full flower.\n\nPussy willow\u2019s beauty is almost mammalian. As shaggy as the mythical Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, willow buds emerge covered in dense woolly fur, as soft as a kitten\u2019s paws. In fact willow flowers are called \u201ccatkins\u201d \u2014 a botanical term derived from the Old Dutch word for kitten, \u201ckatteken,\u201d basically a long inflorescence packed with many tiny flowers. The fur on a willow\u2019s flowers collects the heat from spring\u2019s meager sunshine and provides protection from the very real threat of frost or even snow at this time of year.\n\nThough many species of willow are identified as \u201cpussy willows,\u201d there is only one true version, and that is Salix discolor, a native to much of the northeast, including the wetlands of New York City. To many observers, the difference between willows may seem inconsequential; they all bloom on catkins and almost all can be counted among the very first flowering plants of the season.\n\nWillows are dioecious; that is, male trees produce only male flowers, and female trees produce only female flowers. Though both genders\u2019 flowers are fuzzy when they emerge, the males\u2019 remain that way until their long stamens produce beautiful, bright yellow anthers. These anthers are the business end of the male flowers, where the pollen is \u2014 and they are peculiarly showy. Unlike other catkin-bearing trees, willows are not wind-pollinated. They rely on insects to do their bidding.\n\nWillows accomplish this feat by offering bumblebees, butterflies and wasps their first sweet drink of the season. Willow flowers are fragrant, often even to humans, and they produce copious amounts of nectar. Some butterflies, like the mourning cloak, are freshly emerged from the narrow crevices where they spent the winter, and may find little else in bloom for weeks. Birds, too, are attracted to willow flowers, or more accurately, to the insects that crowd the flowers on warm days. Phoebes and myrtle warblers stake out the sun-warmed branches of the trees, and greedily snap up unwitting pollinators.\n\nIt is hard to point to one place in the city to see pussy willows. They grow along the edges of Central Park\u2019s ponds and amid the tangled borders of Bronx woodlands. In Queens they\u2019re happy in Cunningham Park and Udall\u2019s Cove Park. Basically, willows can be found wherever freshwater is abundant. They are aggressive growers, and a sprig or two collected carefully from a local tree will do little harm. Placed in a glass of water on an office desk or on a windowsill, its buds will continue to develop, hastening the onset of spring \u2014 at least in the mind, if not in reality.", "title": "Spring Arrives on Kitten\u2019s Paws", "authors": ["Dave Taft"]}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "The responses to our Student Opinion question \u201cIs It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\u201d varied widely. While some said yes and some said no, many thought there was no need to choose one over the other.\n\nSesha Patel from Wilmington, N.C., says the well-being of animals is just as important as that of humans:\n\nI have stated on multiple occasions that I prefer dogs to humans. A person could die in a movie, and I\u2019ll be fine, but as soon as the dog gets hurt \u2014 instant tears. I believe most people feel more sympathetic towards animals because we see them as helpless and without a voice. Who\u2019s going to stand up for them if we don\u2019t? And this isn\u2019t a pick-and-choose matter, we need to advocate for human suffering just as much as the mistreatment of animals. I see my pets as much of a part of my family as I am, so shouldn\u2019t the wildlife be just as much a part of our global community as humans are? In the article Dieudonn\u00e9 Kemb\u00e9 said that what\u2019s good for the animals is good for the people. They add just as much to culture and society as humans do. They provide food, labor, and love. The point of charity and volunteer work is to help those less fortunate, no matter the species, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you write your check out to the animal conservatory or the children\u2019s orphanage, just make sure you pick one of them.\n\nZac Gill from Wilmington, N.C., though, thinks human needs should be prioritized:\n\nAnimals are great. Having a pet is like having a best friend that always has your back. I love all three of my pets, but if it came to it, I would always choose to save a human from danger over my pet. A human\u2019s life is much more valuable than an animal\u2019s life. \u2026 The author asked an interesting question, \u201cIs it wrongheaded to fight for elephants and rhinos (or farm animals at home) while five million children still die each year before the age of 5?\u201d yes, but only for the most part. If animals are something you care deeply about you can help them alongside helping the humans in the area. The world would be so much better if everyone who cared so deeply about saving the rhinos put half of their effort into building a new school, establishing a new source of water, or even buying the $5 mosquito net the author wrote about. I agree with the author\u2019s point of view, but I would always prioritize human needs over the needs of animals, endangered or not. With humans suffering around the world it\u2019s our duty to help them before we turn to the elephants and rhinos.\n\nFabiola Polo from St. Cloud, Fla., disagreed:\n\nFocusing more on animal welfare more than focusing on sick humans is something that is absolutely okay. If you think about it most animals are suffering & dying because of us and the changes we\u2019ve made to this world. Maybe that\u2019s also why were more empathetic towards the suffering of animals. We have some blame in their suffering. Also, animals do nothing to purposely hurt us and have malice in them.\n\nDaniel Gonzalez from St. Cloud, Fla., pointed out that humans have caused much more devastation than animals:\n\nWhen comparing humans and other animals, one thing becomes apparent: humans are especially vile. Never has an animal so deliberately devastated an environment for personal gain nor exterminated entire populations (even some of its own) based on superstition such as racism or sexuality. This is important in finding why humans care more for animals than their own kind as humans have other interests, mainly profit, that will trample over others of their own species. Humanity\u2019s role as the \u201cdominant life form\u201d also gives it a \u201ccalling\u201d to defend \u201clesser beings\u201d, we can see this in politics; the U.S. defends weaker nations like Israel and South Korea (some would even say it does this while neglecting its own people) despite the very few unique benefits they would bring. Animal welfare opens the door for human welfare; it\u2019s not uncommon for breakthroughs in animal treatment to make its way into the treatment of people (the Animal Welfare act of 1966 gave ethical guidelines for the testing of subjects and in the \u201870s push for ethical treatment of human subjects became common).\n\nRemi from Tarrytown, N.Y., believes helping either one will make the world a better place:\n\nI am more dedicated to helping humans than animals, but do feel a large amount of sympathy for animals. I feel guilty about animals, because they were doing just fine before humans came and interfered. The reason animals need protection and help is because of humans. Despite this, I would still help humans because there are innocent people all around the world who are suffering, and children who are starving. People are more empathetic towards animals because they are cute, furry, and entirely innocent. It isn\u2019t their actions that put the animals in danger, but ours. I don\u2019t believe it is wrong to help animals, many animals would be extinct by now if it weren\u2019t for human intervention, and many ecosystems would be off-balance, which would affect human-life as well. It is wrong, however, to focus primarily on animals. There are people all around the world who are starving, and in constant danger, but many people prefer to look at the cute puppies. That is wrong, and I agree with Mr. Kristoff.\n\nMaggie Yang from King of Prussia, Pa., had this theory as to why many humans are more sympathetic to animals:\n\nFor me, I am definitely more dedicated to helping humans, but I try to help animals in every way I can. I believe that if you help our fellow humans, there will be more people that can go out to help even more people and animals. People tend to be more empathetic toward animals because we see them as being \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201cinnocent,\u201d while when we see people suffer, we tend to have that the attitude that \u201cthey did something to deserve it\u201d or \u201cthey will get over it.\u201d I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong to focus on animal welfare. Animals have lives just like humans, and they have real emotions and pain. Not looking out for animals is just humanely wrong. People in general should devote their time to try to help both parties without harming the other.\n\nAnd Maddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., doesn\u2019t understand why it has to be one or the other:\n\nI don\u2019t understand how anyone can think there is a one or the other in this debate. Why must one species be denied of their rights for the other to have it? In the article, it states that there were more signature on a petition for the shooting of Cecil the lion than the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. It\u2019s not that people care more about animals lives than they do humans. Many people view animals as small, and without a voice, so who else to speak up for them but us? The problem with this is that we tend to forget our fellow humans. The people we interact with and see everyday. Although we shouldn\u2019t forget about animals, we need to also keep humans in our mind. Just because each person has their own voice, does not mean they don\u2019t need others to speak up for them. Just because animals don\u2019t have the same size brain or opposable thumbs, does not mean their lives are any less precious than ours. There should be absolutely no debate for one or the other.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nIn our Picture Prompt \u201cSmells and Memories\u201d we asked what scents remind you of home and why.\n\nDevin Pack from Lakewood High School wrote about the everyday fragrances of sawdust, air freshener and smoke:\n\nI have always had a sensitive scene of smell but I realized it after my grandpa died. I went to his house two weeks later and smelled his shirt and it reminded me of days when we used to go out to eat and he used to help play ball in his back yard. Every time I smell sawdust I think of my dad because he is a carpenter and every time he came home from work I smelled sawdust. Another smell that reminds of something is the black ice air freshener that is used for cars. I smelled the fragrance the first time when I got in the work truck when I started my first job it was filled with the unique smell black ice fragrance. One of the last smells that get to me the most is the smell of a smoldering smoky fire. The smell of the smoke is a constant reminder of all the late nights out side in my back yard with my friends and my family laughing and having a good time. That\u2019s all the smell that get to me emotionally and in a way sentimental that makes me go back down memory lane.\n\nMakayla D. from St. Cloud\u2019s favorite scents brought to mind vivid childhood memories:\n\nFresh, soft, clean, and salty air. The smell of clean bedsheets and pool chlorine. These scents seem to be profound in my memory. During my childhood I had spent lots of time vacationing at Disney with my family. We went on cruises, Disney World, and hotels around Florida. I remember seeing my favorite Disney characters around every corner, and the imagination from watching all Disney movies. The smell of the ocean reminds me of walking the ship and feeling the waves crash and make it rock. The smell of clean sheets remind me of adventuring through each and every hotel room and playing hide and seek, even though we had been there a million times before. The scent from a memory can be very powerful, it can bring back flushes of memories.\n\nCameron Fullard from Lakewood High School remembered the smells of holidays with family:\n\nI will forever remember the smell at my grandma\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and Christmas day of all the food that she and my aunties cook for the family to enjoy. Also my grandma is in love with growing flowers and have an entire family of flowers around her house and the different smells that flowers let out into the air is something that I will always remember sense every time I go to her house I smell her beautiful flowers. I also remember the smell of coffee because before my granddad passed away coffee was his favorite drink in the morning and anytime I smell coffee I instantly remember the times my granddad would drink it early in the morning. That\u2019s all the smells that bring backs good memories and have me excited for upcoming holidays.\n\nTahj Vaughn from Sumter, S.C., thought of freshly cut grass and laundry:\n\nThe smell of fresh cut grass I loved the smell of our yard after my Dad cut the grass. People cut grass all the time, I know we do here, but it doesn\u2019t smell like it did when my Dad cut our grass. Still when I smell freshly cut grass I can see my father out back mowing our yard. Freshly washed clothing that was hung outside to dry as my Mom and I folded the wash or put the clean sheets on the bed, the smell was overwhelmingly crisp and it made me feel so fresh, clean and renewed. Even if you put something out to dry these days, and most places it isn\u2019t even allowed, it doesn\u2019t quite smell the same as it did back then.\n\nAnd in his reflection, Brandon Tisdale from Lakewood High School realized just how powerful a sense of smell can be:\n\nSmell and memories, there are so many smells that remind me of great memories. the smell of smoke remind me good many good Friday nights beside a fire. The smell of gun powder remind me of early morning duck hunts that I have been on with my buddy\u2019s. That sweet smell of perfume reminds of my women. There are so many smells that make me excited every time I catch a scent of them. Sometimes I wish I could make a candle out of all the smells I enjoy and memorize through my life. I would burn that candle any time I have a bad day to take a trip down memory lane. Smell can determine so many things. sometimes I feel like my nose has its own little brain. Like sometimes I will smell something and aromatically know what it is. Its crazy how our brains memorize all the smells we have smelled through our life and the even crazier part is I still have many years to go hopefully and many more smells to discover. But smells can be a blessing and a curse, present smells make us happy but bad smells make us quiver and sick to are stomachs. Smells will always be important in our life. Without smell we couldn\u2019t do a lot things that we do. It plays a very important role in our life.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHow Much Power Do Books Have to Teach Young People Tolerance of Others?\u201d asked students to comment on a judge\u2019s decision to have wrongdoers read books to correct their mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmily Ball from Wilmington, N.C., said the judge assigned the books as a learning experience:\n\nMy reaction to the punishments was the same as Ms. Sran\u2019s in the article, being that if they don\u2019t understand the meaning of what they are doing, then just sending them to do community service won\u2019t do them, or society any good. The books give them a good look into the severity of what they did. I don\u2019t think that the judge who sentenced the teenagers to read the books meant it as a punishment, it was meant to be a learning experience. Watching one of the movies could do the same thing, but the judge saw the benefit of reading the book. When reading a book, one is immersed in the imagery that is sometimes hard to show in a movie. If I were a judge, I would do all that I could to solve the problem, not suppress it, and I think this is exactly what this judge did. Other forms of community service may teach the people a lesson, but the idea of learning why what they did was wrong would be the best thing to do to change their lives.\n\nC. Hunter from Denver agreed with Emily:\n\nTake away the word, \u201cpunishment\u201d in this article. I agree with Emily. \u201cLearning experience\u201d or another word or phrase emphasizing the assignment as positive is needed.\n\nZach from Northern New Jersey thought what the judge did was creative:\n\nThis punishment that the juveniles were given, reading books to expand their knowledge and remove their ignorance, was a very creative idea. Becoming more knowledgeable about the meanings behind the symbols they used or the insults they said would make them more remorseful on their actions, not just regretful that they were caught. Reading being used as a punishment would not lead to resistance to it in the future, but would rather motivate the juveniles to read more to develop a more intuitive mind. One book is all it takes to open one\u2019s mind and help one realize how much potential they have. However the punishments these teenagers received was in itself to soft. Of course reading was an innovative way to teach them about their mistakes, they should still be punished for them. The judge should have had them serve community service in order to show others that there are real consequences to their actions. Reading a book can literally place you in someone else\u2019s story, giving you an insight on their ideas and cultures. Reading gives you a look on how others live their lives, and you can find similarities and differences in that. That is why this idea with reading works because the vandals will have the great opportunity to not only learn from their mistakes, but to grow from them and help them become a better human being.\n\nAminah I. from Providence, R.I., felt the offenders will expand their views in a positive way:\n\nThe use of books being a form of \u2018punishment\u2019 for teenagers is the best type of reform to implement on them. Personally, I am a book lover. Any genre, any size, I will read. In my opinion, I believe that the characters in books have the ability to change the way someone thinks. I know it did for me. However, instead of enforcing specific books onto the juvenile offenders, I think that they should be able to choose any book of their choice from a specific genre. Most of the time, I feel like it\u2019s a burden when an individual forces me to read a book. By allowing the offenders to have a sense of control over what they read, they will be encouraged to read more and expand their narrow perspective.\n\nMaddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., believed this helped the teens involved:\n\nMost people would agree that they seem to enjoy a book more when they just get to read it. No marking passages, no time limit. Just you and a book of your choice. I believe this really helped these teens. Yes, this group of vandals that had defaced a historical black schoolhouse with insensitive racist symbols, had to pick from a list, but they got to chose the book, and they learned from it. You learn so much better just reading other\u2019s stories and what they had to go through than sitting in a room, listening to someone list the reasons why what you did was wrong. Books can be so powerful, and obviously, these reads left a lasting impression on the group. At first they didn\u2019t understand what what they were doing even meant, but after being able to read about how others had to go through thing such as the holocaust in \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel, racism in the South in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by Harper Lee, and what it is like being an immigrant in \u201cThe Tortilla Curtain\u201d by T.C. Boyle.It just proves how you can learn so much just by picking up a book, even how to be a better person.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Picture Prompt \"Campus\" asked students what they think the image is saying, or to use their imaginations to write the opening of a short story or poem from the point of view of one of the characters in the illustration.\n\nNika Burik from Russia said the image tells the story of a simple college life:\n\nI would call this story \u201cfind your friends and don\u2019t get lost yourself.\u201d This is a very bright spot, very bright campus that symbolizes a wonderful student days.

I\u2019m just making my way through the street like I do every day. Just the same as the last, the same colours as the last, the same sounds as the last. The same movements as the last. There\u2019s nothing particular here, we\u2019re all different I know, but it\u2019s all the same. If an artist portrayed us we\u2019d all be made of different brush strokes, but we\u2019re all the same, are we not? Trying to get somewhere, trying to do something, so we never really pay attention to the colors of others. Her and his and their fluorescent pinks, they don\u2019t glance at my bright yellow. Until our eyes meet. But that\u2019s a story for another day. When I\u2019m not busy and rushing on my way.\n\nJohn Burgee from Wilmington, N.C., envisioned two friends meeting for the first time:\n\nI need to find out where I am going \u2026 I am a freshman in my college and I\u2019m trying to get to my history class on time. I\u2019ve got to be the only one as dressed up as I am for my first day. Surrounding me are people in all different colors with unique outfits and friends that are all doing different things. I am alone until I almost run into a cat in front of me. Realizing that it was being chased by a boy I returned the cat to the owner. He thanked me for returning his pet and asked if I knew where world history was. I smiled and laughed as I told him you\u2019re not alone and I realized how wrong I was. We ended up becoming great friends throughout college and became roommates.\n\nHannah from Pennsylvania imagined overcoming anxiety:\n\nMy heart is pounding as I embark on this journey. The wild and colorful beasts are all around me, pushing and shoving me so much that I feel like I might be trampled. I think to get out my phone and text my mother to tell her I love her, just in case this expedition is fatal. Just when it seemed like I was never going to come back from this, I realize I have successfully crossed the commons without my panic attack getting too bad. We didn\u2019t need a repeat of last year. I shudder at the thought. Time to get to class, until the next bell rings and we do it all again.\n\nBella D. from Pennsylvania wrote about getting to class on time:\n\nI standing dead center of the great lawn, planning my route to get through the massive crowd of people. Left at the group playing frisbee, then a hard right towards the couple laying on the lawn. I had somewhat of an idea of where I was going, then all of a sudden, my feet started moving and next thing I knew, I was in the middle of the Great Lawn. My plan kinda worked, but I intended to be a little more to the left than where I was right now. I ended up running the rest of the way, through the lawn, dodging people left and right. All I had to do was make it to the other side, then I was basically in my classroom.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter news of a massive data leak, we wanted to know: \u201cDo You Trust Facebook?\u201d And who should be responsible for protecting users\u2019 data?\n\nTimosha Fesenko from Rhode Island said she doesn\u2019t know how anyone could trust Facebook any more:\n\nI have a facebook account which I never use nor do I really care about it anymore. After the data leak, I don\u2019t know how anyone could trust facebook. It\u2019s clear what lengths people, such as Zuckerberg, go to just to make more money than they already do. Zuckerberg violated the \u201cbranch of trust\u201d that he extended to all Facebook users and in turn, got caught red-handed. The company clearly doesn\u2019t have the people\u2019s interest in mind whatsoever. Violating a slogan which was used to start the company does not show sympathy or care for any users they have.\n\nJosh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., said Facebook needs to take more responsibility for protecting its users:\n\nThis recent data leak sums up the problems that come with social media. The fact that a company like Cambridge Analytica is able obtain your private information that easily is scary to me. It makes me wonder what the real purpose of all this social media really is. Is it a way for us to be able to share things with friends and family and to keep up with the world, or is it just a platform for companies and the government to learn anything they want about you. Facebook not only displays information about where you live, your birth date, and name, but just from the pictures you like, companies can know about your personality and how to persuade you in certain situations. Without ever meeting some of companies, they may know your entire life. Some might say that if you don\u2019t want you privacy taken away, then just don\u2019t use Facebook. For some, this is very easy, but it is hard for others because of the instant gratification that Facebook and other sites bring in. Whenever someone likes or comments on your post, you feel a sense of gratification. It\u2019s almost like social media keeps sucking you in because of your desire for likes. Facebook should be more protective or their users privacy instead of handing it out to the rest of the world.\n\nMelody S. from Florida agreed, adding that government regulation of social media would be a step too far:\n\nthe facebook data leak was dangerous to everyone who uses facebook. Our privacy is the most important thing and social media shouldn\u2019t be trusted with it. I don\u2019t trust facebook or any social media since it is so easy for people to hack accounts and reach all your information. the company doesn\u2019t have people\u2019s best interests in mind seeing as they allowed this to happen. I do not think that social media platforms should be regulated by the government because that breaks our freedom of posterity and doesn\u2019t allow us to use social media as our ways to express ourselves as who we really are. The government regulating our posts will just bring back censorship and it will allow the government to start taking away our rights. Facebook should protect users data better because even though users can chose what the post, they should still have some type of privacy to share things with their friends online and not have anyone else be able to access it.\n\nBut Jeffrey Settlemyre from Wilmington, N.C., thought users should understand what they\u2019re signing up for and make their own decisions about what to share:\n\nMultiple times I\u2019ve been told, and perhaps some of the whole hasn\u2019t, that anything you post on Social Media that\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d privacy, now becomes anyone\u2019s privacy. Whenever you sign up for a social media site, or for anything in the world, there is always a contract; a contract that few ever feel the need to read. For Facebook there was a very clear Terms of Service; \u201cFor content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post\u2026\u201d. How people share their personal experiences and in-depth details of their life on Social Media, for the whole world to see, not paying attention to the contract, or the simple fact that anyone can see it, befuddles me. Who are you to blame but yourself? The social platform must be to blame, right?\n\nCoral3D from YC CLIP was very careful:\n\nI am Facebook user about 6 years ago. In these time, I wrote my personality information but I dint know what importance is to share this information about myself. Now, I am very meticulous about what shared with my friends, what tweets I like and what information I put about me. When you answer an online test or poll you do not know for what or for who is these information, and these is very dangerous. Facebook did a very bad activity sharing our privacy because they are supposed to protect our personal information, but we are responsibilities too. We are responsibilities because we need to be smart and think that in these world so computerizing, our personal data is being exposed all the time and you do not know who is going to see it, and with what purpose. When we are in the internet, we read that the page used cookies and we accept, but we know exactly what it means? So, I think that we need know more about all of these things and act accordingly.\n\nSarai3D from YC CLIP remains skeptical of Facebook\u2019s true motives, though:\n\nIn my opinion, this Facebook data leak was responsibility of the company because they have the whole information that people bring to them. Most of this people bring their information and do not know what this company should do with it, even though you do not want to bring too much information about you Facebook push people to give unnecessary information in my point of view. People have to be a little more reserved with things that they shared with other people because now it is a great issue, we aren\u2019t take a due responsibilities with our information and private life. We have to learn to make a good use about this kind of tools such as communicate with important people to us, if you think that you do not bring too much information to Facebook you already did with google. Why does Facebook need all those information about us? We do not know even though we accept terms and conditions; well, no one is going to take a little time to read all those small words, neither do I.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur fashion-forward readers told us about the trends they think should be revived \u2014 and those they hoped would die \u2014 in response to our Picture Prompt \u201cFashion Comebacks.\u201d\n\nZoe S. from New Jersey loves to see styles from the past re-emerge:\n\nI myself am a huge fan of older fashion trends making a reappearance and mixing with modern trends to create something new and unique. The woman in the photograph is wearing clothing that appears to be very old fashioned; the brown blazer and short culottes are extremely 90s-esque, but her hairstyle and the black shoes, that appear to be similar in style to Gucci\u2019s popular classic black slides, make the look feel more modern. An older fashion trend that I would like to see revived is fit and flare jeans/pants. They are being included more and more into high end runway looks and have already trickled down to Instagram models everywhere. The idea that skinny jeans/pants are the only attractive pant is a misconception; realistically, fit and flare pants make the body look more proportional, and with more emphasis on embracing different body types, I think these pants would be suitable for everyone when styled correctly.\n\nNyah Price from Providence, R.I., agreed:\n\nVintage is becoming the new sensation of our generation. We are learning to appreciate the fashion of our forefathers and mothers. I think that going vintage is a great trend to follow, while it\u2019s great to come up with your own original idea it I also great to learn from history to make something equally impressive. Personally, I love the 50s swing dresses and I wish those would come back because honestly, they are so cute. They were dresses that were easy to move in, seeing that they were made to dance in. Something that I think should stay in the past is wearing leotards on top of our clothing, it really wasn\u2019t a very flattering outfit.\n\nJuan Hernandez from Classical High School, Providence, R.I., was also looking forward to some revived spring trends:\n\nSpring is one of the best times for fashion. The colors of nature are finally starting to bloom, the sun is out and it is finally warm again. Many see Spring as a time for fashion designers to release new lines of clothes. Nowadays, many fashion designers like to look to clothes in the past for inspiration like neon windbreakers, denim jackets and track pants. These are all great fashion pieces that came back and are killing it in the fashion game. Now, there are other fashion trends that should stay dead like sweatbands, leg warmers, and MC Hammer pants. They just shouldn\u2019t come back.\n\nBut Emma Claire Lisk from Wilmington, N.C., thought the past should stay in the past:\n\nEnough with this nostalgia fashion! Today, the walls of fast fashion stores are lined primarily with the trends of the \u201880s and \u201890s making this age seem like copycat fashion. High-end fashion companies, like Balencia and Gucci, have been taking trends that blossomed on the runway decades ago but slightly modernized them to be made the \u201ctrend\u201d of this decade. Sure, a few trends could come back like bell-bottoms have over the years, but it has become overwhelming when the major fashion trends of 2018 are crushed velvet, statement chokers, track pants, and more that also started in the \u201880s and \u201890s. I say, we as a fashion community must end the recycling of style comebacks, and start generating styles of our own.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Picture Prompt \"College\" asked students how the image relates to society, or comments on it, and if and how they might relate to the image personally.\n\nSesha Patel from Wilmington, N.C., said the image reflects unequal economic factors:\n\nAt first glance, this picture seems to be depicting the attainment of a degree between two different groups. One group, the more privileged, have a grand, red-carpeted staircase which allows them to easily descend up and collect their \u201cprize\u201d. On the other hand, the other group is desperately trying to pull themselves up by means of the tassle. They are in the shadows and seem to be completely overlooked by the people relaxing on the top of the cap. I believe this shows the struggles of those less fortunate in their journey to receiving a proper college or high-school education. Some people just have everything working for them: grades, socioeconomic status, opportunities, but others have to find another way to achieve the same goal. After reading the article, it seems the other is trying to prove this very point. He feels guilty that while he and his family could afford a great Ivy league education, others cannot simply because of their family\u2019s income. While there is some economic diversity, most high ranked colleges have more students from the top 1% than the entire bottom 60%. I agree that college opportunity shouldn\u2019t be unavailable just because of an individual\u2019s inability to pay a large sum. As a country, we need to work towards making college more accessible to those who deserve it but can\u2019t attend just because of a poor economic situation.\n\nMackenzie Smith from Los Angeles, thinks hardships are endless, but that nevertheless students should be encouraged and motivated:\n\nThis image depicts an extremely significant message toward the young adults of our generation. It is illustrated that some people find their way to college quite easily, making their way to university with little struggle. However, others are faced with more challenges when try to go to college. The hardships are endless, this could consist of financial aid, lack of acceptance, GPA/SAT scores, and more. Despite the obvious problems, these students will still find their way to college one way or another \u2014 it just may not be as easy for them. Nonetheless, college is an achievable goal for every high school graduate. Students should be encouraged and motivated by this picture and look forward to the upcoming years.\n\nEmily Brodeur from Rhode Island said college is a way to success:\n\nThis photo prompt conveys a very important message. The act of people climbing the stairs to reach the top of the graduation cap represents that college is the way to reach success. The message in this is that education can help anyone reach the top of their goals. In the photo, there are two sets of people depicted. Although one group appears to be struggling to climb the tassel of the cap, the other group has red carpet stairs to walk up. Either way, with or without difficulty, eventually, the students will reach their goals and be on top for graduation.\n\nTara Samtmann from Wilmington, N.C., said a fairer college admissions process should be a goal:\n\nIn this picture, I see two groups going towards the same goal but on two completely different paths. This picture is signifying the wealthy and the poor I believe. The wealthier can walk their red carpet into anywhere or anything and receive something they might not deserve. Then there is the people cast in the shadow of the red carpet, showing they are hidden behind all the \u201csuccessful\u201d people. They are trying to climb up the tassel and begging for help but are simply ignored because they are less valuable than the wealthy. This image is showing the struggles of the less fortunate in society and college. People should be chosen by a college for who they are academically and actions they took to get here, not by how much money they have or if there family is alumni. In the Harvard class of 2021, 29% had a parent or grandparent attend there. Legacy admission should no longer be around, it is unfair for the people who have worked so hard to get into an Ivy League but have a lesser of a chance because their parents didn\u2019t attend that college. More colleges need to start following the footsteps of Emory and Princeton, by not looking at if the applicant has taken tours or visited the college into consideration when looking to see if they will be accepted. It is unfair because some people can not afford to take a tour. We need to work towards a fair college admissions process, so everyone can have a chance at getting great education.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion question \u201cWhat \u2018Pop-Up\u2019 Classes Do You Wish Your School Offered?\u201d asked students if they would choose to go to class during free time if the class interested them, and why?\n\nJosh Waverly from Nebraska thought a Lego class would be nice:\n\nI like the idea a lot, and feel it could be very beneficial. I would probably choose to go to a class like this if it would interest me, because when it comes down to it, knowledge is power. I would probably do the \u00b4drones and rockets\u00b4 class that was stated in Ellin\u00b4s article. This is because I really enjoy STEM type classes. I wish our school would offer something first aid related, because it is very important. I would teach a class about LEGO\u00b4s. I would teach it very hands on, and tie it into architecture and creativity.\n\nElise Ngo from California liked the idea, and would like to learn more about gun control:\n\nI really like the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes because they give students the opportunity to explore and experiment in different fields that they may be interested in. Many people pay a lot of money to go to specialized classes, but pop-up classes allow every student the opportunity to try something new. With that said, I would definitely choose to go to a pop-up class in my free time because I love to learn more about something that I am interested in. I would like to take the gun control class at Bennington College that was mentioned in the article because I think that with the recent gun violence that has been plaguing the United States, it is important to learn more about gun policy.\n\nAndrea Augustus from Fountain Valley, Calif., would take creative writing and a class on \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d\n\nI think \u201cpop-up\u201d classes would be a great addition to my school. They allow students who wish to explore a topic to do so, and students who feel too stressed out aren\u2019t forced to go. I believe that pop-up classes would create a better learning environment because every student that attends one, wants to be there, and when the room is full of students that want to learn, it is very effective. Many students want to take initiative in their education and learn about topics they care about, and these classes are a perfect opportunity. I would attend a pop-up class if it was one of my interests because the more you know about different topics, the more equipped you are to deal with adulthood and I believe that everything you learn will benefit you. The class mentioned in the article that I would take is \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d, because I have heard a lot of different opinions about the topic of race, and I would want to be more educated. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about social media and how it affects our society. If I taught a pop-up class, it would be about creative writing because I love creative writing and although we write plenty of essays in school, we never write creatively.\n\nEmma from New Jersey would teach a class on psychology:\n\nI think the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes is very creative and innovative. It gives students a chance to explore outside of their comfort zone. After a while, going along with the regular curriculum gets a bit dull. This would be a breath of fresh air. I would take the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d class because I feel like it\u2019s such an important issue that affects many people. I wish my school offered a pop-up class about our country\u2019s politics. I know, I know, this topic is so overrated. But everything moves so fast that I can\u2019t keep up, and can\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on. Discussing it and debating about it would be great. If I could teach a pop-up class, it would be about psychology, and more specifically, the social aspect. Many people have a hard time connecting with others, and I want to break it down to understand how the mind works and reacts to certain things.\n\nIsabella Guerra from California liked the idea of \u201cpop-up\u201d classes and wanted to exercise her mind:\n\nI love the idea of \u201cpop up\u201d classes I think this type of classes is not only benefitting the students but the teachers as well. The change of environment and the timing I believes tricks the mind that school or class is not really taking place and gives you reassurance in the mind that you normally would be worrying in a normal class setting. This also gives teachers elbow room because now they can talk about other topics further on without needing to care what they say for school\u2019s purposes and judgement. I really thought the class: \u2018Self-Determination: Restoration and Resiliency,\u2019 at St. Michael\u2019s College because I love that it is not just something academic but something you can apply in life and I love things that exercise my mind. I would love to teach a pop up class on art history like going to a museum to see different arts or a something with culture to enrich students with different ethnicities and customs. The class could be maybe at culture center or even where there is prone to be only one type of culture in that area while still teaching the history of that culture.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents had mixed feelings about the Student Opinion question \u201cIs Now the Best Time in Human History to Be Alive?\u201d\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., said, without a doubt, it is:\n\nAlthough far from perfect, I believe that now is the best time to be alive. The world is changing and globalizing at a record speed. Places once closed off are becoming more accesible. Even some of the most remote nations, Myanmar, Micronesia and Tanzania, just to name a few, are opening up. With this move towards an interconnected world comes the empowerment of those once undermined, fueled by the Internet. This is the world of the future. Driverless cars are a reality, along with holograms of once deceased singers and potential commercial space flights. There is so much room for innovation, in every field imaginable and more. Inequality and poverty are becoming less prevalent. There are more opportunities for rural women and girls, whose options once looked bleak. More females are running for office than ever before. Minorities are rising up. Whenever I read the news each day, I see an endless stream of articles about war and tragedy. But, I choose to look past the grim and focus on the positive. Of course, no world is perfect, certainly not ours, but there is so much growth in our society that one cannot help but embrace it.\n\nMarie from America was less certain:\n\nI believe that today in time we are certainly lucky to have many new advancements, especially in technology. We can easily get in touch with friends and family in case of emergency. However there are times I wish I grew up 10 years ago when no one had to worry about how many followers they have or how long ago someone opened a snap chat. Back then without advanced technology and media, life was probably much easier and less complicated. Now teenagers today live in panic and are worrying about their phones at all times. With the internet, teens are more exposed to the dangers of the world and it puts them in a constant panic.\n\nVoltron Thunderstorm from Wilmington, N.C., thought it all depends on your perspective:\n\nAccording to Steven Pinker, your beliefs regarding the progress and quality of today\u2019s world is all dependent on how you look at things- and he\u2019s absolutely right. You can look at things in terms of how bad they\u2019ve gotten, or you could look at things in terms of how much we\u2019ve improved upon those bad things; and once you do, it\u2019s hard to disagree with him. Throughout our evolution, we\u2019ve lost things, but we\u2019ve definitely gained things too. And your personal \u201cgolden age\u201d will reflect what you believe to be most important. For example, environmentalists might say it was back before the industrial revolution \u2014 or even further \u2014 when humans didn\u2019t have such an impact on the environment. My ideal time to be born is in the future when humans have built successful colonies on other planets, and I fully credit this to my interest in astronomy. The one thing you can\u2019t argue with is our capacity to change and evolve. Steven Pinker said that \u201cThe Enlightenment\u201d changed everything for the better; it worked. And it\u2019s also working now. As time has gone on, humans have been advancing at an exponential rate. Pinkers understand that, overall, the world has become a better place- despite the media\u2019s exaggerated image of our Earth. The Enlightenment started a movement that I don\u2019t think will ever be stopped, and I\u2019m sure that future humans will say the same things about their vastly improved world too.\n\nSean Harris from Wilmington, N.C., blamed the news for making the world seem worse than it is:\n\nI am not at all surprised by Mr. Pinker\u2019s claim, the world is without a doubt a better place to live in now than ever before. Like he said, lifespans are longer, human rights are better, and lives are more comfortable (in general) than in the past. Yes, the past may have been simpler, but I know for a fact that I would choose high taxes, bad internet connection, and some social issues over having more than half of my country\u2019s population wiped out by the plague. I feel that the reason we hear so much more bad news these days is not because there is more bad news to hear, but more ways to hear it. The sources that supply news are businesses, they need to make money. If they see that bad news sells better, they will sell more bad news. I think acknowledging progress motivates people to keep advancing. They appreciate it when you take notice of their accomplishments and it makes them want to do it more, not less.\n\nKylie Lundy from Wilmington, N.C., changed her mind as she learned more:\n\nOverall I do believe now is the best time to be alive due to a multitude of technological advancements along with the new equality movements that have risen in the past decade. However, when I first read this article my original answer was that the world isn\u2019t becoming a better place or it isn\u2019t the best time to be alive due to the latest displays of gun violence, inequality of gender and race, opioid epidemic, and terrorism. This article changed my mind because statistics show that extreme poverty has improved, life expectancy is much longer, and \u201c90% of the world\u2019s population under the age 25 years can read and write\u201d. All of these are extraordinary accomplishments, and are overlooked because this type of improvement is not immediate, it takes time. Furthermore, I agree with the author of Enlightenment Now because when all we do is look at the negative, we will always fail to see the good.\n\nRobert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., said certain advancements have made the world a better place to live:\n\nIn the midst of the sensationalized stories and journalism spoon-fed to us by commercialized news stations, it can be hard to take a step back and acknowledge the significant progress humans have made in the past couple of centuries. As Pinker said, the immense improvement of global health, affluence, and intelligence, as well as other more recent progressions such as the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, seem to go virtually unnoticed in the interest of pushing for even more regulations. However, this seemingly endless hunger for progress seen in our very politically active generation has been and forever will be crucial to achieving the goal of equality on our planet. Many hundreds of years ago, the impoverished citizens living under the oppressive rule of their oftentimes coronated male leader knew they weren\u2019t being treated fairly, but they had no choice but to accept the fate they were born into or be executed for speaking against the government. Now, with the spread of democracy, many citizens are allowed to protest and vote on hot-topic issues, and we have the ability to push for progress until we can reach the most realistically equal state possible. That\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s currently the best time to be alive in human history, but I don\u2019t doubt that, assuming humans continue their pressuring of politicians to make positive progress for human rights and the environment, the future will hold a society that\u2019d make living in 2018 seem awful in comparison.\n\nBut Timosha Fesenko from Rhode Island thought some of those human creations have made life today worse:\n\nI believe the best time in human history would be when the leaders of the world stop thinking more nuclear missiles is the path to world peace. Only then would I be able to think that it\u2019s the best time in human history. with such weapons of mass destruction, the condition of our planet is at constant risk.\n\nZac Gill from Wilmington, N.C., believes it\u2019s good to acknowledge progress, but that there is still more work to do:\n\nThe idea that the world is becoming a livelier, healthier, and an overall improved place doesn\u2019t shock me at all. Around the world, the standard of living in the last century has drastically improved surpassing any point of recognition. So, do I believe that right now is a better time than ever to be alive? Of course I do. That said, there\u2019s still obvious work to be done. Equality is something many oppressed minorities long for and never achieve. Another pressing issue nowadays is public education, underfunded and underdeveloped educational systems around the world are stunting the growth of youthful minds. There have been so many great advancements in medicine, science, politics, and so much more that it\u2019s impossible to suggest there has been a better time for man. Progression is the key to human advancement. Steven Pinker made a great point disproving claims that tragedy put an end to progress. Those who feel our society is not advancing due to various tragedies or epidemics are naive and two-dimensional. I feel just as Pinker does, that progress cannot always be defined by the expulsion of evil, but by the transformation of society\u2019s most pressing issues. I also agree with Pinker\u2019s views on ignoring progression and the result of that. If groups of people band together to deny or resent the state of progression, how are we to move forward? Denying man\u2019s strides in environmentalism, equality, politics and economics hinders the progression of the future.\n\n_________", "title": "Spring Fashion, Facebook, Animal Welfare and the Power of Books to Teach: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

If a deal goes through now, it will create a wireless giant with more than 127 million customers \u2014 large enough to challenge Verizon and AT&T, which have long dominated the market. As a result, three companies would control almost the entirety of the American wireless industry.\n\nA deal would allow both carriers to stay competitive as the costs of retaining subscribers rose and bigger rivals built out next-generation wireless networks.\n\nService providers are preparing to spend billions to expand their so-called 5G infrastructure, money that Sprint and T-Mobile are harder pressed than the competition to spend.

{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a case of going from four to three wireless companies \u2014 there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,\u201d John Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, who would become the combined company\u2019s leader, said in a statement. He said that the industry is in a mash-up with cable players like Charter and Comcast that are trying to get into wireless, and that AT&T is now the largest TV provider in the country.\n\nIt is true that the wireless and cable industries are likely to continue to transform over the next decade, but it is far from clear how the market will be divided. The efforts by the cable companies to get into the wireless game are nascent and, at least so far, unproved.\n\nFor better or worse, regulators generally make their assessments based on the current marketplace; they are not prophets.\n\nPart of T-Mobile-Sprint\u2019s argument is that the combined company could rapidly deploy the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G, and that its progress in that area would force AT&T and Verizon to move faster.\n\n\u201cOnly the combined company will have the network capacity required to quickly create a broad and deep 5G nationwide network in the critical first years of the 5G innovation cycle \u2014 the years that will determine if American firms lead or follow in the 5G digital economy,\u201d the companies said in a statement.\n\nThey also suggest, perhaps trying to align themselves with President Trump\u2019s jobs agenda, that the merger would create more, not fewer, jobs.\n\nBut many analysts are not convinced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is credible,\u201d Craig Moffett, a veteran telecommunications analyst from the firm MoffettNathanson, said of the claim about jobs. \u201cAnd AT&T and Verizon are going to do 5G anyway.\u201d", "title": "Sprint and T-Mobile Try Again, but Antitrust Hurdles Remain the Same", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-29 00:00:00", "text": "A combined T-Mobile and Sprint, with almost 100 million retail subscribers as of Dec. 31, would put it ahead of AT&T, with 93.6 million, and not far behind Verizon\u2019s 116.3 million. (Or, as the colorful Mr. Legere put it, the transaction would help it better compete against the companies that he has previously referred to as \u201cdumb and dumber.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear how hard Verizon and AT&T will try to fight the deal, if they will at all. A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment, while a spokesman for Verizon said in a statement that it was focused on building its own 5G network, \u201cnot just a proposal that may or may not happen in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the moment, consumers are unlikely to see much change, apart from an agreement by Sprint and T-Mobile that customers of either company could use the other company\u2019s network. Until the deal is completed, which the carriers said they hoped would be by July of next year, they must continue to compete. That means they could potentially be adversaries in a government-run auction of 5G network airwaves, known as spectrum, that is scheduled to begin this fall.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers quickly questioned the merits of the deal. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement, \u201cI remain concerned that increased consolidation could undermine benefits to consumers.\u201d But Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat from T-Mobile\u2019s home state of Washington, tweeted that he welcomed the news of potential job creation.\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint contend that the market looks different than it did when they last tried to combine in 2014. The need to build out 5G requires tens of billions of dollars in investments that T-Mobile and Sprint, especially, would be hard-pressed to put up on their own. And there are fresh competitors in the sector. Comcast, for example, has quickly drawn hundreds of thousands of wireless service customers by bundling mobile phones with their cable plans, even if it loses the company money.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Proponents say the superfast wireless standard would not only make downloading movies faster, but underpin huge advances in autonomous vehicles, internet-connected devices and more.\n\nThe White House has declared 5G wireless a vital national priority. In March, the Trump administration blocked a hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom for San Diego-based Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. Some analysts questioned whether the predominantly foreign ownership of the combined company \u2014 including SoftBank, which has business ties to Chinese companies like Huawei \u2014 poses possible national security risks.\n\nInvesting in new 5G networks as separate companies would be difficult for T-Mobile and Sprint, given their current financial situations. Sprint has about $32 billion in debt on its books, while T-Mobile generates a fraction of the cash that Verizon and AT&T do. But combining would yield some $6 billion in cost savings, especially because the companies would need to pay to run just one network instead of two, allowing them to spend more money on infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe can change the nature of the curve in the way the U.S. and others are investing in 5G,\u201d Mr. Legere said in the interview. He added that he shared worries \u201cthat the U.S. is on the verge of losing the leadership it has attained\u201d in 5G.\n\nFor consumer advocates, however, the chief worry is that a shrinking number of providers would bring an end to the innovations that T-Mobile introduced to the American wireless market since the Justice Department blocked its plan to sell itself to AT&T in 2011. Under Mr. Legere, T-Mobile cut prices, ended long-term contract requirements and promised to simplify customer bills by eliminating hidden fees and surprise taxes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.\n\n\u201cThe success of the four-firm market is proven for consumers in lower prices and better offerings,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, who was the chairman of the F.C.C. when he opposed a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile in 2014. \u201cIt is hard to see how removing the competition that created improves things for consumers.\u201d\n\nHis successor atop the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, has indicated that he is more open to letting companies join together. He has said that he was not wedded to an ideal number of wireless carriers in the market, and that his job is to approach his analysis with \u201chumility\u201d and an open mind.\n\nThe Trump-appointed antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, is more of a wild card, having shown concern about antitrust violations in the telecommunications industry. His team has sued to block AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, arguing that it would force consumers to pay more for content like CNN and HBO. He has also opened an investigation into allegations that Verizon and AT&T had made it difficult for consumers to switch to another provider.\n\nAnd many of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust staff members are holdovers from 2014, when Mr. Delrahim\u2019s predecessor also opposed Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s first attempt to merge. Representatives of the F.C.C. and the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nBut the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson said the issue of what is best for consumers is not merely a question of numbers.\n\n\u201cIs it lower prices,\u201d he asked, \u201cor more availability of advanced consumer technology?\u201d", "title": "Sprint and T-Mobile to Merge, in Bid to Remake Wireless Market", "authors": ["Michael J.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "As it is, the chances of a wider and bloodier war over Syria have grown in recent days. Syrian tanks and artillery have reportedly entered the demilitarized buffer zone near the Israeli border, in brazen violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, as they prepare to sweep rebel forces from the rest of the border area. Israel did very little to deny its attack Monday on an air base used by Iran in central Syria, and Jerusalem is threatening more aggressive steps to keep Tehran from further entrenching itself militarily in its client state. The Iranians have vowed retaliation for the attack, which they are sure to make good on, probably via their proxies in Hezbollah. And tensions between Israel and Russia are at their highest point since the Cold War, in part because Israel did not notify Russia in advance of Monday\u2019s attack.\n\nSo where is the United States in all of this?\n\nAs Michael Doran pointed out in an astute Times op-ed on Tuesday, Trump seems to have violated his own ostensible rules for winning in recent days. First he promised to withdraw U.S. forces, which would eliminate what little military leverage we have with Syria (and Turkey), and then he telegraphed the kind of feckless missile strike he seems intent on carrying out sometime in the coming hours or days.\n\nBut the truth about current U.S. policy is worse. For starters, there is no policy: The president and his commanding general in the Middle East, Joseph Votel, have offered flatly contradictory statements about what the U.S. intends to do in Syria. We long ago pulled the plug on supporting relatively moderate Syrian rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad. And the absence of policy itself runs counter to what is supposed to be Trump\u2019s overarching goal of blunting Iran\u2019s regional ambitions and forcing a renegotiation of the nuclear deal.\n\nTo adapt Churchill\u2019s line about Russia, Trump\u2019s approach to Syria is an impulse wrapped in indifference inside an incoherence. It makes Barack Obama\u2019s failed Syria policy look savvy, since at least the former president\u2019s reluctance to get involved was consonant with his overarching desire to improve relations with Tehran.\n\nA limited missile strike that slightly degrades Assad\u2019s military capabilities will change none of this, just as last year\u2019s U.S. strike changed nothing. What could work? In a column I wrote for The Wall Street Journal in 2013, I argued that the U.S. should target Assad and his senior lieutenants directly in a decapitation strike, just as the U.S. attempted in Iraq in 2003, and against Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nNothing that has happened in the intervening five years has changed my view about this. If we are serious about restoring an international norm against the use of chemical weapons, then the penalty for violating the norm must be severe. And if we are serious about confronting Iran, Syria remains the most important battlefield. An extended U.S. air campaign to destroy Tehran\u2019s military assets in the country would send the message that we will not tolerate its attempt to colonize Syria and threaten its neighbors. It could also help avert the looming war on Israel\u2019s north and persuade Russia that its adventure in Syria won\u2019t pay long-term results, especially if Assad is gone.", "title": "Opinion | Staring Down on Syria", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France issued statements following President Trump\u2019s announcement on Friday evening that the United States had launched airstrikes on Syria. The three governments said they were acting in response to a chemical-weapons attack carried out by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government on April 7.\n\nMrs. May issued the following statement:\n\nThis evening I have authorized British armed forces to conduct coordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical-weapons capability and deter their use. We are acting together with our American and French allies.\n\nIn Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror. The fact of this attack should surprise no one. The Syrian regime has a history of using chemical weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.\n\nAnd a significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian regime is responsible for this latest attack. This persistent pattern of behavior must be stopped \u2014 not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons. We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.\n\nBut our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted. Even this week the Russians vetoed a Resolution at the U.N. Security Council which would have established an independent investigation into the Douma attack. So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change. It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties. And while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\n\nAt this time, my thoughts are with our brave British servicemen and women \u2014 and our French and American partners \u2014 who are carrying out their duty with the greatest professionalism. The speed with which we are acting is essential in cooperating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations. This is the first time as Prime Minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat \u2014 and it is not a decision I have taken lightly.\n\nI have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain\u2019s national interest. We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalized \u2014 within Syria, on the streets of the U.K., or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none. History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe. That is what our country has always done.

{"date": "2018-04-21 00:00:00", "text": "Long before the advent of Mr. Trump, the federal response to this contamination crisis had been slow. Though the first reports of PFOA in drinking water are now two decades old, the Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator, Scott Pruitt, have yet to set enforceable limits on it. In 2006, DuPont and seven other companies that manufactured or used PFOA agreed to phase it out by 2015, along with other long-chain perfluorinated compounds. The agency did set drinking water health advisory limits for PFOA and PFOS in 2016, but those can\u2019t be used to enforce cleanups \u2014 nor do the limits prevent further use of products containing any of the chemicals in their class.\n\nUnlike the federal government, Washington State came up with an ingenious solution. Late last month, it passed the first state laws banning firefighting foam and food packaging containing not just PFOA and PFOS, but the entire class of chemicals to which they belong. Though chemical manufacturers have argued that some compounds in the class are safer than others, Washington banned them all. This class \u2014 known as PFAS \u2014 is huge. The E.P.A. has received information from manufacturers about hundreds of unique PFAS chemicals. Around the world, thousands are in commercial use. Like PFOS and PFOA, they may affect immune and liver function as well as hormone levels. But, as Dr. Swanson discovered, almost nothing is known for sure about their health effects.\n\nThe scarcity of research on the lesser-known PFAS chemicals helps explain why the E.P.A. issued drinking water health advisories for only the two best-known chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. Washington State lawmakers might also have held off on taking action until they had definitive studies on each compound. Instead they took a leap. Forgoing the years or perhaps decades of research necessary for the chemicals to be fully understood, they figured it was safest to assume the worst: that since the chemicals all belong to the same class and have similar structures, they are likely to affect people in similar ways.\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable conclusion that others have reached the hard way. A factory in Parkersburg, W.Va., first brought the dangers of PFOA to the world\u2019s attention in 2005, when the initial stage of a class-action suit over the chemical was settled. The plant, then owned by DuPont, had let PFOA seep into the drinking water of 70,000 people in the area. Studies of the exposed population linked the chemical to six diseases, including kidney and testicular cancer.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit and thousands of personal injury claims that followed were, in many ways, a triumph for the plaintiffs. In total, DuPont and its spinoff company Chemours wound up paying more than $1 billion as a result of the litigation. Yet in the more than two years I have been writing about these chemicals, the crisis that at first seemed limited to those two specific compounds has turned into a much larger and messier conundrum. That\u2019s because, while they were phasing out PFOS and PFOA, many of the companies were also phasing in replacement chemicals that recent research in lab animals has shown pose some of the very same problems. It\u2019s unclear what these chemicals will do to people, which is precisely the problem.", "title": "Opinion | States Are Doing What Scott Pruitt Won\u2019t", "authors": []}

Referencing Classical allegory, the sculpture depicts virtuous good government in the form of a muscular 11-foot-tall man crushing writhing, feminized aquatic creatures meant to represent all that is inimical to it.\n\nWomen had complained about the statue for decades, but Mr. Moylan, outraged at the thought that it might simply be destroyed, gave it a home at Green-Wood, the cemetery that spreads over 478 acres of western Brooklyn, where a plaque now explains its history.\n\nThis week he took in another exiled sculpture, the bronze rendering of J.

Beyond that, however, Trump is even doing trade war wrong, by imposing tariffs on steel and other intermediate goods.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious why this is a bad idea: it raises costs and hurts downstream industries. But I\u2019m enough of an old international economics nerd that I wanted a specific model of how that happens.

The purpose is basically to scratch my own intellectual itch; most readers should probably stop here, because this is even more wonkish than my usual wonkishness.\n\nSo, first things first: I\u2019m talking about wages, not jobs.

It\u2019s true that, as a recent (and excellent) New York Fed analysis says, adjustment is costly, and the process of shifting workers around is likely to lead to considerable unemployment along the way. But adjustment costs and frictional unemployment, while important, aren\u2019t central to understanding why Trump-style tariffs are a particularly bad idea.\n\nWhat is central, I think, is that doing this Trump-style turns even the sort-of-kind-of good arguments for tariffs on their head.", "title": "Opinion | Steel Tariffs and Wages (Painfully Wonkish)", "authors": []}

He said that after 20 years in Congress, it\u2019s time to let someone else get nothing done.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON\n\nAfter Ryan\u2019s announcement, Trump sent the speaker a warm message via Twitter. Colbert couldn\u2019t help but poke fun at that too.\n\n\u201cYes, Republicans are with you, Paul. And by \u2018with you,\u2019 they mean leaving office in November.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nCollusion Confusion\n\nSeth Meyers pointed out that in another Twitter message on Wednesday, Trump had a funny way of denying collusion with Russia.", "title": "Stephen Colbert Bids Paul Ryan Farewell", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello", "Best Of Late Night"]}

Rehnquist, who was appointed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, often taunted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judges for having \u201ca hard time saying \u2018no\u2019 to any litigant with a hard-luck story.\u201d\n\nThe conservative Weekly Standard described Judge Reinhardt as \u201cthe liberal bad boy\u201d of the federal bench \u2014 \u201cideological, outlandish and never dull.\u201d\n\nBut Judge Reinhardt was no knee-jerk contrarian. And some of his decisions\u2019 rationales, which proved to be less radical than classically liberal, were sustained by his judicial colleagues. Even doubters of his ideology often praised his scholarship and his conscientiousness.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t always agree with him,\u201d his Ninth Circuit colleague Judge N. Randy Smith said in a statement, \u201cbut one of my life\u2019s highest honors has been to serve with this legal giant.\u201d\n\nHeather MacDonald, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute and one of Judge Reinhardt\u2019s many former clerks, recalled \u201chis ability to transcend political difference.\u201d\n\nHe \u201cscrutinized every appeal by a criminal defendant with extra care, holding the government to the highest standard of due process,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother former law clerk, Hector Villagra, now executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, recalled a Saturday night when the judge was writing a dissent after the full Ninth Circuit had rejected a death penalty appeal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe knew it was totally pointless; it wasn\u2019t going to affect the outcome,\u201d Mr. Villagra said in a statement. \u201cBut it was the right thing to do, and that\u2019s what mattered. He wanted his voice and his objections heard.\u201d\n\nJudge Reinhardt was born Stephen Roy Shapiro on March 27, 1931, in New York City to the former Silvia Handelsman and Samuel Shapiro, a lawyer.\n\nAfter they divorced, his mother dated the writer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (who was said to have borrowed some of Stephen\u2019s art supplies to draw \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d). He changed his surname in the early 1940s when his mother married Gottfried Reinhardt, the producer, director and playwright who worked on such films as \u201cTwo-Faced Woman,\u201d \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d and \u201cTown Without Pity.\u201d\n\nJudge Reinhardt said his empathy for the underdog was inspired by his stepgrandfather Max Reinhardt, a renowned director who as a Jew had fled the Nazis.\n\nJudge Reinhardt earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in government from Pomona College in California in 1951 and graduated from Yale Law School. He served as a first lieutenant in the legal counsel\u2019s office of the Air Force, clerked for a federal judge, practiced entertainment and labor law in California, was a member of the Democratic National Committee from California and served on the Los Angeles Police Commission, until his circuit court appointment in 1980.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ramona Ripston, a retired executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California; three children, Mark, Justin and Dana; and seven grandchildren.\n\nOver the years, Judge Reinhardt ruled as unconstitutional the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance; a Washington State law banning the procedure that abortion opponents call \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d; Arizona\u2019s English-only official language law; and a 2008 California ballot referendum, Proposition 8, barring same-sex marriage. Each of his rulings was overturned or vacated by the Supreme Court.\n\n(The same-sex marriage case was remanded back to California for further proceedings, and Proposition 8 was ultimately ruled unconstitutional.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJudge Reinhardt sometimes lamented that he was following a legal precedent even though he disagreed with it. Last year, in an anguished opinion, he declined to halt a deportation that he considered deeply unjust.\n\nThe man being deported, Andres Magana Ortiz, had come to the United States from Mexico 28 years before, when he was 15. He became a successful coffee grower in Hawaii, where he lived with his wife and three children, all United States citizens. (The Ninth Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction includes Hawaii.)\n\nMr. Ortiz had been permitted to remain in the country while he pursued a path to legalization during the administration of President Barack Obama, but that decision was abruptly overturned under the Trump administration, and he was ordered deported.\n\n\u201cMagana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims,\u201d Judge Reinhardt wrote in deciding that the court lacked the power to prevent his deportation. \u201cAmong the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "The way Mr. Clark died is part of a historic pattern of black Californians experiencing uniquely harsh and sometimes lethal outcomes in the realm of criminal justice and public safety. Mr. Clark\u2019s death was the second such instance of the local police shooting and killing a black man in Sacramento in the past couple of years; statewide, there have been similar high-profile episodes, notably the caught-on-cellphone-camera shooting death of Mario Woods by San Francisco Police Department officers in December 2015.\n\nThese encounters had a precursor in the beating of Rodney King that was caught on tape in greater Los Angeles 27 years ago, three years before I left the state. In April 1992, following the acquittal of the white police officers who were charged with beating Mr. King after he\u2019d led them on a high-speed chase, thousands of citizens took to the streets of Los Angeles in protests that morphed into a weeklong riot.\n\nI covered that upheaval as a journalist, and in the aftermath Los Angeles residents, city officials and representatives from business engaged in soul-searching about the undercurrent of disaffection among black residents that had fueled the civic unrest. Residents in South Central, Compton and other predominantly black and Latino Los Angeles neighborhoods spoke at town hall meetings and forums, saying they\u2019d continually experienced not only police abuse, but also unfair hiring practices in the city\u2019s retail centers and film industry, as well as job losses from closures in manufacturing.\n\nNow, nearly three decades later, the state still enjoys a liberal reputation that is partly deserved, but it is also often at odds with the material status of black residents \u2014 not only when it comes to headline-grabbing tragedy and injustice, but also in all facets of life. Equal access to California\u2019s economic drivers has long been elusive for black residents.\n\nCurrently 10 percent of Sacramento County\u2019s 1.5 million residents are African-Americans, and the median household income for blacks there is $44,188, versus $70,076 for whites, according to the county government\u2019s 2018 summary census data. Homeownership among Sacramento\u2019s black population declined from 43 percent in 2006 to 27 percent in 2015, with blacks experiencing larger losses during the subprime mortgage-related economic downturn of 2008 and seeing a longer recovery period than whites, The Sacramento Bee found.", "title": "Opinion | Stephon Clark and the Golden State\u2019s Shameful Secret", "authors": []}

Connor, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard overrode the amendment\u2019s protections \u201cagainst unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d and even the Fifth Amendment\u2019s admonition that no person shall \u201cbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d\n\nBy ruling that an officer\u2019s use of force must only meet the \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard while allowing that \u201cpolice officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation,\u201d the court itself laid the groundwork for the extrajudicial killings by police officers that we keep seeing. This ruling has become scripture for law enforcement.\n\nAs Police Magazine wrote in 2014:\n\n\u201cA generation of officers has been trained in the case\u2019s practical meaning and has spent decades applying it to every use-of-force decision. So it has become part of law enforcement DNA, often unnoticed as it works in the background to determine our actions.\u201d\n\nWhat is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d is clearly a subjective determination, and when the assessment interacts with race, class, gender and the stereotypical perception of criminality and propensity for violence surrounding those classifications, the \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d standard can easily become corrupted and used more as a badge of permission and a shield against liability.\n\nIn a utopian society where people did not discriminate \u2014 consciously or subconsciously \u2014 \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d would be a perfectly serviceable standard. But we don\u2019t live in that world; we live in this one.\n\nWe live in a world in which, as The New York Times reported in 2016 about a study issued by the Center for Policing Equity:\n\n\u201cAfrican-Americans are far more likely than whites and other groups to be the victims of use of force by the police, even when racial disparities in crime are taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe courts have given police officers broad discretion, but they simply aren\u2019t applying that discretion equitably.

They drank, swore and had messy personal lives \u2014 provocative portrayals that caused some episodes to carry \u201cexplicit warnings,\u201d scared off some advertisers and led some network affiliates to refuse to broadcast episodes.\n\nBut his style forever changed the format.\n\n\u201cThe idea of almost every other cop show was that the private lives of these folks was what happened the other 23 hours of the day that you weren\u2019t watching them, and we turned that inside out,\u201d Mr. Bochco said in a 2014 interview with The New York Times about the creation of \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d and its lasting influence.\n\nBut \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d was not an overnight success. After its first season, in 1981, the show ranked 87th out of 96 television series in the ratings. But a few months later, it won eight Emmy Awards, including for best drama, giving \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d momentum that carried the series another six seasons on NBC. It also propelled Mr. Bochco\u2019s career.\n\nIn 1986, he applied his trademark method to courtrooms, creating \u201cL.A. Law\u201d on NBC. It was no \u201cPerry Mason.\u201d The show brought a realism to lawyers and law firms and accurately portrayed legal issues, all while tackling tough and sensitive subjects like capital punishment and AIDS.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Mr. Bochco was in high demand. In 1987, ABC lured him away from NBC with a first-of-its-kind network exclusive: a $50 million deal to create 10 series over eight years. Two shows were hits, \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d and \u201cDoogie Howser, M.D.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cDoogie Howser,\u201d a teenage doctor, played by Neil Patrick Harris, tried to balance his personal and professional life. A comedy-drama, the show veered into new territory for Mr. Bochco, but it stuck with a core trait of his shows: pushing the boundaries on television. Some people criticized a 1991 episode about the title character and his girlfriend losing their virginity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut nothing shocked like \u201cNYPD Blue.\u201d\n\nMonths before the show had its premiere in September 1993, Mr. Bochco predicted that its nudity and explicit language would make it the first \u201cR rated\u201d show on network television. In what might have been a marketing ploy, ABC came under tremendous fire in an orchestrated outcry that included full-page newspaper ads. When the first episode aired, it carried only a handful of national advertisers, and 57 of ABC\u2019s 225 affiliates did not broadcast it.\n\nPhoto\n\nShortly before the premiere, Mr. Bochco told The Times that he believed that \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d did \u201cbreak ground, though only because it goes a little farther that anything that\u2019s gone before.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIt is a cop show, after all.\u201d\n\nInsisting that viewers be treated like adults, Mr. Bochco sparred with network executives and censors over details such as what percentage of a woman\u2019s breast could appear onscreen or how many times a profanity could be repeated.\n\nThe show, about detectives in the 15th Precinct in Manhattan, survived the backlash, winning numerous awards over 12 seasons.\n\nIt did not take long for other networks to copy the format, leading to shows like the hospital drama \u201cER\u201d on NBC. Critics said \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d had lost its groundbreaking luster by the early 2000s.\n\nBy then Mr. Bochco had also helped created \u201cMurder One,\u201d a well-received 1990s drama about criminal defense lawyers.\n\nMr. Bianculli said that one of Mr. Bochco\u2019s lasting contributions was making characters real and relatable. Detective Andy Sipowicz on \u201cNYPD Blue,\u201d played by Dennis Franz, starts out \u201calmost irredeemable but ends up being the soul\u201d of the show, he said.\n\nWithout that precedent, viewers might not have been prepared for the likes of Walter White in \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d or Tony Soprano in \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSteven Ronald Bochco was born on Dec. 16, 1943, in New York City.

The couple also had a daughter, Joanna.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bochco is survived by his wife, Dayna; two sons, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan; a daughter, Melissa Bochco; and two grandchildren. Mr. Bochco was previously married to the actress Barbara Bosson, who played Fay Furillo, the ex-wife of Capt. Frank Furillo, on \u201cHill Street Blues.\u201d\n\nMr. Bochco grew up in New York City, attended Manhattan High School of Music and Art and then the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now known as Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh. In an interview with Mr. Bianculli for his book \u201cThe Platinum Age of Television: From \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 to \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019 How TV Became Terrific,\u201d Mr. Bochco said his parents had had \u201czero interest\u201d in buying a television set.\n\n\u201cIt was quite the contrary: They were in the minus territory,\u201d he said. Eventually, a group of friends and neighbors pitched in to buy a television for his sister and him.\n\nAfter college, Mr. Bochco moved with his first wife to Los Angeles and began a writing job at Universal Studios. He wrote the script for the introductory episode of the detective series \u201cColumbo\u201d in 1971, working with Steven Spielberg on it. He moved to the production company MTM Enterprises in the late 1970s and was later chosen to help write a police drama ordered by NBC.\n\nMr. Bochco said that for \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d he had studied a police documentary and aimed to make the series \u201cdimensional,\u201d filling every part of a scene and a frame with something important.\n\nHe told Mr. Bianculli: \u201cI always thought that with the success of \u2018NYPD Blue\u2019 we would bust open the door for broadcast television to really come into the 21st century properly. And it never happened. And I was amazed then, as I am now, that it didn\u2019t seem to give broadcast television the license to get significantly more adult in their programming.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut the interesting thing is, I think \u2018NYPD Blue\u2019 created the cable drama world.

He rejected Harvard because his family could not afford the room and board. To save money when he attended Columbia, he lived at home and carried his lunch to school.\n\nHe earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948 and wrote a master\u2019s thesis on Henry James under the guidance of Professor F. W. Dupee, the eminent modernist scholar.\n\nAfter brief stints teaching at Indiana University and City College of New York, he won a fellowship to Cambridge University, where he conducted research on a Fulbright fellowship and published his first literary criticism, in The Partisan Review and Commentary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter serving two years in the Army, mostly in Greenland, he returned to Columbia to complete his 1,105-page dissertation on Dickens, which became the basis for his 1965 book.\n\nProfessor Marcus said that Lionel Trilling and another Columbia professor, Jacques Barzun, had influenced him most by pointing him \u201cin the direction I wanted to have in academic life.\u201d\n\nIn 1961, when he was teaching at Indiana University, a casual conversation with John Gagnon of the university\u2019s Institute for Sex Research, founded by Alfred C. Kinsey, prompted him to write \u201cThe Other Victorians.\u201d\n\nProfessor Marcus returned to Columbia as an associate professor in 1963. He became a full professor of English in 1967 and the George Delacorte professor in the humanities in 1976. He twice served as chairman of the Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nHe was also a principal investigator in the Columbia Project on Conflicts in Values and Health Care. He became a professor emeritus in 2004.\n\nProfessor Marcus\u2019s many books also included \u201cRepresentations: Essays on Literature and Society\u201d (1976); \u201cDoing Good: The Limits of Benevolence\u201d (1978), with Willard Gaylin, Ira Glasser and David Rothman; and \u201cFreud and the Culture of Psychoanalysis\u201d (1984).\n\nHe edited \u201cThe World of Modern Fiction\u201d (1967); \u201cArt, Politics and Will: Essays in Honor of Lionel Trilling\u201d (1977), with Quentin Anderson and Stephen Donadio; \u201cMedicine and Western Civilization\u201d (1995), with David Rothman and Stephanie Kiceluk; and a series of books called \u201cPsychoanalysis and Culture,\u201d with Arnold Cooper.\n\nIn 1997, Columbia bestowed the Mark Van Doren Teaching Award on Professor Marcus for his \u201chumanity, devotion to truth and inspiring leadership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis first marriage ended in divorce.

Fears about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economic powers emerged in March after Mr. Trump unveiled tariffs on global imports of aluminum and steel. The threat of tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports followed.\n\nNext month, the Treasury Department is expected to release a plan to further restrict Chinese investment in American companies, including industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence that are sensitive for national security reasons. The rules could also restrict American partnerships with Chinese companies abroad.\n\nChina has not taken such threats lightly. In recent weeks it has hit back with its own threats, raising concerns among farmers and businesses in the United States that the escalating dispute could be a drag on the economy and blunt the effect of the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law in December.\n\nBut Mr. Xi has also signaled that he is open to negotiating with Mr. Trump. He said this month that China would reduce its tariffs on autos, which Mr. Mnuchin called \u201ca big step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWhile some trade experts warned that China has failed to deliver on such promises before, Mr. Trump insisted on Tuesday that he was encouraged about the possibility of a deal.\n\n\u201cPresident Xi made a speech four days ago where he said that China is going to be opened up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not opened up right now.

The domestic budget airline Allegiant Air offers four daily flights to Florida and South Carolina.\n\nAllegiant and Norwegian Air are seen as trailblazers to officials at the Port Authority, because if their service succeeds, it will encourage other airlines to offer flights at Stewart.\n\n\u201cStewart has enormous potential to be a real gateway airport to the New York area,\u201d said Rick Cotton, the authority\u2019s executive director. The agency has spent $200 million over the past decade to improve the airport, and an additional $30 million has been set aside for the construction of a 20,000-square-foot hall for international arrivals. When complete in 2019, the hall will be able to process 400 passengers an hour.\n\nBy focusing on a low-cost carrier identity, Stewart is part of a growing trend among airports in the United States. It is following a pattern established in Europe and Asia, where budget airlines have reinvigorated smaller airports on the outskirts of major cities, said Matthew J. Cornelius, vice president of air policy at Airport Council International, an industry group.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had the ability to strengthen their power, and now the Europeans are coming across the Atlantic,\u201d Mr. Cornelius said, adding that the international airlines were seeking smaller airports like Stewart, as well as those in Hartford and Providence, R.I. \u201cThey\u2019re used to operating at secondary airports, so it\u2019s a natural.\u201d\n\nThis attracts passengers like Gavin Bamford of Northern Ireland, who arranged to visit family in Pennsylvania after finding a $364 round-trip ticket to Stewart Airport on Norwegian Air\u2019s website. Before he returned to Belfast, he said that if fares remained low, he would come back to Stewart, rent a car and drive 400 miles to see relatives in Toronto.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

Their prime location, along with assets like long runways and underlying infrastructure, can help communities keep up with increasing demand for air travel.\n\nTraffic jams are frequent on the sole highway leading to Seattle Tacoma International Airport, which has grown over the past few years to become one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports. Sea-Tac, as it is known, served nearly 47 million travelers in 2017, a 25 percent increase over five years.\n\nBut about 37 miles north in Snohomish County, away from the congestion on Interstate 5, a former military airfield called Paine Field was being used by Boeing for test flights and general aviation. It was ripe for commercial flights, said Brett Smith, chief executive of Propeller Airports in New York, which is developing a passenger terminal at the airport with county officials.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines subsidiary Horizon Air, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have announced that they will offer multiple daily flights at Paine Field while continuing service at Sea-Tac.\n\n\u201cThe fact they\u2019re splitting their operation shows how much Seattle needs this,\u201d Mr. Smith said. The airlines are not shifting business, but they \u201care adding capacity to the market in Seattle,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Seattle, Phoenix had an opportunity to alleviate congestion at Sky Harbor International Airport, Arizona\u2019s busiest airport. In 2007, a former Air Force base 30 miles southeast of the city was renamed Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, and Canada\u2019s WestJet and Allegiant began offering flights.\n\nGateway\u2019s master plan calls for an investment of $722 million to accommodate growth. The plan relies in part on federal money set aside for the repurposing of joint-use or no-longer-in-use military airfields.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTwenty, 30 years ago, we were a military base on the outskirts of civilization, but the growth has continued to move east,\u201d said J. Brian O\u2019Neill the airport\u2019s executive director and chief executive. \u201cWe anticipate this market will continue to grow and will require service from two full-service airports.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is not the first time municipalities have pegged commercial and economic development plans to the business decisions of airlines. In the 1990s, Texas-based Southwest Airlines favored smaller airports, choosing to fly into Providence over Boston and Baltimore over Washington. Customers traveled to these secondary airports to take advantage of Southwest\u2019s lower fares. The term \u201cSouthwest effect\u201d is still used in the airline industry, but now it could also be called the Norwegian or Allegiant effect.\n\nStill, in his job monitoring airports around the world, Mr. Cornelius of the Airport Council said communities needed to be cautious that capital and time-intensive airport development did not hinge too heavily on airlines.\n\nNot only can airlines be fickle in their route planning, but bad publicity can have an impact on travelers\u2019 confidence. Allegiant was the subject of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report this month that showed the airline had a higher rate of safety events than other American carriers. Now, three senators are calling for an investigation into the airline, which could affect passenger numbers at the airports where Allegiant operates.\n\n\u201cIf you build it, they won\u2019t necessarily come,\u201d Mr. Cornelius said. There has to be a need.\n\n\u201cYou have to have the traffic to sustain all those elements at the airport, to fund the concessions, to create a parking lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have the demand.\u201d", "title": "Stewart Airport Adopts a New Identity: New York Area\u2019s Budget Flight Hub", "authors": ["Christine Negroni", "Square Feet"]}

(\u201cThis standoff was a long time coming, a childhood friendship that had hardened,\u201d as McGuane would write some 40 years later about a different set of frenemies in a story called \u201cRiver Camp,\u201d the cannibalism of masculinity having never lost its pride of place among his writerly concerns.) \u201cThe Sporting Club\u201d was published in 1969, followed by \u201cThe Bushwhacked Piano\u201d (1971) and \u201cNinety-Two in the Shade\u201d (1973), an explosive picaresque that was nominated for the National Book Award.\n\nAll three novels are excellent, a hat trick that brings to mind Bob Dylan\u2019s legendary hot streak of 1965-66: \u201cBringing It All Back Home,\u201d \u201cHighway 61 Revisited,\u201d \u201cBlonde on Blonde.\u201d Like Dylan\u2019s, McGuane\u2019s streak was put on ice by an accident: a totaled car in Texas, from which he walked away unhurt but badly shaken. Rather than go to ground like Dylan, McGuane instead went wild. He started writing screenplays, including the Brando-Nicholson western \u201cThe Missouri Breaks\u201d and his own adaptation of \u201cNinety-Two in the Shade,\u201d which he also directed, starring Peter Fonda and Margot Kidder. Fonda ran away with McGuane\u2019s wife; McGuane married and then divorced Kidder within a year. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the lost weekends, or how he earned the nickname \u201cCaptain Berserko,\u201d or why one day he decided that he\u2019d had enough. \u201cHe \u2026 quit drinking, just stopped by force of will like he did everything,\u201d his old editor Terry McDonell wrote in his memoir. In 1977 McGuane married Laurie Buffett, sister of his old Key West pal Jimmy, and the two have been together ever since.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt hardly seems to have occurred to McGuane to write short until the \u201980s. His first collection, \u201cTo Skin a Cat,\u201d was published in 1986, and nearly all of its stories appeared in magazines that same year. This is pure speculation on my part, but it sure looks as if the stories were written in a cluster, sold as a manuscript and placed afterward in a rush to beat the shot clock of first-serial rights. (The story may be less lucrative than the novel, but play your cards right and you can get poorly paid twice for the same work.) \u201cTo Skin a Cat\u201d is as uneven as its name is ugly; one can feel McGuane chafing under the constraints of the form. There are some gems, to be sure: \u201cSportsmen,\u201d a finely drawn portrait of outdoorsy American boyhood; \u201cA Man in Louisiana,\u201d in which a city slicker is conned by a country dog breeder; \u201cLike a Leaf,\u201d about a widower struggling with his first serious romance since the loss of his wife. Still, I was not surprised to see that McGuane did not include several stories from that first collection in \u201cCloudbursts,\u201d including its long and unsuccessful title story, or that some of the material he did use from it has been substantially revised.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMcGuane\u2019s second collection, \u201cGallatin Canyon,\u201d was published in 2006 and his third, \u201cCrow Fair,\u201d in 2015; of the eight new stories in \u201cCloudbursts,\u201d six are of newer vintage yet. It is a curious fact, then, that of the 45 stories in this career-spanning collection, fully 35 of them date from the last decade and change. This might make the very existence of a \u201ccollected\u201d seem redundant or at least premature, but given that McGuane is on the verge of turning 80 \u2014 and that the stories are uniformly brilliant \u2014 any objections should be summarily withdrawn. \u201cGallatin Canyon,\u201d \u201cWeight Watchers,\u201d \u201cThe Refugee\u201d (and its bizarrely charming afterthought, \u201cPapaya\u201d), \u201cHubcaps,\u201d \u201cIce,\u201d \u201cStars\u201d: Would it be ludicrous to list, say, 20 of them as favorites? I don\u2019t know what happened during that long break between the first and second collections, but McGuane has emerged a master of the short story. However close together the bulk of these pieces were written, \u201cCloudbursts\u201d is clearly the product of a life\u2019s worth of thought and feeling and experience; it ought to be savored. That said, if you find yourself tearing through the book like a flash flood washing out a dirt road, I say go for it.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "THE SURPRISING PLACE\n\nBy Malinda McCollum\n\n197 pp. University of Massachusetts Press. Paper, $19.95.\n\nAll but one of the stories in Malinda McCollum\u2019s collection, \u201cThe Surprising Place,\u201d are set in Des Moines, and the title derives from a hopeful Chamber of Commerce promotional slogan. But this is not the Des Moines of civic boosters, spacious parks, public art, clean air and other wholesome attractions. McCollum\u2019s version of the city is, at best, a community of disconsolate oddballs. At worst, it resembles a Bruegel hellscape. An overcorrection, perhaps, of the notion of \u201cIowa nice.\u201d\n\nLike all fictional worlds, this Des Moines consists of a combination of geography and subjectivity. One of the best stories, \u201cGood Monks,\u201d makes use of a local landmark: an abandoned lime pit \u2014 desolate, lurid, ruined \u2014 known as the \u201cLost Planet.\u201d Severa, a teenage girl with well-developed criminal instincts, lures a drunken, disconsolate former Buddhist monk here, intending to rob him. She\u2019s interrupted by the arrival of two hard-core druggie brothers who proceed to cook up an appalling batch of low-rent meth. The menace here is ugly and the suspense genuine; things do not end well.\n\nSevera is a recurring character in several stories. She is both self-destructive and possessed of formidable survival skills. There\u2019s a kind of homegrown spiritualism on display in her own increasingly desperate escapades. Should one wish for being or nonbeing? There are stoned discussions of nirvana and muddled yearnings for peace and wholeness, reminiscent of Denis Johnson stories. When Severa declares that she too is Buddhist, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s sincere or devious. \u201cLater on, we should chant, chant, chant,\u201d she tells the ex-monk she intends to victimize. At least the high of religion is less toxic than other substances: Severa\u2019s Buddhist impulses do not prevent her from robbing a corpse in a coffin.\n\nImage\n\nAnother character, Green, also reappears in several of the stories, at different life stages. He too seems burdened by his existence and is looking for an exit, or perhaps the promise of rebirth. Others around him are similarly busy unmaking themselves: His tenant dismantles the house he is renting from Green and his brother, Roy, piece by piece, envisioning a space \u201clike a big church.\u201d Roy passes out with his arm in a snowbank and ends up frostbitten and amputated. Later he confesses to Green, \u201cI thought something was in there if I dug deep enough.\u201d", "title": "Stories That Look Askance at the American Midwest", "authors": []}

Over the past two semesters, she has raised her grade-point average and declared a major in psychology.\n\nMuch of her newfound maturity is thanks to Pinky, a rabbit she recently welcomed into the Staten Island home she shares with her mother. Pinky has bridged the divide between mother and daughter, encouraging frequent visits into Ms. Genao\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually like people in my space,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my mom loves petting the rabbit.\u201d And the visits have opened lines of communication.\n\nMs. Genao has set her sights on earning a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nOther fund recipients are also anticipating brighter futures.\n\nAn extended convalescence after heart surgery in 2005 led Charlotte Wood, 67, to lose her apartment and take up residence in a rehabilitation center.

This year, the lunch raised roughly $3,000 for Ms. Matthias, who was once homeless and served jail time and has a son, Franklin, with special needs.\n\nMr. Shapiro, 78, said he had committed to further assisting Ms. Matthias, and would pay for Franklin\u2019s 15th birthday party in June, which he would also attend.\n\nMs. Matthias plans to throw an outdoor party with hired entertainment.\n\n\u201cEach year is a milestone,\u201d she said, noting that Franklin\u2019s odds of survival at birth were low. \u201cBut 15 years is big.

The court held that \u201cif the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.\u201d Although one would expect a federal judge to know that lying to investigators would have an impact, the court required proof of actual knowledge that the false statements would be provided to the grand jury, not just a general familiarity with how the process worked.\n\nIn Arthur Andersen v. United States, a 2005 decision, the court unanimously overturned the obstruction conviction of the accounting firm. Arthur Andersen had been convicted of destroying records shortly before the Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into financial misstatements by its client Enron. A defendant \u201ccannot be someone who persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material,\u201d the opinion explained.\n\nIn 2015, the court restricted the scope of a statute that was adopted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to make it easier for prosecutors to pursue obstruction cases in the wake of Enron\u2019s collapse. The law makes it a crime to conceal, alter or destroy \u201cany record, document or tangible object.\u201d\n\nIn the case, Yates v. United States, a majority of the justices held that a \u201ctangible object\u201d did not include undersized fish that the defendant had been caught with on his fishing boat but that he threw overboard before returning to port. Although a fish is indeed tangible, the statute was narrowed to cover only those items that hold information, similar to a record or a document, and not just anything with a physical existence.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s opinion noted that \u201can aggressive interpretation of \u2018tangible object\u2019 must be rejected,\u201d and a narrower reading must be adopted to avoid making the destruction of just about anything with possible value in an investigation into obstruction of justice.\n\nMr. Mueller is reportedly looking at the possibility that there were attempts to obstruct the investigation in Russian meddling in the election. For the most part, actions or statements that might be considered obstructive are open to conflicting interpretations. Whether it be the firing of Mr. Comey or talk of removing Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, these acts are probably insufficient alone to prove obstruction in court because they would be lawful actions, so inferring the requisite intent would be a significant challenge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbsent evidence along the lines of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d recording of President Richard M. Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in, proving such a case will be especially difficult because the standard is proof of intent to obstruct beyond a reasonable doubt. The message from the Supreme Court in the wake of the Marinello decision is to tread carefully when trying to show that ordinary acts amount to obstruction, even if they make life more difficult for prosecutors.", "title": "Supreme Court Continues to Narrow the Meaning of Obstruction", "authors": ["Peter J.

Amazon, which is not involved in the case before the Supreme Court, collects sales taxes for goods that it sells directly but not for merchandise sold by third parties.

Isaacson, a lawyer for the three internet retailers, who said a ruling against his clients would impose burdens on small online merchants. A national solution, he said, should come from Congress rather than the Supreme Court.\n\nSome justices complained that they lacked fundamental information about how hard it is to collect the taxes and how much money is at stake. The two sides, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, were of little help.

Max had been a brilliant and leading organizer of the Yiddish Bund, a humane form of non-Communist leftism that attracted tens of thousands of adherents in prerevolutionary Russia, Lithuania and Poland. Hunted by czarist police, the Bundists would be crushed not by their enemies but by the far smaller band of jealous, self-interested Bolsheviks, who had other ideas about how to pursue a revolution.\n\nAn organizer in Vilna and Lodz, Max renounced his activism and settled in a quiet suburb of London. There he raised a family and provided sanctuary for often traumatized emigrants. Soon, however, Mazower\u2019s narrative opens out onto an expansive, branching cast of characters that includes family members as well as numerous icons of 20th-century Jewish history (from Emma Goldman to Walter Benjamin). These stories are remarkable, if often devastating. Max\u2019s Bundist associate Shmuel Zygielboym persuades the BBC to report on the gassings of Polish Jewry, only to commit suicide in guilt over having left his wife and child behind in the Warsaw Ghetto. Max\u2019s long-ago lover is a Menshevik firebrand named Sofia Krylenko, the sister of Lenin\u2019s much-feared people\u2019s commissar for justice, while the siblings and cousins of Max\u2019s deeply adored wife, Frouma, later became ensnared in Stalin\u2019s Terror.\n\nMazower\u2019s family saga may begin as an effort to recover a way of being Jewish that is often now lost from memory. Yet it is imbued throughout with perceptive asides about what we can learn from \u201chistory\u2019s losers,\u201d about solidarity across political divisions and about the tremendous tolls taken by the destabilizing uncertainty of not knowing, under repressive regimes, whether and how loved ones have died. \u201cWhat You Did Not Tell\u201d is, in the end, a profound testament to the saving grace of a sense of rootedness in place and home.", "title": "Surviving Europe\u2019s Horrendous 20th Century", "authors": []}

In addition to the downtown business district and shopping centers at the intersection of Oyster Bay Road and South Woodbury Road, the east-west Jericho Turnpike is a major commercial strip.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing is that you can purchase as a first-time home buyer, and you can upgrade many times without leaving the community,\u201d Ms. Pascullo said. Residents even have the option of moving to nearby towns while remaining in the school district.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe tricky part is breaking into the market, which has grown competitive with the incursion of New York City residents driven east by rising home prices.

When the Long Island Rail Road began to extend its main line between Hicksville and Cold Spring Harbor in 1854, East Woods lay along the route.\n\nBut when the plan fizzled out, the community was left with a stretch of rail that ended abruptly. The railroad built a terminus at the spot and called it Syosset, which is believed to be a corruption of the Dutch \u201cschout,\u201d or sheriff.

He said he heard discussions of plans to fabricate evidence of rebels attacking civilians. He quit when he concluded there was no intention of reform, fleeing Syria with USB drives and paper documents bandaged to his torso under his clothes. (He defected several weeks before the journalists were killed.)\n\nAnother witness \u2014 Anwar Malek, an Algerian member of an Arab League monitoring mission \u2014 said he quit the mission after coming to believe that members were acting as agents for the government and removing evidence of government attacks on civilians, including the case of a 5-year-old boy killed by a sniper, from reports.\n\nMr. Malek described conversations in Homs in January 2012 with a member of the crisis committee, Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, Mr. Assad\u2019s brother-in-law. He said Mr. Shawkat told him that it was necessary to kill civilians to defeat \u201cthe terrorists,\u201d that \u201che would have been able to destroy Baba Amr in 10 minutes if there were not any video cameras\u201d and that foreign journalists reporting from Baba Amr were \u201cagents\u201d of Israel and other countries, who should be targeted.\n\n\u201c\u2018For us, these are terrorists,\u2019\u201d Mr. Malek quoted him as saying. \u201cThey are targets for our military services and our security forces.\u201d\n\nMr. Malek added that when Mr. Shawkat learned he had visited the media center, he pressed him to disclose its exact location; Mr. Malek demurred.\n\nSoon after, Mr. Malek concluded that the mission was compromised and resigned. He said he received a death threat over the phone in his Homs hotel room, and his convoy to Damascus was shot at. The government blamed rebels, but Mr. Malek believed the attack was staged by the government.\n\nLess than a month later, Syrian activists brought in Ms. Colvin and a British journalist, Paul Conroy, through a mile-long, four-foot-wide water pipe.

SoftBank would own just 27 percent of the combined company, which would be named T-Mobile, and have four of the 14 seats on the company\u2019s board of directors. (T-Mobile\u2019s current parent company, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, would own 42 percent of the new company and hold nine seats.)\n\nEven with an agreement in place, the deal is not done. Regulators in Washington will scrutinize the merger, which would cede control of the United States wireless market to just three carriers. In the past, attempted mergers in the industry have been rejected on the grounds that more competitors are better for consumers because they result in lower prices and superior services.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the agreement is the latest in a series of bold wagers that have defined Mr. Son\u2019s investing career.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2000, he put $20 million into Alibaba, the Chinese internet company. As a result of that investment, Mr. Son now owns 30 percent of the $440 billion shopping giant.\n\nMr. Son and SoftBank became serial acquirers. The company built up positions in the Japanese mobile phone market, including by purchasing the British semiconductor designer ARM Holdings, which develops critical technologies for the mobile market.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Son has focused on technology companies in the United States. The vehicle for those efforts will be Mr. Son\u2019s London-based Vision Fund. While the fund represents the vision of Mr. Son, it is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia, which has put up $45 billion \u2014 nearly half the fund\u2019s size.\n\nWhile some have hailed Mr. Son as the Warren Buffett of technology investing, that comparison misses the mark. Mr. Buffett is a forensic analyst of companies rather than trends, and he usually opts for what he perceives to be strong, undervalued brands rather than putting his money into fast-growing, innovative \u2014 and risky \u2014 firms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Son is more entrepreneur than investor in the classic style.\n\nAs a university student, he invented a language translator that he sold to a computer company. As an investor, his forte has been identifying futuristic themes and investing based on them. He now is predicting that interconnected devices and artificial intelligence will be the next big trends to disrupt life and industry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They travel the world, identifying potential corporate targets and then structuring deals to acquire them.\n\nBut such thematic investing can backfire. Many of Mr. Son\u2019s technology bets fell victim to the 2000 technology crash. And skeptics say the enormous Vision Fund could stumble into bad, overpriced deals as it tries to deploy tens of billions of dollars in a short period of time. One such eyebrow-raising deal was a $300 million investment in Wag, a dog-walking service built around a smartphone app.\n\nMr. Son also faced criticism for his purchase of 80 percent of Sprint, given the company\u2019s size, shaky finances and the difficulties of winning American regulators\u2019 blessings for any mergers.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Son had long dreamed of combining Sprint with T-Mobile \u2014 but, for a long time, on his terms. The carriers\u2019 merger discussions last year fell apart because he wanted more control of the combined business.\n\nMarcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s chief executive and a confidant of Mr. Son, dismissed SoftBank\u2019s diminished role at the combined company as a setback. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the percentage of our ownership and happy to put the company in the hands of such a strong management,\u201d Mr. Claure said in an interview. \u201cThis is the fulfillment of an initial vision that was laid out in 2012.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Son is calculating that under President Trump, the Federal Communications Commission will look more favorably on such a merger than it did during the Obama administration.\n\nIt is no sure thing \u2014 the Trump administration is suing to block a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner, citing the size of a combined entity.\n\nWhile not known for his political instincts, Mr. Son was savvy enough to get a meeting with Mr. Trump in the early days after the election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president-elect publicly praised Mr. Son\u2019s promise to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the great men of industry,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in December 2016.\n\nThe question was then put to Mr. Son: Why had he come to meet Mr. Trump so soon after the election?\n\n\u201cI came to celebrate the president\u2019s new job,\u201d Mr. Son said. And in their meeting, he said, Mr. Trump told him \u201cthat he would do a lot of deregulation.\u201d\n\nThat was music to Mr. Son\u2019s ears, given his ambition to secure a merger.\n\n\u201cI said this is great,\u201d Mr. Son said. \u201cThe United States would be great again.\u201d", "title": "T-Mobile-Sprint Merger Would Give Japan\u2019s SoftBank Bigger Foothold in U.S.", "authors": ["Landon Thomas Jr."]}

He described the female passenger as having brown hair and a scarf.\n\nLaw enforcement alerted Amtrak, disrupting service, but by the time the train was stopped and searched, it was already in Westport, Conn. Passengers were ordered to evacuate while bomb squads searched the train and found no evidence of any explosive materials.\n\nIt turned out that Mr. Miller had been on a different train \u2014 Amtrak Train 2258 \u2014 which pulled into Westport soon after. According to the complaint, when investigators again contacted Mr. Miller, who was then in New York, he described the woman as having red hair, rather than brown, and said she had a black carry-on suitcase with a handle.

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "I grew up in the small businesses my parents owned and operated. My mom worked her final shift in the restaurant they managed together two days before I was due. After surviving a grueling, anesthesia-free 42 hours of labor (a number I am not allowed to forget), my mother returned home and within a month was back to work. Since she and my father worked at the restaurant that they owned together, they were able to trade off to keep both the business and their new baby thriving, swapping day shifts and nights with each other, one of them always tending to me while the other managed the restaurant. Paid leave was not really considered: In my mom\u2019s case, the ability to continue to work, often with her newborn swaddled against her chest, was both a luxury and a necessity for keeping her family afloat.\n\nWhen she was pregnant again, seven years later with my sister Zoe, my parents had sold the restaurant and were building a small housecleaning business. I spent every day after school in their company headquarters, after the business finally outgrew the home office that also doubled as my childhood bedroom. I would study for spelling tests as their all-female staff bustled around me, returning for the day with totes full of cleaning supplies and dirtied rags, rolling industrial-strength vacuum cleaners past my makeshift desk.\n\nOn my sister\u2019s due date, I returned to the company office after school, disappointed my mother hadn\u2019t had the new baby, thus ruining my chance to be dramatically pulled from my second-grade classroom. That afternoon I watched as my mother stood with her swollen stomach hanging over her desk, issuing instructions to the employees surrounding her. Every 15 minutes or so she would pause, clench her fists and Lamaze-breathe through contractions.\n\nI was thrilled, terrified and in awe, watching this league of women \u2014 most of them working mothers themselves. They stood around my mother, nodding and taking notes, waiting patiently for her instructions, knowing their boss would be out of commission for, well, the rest of the week at least. She eventually made it to the hospital, and after an easy, anesthesia-aided two-hour labor (there is a clear favorite in our sibling rivalry), my sister was born, and within two weeks she was nursing above that same desk. My mother\u2019s workplace was newborn-friendly because she made it that way, for herself and her employees.\n\nNow senators, too, can enjoy a workplace that accommodates working mothers, and with an unprecedented number of women running for Congress (as of earlier this month, according to The Associated Press, 309 from the two major parties have filed papers to run for the House, and 29 will be on ballots in Senate races), the House of Representatives ought to follow their example.\n\nThere are lots of conversations to be had about how, after these female candidates win, they can contribute to making life better for working mothers in this country. These range from how to improve family leave policies to why American mothers still don\u2019t have the right to breast-feed at work.

Based on available data, many economists don\u2019t believe that it plays a major role in American trade. For example, the United States imports only modest amounts of steel from Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia or other Southeast Asian countries that are popular stops for freight forwarders like Settle Logistics.\n\nStill, the shadowy world of transshipments and other trade trickery is set to get a much closer look. Transshipments are likely to be a major part of any negotiations between China and the United States aimed at settling their trade dispute. They could also figure into conversations with Europe, South Korea, Canada and other major partners looking to extend their exemptions from Mr. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs. The governments may need to be on alert to make sure they do not become way stations and anger Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada announced on March 27 that his country would enact a series of regulatory measures to block transshipments. By contrast, South Korea has insisted that it makes sure the true origins of cargo are accurately identified and that tariffs are paid.\n\nTransshipments are perfectly legal in most cases.

American steel and aluminum companies complain that some basic metal is sent to other countries for minimal processing before it is shipped to the United States.

The extra costs include $500 for a Malaysian certificate of origin, at least $950 for unpacking goods in Malaysia and repacking them in a different container and $600 or more for the additional sea freight.\n\nMalaysian trade officials said the country did not have a specific law against tariff circumvention. Still, it has laws against the falsification of documents and requires companies to manufacture products there in order to obtain local certificates of origin.\n\nA new era of tariffs could make transshipments even more appealing. Brokers described receiving up to 10 times as many phone calls for price quotes as usual in the past several weeks as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing heated up.\n\nStamping out such transshipments could prove difficult. The United States made a big effort in the late 1990s to address the relabeling in Hong Kong of garments that had been made in mainland China, said Patrick Conway, a textiles trade specialist.\n\nBut after American officials gathered enough evidence to put companies on a watch list, the companies quickly disappeared, said Mr. Conway, who is the chairman of the economics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

If you have a specific type of high-deductible health insurance plan, you have until April 17 to contribute to an H.S.A. for 2017 and take a deduction from your taxes. You needn\u2019t itemize on your tax return to claim it.\n\nYou can make an extra H.S.A. contribution even if you already contributed some money in 2017 via payroll deduction at work, as long as you don\u2019t exceed the maximum, said Chris Byrd, executive vice president of WEX Health, which provides technology that helps employers and workers manage H.S.A.s and other health benefits. For 2017, the contribution limit is $3,400 for an individual and $6,750 for families. If you\u2019re unsure if your health insurance plan qualifies for an H.S.A., check with your employer or your health plan administrator.\n\nFor those with last-minute questions about their return, the I.R.S. offers answers on its site.\n\nOnce your taxes are filed, reward yourself: Many businesses offer freebies on Tax Day. Participating locations of Great American Cookies, for one, will offer free cookies on Tuesday.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the tax filing deadline:\n\nWhat if I mail my tax return?\n\nMailed tax returns must be postmarked by April 17. Some post offices stay open late on Tax Day, although that\u2019s less common now that more people file electronically. It\u2019s best to check with your local post office for details. (You can use the post office finder tool online.) The United States Postal Service says at least one office in New York City will be open until midnight on Tuesday: the James A. Farley Post Office at 421 Eighth Avenue.\n\nHow do I obtain an extension to file my tax return?\n\nIf you can\u2019t get your return done by Tuesday, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to panic,\u201d Ms. Labant said. You can obtain an automatic six-month extension by submitting I.R.S. Form 4868 by the filing date.\n\nAll taxpayers can file the extension form electronically via the I.R.S.\u2019s Free File program, even if their income doesn\u2019t qualify them to use the program to prepare their tax return, said Eric L. Smith, spokesman for the I.R.S.\n\nIf you\u2019re owed a refund, there\u2019s not much to worry about if you file a bit late, Mr. Smith said. Late-filing penalties are based on the amount of tax owed, so you won\u2019t be dinged (unless you\u2019ve miscalculated, and end up owing money). You can\u2019t get your refund until you file, though, so it makes sense to get the return in as soon as you can.", "title": "Tax Dawdlers, It\u2019s the Last Minute.

When I started looking at everything, I just started looking at the positives. We have a great arena; the practice facility is right here. I have a coach and a G.M. who believed in me. We were really starting to put some pieces together that we could be a really competitive team.\u201d\n\nThe Devils (44-28-9) face the Tampa Bay Lightning (54-23-5), the top team in the East, in the first round of the playoffs, beginning Thursday. The Devils won 10 of 13 games from March 10 to last Thursday, when they held off Toronto to earn the playoff berth. Hall, the left wing on the Devils\u2019 top line, had nine goals and 10 assists in those games.\n\nEarlier this season, Hall, 26, had a 26-game point streak, the longest in the N.H.L. in two years. The Devils won only 12 of those 26 games, but they stayed in the playoff race.

Seems like every game he\u2019s getting faster and stronger and more dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe Devils caught a big break last April when they won the draft lottery after finishing with the fifth-worst record in the N.H.L. That enabled them to choose between two centers who were 18 then, Nico Hischier of Switzerland and Nolan Patrick of Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nShero took Hischier, who was put on a line with Hall at midseason. The two players have complemented each other perhaps more than expected, and Hischier finished with 19 goals and 32 assists.\n\nHischier said of Hall, \u201cHe\u2019s the type of player who can raise his game at the part of the season when it counts.\u201d\n\nHall re-evaluated his life after last season and decided to buy in.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is home now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything else would be weird.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, then added: \u201cFrom Edmonton, it was a big change.

The union supports a ballot referendum that would raise taxes on corporations and on incomes over $150,000 annually. It opposes a proposal to change teacher pension plans to be more like the 401(k) accounts used in the private sector, and to raise the teacher retirement age to 65 from 58.

Two of the tech giants that will share their financial results have been under political assault, but for very different reasons. Facebook has come under scrutiny by Congress and regulators for its data practices and role in the spread of misinformation, while Amazon has become a punching bag for President Trump, who has attacked it for not collecting enough taxes and its relationship with the United States Postal Service. It\u2019s not clear whether the financial results of either company were affected, but the attacks have nonetheless spooked investors in the past. Nick Wingfield\n\nBritish panel hears testimony on Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe researcher at the center of the Cambridge Analytica scandal will testify on Tuesday before a British panel investigating fake news and the use of social media in the weeks before the country voted to leave the European Union. The University of Cambridge researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, has been accused of improperly gathering personal data on millions of Facebook\u2019s users and sharing the information with the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, the same panel, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, will hear from Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer. Mr. Schroepfer can expect to hear about the frustration of committee members who have wanted Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify rather than lower-ranking executives. The committee has little legislative authority, but is working on a much-anticipated report that aims to shed light on the ways that political campaigns have manipulated social media to win over voters. Adam Satariano\n\nTRADE\n\nEuropean leaders will discuss trade with Trump.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, will arrive in Washington early this week for a state visit, and they will be followed closely by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday. Their discussions with Mr. Trump are likely to center on global security concerns but also on his administration\u2019s aggressive trade agenda, as an important trade deadline looms. On May 1, the exemptions that the United States granted several countries from steel and aluminum tariffs are set to expire, meaning the European Union and other close allies would to pay a steep premium to send metal into the United States. The Trump administration is hoping to use the tariffs as leverage in a trade negotiation, but European leaders have said they would not be bullied into concessions. Ana Swanson\n\nAUTO INDUSTRY\n\nDetroit automakers report earnings.\n\nThe three Detroit automakers all report first-quarter earnings this week, and most of the attention will focus on the struggling Ford Motor, which replaced its chief executive a year ago. Ford brought in Jim Hackett last May to reinvigorate earnings, cut costs and sharpen its strategy, but after 11 months on the job he\u2019s offered few specifics on a turnaround plan. At least some details on cost-cutting are expected when Ford reports on Wednesday. General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles both present their results on Thursday, and are expected to show solid performances, thanks to sales of high-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles.

Boudette\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nECONOMY\n\nStimulus is on the European Central Bank\u2019s agenda.\n\nHave signs of a slowdown in Europe pushed back the European Central Bank\u2019s timetable for ending its emergency stimulus measures? That will most likely be the chief question when Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, holds a news conference on Thursday after a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council. The central bank is not expected to make any changes to its monetary policy at the meeting. But it will probably discuss whether a downturn in some economic indicators signals a slowdown or is just the result of one-time factors, including an especially brutal flu season that kept many workers off the job.

Mr. Sewing (pronounced \u201csaving\u201d), who was named to replace John Cryan this month amid chronic losses at the bank, will face investors and analysts in an early morning conference call. They will most likely interrogate Mr. Sewing about the bank\u2019s strategy, which some investors complain is amorphous and unconvincing.

Iran is suspected in a recent attack on a Saudi petrochemical plant.\n\nYet not all governments are likely to embrace the \u201cCybersecurity Tech Accord\u201d in part because the principles it espouses can run headlong into their own, usually secret efforts to develop cyberweapons.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The company said it knew nothing about the intrusion into its products, but American officials do not believe the denials and have banned Kaspersky products from United States government systems. Kaspersky is not a signer to the new accord.\n\nEdward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, revealed pictures suggesting that American officials intercepted some hardware that came out of Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of the routers and switches that make up the spine of the internet, apparently so the equipment directed traffic back to American intelligence agencies. There is no evidence that Cisco cooperated, but the publication of the photos led some foreign customers to believe that American equipment had been broadly compromised by the N.S.A.\n\nCisco is one of the firms that has signed the accord. Mark Chandler, Cisco\u2019s general counsel, said the company believed that \u201cwe need to say we will not be part of any effort that will undermine the security of the web, or undermine those who depend on it \u2014 our customers.\u201d Among the other signatories were Dell, Juniper Networks, the two parts of the recently-split Hewlett-Packard, Symantec and FireEye. Two foreign firms, Telephonica of Spain and Nokia of Finland, also signed. There are no Chinese or Russian companies on the list of initial signatories.\n\nThe new technology accord vows that the 31 signers \u201cwill protect against tampering with and exploitation of technology products and services during their development, design, distribution and use.\u201d Among the companies that signed are Oracle, Symantec, FireEye and HP, along with the Finnish company Nokia and the Spanish company Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nMicrosoft officials said they briefed the Trump administration on the new accord and heard no objections. But that may not mean much: Mr. Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, who oversaw cybersecurity policy, was dismissed last week after John R. Bolton took over as national security adviser.\n\nThe cybersecurity coordinator at the White House, Rob Joyce, is widely rumored to be considering leaving his post and returning to the National Security Agency, where he ran the most elite of the cyberforces that attack foreign networks. If Mr. Joyce departs, the White House will have lost its two most senior, and most knowledgeable, cybersecurity policymakers in the span of a few weeks.", "title": "Tech Firms Sign \u2018Digital Geneva Accord\u2019 Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar", "authors": ["David E.

Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects. \u201cI love the fact that you can transmit data, information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack \u2014 really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient.\u201d\n\nMr. Tusk, the founder of Tusk Strategies, is an investor in some large virtual currency companies. He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain-based systems. Mr. Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper-proof way.\n\n\u201cEverything is moving toward people saying, \u2018I want all the benefits of the internet, but I want to protect my privacy and my security,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain.\u201d\n\nBlockchains assemble data into so-called blocks that are chained together using complicated math. Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps, any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions. The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 and most of its imitators \u2014 are kept by a peer-to-peer computer network.\n\nThe novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard, abuse or lose control of the data, as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax.\n\nA range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model \u2014 for projects from the prosaic to the radical. Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people. Coca-Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor.", "title": "Tech Thinks It Has a Fix for the Problems It Created: Blockchain", "authors": []}

But the commonwealth attorney\u2019s office has said they were public school students ages 16 and 17. Two were white, and three were nonwhite.\n\nOne of the teenagers agreed for this article to share the list of books that he chose.

Money was raised, work teams were drawn from community volunteers, and the little schoolhouse eventually opened as a museum.\n\nSome criticized the sentence. For example, an English teacher at Loudoun balked at the idea of associating reading with punishment, said Deep Sran, the school\u2019s founder.\n\nKamran Fareedi, 17, a senior at Loudoun, had been working on the renovation before the vandalism. He said he thought the sentence \u201creeks of pampering and no consequences.\u201d\n\n\"When I heard that the punishment was that they were going to have to do homework assignments, I was very disappointed,\u201d he said. \"All over the country we have a giant mass incarceration problem. And particularly African Americans do the slightest thing, their interaction with the criminal justice system is way more harsh. When people of color make mistakes they don\u2019t get the chance to start over.\u201d\n\nHe said the fact that three of the youths were minorities also reflected the economic privilege of youths in the Ashburn area.\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing that they are that disconnected from the serious implications of their history and their heritage and people of their background today in non-privileged areas,\u201d Mr. Fareedi said.\n\nShailee Sran, a 16-year-old student at the school, said she hoped that the teenager learned the value of bravery in defending what is right from his reading of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI actually thought the punishment made sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like if they don\u2019t understand what they did wrong it is not helping the problem.

This shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d\n\nIn both cases, the youths also had to visit museums and had the option of watching relevant documentaries and speeches.\n\nMs. Rueda, the commonwealth attorney, said she saw the sentence as an opportunity to expand their minds. \u201cIs it going to change their perspective on swastikas if you put them in the juvenile center and locked them up?\u201d she said.", "title": "Teenage Vandals Were Sentenced to Read Books.

We\u2019ve come a long, long way, but some fundamental questions remain unanswered. There are times when we still struggle to predict them with specificity. When you live in a city, our dominion over the natural world can seem complete. It\u2019s nice to learn there are still some mysteries.\n\nImage Brantley Hargrove Credit Catherine Downes\n\nI was stunned by the fact that when Samaras came on the scene at the turn of the 21st century, we had no data on ground level from the core of a violent tornado. We\u2019re the most advanced civilization the world has ever known. But this was one place that we hadn\u2019t been. We\u2019ve been to the moon, we\u2019ve seen Mars, but the core of a tornado was terra incognita. It\u2019s a testament to just how dangerous it was for Tim.\n\nIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\n\nIt\u2019s vastly different. The initial manuscript I turned in was 112,000 words. There were whole chapters on Ted Fujita, the godfather of tornado science. There was a chapter where I visited a vortex simulator at Texas Tech that used Samaras\u2019s data. I had chapters where I\u2019d go out storm chasing with some of Tim\u2019s best buddies and colleagues, and we saw monstrous tornadoes. I had these incredible adventures and experiences, and you can imagine how painful it was to cut them completely out of the book. We took the meat cleaver to it. The final product is about 80,000 words, and I think that\u2019s all for the best. As interesting as those chases I went on were, I think the book is better for having a laser focus on Tim and his life and work.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nOne singer I\u2019ve always loved and I think is probably one of the greatest living songwriters is James McMurtry.

The director George Stevens\u2019s film, starring Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, and based on Edna Ferber\u2019s 1952 novel of the same name, was released in 1956. It earned Stevens an Oscar and was nominated in several other categories, including Best Picture. (It lost to \u201cAround the World in 80 Days.\u201d) Don Graham\u2019s new book tells the story of how this epic about the ranching life, the oil business, clashing cultures and the changing fortunes of generations made it to the screen. Below, Mr. Graham, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin, discusses how his students\u2019 reaction to the movie helped inspire the book, how Stevens\u2019s experiences during World War II influenced the film and more.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen did you first get the idea to write this book?\n\nI could have written it 30 years earlier. In 1986, my wife and I went to Marfa, Tex., on our way out to California. We were invited to spend three nights at the ranch right beside the decaying house where \u201cGiant\u201d was made. It was the 30th anniversary, and Marfa was going to hold this celebration. It turned out to be kind of a farce because they never got the film, so they couldn\u2019t show it. They had a rodeo, but that didn\u2019t seem to have much to do with anything. So the film was much on my mind, but I was working on another book.\n\nI\u2019ve taught a class called Life and Literature in the Southwest for many years, and I started putting films back into it. I put \u201cGiant\u201d in, in 2004 or 2005. Most of the kids had never heard of it, but it really struck a chord with them. They complained about the length, but I told them that they watch the NFL and pro baseball; it\u2019s the same length. The film feels very modern to them. They\u2019re surprised at Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s feminism. They love the scene where she denounces the men for being Neanderthals. And the question of racial prejudice is very powerful in the film. The more I talked about it and thought about it, the more I thought this is the book I need to write now.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?\n\nThe degree to which World War II affected both Edna Ferber and George Stevens. Stevens was an obsessive guy, as many directors are. He was much influenced and really devastated by what he saw when he went to Dachau. He was shooting footage for Eisenhower under the general\u2019s command. When he came back, he wasn\u2019t able to work for two or three years. Ferber went to Europe in the summer of 1945 as a war correspondent. She witnessed the Buchenwald death camp and pronounced Germany to be an \u201cunadulterated horror.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStevens put motifs in the film straight from his experience in the war. I would never have picked up on that independently from just watching the film. One instance is the burial of the soldier, Angel, a young Mexican-American boy. We see his whole burial scene, for three or four minutes. A lot of people wanted Stevens to leave it out, but he thought it paid respect to all the people who died in the war and whose remains were delivered years later. He and Ferber were both progressive. They were fearful that America was hardening; that discrimination might turn into something even worse. I think that fear was emphasized by what they saw in Germany.", "title": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Bringing \u2018Giant\u2019 to the Big Screen", "authors": ["John Williams"]}

When you think about growing older and getting stuck in these troughs of life from which you can\u2019t escape, you don\u2019t think of someone like Bruno or Michael. But both, in their extraordinary lives, got a little stuck on tracks from which they couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nPhoto\n\nBruno\u2019s story is tragic. What\u2019s a guy to do who just wants to live with hunter-gatherers in the jungle when there are no more hunter-gatherers to live with? He couldn\u2019t go back home and live in Switzerland.

Bruno is this Jesus-like figure. He moved people because he was so authentic, dedicated, single-minded and pure. But that purity was also a selfish purity. He alienated the people closest to him. When you\u2019re pure and there\u2019s no compromise, there\u2019s nowhere to run and nowhere to turn if things don\u2019t work. Despite all his incredible work \u2014 and it was selfless, the miles traveled and the hunger strikes \u2014 he failed in saving any of the forest and he ended up dead. As sad as the Penan situation is now, there are Penan who are becoming educated, who want more modern lives and yet retain an essence of their Penan-ness. But that was unacceptable to Bruno.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Who is the better person? In the end, I feel an incredible admiration for Bruno, but I also think he was kind of nuts. A main theme of the book is that the saint-like figure is maybe not that saintly; and the person who on the surface is more of a sinner isn\u2019t really at all, and that life is complicated.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nMy parents. My mother loved fiction and my father loved old-school journalism. They wanted to be writers, but they couldn\u2019t. I mean, they could write a nice letter, but my dad tried a couple of times to write a book and he couldn\u2019t finish anything.

Those who escape exchange their country\u2019s near-total isolation for the headiness of freedom. But in the process, their history is erased.\n\nIt was this disordered transition that Tim Franco, a photographer who splits his time between South Korea and China, decided to explore in a new portrait series called \u201cUnperson.\u201d A riff on an Orwellian construct from the novel \u201c1984,\u201d his work examines the \u201cvaporization\u201d of the defectors\u2019 past, which has left many in limbo, free but incomplete. \u201c[North Korea] is their home, they left people behind,\u201d Mr. Franco said. \u201cEven if they live in a modern country, they will never be completely happy in South Korea.\u201d\n\nAn artist, a concert pianist and a political prison camp guard who is still haunted by his own brutality are among those who sat for Mr. Franco. Their testimonials vary in detail, but most share a shade of regret. Although their stories are impossible to confirm, Mr. Franco thinks that some accounts may be slightly exaggerated \u2014 perhaps because stories of defection become currency in South Korea. Fitting into a new society can be painful; distrust and indifference make it difficult to find work. As a result, Mr. Franco said, many defectors are forced to capitalize on their escape by writing books or appearing on TV shows.\n\nMr. Franco translated this exploration of identity into the photographic process itself. Working with an old wooden 4x5 camera, Fuji instant film and a series of chemical procedures, Mr. Franco reclaimed a negative from the developed print, an analog material that is not supposed to exist. It\u2019s a long and risky business that he said echoes the dangerous journey of the North Korean migrant.

Positioning herself not as a scholar breaking new ground (many of these women have been well covered in biographies, memoirs and academic studies) but as a missionary championing her subjects\u2019 \u201coppositional spirit,\u201d Dean artfully shepherds the reader through the professional and personal ups and downs of each life, keeping an eye on the affinities \u2014 a taste for battle, an ethic of intellectual honesty \u2014 that made some of them allies (McCarthy and Arendt, Arendt and Adler) and drove others apart (McCarthy and Sontag, Adler and Kael).\n\nPhoto\n\nA leitmotif \u2014 at least until Didion, Ephron and Malcolm come along \u2014 is that of being \u201cthe only woman at the table.\u201d Parker embodied this as a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a charmed lunch club in which writers jousted with quips and witticisms. She wasn\u2019t the only woman at this table, but she was the one who memorably bested the men \u2014 her pun on \u201chorticulture\u201d is by far the most quoted piece of Algonquin wordplay. Indeed, two themes run through this book: the hard-won autonomy of the one girl in the boys\u2019 club and her ambivalence toward the feminist movement. Though McCarthy once characterized her heroine in a short story \u2014 a clear alter ego \u2014 as \u201ca princess among the trolls,\u201d and Sontag complained about being the only woman on countless panels, both accepted elevated status as their due and neither felt obliged to lower the ladder for other women. (A story went around that McCarthy baited the younger Sontag, who was suddenly turning heads, by saying, \u201cI hear you\u2019re the new me.\u201d) The political philosopher Arendt \u201cwas steadfastly against feminism until her dying day,\u201d Dean writes.

It is viewed as an unforgivable lapse.\u201d This is shocking, and it would have been interesting to know if the unforgiving are activists, academics or what.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor readers unfamiliar with the work of these women, \u201cSharp\u201d should be eye-opening. Dean traverses the intellectual landscape of the 20th century at an easy gallop \u2014 the boozy cocktail parties; the plotting of editors in their offices; the literary and political trench wars, aggressive essays thrown across the breach like grenades. She is frank, giving us the skinny. She admits that much of Parker\u2019s verse doesn\u2019t hold up (\u201cIt seems clich\u00e9d, overwrought\u201d), and owns that Kael, the brilliant film critic of The New Yorker, was less than authoritative on subjects requiring sustained research. (In her book on \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Kael lined up opinions that supported her thesis yet never interviewed Orson Welles, the film\u2019s director, who was very much alive.) Writing about Adler, the critic and novelist, Dean shows how a relentless need to attack can shade into self-sabotage: It\u2019s one thing to go ferociously at your subjects, backed by a nurturing editor, and quite another to launch an Electra-like offensive against that editor\u2019s replacement.\n\nFor those who have lived with these writers for years, Dean can come up short. When she writes that Adler, in her famous New York Review of Books hatchet job on Kael\u2019s criticism, \u201cmade a decent case,\u201d it\u2019s not enough. Adler was lawyerly, certainly, running down Kael\u2019s every repeated trope and overused word, but her attack was as humorless as Kael\u2019s reviews are pleasurable. You can be so right that you\u2019re wrong, and I wondered what Dean really thinks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Book Review Newsletter Sign up to receive a preview of each Sunday\u2019s Book Review, delivered to your inbox every Friday.

Sure, she wrote \u201cHeartburn,\u201d which shocked the mediacracy by broadcasting raw details from her failed marriage to Carl Bernstein. But what was oppositional about Ephron\u2019s work in Hollywood? Her rom-coms \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d are formulaic films that pander, with none of the vicious wit her friends enjoyed. (It\u2019s been said that at parties one didn\u2019t want to be the first to leave a conversation that included Ephron, lest she entertain those who remained with a zinger about you.) Did Ephron sell out? Or did she find another way to be the only woman at the table, this time in Tinseltown, where she got to be as trite as the men? Dean doesn\u2019t say.\n\nThen there\u2019s Malcolm, who at The New Yorker has made a specialty of reportage that stubbornly hovers in the zone where truth, story, presumption and the law merge into mist. She herself, like the Cheshire Cat, appears and disappears, which brings yet another dimension to writing on subjects such as psychoanalysis, crime, and ethics in journalism and biography. Over a long career, an oppositional sensibility can become a default strategy that subtly or not so subtly distorts the picture, and Malcolm\u2019s ineffable calculation sometimes leaves one queasy about her motives. \u201cThe experience of reading a Malcolm text,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cis always to linger in that sense of uncertainty, both about the nominal subject \u2026 and about exactly what new kind of sly trick the narrator might be pulling on us.\u201d Is this the art of opinion? Or something else?\n\nOne is also curious to know where Dean stands on Arendt\u2019s \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem,\u201d a 1963 meditation on war crimes that was incendiary because of its problematic phrase \u201cthe banality of evil,\u201d and a tone so cold that Arendt\u2019s friend the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem thought it flippant (some used the word cruel). Dean lays out this controversy, and many others, with a deft hand, but sometimes skips ahead just when we want her to deliver her own view.\n\nI was struck, as well, by the number of sloppy sentences. Dean knows that clarity doesn\u2019t exist without precision; Ephron\u2019s meandering style, for instance, is so controlled it\u2019s practically pointillist. And yet Dean\u2019s own writing, direct and lively, can get too loosely conversational \u2014 too wordy and imprecise. Her chatty approach to these formidable women makes them seem accessible, and that\u2019s a good thing. But a blue pencil is as strong as a sword, and more cut and thrust would have made this book sharper.", "title": "Ten Women Whose Tongues and Pens Were as \u2018Sharp\u2019 as Knives", "authors": ["Laura Jacobs", "Michelle Dean"]}

It is often used to suggest activity that is illicit, like a \u201cgypsy cab,\u201d which is generally unlicensed.\n\n\u201cThe word Gypsy is being phased out in many places, since the Romany voice has gained strength in recent years and is voicing its objections,\u201d said Ian Hancock, director of the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On opening night for every musical with a chorus, the robe is given to the person with the most Broadway chorus credits; the recipient puts on the robe, circles the stage three times to allow the rest of the cast to touch the robe and then visits each dressing room as a sort of good-luck blessing before the curtain goes up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach show that gets the robe adds a memento, signed by cast members, and then the robe is passed to the next show that opens; when the robes get too big, they are retired, and some are in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of the City of New York.\n\nThe most recent ceremony was Thursday at the Lincoln Center Theater revival of \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d and the next (and last using the Gypsy Robe name) will be Monday at \u201cSummer: The Donna Summer Musical.\u201d The ceremony will continue next season but will be renamed. Equity is surveying its membership about what to call it.\n\nThe history of the usage is not clear, but Laurence Maslon, an arts professor at New York University and the author of the forthcoming \u201cBroadway to Main Street,\u201d said it appears to relate to the fact that until the early 20th century, many American actors proudly earned a living by traveling from city to city. \u201cIt was a badge of honor, not a badge of shame, that you were itinerant,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw more people that way.\u201d\n\nThe word deeply permeated the industry. In his 1963 autobiography, \u201cMister Abbott,\u201d the Broadway producer George Abbott wrote of Broadway dancers: \u201cWe call them the Gypsies, and they call themselves that. They are homeless, wandering people for the most part, defying all the conventions.\u201d\n\nThe 1970 musical \u201cApplause,\u201d based on the movie \u201cAll About Eve,\u201d features a song titled \u201cShe\u2019s No Longer a Gypsy,\u201d about a scheming understudy who becomes a star. And in 1976, the actress Bonnie Franklin, presenting a choreography prize at the Tony Awards, described herself as \u201ca gypsy from Santa Monica,\u201d and added, \u201cthe term gypsy lovingly applies to all dancers in the Broadway theater.\u201d\n\nMs. Jordan said there had been no pressure on Actors\u2019 Equity to change the ceremony name. And one scholar and activist contacted for this article had a mixed reaction to the move.\n\n\u201cThe ceremony seems like a lovely ritual, and changing its name would not have been my first choice of a battle to fight,\u201d said Petra Gelbart, a curator at RomArchive, a digital archive. \u201cThat said, the fact that the term Gypsy is so often used to denote free-spirited or traveling lifestyles has real-life repercussions for actual Romany people. We are always being reduced to ridiculous stereotypes that can make it difficult to find employment or social acceptance.\u201d\n\nBroadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS is sticking with \u201cGypsy of the Year\u201d for two annual performances that for 29 years have celebrated a fall fund-raising campaign. \u201cWords have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used,\u201d said Tom Viola, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director. \u201cEven words that may have once been intended as a slur can be, in fact, reclaimed with pride.\u201d\n\nMr. Viola said the performances celebrate \u201cthe talent, generosity and unique skills of those performing in the ensemble.\u201d He added, \u201cIn our theatrical community, \u2018the gypsy\u2019 is beloved.\u201d", "title": "Term of Affection?

Stern, founder of his namesake architecture firm and co-author of \u201cNew York 1960: Architecture and Urbanism between the Second World War and the Bicentennial.\u201d Such slabs were \u201ccheaper than a whole room to build,\u201d Mr. Stern said, but building owners could charge considerably more these apartments. Instead of \u201ca four-room apartment, you\u2019d have a three-room-with-balcony apartment.\u201d\n\nSmall, cheaply detailed, and sometimes overlooking trafficked streets, these \u201ctongue depressors,\u201d as Mr. Stern disparagingly calls them, typically became overflow storage, filled with bikes and baby carriages \u2014 not people (unless they were ducking out there for a smoke).\n\nThe problem went beyond the fact that a tenant might feel insecure out on a ledge exposed on three sides. The air was more polluted in the days before the Clean Air Act of 1970, and the terraces got sooty. Air-conditioning, which encouraged residents to remain inside, was another reason terraces went out of favor.\n\nBut now developers are asking architects to bring them back, albeit in friendlier forms. And green-minded architects, for their part, are pushing developer clients to allow them to include terraces in their plans.\n\nAt 100 Vandam Street, a project that COOKFOX has designed for real estate developer Jeff Greene, there will be outdoor rooms, setback terraces, loggia balconies and what the architects are calling \u201csky garden planters,\u201d filled with native perennials, grasses and ferns.\n\nRick Cook, a co-founder of the design firm, said that he adds so many terraces to his buildings that he calls the sum of the horizontal surfaces \u201cthe fifth facade.\u201d\n\nBrazilian architect Isay Weinfeld is also adding built-in planters to some of the terraces on his garden-themed Jardim condominium for Centaur Properties and Greyscale Development Group. The project, which consists of two 11-story towers, is currently under construction next to the Zaha Hadid-designed 520 West 28th Street, which has its own space-age-looking terraces.", "title": "Terraces to Look At and Linger On", "authors": []}

And in a nation that escaped the grip of dictatorship only in 1985, it is unclear whether democracy will survive or whether supporters of authoritarian government will gain the upper hand.\n\nOn April 4, the day before the Federal Supreme Court rejected Mr. da Silva\u2019s habeas corpus appeal, the commander of the Brazilian Army, Gen. Eduardo Villas Boas, summoned the ghost of the dictatorship when he announced on Twitter that the military, \u201calong with all good citizens, repudiates impunity and respects the Constitution, civic peace and democracy.\u201d The message was widely interpreted as an attempt to intimidate the court into convicting Mr. da Silva. Another general, Luiz Gonzaga Schroeder, went even further, stating in an interview that if Mr. da Silva were elected again, it would be \u201cthe duty of the armed forces to restore order.\u201d\n\nBoth generals believe that Mr. da Silva\u2019s presidential bid is an affront to the war against corruption, known here as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash), a far-reaching campaign started in 2014 that has uncovered a network of graft and corruption in the public service, shaking the political class.

Alternatively, he could run his campaign from prison as long as the electoral courts don\u2019t disqualify him by invoking the Clean Slate law, which bars those convicted of criminal offenses from seeking public office.\n\nIf things don\u2019t go well for Mr. da Silva, the biggest loser will be the Brazilian left, which has been looking to him as its anchor and promise. With the left in disarray \u2014 its reputation is tarnished, its members divided, and it has no other strong presidential candidate \u2014 Brazil could well follow the recent trend in other Latin American countries, where right-wing parties that stubbornly refuse to cut ties with their former dictatorships are now on the rise, enjoying the support of the growing evangelical Christian communities, as is the case in Chile.", "title": "Opinion | Testing Brazil\u2019s Democracy", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-22 00:00:00", "text": "Rome\u2019s power was built on benefactors and beneficiaries bound by reciprocal obligations of gratitude. It worked, but it was easily corrupted. Lower classes incurred huge debts of gratitude that could never be repaid, functionally enslaving them. Ancient philosophers urged benefactors to eschew corrupted gratia and instead give freely from a desire for the common good. Benevolent gratitude, they insisted, was a virtue. Sadly, it was also rare.\n\nWestern societies inherited Roman ideas of gratitude. Medieval rulers tried (and failed) to Christianize political gratitude, but Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Adam Smith rejected quid pro quo. They argued that reciprocal gratitude was bad for politics, but also believed that benevolent gratitude was necessary for moral democracy. It was a nuanced and difficult position to achieve. The temptations of corrupted gratitude kept creeping back into Western politics.\n\nUnderstanding this helps explain Donald Trump. He has always depicted himself as a benefactor: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d During the primaries, he boasted that he received no outside gifts or contributions, thus debts of gratitude would never control him. He criticized conventional forms of payback, promising to distribute social largess to the \u201cright\u201d people, rid the system of undeserving beneficiaries and restore upward mobility in a social pyramid. No more corporations, no more politicians. He would be the ultimate benefactor. He would make America great again from the top.\n\nThis helps explain why the Russia inquiry makes Mr. Trump angry. The suggestion that he benefited from anyone, much less a foreign government, undermines his self-image as unassailable benefactor. He never receives. He gives as he wills, and to whom he chooses. \u201cReceivers,\u201d like the poor, immigrants, women and persons of color, are considered weaker beings, consigned to the lower ranks of his social pyramid, and who, failing to reciprocate his paternalistic generosity, are chided for a lack of thanks.\n\nThere is, however, an alternative to the pyramid of gratitude: a table. One of the enduring images of American self-understanding is that of a Thanksgiving table, where people celebrate abundance, serve one another and make sure all are fed. People give with no expectation of return, and joy replaces obligation.\n\nThis vision of gratitude is truly virtuous, sustains the common good, ensures a circle of equality, and strengthens community. Instead of Mr. Trump\u2019s gratitude-as-duty politics, what our country needs is a new vision of an American table of thanks.", "title": "Opinion | Thank Trump, or You\u2019ll Be Sorry", "authors": []}

It also benefited from Papua New Guinea\u2019s willingness to collaborate.\n\nMany countries, however, do not even bother responding to inquiries sent by American agents. And sometimes, officials in exporting countries vouch for suspect shipments. Then American agents have no recourse, Mr. Souphanya said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re certifying that their permit process is correct, we can\u2019t tell them, \u2018Hey, you guys are wrong,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to prove.\u201d\n\nWarning Signs\n\nEven when it can\u2019t be proven, there may be other telltale signs that animals were caught in the wild.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome species sold as captive-bred are notoriously difficult to coax into reproducing. For example, leading zoos around the world over the decades have managed to breed fewer than 50 echidnas \u2014 strange, egg-laying mammals that resemble hedgehogs.\n\nYet in 2016, Indonesian officials permitted PT Alam Nusantara, a Jakarta-based company, to export 45 \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d echidnas. F.W.S. records show that as early as 2011, the exporter was shipping echidnas labeled captive-born to the United States.\n\nThat echidnas appeared on the quota list at all suggests that traders had a hand in setting it, Dr. Nijman said.\n\n\u201cHaving been present at those meetings, it felt more like a negotiation between what traders wanted, what regional forestry departments could offer, and what was within acceptable limits for the scientific authority,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of this, he continued, a country\u2019s list of permissible captive-bred animals often appears scattershot and illogical. Reisinger\u2019s tree monitors and spotted tree monitors, for example, suddenly appeared on Indonesia\u2019s list of permissible exports in 2015, only to be removed the following year.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to invest years and years into breeding a particular species, only to then suddenly no longer export it and change to another species,\u201d Dr. Nijman said.\n\nThe more likely explanation? \u201cNew entries represent new demand for rare species,\u201d he said. That is, traders received a request, lobbied for the species to be added to the list, found the animals in the wild and exported them \u2014 then moved on.\n\nAccording to Adri Tasma, owner of CV Terraria, a reptile farm near Jakarta, traders rely on Indonesia\u2019s Cites authorities to set sustainable, responsible quotas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tasma specializes in captive-bred green tree pythons, and in 2016 he was allowed to export up to 2,000 of them.

That gap has narrowed significantly over the past four decades, as women have gotten more education and entered male-dominated professions, but a divide remains.\n\nWomen who have babies late typically have different career paths from those who have them early. Those who first give birth in their late 30s tend to be more educated with higher-earning jobs, while those who have babies in their early 20s have less education and lower earnings.\n\nLow earners have a smaller pay gap in general, and people who have babies in their late 30s could have a smaller pay gap because they are less likely to have more than one child. But the fact that both groups of women recover their earnings, relative to their husbands, suggests there\u2019s also something about having children outside the prime career-building years that hurts women\u2019s pay less, no matter the occupation.\n\nOne explanation is that the modern economy requires time in the office and long, rigid hours across a variety of jobs \u2014 yet pay gaps are smallest when workers have some control over when and where work gets done. In high-earning jobs, hours have grown longer and people are expected to be available almost around the clock. In low-earning jobs, hours have become much less predictable, so it can be hard for working parents to arrange child care.\n\nThe issue, in general, comes down to time. Children require a lot of it, especially in the years before they start school, and mothers spend disproportionately more time than fathers on child care and related responsibilities. This seems to be particularly problematic for women building their careers, when they might have to work hardest and prove themselves most, and less so for women who have already established some seniority or who have not yet started careers.", "title": "The 10-Year Baby Window That Is the Key to the Women\u2019s Pay Gap", "authors": []}

After the earthquake that demolished the city in 1906, she moved with her mother and sister to Paris. Florence yearned to be an opera singer, but she exaggerated her talent and training. \u201cWhether she ever asked herself if she could have truly become a successful headline singer is doubtful \u2014 Florence\u2019s monumental ego prevented that kind of self-analysis.\u201d Or any other kind of self-analysis, come to that. Ronald had her work cut out for her.\n\nFlorence\u2019s unimaginative mission in life was to marry a rich man, and after a failed starter marriage, she became the third wife of Frank Gould, son of the infamous millionaire railway tycoon Jay Gould. Eighteen years her senior, Frank Gould was the kind of guy who started drinking at 8 a.m. and tried to kill his second wife, the English showgirl Edith Maud Kelly. Florence remained undeterred.\n\nThe couple married on Feb. 10, 1923, and set about acquiring real estate, including swaths of Juan-les-Pins, a tiny fishing village between Nice and Cannes. Ronald is very good at detailing the development of luxury hotels and casinos on the French Riviera, and the Goulds\u2019 efforts to create a holiday destination for the beau monde.\n\nPhoto\n\nFlorence was \u201can extremely talented businesswoman,\u201d but aside from ordering her husband to buy more property, the only business she seemed to conduct was batting her eyelashes at men she deemed useful. During the German Occupation, many of these men were high-ranking Nazis. She headed up a network of so-called souris gris, or gray mice, who were \u201csociety women willing to prostitute themselves \u2026 in exchange for all sorts of favors besides cool cash.\u201d She attended auctions of \u201cdegenerate\u201d art, and gobbled up masterpieces the Germans didn\u2019t want. After the war, when female collaborators were publicly shamed and arrested, Florence used her connections to avoid imprisonment. She reached out to \u201cher old friend Joseph Kennedy,\u201d who asked Edward Kennedy, a war correspondent for The Associated Press, to write a sympathetic piece whitewashing her behavior.\n\nFlorence Gould\u2019s story is glamorous, but static: Her sole ambition was to become ever richer and more admired, and in that regard, her story gives us a glimpse into the seemingly universal mind-set of the superaffluent. Wars that destroyed families and cities were viewed simply as fun killers; economic disasters were an exciting opportunity to snag mansions and masterpieces at fire sale prices.\n\n\u201cA Dangerous Woman\u201d may fall short in exploring the complexities of a clearly captivating woman, but Ronald\u2019s group portrait of people of great wealth \u2014 their expensive squabbles over inheritances and divorce settlements, their disinclination to pay taxes (Frank skipped out on paying federal income taxes for more than 30 years), their ability to manipulate people in power, all in the service of adding even more zeros to their bank accounts \u2014 is breathtaking and quite modern.", "title": "The Amazing Life of a Robber Baron\u2019s Daughter-in-Law, With Caveats", "authors": ["Karen Karbo", "Susan Ronald"]}

We met at a time of mutual vulnerability, both of us unknowingly dating the same woman who seemed to take great pleasure in exploiting our trust and undermining our sanity.\n\nWhen we came together a few years after that \u2014 both free of her, road tripping across the Southwest, kissing sweetly on a friend\u2019s fold-out couch in New Mexico \u2014 the philosophy that had governed my entire relationship history evaporated. How could it not? Val was lovely, funny, brilliant \u2014 the tenderest, kindest person I\u2019d ever met.\n\nWhen Val is anxious, she wears it on her face; she needs to talk about it, she cries. As for me, my adrenaline skyrockets and I begin to imagine the many ways death can come to me (liver cancer, aneurysm, stray bullet). Eventually, I shut down mentally and physically, as though the terrible outcomes are predators that can only see me if I move.\n\nWe are terrified of mostly opposite things. I am anxious about: insects, germs, disease and mortal injury and death, messy rooms, being late, not honoring my commitments. She is anxious about: rodents, money, her writing, her job, social interactions, conflict, people secretly hating her. There is some overlap between our fears: not being believed, being believed to be crazy, being crazy, the fear that one of us is 10 seconds from leaving the other.\n\nBecause of our mutual ex-girlfriend, the process of learning to trust each other was slow and deliberate. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep me accountable of your whereabouts 24 hours a day,\u201d Val would say to me after I came home late wielding evidence of the train slowdown that had caused my delay, frantic that she\u2019d think I was cheating on her. \u201cIf I was angry, I\u2019d tell you,\u201d I\u2019d promise her when she worried that I was squirreling away my rage until it exploded.\n\nThe first apartment we rented in Philadelphia abutted a restaurant\u2019s back alley and was blessed with cockroaches and mice. The roaches agitated me; I hated their spindly legs and their constantly probing antennae, the way they darted and the sheer quantity and speed of them. Val became an expert at recognizing my whimper and dashing into the room with her sneaker aloft. But she was pathologically terrified of mice, who were fewer in number but larger and harder to kill and bolder the longer we lived there. She feared they\u2019d run over her feet, and more than once dashed to a chair like a woman in an old cartoon lifting her skirts in terror. I became the de facto exterminator, chasing, catching and disposing of their bodies.\n\nWhen we began wedding planning, we also performed our anxiety on opposite schedules: When picking a venue and buying our dresses, she fretted while I achieved absolute, meditative calm; when the date neared, she seemed suddenly relaxed. \u201cWhatever happens at the end of the day, we\u2019ll be married!\u201d she reminded me as I sat hunched over a table in my pajamas, three days unshowered, hot-gluing centerpieces and nursing burns on my fingers and yelling about \u201cKitchen Nightmares\u201d (\u201cThis show is entirely about toxic masculinity, and also if I ever suggest we open a restaurant please just divorce me\u201d).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

I\u2019d been on my feet for two weeks straight, commuting an hour each way. I was exhausted and barely functioning, and the check barely covered my student loans, much less rent or food or anything else. When she got home from work, I was staring at the wall in our bedroom. \u201cI am useless,\u201d I told her. \u201cLook at this paycheck. I can\u2019t make my half of the rent.

I\u2019m in this for a long haul, and if you are too, then we will make this work.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be in denial if I didn\u2019t acknowledge the joke of our situation, the simultaneous stereotypes of the emotionally volatile artists and the continuously processing lesbians. But we\u2019ve turned these heightened emotional states into engines for our writing and our marriage, a shorthand for the kind of give-and-take that makes relationships work.\n\nWe do a lot of sort-of-joking-but-not-really talking about the end times. Blame it on climate change (her anxiety), too many post-apocalyptic movies and video games (mine), and a healthy dose of terror about nuclear annihilation and antibiotic-resistant pathogens (both of ours).\n\nVal laments: \u201cI\u2019m useless, I can\u2019t hunt animals or anything. I have no practical skills of any kind. If the world goes to hell, I\u2019d be dead weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to be a vegetarian anymore,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI know!

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "Beyond this conceptual confusion, there\u2019s a raw fact few people \u2014 and, as far as I can tell, nobody in the Trump administration \u2014 seem to appreciate: China no longer runs big trade surpluses.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always true. A decade ago, China\u2019s current account surplus \u2014 a broad measure that includes trade in services and income from investments abroad \u2014 was more than 9 percent of G.D.P., a very big number. In 2017, however, its surplus was only 1.4 percent of G.D.P., which isn\u2019t much. Meanwhile, the U.S. ran a current account deficit of 2.4 percent of G.D.P., a bit bigger, but also much smaller than the imbalances of the mid-2000s.\n\nBut in that case, why is \u201cbilateral\u201d trade between the U.S. and China so unbalanced? The answer is that it\u2019s largely a kind of statistical illusion. China is the Great Assembler: it\u2019s where components from other countries, like Japan and South Korea, are put together into consumer products for the U.S. market. So a lot of what we import from China is really produced elsewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why we should demand that China stop playing that role. Indeed, it\u2019s not clear that China could even do much to reduce its bilateral surplus with the U.S.: To do so, it would basically have to have a completely different economy. And this just isn\u2019t going to happen unless we have a full-blown trade war that shuts down much of the global economy as we know it.\n\nNow, Trump himself might be O.K. with large-scale deglobalization. But as we\u2019ve seen, his beloved stock market hates the idea, and with good reason: Businesses have invested heavily on the assumption that a closely integrated global economy is here to stay, and a trade war would leave many of those investments stranded.\n\nOh, and a trade war would also devastate much of pro-Trump rural America, since a large share of our agricultural production \u2014 including almost two-thirds of food grains \u2014 is exported.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why things seem so incoherent. One day Trump talks tough on trade; then stocks fall, and his advisers scramble to say that the trade war won\u2019t really happen; then he worries that he\u2019s looking weak, and tweets out more threats; and so on.

But his profile is solemn: a sharp jawline, chin raised and jutted, tinted sunglasses that appear more fogged-over than tinted, hair sheared short, perhaps by an electric razor. He wears a gray Mao jacket with glinting buttons, the old uniform of the Communist Party of China. He is an ambassador or a poseur, a visitor out of time and place, his manner ruthlessly aloof, his impression of his surroundings comically unreadable. He visits Disneyland and requests photos with Goofy and Mickey, who bend and mug as he stands upright with customary self-protecting stiffness. The pictures parody stereotypes of Asian inwardness, and they rebuke Western portraiture, which purports to disclose the inner lives of the subject. In these works, nothing about the person, though much about the world, is revealed.\n\nCompare these shots, from Tseng Kwong Chi\u2019s \u201cEast Meets West\u201d a.k.a. \u201cExpeditionary\u201d series (1979-89), to paintings by Martin Wong, his contemporary, who lived on the devastated Lower East Side, not far from Tseng\u2019s East Village. Wong\u2019s works are as outr\u00e9 as Tseng\u2019s are hermetic, landscapes that obscure the painter and take in the men \u2014 usually men, mostly Latino \u2014 behind the grimed facades of Manhattan\u2019s then-frayed edges. This is the imagery of Wong\u2019s neighborhood: Storefronts featuring Chinese characters and Spanish; the variegated concrete of prison cells that form the backdrop for a Renaissance-style annunciation; an elegy for a handball court; a paean to the \u201chickory smoked rubber and B.O.\u201d scent, as the artist once described it, of firemen coming back from work; and above all, expanses of brick, each slab and joint individuated. \u201cHeaven\u201d (1988) is a circle of brick with a hole at the center: a Chinese bi form and maybe, as some critics read it, a glory hole. Though Chinatown was just around the corner, Wong was a rare Asian resident on the Lower East Side, and he became integral to it, one of the surest and most steady documentarians of its cracked mood. One scholar has compared his work to the glory days of Dutch realist art. In the end, he said, he was working in the much longer and deeper tradition of Chinese landscape painting.", "title": "The Artists Who Brought Asian-Americans Into the Annals of Contemporary Art", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "JK: There was really a sense of trying to work on global ideas. Of really being open to the possibilities of art. I don\u2019t really think any of us ever cared about money. The discourse about money came through some of the success that we had. But we didn\u2019t care about money. We wanted to make our work.\n\nAB: This gets into an area that has to be parsed a little bit more. There were some of us that specifically addressed this idea.\n\nBB: Which idea is that?\n\nAB: One term that was leveled at us that I actually preferred was Commodity Art. Because I thought some of us were addressing that. You know, if the spiritual essence of America is consumerism, which it credibly is, Jeff nailed the actual moment of spiritual precision. When you get an object and you unwrap it and before it becomes a utilitarian thing, it exists in that perfect pristine state. You stopped right there and nailed it. We were definitely addressing these questions. There was Donald Judd and people saw a box, but suddenly this box was bought and sold, and it was branded, and we began to see the other side of that. How it was put into play \u2014 as it played through the auction houses, as it played through the whole process of brand identification, as it existed as an object. And this became part of the equation of our conceptual thinking, of our understanding of conceptual art. It was no longer pure.\n\nBB: When you use the word \u201cour,\u201d who are you referring to?\n\nAB: Well, there are different aspects.\n\nBB: Because I think that\u2019s one aspect, but there are so many other ways of looking at the use of an object. So if you think of an object as somehow a placeholder for a thought, and if you think of an object as having poetic or narrative qualities, and if you place one object next to another object next to another object, how that can be a staging for some kind of narrative. There are other ways of looking at the use of objects.\n\nAB: Sure.\n\nBB: And those ways of looking at objects may be a quieter, less flashy way of thinking about the use of objects, and because it hasn\u2019t been argued as loudly, it becomes somehow pushed to the side about commodity exchange. I think it\u2019s important to remember that there are aspects about your work, Jeff, that are not about commodity critique. It\u2019s about the poetic quality of objects and the way when you isolate an object, or when you place one object next to another one, the ricochet of meaning that takes place. It\u2019s important to remember those things and discuss those things, because I think other arguments \u2014 particularly culture in relation to money \u2014 those things get pushed away.", "title": "The Artists Who Defined the East Village\u2019s Avant-Garde Scene", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "In 2009, Turkey\u2019s tax ministry imposed a $2.5 billion fine for alleged tax evasion on Dogan Yayin, a media conglomerate whose newspapers and television stations were critical of the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Under financial and political pressure, the company began unloading some assets and closing others. Last month, the billionaire Aydin Dogan sold his remaining media properties, including the influential Hurriyet newspaper and CNN Turk, to a group of Erdogan loyalists.\n\nModern authoritarians rarely seize critical newspapers or TV stations outright. Instead, they use state power to pressure critics and reward friends. As Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, professors at Harvard, wrote in their recent book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d President Vladimir Putin of Russia turned the tax authorities on Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of an independent television network, NTV, which was considered bothersome. Gusinsky eventually signed NTV over to a government-controlled company. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuelan authorities accused Guillermo Zuloaga, owner of Globovisi\u00f3n, a TV station frequently critical of the government, of illegal profiteering. In 2013, Zuloaga sold Globovisi\u00f3n to allies of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nNow Donald Trump is going after Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post.\n\nThe president\u2019s latest round of anti-Amazon tweets began last Thursday, when Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Amazon pays \u201clittle or no taxes to state & local governments\u201d and that the United States Postal Service loses money on Amazon deliveries. On Saturday, he wrote that The Washington Post should be forced to \u201cREGISTER\u201d as an Amazon lobbyist. On Monday, he warned that Amazon may soon have to pay more for its deliveries: \u201cOnly fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s antipathy has already affected Amazon\u2019s fortunes. He threatened the company during the presidential campaign, and, as Forbes reported, Amazon\u2019s stock plunged more than 6 percent after he won. Last Wednesday, after Axios reported that Trump was \u201cobsessed\u201d with Amazon, the company lost $53 billion in market value.

Until the current turmoil, the latter groups have supported and legitimized the regime in the name of social peace and economic stability. Nicaragua indeed has been one of the most stable countries in the region, relatively free of the gang violence and drugs that have plagued other Central American nations. The price, however, is just too high.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Ortega is now experiencing a terminal crisis as Anastasio Somoza Debayle did, or whether these protests are the beginning of the end. But he is certainly facing a new reality. Government repression of popular protests has killed more than 30 to date, including one journalist, Angel Gahona, whose murder \u2014 like that of the ABC correspondent Bill Stewart in 1979 \u2014 was horrifically captured on video and broadcast around the world.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before. During the 20th century, three Somozas systematically violated human rights and used their state control to enrich themselves and their cronies. Despite the abuses, Nicaragua\u2019s traditional elite (the country is one of the poorest and most unequal in the hemisphere) mostly acquiesced to the dictatorship because it promised stability and implemented economic policies favorable to their interests. In exchange, the Somozas asked not to have their power challenged. To put it crudely, Somoza may well have used the following motto: \u201cMake yourselves rich, but stay out of politics.\u201d\n\nThis model, which the current regime has studiously emulated, turned out to be a recipe for tragedy. The Somozas\u2019 United States-backed military dictatorship did bring four decades of relative peace to a country with a long history of revolutions and civil wars. But that stability came at the price of closing all political avenues for change. Thus, when Nicaraguans decided that they had enough, they saw no other way out but the violent overthrow of the dictatorship.\n\nConfronted with an insurrectionary population, Mr. Somoza \u2014 the last of his clan \u2014 refused to resign, opting instead to hold on via brute force. In the run-up to his overthrow in July 1979, roughly 40,000 Nicaraguans lost their lives.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nAccording to most estimates, there are more than 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the United States, and it seems as if you can find some version of beef and broccoli at almost all of them: velvety wok-fried meat in brown sauce, served in a forest of green. The dish has been part of the Chinese-American restaurant-food canon since at least the 1950s, a few decades after broccoli first rode to popular heights on the backs of the southern Italian immigrants who championed it on our shores. The dish is a standard at high-end restaurants and scruffy takeout shops alike, wherever there is a market for the sweet-salty-crisp flavors that Americans claim as a birthright.\n\nBut it would be a trial to find such a dish in China. \u201cIt\u2019s diaspora food,\u201d said Jonathan Wu, who until it closed recently was the chef at the elegant dim-sum bar Nom Wah Tu on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, \u201ca genre unto itself.\u201d Wu, an American of Chinese descent, ate the dish a lot when he was growing up outside Hartford, a home-cooked variety in which his mom reversed the proportions to provide a lot more broccoli and rice than beef. The broccoli was his favorite part, he said, lightly tossed in a wok that never got very hot on her electric-coil stove, and mixed with a sauce she never thickened beyond its base of pungent oyster cut through with soy. \u201cShe kept it simple,\u201d he said. \u201cStreamlined.\u201d\n\nThat happens to be excellent advice for anyone who believes that home-cooked takeout-style beef and broccoli can trump the white-carton delivery variety. Inspired, I found myself cooking a version of Wu\u2019s mother\u2019s recipe for beef and broccoli not three hours after talking to him. On his advice, I trimmed chuck steak and cut it against the grain into strips, then stirred them into a marinade of rice wine, soy sauce and cornstarch. It clung to the beef, a kind of lustrous cloak. I cut broccoli into florets and planked the stems, just as his mother did, and made a sauce out of three others: Wu\u2019s oyster and soy, and a little chile-garlic for zip.\n\nThe result was a heady miracle for a family that somehow always believes that the food coming on the bicycle, being handed through the Plexiglas shield, served from the steam table in the corner of the airport will be excellent, though it never really is. The two little Michelin inspectors who eat my food every night gave it two stars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI thought: Two stars is great. [Pause] I was looking for three.\n\nIn search of improvement, I considered the lead of the antic, puckish chef Danny Bowien, of Mission Chinese in New York and San Francisco, who put a recipe for beef and broccoli into his 2015 cookbook. He built the dish on a foundation of braised beef cheeks and Chinese broccoli adorned in smoked oyster sauce. But the beef cheeks alone took the better part of a day. The smoked oyster sauce was like building a rocket. I looked at the other end of the spectrum as well, at chain-restaurant copycat recipes, considering the shiny slurries of cornstarch, soy and mirin that are meant to evoke the sugary sauce on the beef and broccolis served at PF Chang\u2019s and Panda Express. I don\u2019t love the food at those restaurants. I hated the slurries.\n\nPhoto\n\nI called Dale Talde, chef at Talde in Brooklyn, where he cooks a kind of Asian-American food that he calls \u201cproudly inauthentic.\u201d His advice was immediate and emphatic: \u201cPut a pat of butter in the sauce right at the end of the cooking. No one\u2019s going to notice, but it\u2019ll tone down the sodium and give you a gloss that\u2019s there, but not there like that weird gloss you get with cornstarch.\u201d I responded, \u201cButter in your Chinese food?\u201d Talde said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you.\u201d", "title": "The Best Beef and Broccoli, No Delivery Required", "authors": ["Sam Sifton"]}

Unpredictable from start to finish, \u201cThe Lobster\u201d is a barbed satire, poking at our social conventions.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Interstellar\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 5\n\nApril 5 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNo modern filmmaker has been as adept as director Christopher Nolan at turning personal obsessions into international box-office sensations. \u201cInterstellar\u201d is one of his most straightforward, crowd-pleasing pictures, starring Matthew McConaughey as a NASA pilot who takes part in a last-ditch mission to save humanity by exploring a wormhole. Yet even this film is unapologetically brainy, filled with speculative science and philosophical debates about human nature. As always, Nolan finds ways to make the cerebral viscerally exciting.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u201810 Cloverfield Lane\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 6\n\nApril 6 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe second film from producer J.J. Abrams\u2019s science-fiction-horror franchise \u201cCloverfield\u201d (and, so far, the best), \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a woman held captive by two men, played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr., who claim they\u2019re keeping her safe from a massive global attack. The heroine tries to figure out the real truth at the same time the audience does, in a tense, twisty movie that \u2014 like the other entries in this series \u2014 looks at a possibly world-ending catastrophe from a narrower, human perspective.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Speed\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 7\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nReleased at a time when seemingly every action movie was trying (and failing), to copy \u201cDie Hard,\u201d this 1994 thriller offered a winning variation on the \u201ccapable loner outsmarts the genius terrorist\u201d formula, adding humor and a strong hook. Dennis Hopper plays a madman who rigs a Los Angeles city bus with a bomb that will explode if the vehicle drops below 50 miles per hour. Keanu Reeves plays a cop who partners with a plucky passenger (played by Sandra Bullock) to keep everyone onboard from blowing up. With its unpretentious direction by Jan de Bont and a taut script by Graham Yost, \u201cSpeed\u201d remains a prime example of how to turn a simple premise into something awesome.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Iron Giant\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 12\n\nApril 12 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore he directed Pixar\u2019s massive hits \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d and \u201cRatatouille,\u201d Brad Bird directed this heartfelt, heartbreaking animated adaptation of the children\u2019s book by Ted Hughes. Although it flopped in theaters, \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d has since become a cult favorite. A thrilling story about a boy who befriends an towering alien robot, the movie is a mediation on what it means to be hero, and it is also a catalogue of Bird\u2019s pop-culture obsessions \u2014 from old Superman cartoons to pulp magazines.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\u201cBaby Mama\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Bourne Identity\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Bourne Legacy\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d (April 1), \u201cElizabeth\u201d (April 1), \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (April 1), \u201cKnocked Up\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Meddler\u201d (April 1), \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d (April 15), \u201cMonty Python: Live at the Hollywood Bowl\u201d (April 15), \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Life of Brian\u201d (April 15) and \u201cGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\u201d (April 30).\n\n\u2014\n\nNew Netflix Original Movies\n\n\u20186 Balloons\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 6\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe accomplished young comic actors Abbi Jacobson and Dave Franco play against type in the writer-director Marja-Lewis Ryan\u2019s \u201c6 Balloons,\u201d an edgy drama about the stress of dealing with a loved one who\u2019s hooked on drugs. Franco is a heroin addict suffering through a relapse and Jacobson is the hyper-organized, straight-laced sister who spends one long, tense day trying to get him the help he needs while also making sure that his life isn\u2019t totally upended \u2014 two goals that aren\u2019t necessarily compatible.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Come Sunday\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the best performances of his long, accomplished career in \u201cCome Sunday,\u201d playing the real-life evangelical minister Carlton Pearson, who in the early 2000s began preaching \u201cthe Gospel of Inclusion,\u201d arguing that Jesus Christ has saved everyone regardless of a person\u2019s religious beliefs. Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Mercury 13\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 20\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space, a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to the so-called Mercury Seven. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary \u201cMercury 13\u201d is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers .\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Week Of\u2019\n\nSarts streaming: April 27\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFor the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there\u2019s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best \u2014 in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler\u2019s old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids\u2019 wedding.

Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who hole up in a seaside hotel in France in the mid-1970s, hoping to rekindle their relationship, but they mostly retreat to their separate corners. That changes when they discover a hole in the wall and start spying on the newlyweds next door.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Elizabeth\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 1\n\nApril 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nHistorical accuracy bends \u2014 and then cracks, and then shatters into a million pieces \u2014 in this 1998 costume drama, which conceives the rise to power of Elizabeth I as a tale of diabolical cunning and feminine resolve. Although \u201cElizabeth\u201d brings a conspicuously modern perspective to events that took place in the 16th century, the film works as a stylish vehicle for Cate Blanchett, then a largely unknown actress who put herself firmly on the map with this film. Blanchett plays Elizabeth as a political na\u00eff who grows into the role quickly and sees power as a means toward personal happiness.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Pride & Prejudice\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nJane Austen aficionados may blanch at the surface-level sleekness of this 2005 adaptation from Joe Wright, which couldn\u2019t be further from the six-hour BBC standard from a decade earlier. But taken on its own terms, \u201cPride & Prejudice\u201d is a fetching, romantic drama that still does justice to its source. Wright emphasizes the humble, mud-caked state of the Bennet home, which will collapse entirely if they fail to marry off their five daughters, including the headstrong Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who doesn\u2019t want her suitors chosen for her. Her suspicion of the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), however, yields to more complicated feelings over time.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt may have been no more than a glorified PowerPoint presentation, but the 2006 documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d grossed $50 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, won an Oscar for best documentary and forcefully advanced the debate on climate change, even if its arguments wound up meeting stiff political headwinds. Al Gore returns for a victory lap of sorts with \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,\u201d which underlines the prescience of the first film while looking toward innovative solutions to a growing crisis. New movie, same formula: A terrifying glimpse of the coming eco-apocalypse, brightened with a glimmer of hope.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Killing of a Sacred Deer\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 5\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Greek social satirist Yorgos Lanthimos follows up \u201cThe Lobster\u201d with another beguiling oddity about the dark mysteries of human behavior. Colin Farrell again stars as a wealthy surgeon who enters into a friendship with a disturbed young man (Barry Keoghan) in an effort to seek redemption for a past mishap on the operating table. But when the surgeon brings him home and introduces him to his wife (Nicole Kidman) and two children, the stranger\u2019s behavior gets more threatening and compels him to make some desperate decisions. Shot with the antiseptic chill of a Michael Haneke or Stanley Kubrick production, \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d nonetheless relieves the horror with inspired bursts of black comedy.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Florida Project\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 6\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSet around a purple motel in Kissimmee, Fla., a tourist trap in the shadow of Disney World, \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d focuses on characters who can barely make the rent week-to-week, much less afford a trip to the Mouse House or take advantage of the cacophonous helicopter tours that take off nearby. Told mainly through the eyes of a six-year-old (Brooklynn Prince) who\u2019s living with an unstable single mother (Bria Vinaite), the film is heartbreaking at times, but it is also rambunctious and funny, like a cross between \u201cDennis the Menace\u201d and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cSmall Change.\u201d As a put-upon yet compassionate apartment manager, Willem Dafoe embodies its unique soul.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Nice Guys\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOnce upon a time, Shane Black was Hollywood\u2019s hottest screenwriter, parlaying his standard-setting buddy comedy \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d into big paydays on \u201cThe Last Boy Scout,\u201d \u201cLast Action Hero\u201d and \u201cThe Long Kiss Goodnight.\u201d But his rebirth as a writer-director in the 2000s has brought out the noir-inflected wordplay (and smarm) that always lurked in his scripts, starting with the brilliant \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d and continuing with \u201cThe Nice Guys,\u201d which reimagines a \u201cChinatown\u201d-type scenario as a bloody, sleazy, knockabout buddy picture. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry as a knuckle-breaker and a private eye who tackle a conspiracy that\u2019s bigger than they can handle.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Monty Python and the Holy Grail\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 15\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix is releasing a huge amount of Monty Python-related content on April 15, including the religious satire \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Life of Brian,\u201d the legendary TV series \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d and a host of live shows and supplementary materials. The most popular of the bunch is \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail,\u201d an irreverent goof on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, with additional commentary on the miseries of medieval life and the absurdities of mythmaking itself. Few films have been quoted as religiously, so rewatch value is high.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Loving Vincent\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 16\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nEvery year, the Oscar nominees for Best Animated Feature include a couple of offbeat selections from outside Hollywood, and in 2017, one of those was \u201cLoving Vincent,\u201d a biopic about the life of Vincent van Gogh. What sets the film apart, however, is that it is the first fully painted animated feature: Each of its 65,000 frames is an oil painting rendered in van Gogh\u2019s unmistakable postimpressionist style, a venture that required 125 painters working at an excruciatingly slow pace. The story focuses on a letter delivered to the last place van Gogh lived and an investigation into what happened during those final days.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Conjuring 2\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 30\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nDirector James Wan made the seventh \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d movie between the horror movies \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and its sequel, but he didn\u2019t modulate his style from one to the next in the least \u2014 lending a distinct blockbuster maximalism to the \u201cConjuring\u201d movies, in a genre that usually operates on a much smaller scale. \u201cThe Conjuring 2\u201d runs an absurd 133 minutes, but the ghost-busting adventures of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) rarely flag as they take on a vicious old spirit that has possessed a London home. As in the first entry, the Warrens have a strong, lived-in chemistry and Wan treats the haunted house like demented carnival ride of jump scares and demonic gizmos.\n\nNew Netflix Original Films\n\n\u2018Amateur\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 6\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe writer-director Ryan Koo, who founded the D.I.Y. indie website No Film School, makes his directorial debut with what sounds like a fictionalized version of \u201cHoop Dreams,\u201d following the long-shot dreams of an 8th grade basketball prospect from the inner city. Funded by a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, \u201cAmateur\u201d stars Michael Rainey Jr. as a 13-year-old guard whose dazzling skills lead to a viral video and recruitment to an elite prep school, where his new coach (Josh Charles) offers himself as mentor and father figure. But at this early stop on the road to professional hoops, the possibilities for exploitation and mismanagement far exceed the odds of making millions down the line.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Psychokinesis\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 25\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe South Korean director Yeon Sang-ho scored a massive hit in his home country with his 2016 horror-thriller \u201cTrain to Busan,\u201d which distinguished itself from other zombie movies by having the undead hordes gobble up passengers on a bullet train through an apocalyptic setting. Yeon\u2019s new film, \u201cPsychokinesis,\u201d arrives straight to Netflix after debuting in Korea in late January. It is another genre picture, but this time, Yeon tackles the superhero action comedy, following an ordinary man who discovers he can manipulate matter with his mind.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Week Of\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 27\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWith the notable exception of Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),\u201d Adam Sandler\u2019s multi-picture deal with Netflix has yielded some of his worst lowbrow comedies, including \u201cThe Ridiculous 6,\u201d \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d and \u201cSandy Wexler.\u201d Yet there\u2019s reason to hope that \u201cThe Week of\u201d may be an improvement, based on Sandler\u2019s chemistry with his co-star Chris Rock and the gifted co-writer and director Robert Smigel, best known as the puppeteer behind Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog. \u201cThe Week of\u201d stars Sandler and Rock as fathers of clashing temperament who scramble to marry off their children to each other.\n\nNetflix Original Series\n\n\u2018AMO\u2019: Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: April 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nVeterans of the international film festival circuit will likely do a double-take in learning that Netflix has picked up a series from the Filipino director Brillante Mendoza, one of the current cinema\u2019s most prolific and reliably controversial figures. And yet here\u2019s \u201cAMO,\u201d a 13-episode crime drama about a high-school student (Vince Rillon) who sells crystal meth in a country that, under the iron-fisted rule of President Rodrigo Duterte, has brutalized drug dealers. With the street-level grittiness of previous work like \u201cMa\u2019Rosa,\u201d \u201cKinatay,\u201d and \u201cSerbis,\u201d Mendoza seeks to reveal the human stakes of Duterte\u2019s continuing drug war.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Lost in Space\u2019: Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: April 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe list of screenwriting credits for Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless \u2014 \u201cDracula Untold,\u201d \u201cThe Last Witch Hunter,\u201d \u201cGods of Egypt\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t necessarily portend great things for their reboot of the 1965 science fiction series. But Netflix has been leaning heavily on sci-fi-action and nostalgia projects lately, and the service is investing a fortune into Sazama and Sharpless\u2019s revised take on the Robinson family and how they adjust to being stranded on an alien planet. The unnamed robot still says \u201cDanger, Will Robinson,\u201d but based on its appearance alone, the kitsch of the old series has been dialed back completely.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Letdown\u2019: Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: April 21\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOn top of its originals, Netflix has been casting out for choice imports, too, and the Australian series \u201cThe Letdown\u201d looks like its answer to the domestic chaos of Amazon\u2019s British series \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d The co-creator and co-writer Alison Bell stars as an uncertain mother who starts attending a support group for new parents but discovers that the moderator (Noni Hazlehurst) doesn\u2019t treat her charges gently.

In this 2003 film, Zellweger plays a tomboyish woman in the beautiful mountains of rural North Carolina who goes to live with a lonely neighbor (Nicole Kidman) who\u2019s waiting for her husband (Jude Law) to come back from the Civil War.

In the original animated film, a boy named Hogarth finds the large robot from outer space during the paranoia-filled age of the Cold War. He is forced to keep his new best friend a secret even though the giant comes in peace. Unloved at the box office during its first run, \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d later gained a devoted following and helped get its director, Brad Bird, into Pixar Studios, where he went on to make \u201cThe Incredibles.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Roberto Benigni, Giorgio Cantarini and Nicoletta Braschi in \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d Sergio Strizzi/Miramax Films\n\n\u2018Life Is Beautiful\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn this three-time Oscar-winner (one of which resulted in this moment), a Jewish Italian father tries to protect his young son from the horrors of a concentration camp after they are captured by Nazis.

Written by Oliver Stone, the film follows the ruthless Cuban gangster Tony Montana as he climbs his way up from being a low-level hood to ruling a slice of the Miami drug scene in the decadent \u201980s. In his perverted sense of the American dream, nothing is off limits. It\u2019s a mentality that eventually leads to so many scenes of violence and drug use that it makes \u201cMiami Vice\u201d look like a kid\u2019s show.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix Original TV Series\n\nA scene from \u201cChef\u2019s Table: Pastry.\u201d Martin Westlake/Netflix\n\n\u2018Chef\u2019s Table: Pastry\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: April 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nTV\u2019s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar\u2019s Christina Tosi, Room 4\u2019s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca\u2019s Jordi Roca and Caff\u00e8 Sicilia\u2019s Corrado Assenza.

Unfortunately, leaving the mob is harder than breaking a marriage, and Angela is left to defend for herself from gangsters and the feds. The premise sounds bleak, but \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is a lively Jonathan Demme romantic comedy that gives Pfeiffer a chance to play for laughs.

Their jealousy drives them to dark magic, which has some interesting physical side effects. \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d has a lighthearted, macabre sense of humor, full of morbid slapstick stunts and neck-twisting pratfalls.

He has warned congressional Republicans about the possibility of withdrawing from Nafta altogether if they refuse to vote for it \u2014 which, until recently, the Trump administration had used to force concessions from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThose warnings have not been well received among congressional Republicans. Farm and border-state Republicans are already deeply unsettled by the president\u2019s tariff threats on China, which has resulted in a tit-for-tat by Beijing that would hurt exports from their communities, including agricultural products like soybeans, pork and wheat.

Some have urged the president to move prudently, reminding him how many of his voters live in agriculture states, but more of them are reluctant to confront him and simply hope he backs off those threats as he has on other issues.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and majority whip, made clear that the Senate would not simply rubber-stamp any deal that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade team strikes and lamented that the administration had kept lawmakers largely in the dark.\n\n\u201cI regret that the administration has not been communicating very well what they are negotiating and I hope they come up with something that we can pass out of here, because I think Nafta is pretty important,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.\n\nIf the president were to carry through on a threat to withdraw from the deal to force a vote in Congress, lawmakers could fight back, congressional aides said. Lawmakers could pass legislation that alters the president\u2019s authority to impose tariffs and other trade measures \u2014 or create laws to more clearly define the process for the United States to leave trade agreements.\n\nTop Republicans in the House also expressed trepidation on Wednesday about a Nafta resolution.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the likelihood of such a deal passing in the House \u201cdepends on the quality of the agreement.\u201d\n\nMr. Brady, a staunch ally of Mr. Trump during the tax overhaul last year, has been critical of the president\u2019s tariff threats. He said that he had encouraged Mr. Trump to deliver an agreement that bolstered American jobs, exports and economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard different summaries of where they might be headed and we\u2019re weighing in,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful and cautiously optimistic.\u201d", "title": "The Biggest Nafta Hurdle Now May Be Congress", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Alan Rappeport"]}

He worked with a Colombian who was later convicted of money laundering. Mr. Nogueira told NBC News last year that he sold about half of his Trump condos to Russians, including some connected to the Russian mafia, and that some of his clients had \u201cquestionable backgrounds.\u201d\n\nThree years later, as Reuters has reported, Panamanian authorities arrested Mr. Nogueira on charges of fraud and forgery unrelated to the Trump project. After getting out on bail, he fled to Brazil, where he faces a separate money-laundering investigation. In 2014, he fled Brazil, too.\n\nThe Trumps typically claim to be passive partners in projects like Trump Ocean Club and that they had minimal dealings with the likes of Mr. Nogueira. (The chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, has said that no one in the Trump family remembers meeting or speaking to Mr. Nogueira. But there are photos of Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka with Mr. Nogueira.) Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s limited public disclosures reveal his company has earned millions from licensing fees, a percentage of property sales and management fees in foreign projects. And the Trump family was sometimes personally involved in everything from a project\u2019s design to its d\u00e9cor.\n\nThat appears to have been the case with the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a high-end residence and hotel that has yet to open. In 2012, the Trumps signed a licensing agreement with the local developer, Anar Mammadov \u2014 the son of the country\u2019s billionaire transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov, who an American diplomat once described in cables published by WikiLeaks as \u201cnotoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization has said that it conducted an extensive due-diligence review of Anar Mammadov and that questions about the source of his wealth surfaced after they signed the deal. Presumably, Mr. Mueller will want to see evidence of that.\n\nIn Vancouver, the Trump Organization partnered with the son of Tony Tiah Thee Kian, a Malaysian oligarch who was convicted of providing a false report to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. That project, which was guided by Ivanka Trump and is one of the few Trump-branded properties to open since Mr. Trump took office, is now the subject of an F.B.I. counterintelligence inquiry, according to CNN. Mr. Garten, the Trump chief legal officer, told CNN: \u201cThe company\u2019s role was and is limited to licensing its brand and managing the hotel. Accordingly, the company would have had no involvement in the financing of the project or the sale of units.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether Mr. Mueller will investigate these deals, or already is. But a comprehensive investigation could raise questions about the Trump Organization\u2019s compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which \u2014 according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice \u2014 makes it a crime for a United States company to act with willful blindness toward the corrupt activities of a foreign business partner.", "title": "Opinion | The Business Deals That Could Imperil Trump", "authors": []}

In recent weeks, three Democratic senators (and likely presidential contenders) \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 have either expressed their approval of the idea or unveiled initial ideas about how an updated version could work.\n\nThey are building on the legacy of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, introduced in the 1970s by Senator Hubert Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Augustus Hawkins, Democrat of California.

It demonstrates that all these seemingly disparate attitudes are principally caused by just two factors: individuals\u2019 innate psychological predispositions to intolerance (\u201cauthoritarianism\u201d) interacting with changing conditions of societal threat.\n\nLooked at this way, recent developments experienced by many voters as alarming \u2014 including the financial collapse of 2008, the surge of third-world immigration in the United States and Europe and continuing fears among traditionalists that the social order is under assault \u2014 have fueled authoritarianism:\n\nThe threatening conditions, resonant particularly in the present political climate, that exacerbate authoritarian attitudes include at least the perception of civil dissent and unrest, loss of confidence in social institutions, unpopularity of leaders on both sides of politics, divisive presidential campaigns, internal or external crises that undermine national pride or confidence, national economic downturn and rapidly rising crime rates.\n\nIn an email, Stenner provided figures from a recent EuroPulse survey showing that authoritarianism is stronger in the United States than it is in the European Union: In the E.U., 33 percent of the electorate can be described as authoritarian, while in the United States, it\u2019s 45 percent.\n\nThe animosity between authoritarians and non-authoritarians has helped establish what Johnston, Lavine and Federico describe as the \u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of policy choices:\n\nIn this view, the influence of personality on economic opinion arises not because the expected outcomes of a policy match an individual\u2019s traits, but because those traits resonate with the social meaning a policy has acquired.\n\nThey explain further:\n\nCitizens care less about the outcomes a policy produces and more about the groups and symbols with which a policy is associated.\n\nMason enlarged on this argument in her 2015 paper, \u201c\u2018I Disrespectfully Agree\u2019: The Differential Effects of Partisan Sorting on Behavioral and Issue Polarization.\u201d Her argument is a direct challenge to those who take, as she puts it,\n\nan instrumental view of politics, in which people choose a party and decide how strongly to support it based solely on each party\u2019s stated positions and whether the party shares interests with them.\n\nInstead, she writes,\n\nContrary to an issue-focused view of political decision making and behavior, the results presented here suggest that political thought, behavior, and emotion are powerfully driven by political identities. The strength of a person\u2019s identification with his or her party affects how biased, active, and angry that person is, even if that person\u2019s issue positions are moderate.\n\nWhile much of this research uses the \u201cpreferred traits in child-rearing\u201d questions to measure authoritarianism, two sociologists at the University of Kansas, David Norman Smith and Eric Hanley, observe in \u201cThe Anger Games: Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Election, and Why?\u201d that those questions do not capture the full scope of authoritarianism, especially the more aggressive authoritarianism that they believe drives voters to Trump.\n\nSmith and Hanley used what they call a \u201cdomineering leader scale\u201d to measure\n\nthe wish for a strong leader who will force others to submit.

The desire for a domineering leader is the desire to see this evil crushed.\n\nThe domineering leader scale is based on responses to two statements: \u201cOur country will be great if we honor the ways of our forefathers, do what the authorities tell us to do, and get rid of the \u2018rotten apples\u2019 who are ruining everything\u201d and \u201cWhat our country really needs is a strong, determined leader who will crush evil and take us back to our true path.\u201d\n\nIf an aggressive, domineering authoritarianism is a prime motivator for many Trump supporters, as Smith and Hanley contend, the clash between Republicans and Democrats is likely to become more hostile and warlike.\n\nFederico, Feldman and Weber note that\n\nsince the early 2000s, many especially acrimonious political debates have focused on threats to social stability and order \u2014 debates surrounding abortion, transgender rights, immigration, and the role of the federal government in protecting the rights of marginalized social groups.\n\nThe rising \u201csalience of these debates,\u201d they write, \u201chas contributed to a growing \u2018authoritarian divide\u2019 within the United States, at least among White Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump has purposefully exacerbated the \u201cmany especially acrimonious political debates\u201d now dominating public discourse, deepening not only the authoritarian divide, but the divide between open and closed mindedness, between acceptance and racial resentment, and between toleration of and aversion to change. He evidently believes that this is the best political strategy for presiding in the White House and winning re-election, but it is an extraordinarily destructive strategy for governing the country and for safeguarding America\u2019s interests in the world.", "title": "Opinion | The Contract With Authoritarianism", "authors": []}

A retrial typically looks much like the first go-round. But in this case, the #MeToo era began between the two trials. So the second trial has become a litmus test of the movement\u2019s impact. Because the jury convicted this time around, it is tempting to think that #MeToo is already improving the criminal justice system\u2019s notoriously poor handling of sexual violence.\n\nI would urge caution about generalizing in this way. In many respects, this was no ordinary sexual assault prosecution. The case featured a celebrity and dozens of accusers. The two trials involved different witnesses, different lawyers and different jurors. Even with these caveats, I do see the conviction as a mark of progress \u2014 progress that is best understood in relation to the work of #MeToo.\n\nFirst, Andrea Constand, the main accuser in the case, was believed. She did not face the \u201ccredibility discounting\u201d that usually confronts women who make allegations of sexual assault and harassment. As I have described in a recent paper, police officers, prosecutors and jurors tend to default to doubt when evaluating the credibility of an accuser. Even abundantly corroborated allegations of sexual assault may not result in prosecution, much less conviction. Credibility discounting helps to explain research showing that sexual assault very rarely results in criminal justice accountability.\n\n#MeToo offers a much needed corrective. While not all allegations are true, of course, starting from a position of not believing women who allege sexual assault reflects a widely held set of misconceptions and biases. The defense in the Cosby trial revived many of those tired tropes of lying women, but this time, the jury rejected them. This suggests that we are recalibrating our judgments about who to believe.", "title": "Opinion | The Cosby Jury Finally Believes the Women", "authors": []}

Both have argued that such spending is counterproductive and wasteful, and that eligibility must be tightened for programs including food stamps and Medicaid. Mr. Trump and House Republicans have also asserted that welfare benefits are far too generous, and work requirements much too lax.\n\nYet as is so often the case, the reality is much different from what the political rhetoric says. The United States has the weakest safety net among the Western industrialized nations, devoting far fewer resources as a percentage of gross domestic product to welfare programs than do other wealthy countries.\n\nPartly as a result, a majority of Americans will experience poverty during their lives, and America\u2019s rate of poverty consistently ranks at or near the top in international comparisons. Rather than slashing anti-poverty programs, the fiscally prudent question to ask is: How much does this high rate of poverty cost our nation in dollars and cents?\n\nClearly, poverty extracts a heavy toll upon those who fall into its ranks, particularly children.

The clustering of talent, industry, investment, and other economic assets in small parts of cities and metropolitan areas is at once the main engine of economic growth and the biggest driver of inequality.

Walmart stores already offer pharmacy services and attract older people.\n\nIn addition, the proposed $69 billion merger between CVS Health, which operates 1,100 MinuteClinics, and Aetna, the giant insurer, would expand the customer bases of both.

And the wealth of data mined from consolidation would provide the companies with a map for steering people one way or another.\n\nOn top of these corporate partnerships, Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway decided to join forces to develop some sort of health care strategy for their employees, expressing frustration with the current state of medical care. Their announcement, and Amazon\u2019s recent forays into these fields, are rattling everyone from major hospital networks to pharmacists.\n\nDoctors, too, are watching the evolution warily.\n\n\u201cWith all of these deals, there is so much we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Michael Munger, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cAre Aetna patients going to be mandated to go to a CVS MinuteClinic?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConstant Changes in Care\n\nDr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician in Warrington, Pa., has watched patients leave. Parents who once brought their children to her to treat an ear infection or check for strep, services whose profits helped offset some of the treatments she offered, are now visiting the retail clinics or urgent care centers.\n\nWhat is worse, some patients haven\u2019t been getting the right care. \u201cSome of the patients with coughs were being treated with codeine-based medicines, which is not appropriate at all for this age group,\u201d Dr. Kressly said.\n\nEven doctors unfazed by patients going elsewhere at night or on weekends are nervous about the entry of the corporate behemoths.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t advertise on NBC,\u201d said Dr. Shawn Purifoy, who practices family medicine in Malvern, Ark. \u201cCVS can.\u201d\n\nNurse practitioners allow Dr. Purifoy to offer more same-day appointments; he and two other practices in town take turns covering emergency phone calls at night.\n\nAnd doctors keep facing new waves of competition.

Consumers who not long ago would have taken a cough drop or gargled with saltwater to soothe a sore throat now pop into their nearby retail clinic for a strep test.\n\nFrustration with the nation\u2019s health care system has fueled a lot of the recent partnerships.

Brennan, the chief medical officer for CVS. The company hopes its proposed merger with Aetna will allow it to transform its current clinics, where a nurse practitioner might offer a flu shot, into a place where patients can have their conditions monitored. \u201cIt requires new and different work by the nurse practitioners,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Brennan said CVS was not looking to replace patients\u2019 primary care doctors. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to buy up an entire layer of primary care,\u201d he said.\n\nBut people will have the option of using the retail clinic to make sure their hypertension or diabetes is well controlled, with tests and counseling provided as well as medications. The goal is to reduce the cost of care for what would otherwise be very expensive conditions, Dr. Brennan said.\n\nIf the company\u2019s merger with Aetna goes through, CVS will initially expand in locations where Aetna has a significant number of customers who could readily go to CVS, Dr. Brennan said.\n\nPhoto\n\nUnitedHealth has also been aggressively making inroads, adding a large medical practice in December and roughly doubling the number of areas where its OptumCare doctors will be to 75 markets in the United States. It is also experimenting with putting its MedExpress urgent care clinics into Walgreens stores.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBig hospital groups are also eroding primary care practices: They employed 43 percent of the nation\u2019s primary care doctors in 2016, up from 23 percent in 2010. They are also aggressively opening up their own urgent care centers, in part to try to ensure a steady flow of patients to their facilities.\n\nHCA Healthcare, the for-profit hospital chain, doubled its number of urgent care centers last year to about 100, according to Merchant Medicine.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "Desperation focuses the mind. As the elections loom, Republicans must resist the impulse to become full-time campaigners instead of legislators. That would only reinforce the public perception of Congress as a dysfunctional mess and incumbents as swamp-dwellers more concerned with their political survival (and self-enrichment) than with the national welfare.\n\nInstead, the party should approach the elections under the banner of an ambitious program to bring economic revival to the working class. The starting point for such a program would be Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign-trail commitment to rebuild our decaying national infrastructure \u2014 including the roads, schools, hospitals and other civic assets that have been squeezed by conservative cutbacks.\n\nA Trump New Deal could also include other elements with strong appeal to working-class voters, such as vigorous support for universal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare (as opposed to means-tested programs that benefit only the poor), robust wage subsidies, a generous child care tax credit and apprenticeship programs linked to specific high-skilled jobs. Republicans might also consider a national version of a California proposal to make housing more affordable.\n\nA Republican campaigning on the back of a Trump New Deal could sell himself or herself as someone who shares the values of voters in the economically ravaged American heartland but who also has a real program to address their problems. It would be a lot more persuasive than just touting the magic of tax cuts.\n\nThe president would relish an initiative built around the most popular parts of his agenda; he might even find it in his self-interest to call Congress into a special session to pass it. Republicans running for re-election could present themselves as loyal to Mr. Trump\u2019s overarching goals while avoiding the president\u2019s toxic tweets and scandals. Democrats would be reluctant to give Mr. Trump a political win heading into the elections, but equally reluctant to offer him a legitimate opportunity to paint them as partisan obstructionists. Entrenched special interests would be outraged by any Republican move toward the economic center, but the Koch brothers and other big donors would still work for Republican majorities to supply the regulatory relief and conservative justices they crave.\n\nThe idea of a New Deal advanced by Republicans, even as unorthodox a Republican as Mr. Trump, sounds like alternate-reality science fiction. But historically the Republican Party has not been an organization with a fixed identity. Its transformation into a conservative ideological force began to take root only in the 1960s and took half a century to complete. It\u2019s hardly impossible for the party to move toward the economic center while continuing to embrace Trump-style cultural populism.\n\nPolitical scientists who specialize in what\u2019s called \u201crealignment theory\u201d point out that America\u2019s two main political parties have flipped constituencies and ideologies in the past. Before the New Deal, the Democrats were predominantly a rural, socially conservative agrarian party allied with a number of urban political machines, while Republicans were advocates of powerful government and the party of intellectuals, African-Americans and the native-born working class.", "title": "Opinion | The Dream of a Republican New Deal", "authors": []}

Or maybe everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, cable arrived at our home. And everything changed.\n\nWithin six months, we were hooked. But not in the way our peers were hooked. We lived in a suburb of New Orleans called Metairie, which offered cheap land and wide streets for families with young kids. On weekends, most of those kids rode their bikes and talked about \u201cStar Wars.\u201d And while we did some of that, we were more taken by other movies that HBO had to offer. What many people don\u2019t remember about the early days of HBO is that the programming wasn\u2019t exactly curated for the time of day it was airing. So, we\u2019d wake up on Saturday, start with a viewing of \u201cKramer vs. Kramer.\u201d Then we\u2019d roll right into \u201cGandhi,\u201d or \u201cOrdinary People.\u201d And then lighten the mood with \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d or \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice.\u201d Every now and then we\u2019d take in \u201cEvery Which Way but Loose,\u201d but mostly we were watching the hard-hitting dramas of the \u201970s and \u201980s. And we loved them. But not in a pretentious \u201cWe\u2019re more erudite than \u2018Star Wars\u2019\u201d kind of way. We just loved watching people emote, and we deeply connected with the spirits of those dealing with divorce, hunger, PTSD and death. It wasn\u2019t that we were morbid, we were just \u2014 into it.\n\nAround the same time, our dad brought home our first video camera. This was huge. Not metaphorically. Literally. The thing was a beast. And, like most dads in the \u201980s, he was terrible with electronics and couldn\u2019t figure out how to use it, so he basically left it in our hands. Jay, being the older-smarter-stronger one, picked up the manual and became the first one to figure it all out. (Mark: To this day, I do not know how to assemble anything, because Jay was always there to do it.) But he needed a second person to carry the separate videotape recorder (which attached to the camera via an enormous cable) and act in the \u201cfilms\u201d he was brewing. I got the job. And thus began the two-person filmmaking team known as the Duplass Brothers, circa 1985 (ages 12 and 8).\n\nNow, let\u2019s be clear. There are tales of the childhood films of the Coen Brothers and Steven Spielberg showing the seeds of the great filmmakers they would eventually become. Our films were not like those. Ours were dull, boring, uninspired and fairly stupid. We recreated \u201cThe Blob\u201d by throwing our beanbag down the stairs. We took a stab at remaking \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d by taking quick shots of an empty pair of shoes walking around our living room.\n\nEventually, however, we cracked our first narrative. The story of a young karate master whose home was invaded by a robber.

Many Commonwealth nations, notably India, would like more freedom of movement. In 1948, when British nationality was first formalized in law, British citizenship extended to more than 850 million people, either in the category \u201cCitizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\u201d or \u201cCommonwealth citizen.\u201d The latter designation included the people of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Pakistan, among others. As Professor Gurminder K. Bhambra of the University of Sussex, has pointed out, \u201cthe very imperial form was itself multicultural.\u201d So too was British citizenship.\n\nFor all politicians\u2019 talk about a family of nations, though, the archives of the Commonwealth Relations Office have decades\u2019 worth of papers revealing Britain\u2019s attempts to deter people of its former colonies from coming anywhere near the white cliffs of Dover. In the 1950s, the C.R.O. sent propaganda to the South Asian press claiming, \u201cToo many Indians and Pakistanis are coming to Britain.\u201d This was accompanied by warnings that jobs were scarce, rice was expensive and subcontinental clothing was inadequate for the climate of Yorkshire.\n\nThe earliest members of the Commonwealth were once called the \u201cWhite Dominions\u201d: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, South Africa and Newfoundland. Minus Ireland (firmly embedded in the European Union) and South Africa (no longer so white), these nations still form the basis of some Brexiteers\u2019 fantasies of creating a union around an \u201cAnglosphere\u201d or \u201cCanzuk.\u201d No doubt, the advocates of reviving Britain\u2019s links with Canada, Australia and New Zealand can cite myriad reasons that have nothing to do with racism to explain why South Africa, India, Pakistan or the Caribbean nations are just different. Still, majority-nonwhite nations will notice if they are treated as them rather than us, because this will not be the first time that has happened.\n\nThe Home Office is certainly capable of being hostile to migrants regardless of their skin color. Last year, around 100 European Union nationals, many of whom were white, received letters telling them to leave Britain or face deportation; the Home Office later said this had been a mistake. Even so, the Windrush scandal raises the question of whether Britain is still in denial about its own multicultural past.\n\nIn a radio interview this month, Shashi Tharoor, a member of India\u2019s Parliament, was blunt about the Commonwealth\u2019s prospects: \u201cYou really have only two choices now. One is reinvention and the other is burial.\u201d Reinvention in any more effective form would be a huge undertaking, requiring a great feat of imagination and diplomacy as well as cultural and political change \u2014 this at a time when British institutions will already be struggling to cope with Brexit. The Commonwealth does not seem minded to reinvent itself, either: Last week it acquiesced to the queen\u2019s \u201csincere wish\u201d that Prince Charles will one day inherit the nonhereditary position as its head.\n\nThe Windrush scandal reveals the complex reality of Britain\u2019s relationships with its former colonies.

And while her third book of personal insights, \u201cLook Alive Out There,\u201d is poised to continue this legacy, its one-liners do far heavier existential lifting than their predecessors. Where Crosley\u2019s first collections were dense with zingers made to deliver laughs, the most memorable lines in this one are built to break hearts. That reflects a similar shift in the author\u2019s storytelling priorities: Crosley has changed focus from the mild absurdities of day-to-day existence to quiet but universal devastations.\n\nIn \u201cOutside Voices,\u201d Crosley recalls the turmoil caused by the endless noise of an adolescent neighbor\u2019s 24/7 party. Crosley\u2019s self-deprecation is evident in clever but exaggerated metaphors that cast her as the beleaguered victim of teenage tyrants. When the neighbor, Jared, leaves the music on even while away, she casually notes it as \u201ca tactic generally employed by war criminals.\u201d She compares Jared\u2019s friends to \u201ccicadas without the bonus years of dormancy\u201d who were \u201cmultiplying like gremlins.\u201d This flippant incredulity in the story\u2019s setup only renders its true significance all the more gut-wrenching. When the teenagers go miraculously silent (\u201cHad my dreams of their alien abduction come true?\u201d), Crosley investigates from her window to find more than a handful of them dancing and laughing in the kitchen, Jared swooping in and, in seemingly one fluid motion, delighting one female friend by spinning and dipping her. \u201cAnd for a full minute, I was so in love with all of them, I almost couldn\u2019t stand it,\u201d Crosley writes to close the scene \u2014 conceding with genuine admiration that the actual terror inflicted by the young is the evidence they offer of how pure and big joy can be.\n\nImage\n\nIn \u201cThe Grape Man,\u201d Crosley reflects on the death of her downstairs neighbor Don, an older, single man who tended an elaborate garden outside his apartment. \u201cTo live alone can be a glorious thing. Between jags of crippling loneliness and wretched TV, it\u2019s an education in self-sufficiency, self-actualization and self-tanner. But it is possible to have too many rooms of one\u2019s own,\u201d Crosley remarks, with some regret for never having taken full inventory of this man\u2019s solitude. Don had occupied for her the strange and unlabeled space between the palpable, but mostly passive, affection between neighbors, and the solid, certain affections between actual friends. The essay\u2019s sadness derives not just from Don\u2019s isolation, but from the author\u2019s reminder that nearly everyone we know in some way occupies that same mysterious liminal space.\n\nCrosley remains inexorably funny, even as she uses her life and the lives she encounters to take on the heavier issues of aging, loneliness and mortality. Fans of Crosley\u2019s signature humor \u2014 a blend of upbeat and offbeat self-effacement \u2014 will not be disappointed. Her aforementioned one-liners remain as astute as they are austere, the wisdom she shares just as relatable. \u201cLook Alive Out There\u201d preserves Crosley\u2019s instinct to observe minutiae and uncover answers to universal questions, while introducing a new willingness to acknowledge that sometimes stories don\u2019t end with such neat answers. This realization is most apparent in \u201cRelative Stranger,\u201d wherein Crosley recounts a visit to her \u201cuncle\u201d Johnny, a distant cousin and retired adult film star whose singular focus on finding love never paid off. In a moment of heartbreaking clarity, he senses that Crosley might be on a similar path. He tells her: \u201cYou don\u2019t just stop being who you are when you reach a certain age. You know that, right? You don\u2019t magically outgrow yourself. The life you\u2019re living now is your actual life.\u201d Crosley determines that his cautionary wisdom is both totally generic and entirely true; it just often takes longer than we intend for us to accept the advice we\u2019re given.", "title": "The Essays Are Personal.

I increasingly get the sense that gayness itself has scattered, becoming something more various and harder to define. \u201cGay\u201d tells you about a person\u2019s lusts and loves, but it used to tell you more \u2014 about his or her boldness, irreverence, independence. It connoted a particular journey and pronounced struggle, and had its own soundtrack, sartorial flourishes and short list of celebrity icons. Not so anymore.\n\nThese thoughts came to mind as \u201cBoys\u201d comes back into view. For its 50th anniversary, it\u2019s getting its first-ever Broadway production, with an all-gay, all-star cast including Jim Parsons, Matt Bomer and Zachary Quinto. Previews begin Monday; the show opens May 31. I\u2019ll be fascinated to see what audiences make of this campy, catty portrait of a group of gay men who talk in code, traffic in secrecy and have carved out something separate that is not exactly peace.", "title": "Opinion | The Extinction of Gay Identity", "authors": []}

The increasing body of research into how we behave online suggests not.\n\nAn experiment by Susan Athey of Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business, along with Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that people who profess concern about privacy will provide the emails of their friends in exchange for some pizza.

As The Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin reported, many Republicans, including Ted Cruz, are making the argument that if Democrats take over Congress, they will impeach the president. In other words, far from ignoring Trump, these Republicans are making defending him the center of their campaigns.\n\nIn red states, as Josh Kraushaar of the National Journal noted, Republicans compete to see who is the most Trumpish. In Indiana, the men vying for the Republican Senate nomination underline their support for the trade war. One candidate has a slogan, \u201cDefeat the elite,\u201d while another promises to \u201cMake America Great.\u201d\n\nEven in blue states, Republicans refuse to criticize the man. In districts across Southern California, 11 Republican House candidates were asked about their positions on various issues. Seven of them refused to answer any question concerning Trump, and the four who did were strongly supportive.\n\nDemocratic anti-Trumpers had better hope they win in 2020, because their attacks have only served to entrench Trumpism on the right. Meanwhile, if Republican never-Trumpers were an army, they\u2019d be freezing their buns off in Valley Forge tweeting over and over again that these are the times that try men\u2019s souls.\n\nWhy has Trump dominated? Part of it is tribalism. In any tribal war people tend to bury individual concerns and rally to their leader and the party line. As late as 2015, Republican voters overwhelmingly supported free trade. Now they overwhelmingly oppose it. The shift didn\u2019t happen because of some mass reappraisal of the evidence; it\u2019s just that tribal orthodoxy shifted and everyone followed.\n\nPart of the problem is that anti-Trumpism has a tendency to be insufferably condescending. For example, my colleague Thomas B. Edsall beautifully summarized the recent academic analyses of what personality traits supposedly determine Trump support.\n\nTrump opponents, the academics say, are open-minded and value independence and novelty. Trump supporters, they continue, are closed-minded, change-averse and desperate for security.\n\nThis analysis strikes me as psychologically wrong (every human being requires both a secure base and an open field \u2014 we can\u2019t be divided into opposing camps), journalistically wrong (Trump supporters voted for the man precisely because they wanted transformational change) and an epic attempt to offend 40 percent of our fellow citizens by reducing them to psychological inferiors.", "title": "Opinion | The Failures of Anti-Trumpism", "authors": []}

It\u2019s also a measure of intensity on both sides to prevail in Wisconsin after Donald J. Trump shocked Democrats in 2016 by being the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state since 1984. National Democrats are bent on winning it back in 2020 \u2014 and getting Ms. Baldwin re-elected is a crucial step toward that goal.\n\nThe fight may become the most expensive Wisconsin Senate race ever: An analysis by the state Democratic Party found that nearly $10 million in advertising had already aired or been purchased by outside groups against Ms. Baldwin or in favor of Mr. Nicholson. (Mr. Nicholson\u2019s camp put the number at nearly $9 million.) At least another $3.7 million in advertising is underway sponsored by outside groups in favor of Ms. Baldwin.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe advertising by political action committees like Restoration PAC and Americas PAC \u2014 both heavily financed by the hard-right industrialist Richard Uihlein \u2014 has propelled the first-time candidacy of Mr. Nicholson, and underscores the influential role that outside conservative PACs play in this politically polarized state. Organizations funded by Mr. Uihlein and the billionaire Koch brothers have devoted millions to assuring continued Republican control of the Senate, and many conservatives view Ms. Baldwin, 56, as a beatable first-term senator who symbolizes the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cTammy Baldwin is very vulnerable,\u201d said Brad Courtney, the state\u2019s Republican chairman, calling her one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be lots of money coming into Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nEven in this rural area of small farms, nearly two hours from Milwaukee, it\u2019s hard to avoid the drumbeat of ads, which began well before the traditional start of campaign season.\n\n\u201cI hear a lot of stuff on the radio,\u201d said Gary Buchholz, a soil technician who was part of the crowd at J & J Fireball Lanes, a local bowling alley, and plans to vote for Ms. Baldwin. \u201cI don\u2019t like the money that comes in from out of state, huge amounts of money trying to influence Wisconsin elections.\u201d\n\nPartly to counter the advertising, an energized Democratic base is organizing early, determined to retain the Senate seat held by their party since 1957, when William Proxmire was elected to the unexpired term of Joseph McCarthy, who had died in office.

Ms. Vukmir has also received scores of endorsements from state Republicans, including the support of Reince Priebus, a Wisconsinite who served as White House chief of staff.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemocrats privately expressed concern that the negative advertising has whittled away at Ms. Baldwin\u2019s support. A March poll by Marquette Law School revealed that her approval rating was a mere 37 percent.\n\nFearing a reprise of the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race \u2014 when outside groups targeted the Democratic candidate, Russ Feingold, who lost even though he had held a lead two months before the election in a Marquette poll over the incumbent Republican, Senator Ron Johnson \u2014 Ms. Baldwin\u2019s campaign has already dug into her formidable campaign chest. Her campaign said it planned to have 60 field organizers in place statewide by the end of next month.\n\nMs. Baldwin\u2019s campaign also said it had released television advertising earlier than any incumbent Senate Democrat nationally, including one last week emphasizing her support for Wisconsin\u2019s cheese industry. Dairy farms have been a staple of rural areas of Wisconsin like Portage, the county seat of Columbia County, one of 23 Wisconsin counties carried by Mr. Trump that President Barack Obama had won in 2012.

Then, in April, in a statewide Supreme Court election, a liberal judge from Milwaukee County defeated a county circuit judge backed by conservatives.

In March of last year, a new Uihlein-backed PAC, Solutions for Wisconsin, announced that Mr. Uihlein had contributed $2 million to support a Senate run by Mr. Nicholson. In all, according to a recent Democratic Party analysis, spending by Uihlein-funded groups in favor of Mr. Nicholson and against Ms. Baldwin exceeds $5.4 million. Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for an interview regarding the Wisconsin Senate race.\n\nMr. Nicholson, a telegenic 40-year-old who always seems to have a fresh haircut, said he had begun exploring the idea of a Senate run well before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, seeking support both inside the state and from national donors.\n\n\u201cThe coalition is very impressive,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said, reeling off a list of six groups supporting him, including four groups that have received large donations from Mr. Uihlein. \u201cWe have a lot of groups stepping in to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you take back that seat.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Nicholson\u2019s political metamorphosis from Democrat to Republican has attracted thinly veiled criticism from some within the party who question his sincerity. Ms. Vukmir, who worked as a registered nurse for many years, told the crowd in Mequon, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent pro-life and I have always been 100 percent pro-life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was an apparent reference to Mr. Nicholson\u2019s evolved position on abortion.

We complain that they spend too much money or connive too much and drink too much \u2014 or not enough, in the case of Lemonade Lucy Hayes \u2014 and they run or ruin their husband\u2019s careers. So in its strange way, history has been kind to Varina Howell Davis mainly because it\u2019s largely forgotten her. The much younger second wife of Jefferson Davis, who presided over an imaginary country called the Confederate States of America, Varina Davis has escaped the opprobrium of statues dedicated in her honor and then torn down.\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t disappeared. An excellent scholarly biography by Joan E. Cashin was published in 2006, and she drifts through Mary Chesnut\u2019s astringent memoirs prophesying the failure of the Confederacy. A woman to whom clever women gravitated, as Chesnut suggested more than once, Davis (who lived until 1906) in later life sought to reconcile North and South. She developed a close friendship with Julia Dent Grant and in the 1890s wrote an advice column as well as a number of articles for Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s New York World. And she rises, once again, in \u201cVarina,\u201d Charles Frazier\u2019s elegiac novel, told mostly from her own subdued point of view.\n\nAuthor of the wildly popular debut novel \u201cCold Mountain,\u201d which won the National Book Award more than 20 years ago, Frazier in this, his fourth novel, lyrically resurrects the blasted but hauntingly beautiful Southern landscape just after the war, a time when Varina Davis and a brood of five children, along with a former slave and \u201ca dwindling supply of white men,\u201d have fled Richmond. It\u2019s the spring of 1865, and the Federal Army is close. Hoping to elude Union soldiers and bounty hunters all the way to Florida, eventually to reach Havana and freedom, Varina has a little money from the sale of her household furnishings and a small pistol with which she can shoot herself if Union soldiers try to violate her. The pistol and instructions are gifts from her husband. Beyond that, she has a great deal of moxie as well as a reserve of \u201chousewife morphine\u201d that will last for a little while.\n\nTo narrate the travails of this Mississippi-born Confederate mistress in 2018 is far from easy, so Frazier leaps what might have been an insurmountable narrative hurdle with a widower named James Blake. A middle-aged black man, he calls on Varina Davis just a few months before her death. To cut back on her \u201cpowders and tinctures,\u201d she is staying for the season at a sanitarium-like hotel, the Retreat, which offers a range of therapies (hydrotherapy, mechanotherapy, electrotherapy and \u201cdramatotherapy\u201d) in the fashionable resort town of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Blake, who lives in nearby Albany, has recently come across a book, \u201cFirst Days Amongst the Contrabands\u201d (a real book), by a Northern abolitionist teacher, that devoted an entire chapter (also real) to a boy known as Jimmie. This book, along with a wisp or two of early memories, has stirred up misgivings about his own past that Blake believes Varina might clarify. Uninterested in backward glances or interminable \u201ctales of waste and loss,\u201d she wants to brush him off. \u201cThe only bright spot is, the right side won,\u201d she says, and then pointedly advises, \u201cDon\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBlake is, of course, Jimmie, the skinny orphan boy Varina rescued back in 1864 when she saw a drunken woman beating him with a stick. Raising him alongside her own children in the Gray House, as she derisively christened the president\u2019s mansion, Varina protected Jimmie until the Federals captured them in 1865. \u201cKeeping you with me was worse for you than letting you go,\u201d she sorrowfully recalls. Sent to Gen. Rufus Saxton, military commander of the Union-occupied Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina, so he might be cared for, Blake then disappeared from her life \u2014 until now, the summer of 1906, when he arrives with his book and a slew of questions: \u201cDid you ever own me?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the novel\u2019s moral center, James Blake presumably allows the reader to admire this complex woman or at least hope that her empathetic imagination may not be as deficient as, say, that of her husband. As the novel proceeds, Blake begins to visit her on Sunday afternoons, and she begins to reminisce, though her recollections are often filtered through the haze of the opiates she\u2019s been swallowing since the age of 13 to blunt panic, depression and grief. In 1877, after she\u2019d sought medical help in Karlsruhe, Germany, her doctor diagnosed her as suffering from \u201cmisplaced malaise.\u201d Varina protested. \u201cEven leaving the war out of it,\u201d she asked, how could her malaise be misplaced, given the deaths of most of her six children, her difficult marriage, her experience of poverty and homelessness \u2014 not to mention something she calls \u201crecognition of fundamental moral failure\u201d?

My colleagues and I found, in a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, that under typical conditions the formaldehyde coming out of an e-cig can even exceed what is known as ceiling limits \u2014 a level of formaldehyde in the air that is not allowed to be exceeded in the workplace, even for one second.\n\nSo that\u2019s the case for calling e-cigs Electronic Formaldehyde Delivery Systems. But e-cigs don\u2019t just emit nicotine and formaldehyde. We could also call them Electronic Diacetyl Delivery Systems. Diacetyl, a flavoring chemical, is less well-known than formaldehyde, but it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nAbout a decade ago several former workers in a microwave popcorn packaging plant got sick with a severe and irreversible lung disease called obliterative bronchiolitis, which became known as Popcorn Lung. After a lengthy investigation, it was discovered that those who had most often been exposed to the popcorn\u2019s fake butter flavoring were the most likely to have problems with their lungs. Diacetyl, the chemical that was used to create that fake butter flavor, was being heated up, and the workers were breathing in the vapors. Although diacetyl is safe to eat, it is not safe when it is heated and inhaled.\n\nHeating and inhaling flavors sound a lot like what\u2019s happening with e-cigs, right? And Diacetyl is used to create all sorts of flavors besides butter, like strawberry, pi\u00f1a colada and butterscotch. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that we found diacetyl in over 75 percent of e-cigs tested.\n\nSome e-cig makers have moved away from diacetyl because of its bad rap. But what are they using instead to create those 7,000 or so flavors of e-cigs on the market? Often we see a close look-alike chemical called 2,3-pentanedione, which we found in nearly 50 percent of e-cigs tested.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "But Greek life needs to change. In its current form, it fosters not just fun and friendship but also inequality. At a time when many dorms have gender-mixed floors, and a full generation after most single-sex schools began admitting both sexes, these organizations seem like relics. Fraternities and sororities must make a number of changes to ensure their survival, starting with going coed.\n\nThose who defend Greek life talk about how it fosters a sense of community and belonging at a time when many people are far from home and often unsure of their direction. People meet lifelong friends, and sometimes spouses, through the Greek system, and after college, alumni associations can provide networks in new cities. This may explain why people remain fierce advocates of their \u201cway of life\u201d long after graduation.\n\nStudies have shown that fraternity and sorority members also surpass their non-Greek counterparts on a number of metrics. They are more likely to graduate on time and go on to earn higher salaries (though joining a fraternity does seem to have a slight negative effect on grades). In addition to all that they provide their members, Greek organizations also typically raise money for charity and do volunteer work. What\u2019s not to love?\n\nWell, a lot. Those who support Greek life often have a blind spot. The system strictly enforces gender separation and traditional gender roles. Rules that prevent sorority sisters from hosting parties, drinking alcohol or having members of the opposite sex in their houses result in a disproportionate amount of social capital concentrated in male-dominated spaces. While not all fraternities, and certainly not all fraternity men, abuse this social power, some do. This means that women may be excluded from a major social space on campus if they do not adhere to the expectations of fraternity men. This hasn\u2019t just made it easier to exclude women; it has made it easier to objectify them, too.\n\nI would prefer no Greek life to Greek life that continues to marginalize women and other groups. The purpose of higher education is to prepare the next generation to be engaged and democratic citizens. This is why most universities, even those that are private, receive public funding.

For several years now, his preferred target for that exercise has been New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio. Despite the aura of insincerity that some feel surrounds the governor generally, his distaste for the mayor seems entirely genuine.\n\nThe embattled relationship is now playing out most dramatically over the issues surrounding the New York City Housing Authority, the largest public housing system in the country.

Stringer, found that 70 percent of the playgrounds managed by the housing authority were rundown or actually dangerous.\n\nThe governor has positioned himself as a savior, declaring a state of emergency in the public housing system a few days ago, committing an additional $250 million in state resources to remediating some of the most urgent mechanical problems and public-health threats, and demanding an independent monitor to oversee the repairs.

But Dr. Britton also found that mice infected with those virulent strains of C. diff that consumed the sugar fared worse than infected mice that were not fed the sugar.\n\nHis research adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that common food additives can push our microbial communities in unhealthy directions, not only potentially aiding the emergence of new pathogens, but also encouraging diseases like obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nLet\u2019s back up and ask: Why have a microbiome to begin with? Why lug around a few pounds of microbes in your gut? One reason, the Stanford University microbiologist Justin Sonnenburg reminded me, is that these microbes can rapidly shift in response to new foods, helping us wring calories from a wider variety of foods than our bodies would normally allow.\n\nAs an example, he pointed to research on the microbiome of people in Japan. It has a unique ability to break down seaweed, and scientists think it acquired this talent by borrowing DNA from microbes that live on seaweed itself. The implication is that by eating lots of seaweed, the ancestral Japanese pushed their microbiome to evolve until it adapted to their diet. And they were presumably better off for it: Their microbes could extract more calories from what they ate, better nourishing them.\n\nBut that same flexibility can be dangerous when we push our microbial communities too far, says Dr. Sonnenburg. Our sugary, greasy diet diverges so much from the diet humans evolved eating, he and others think, that the microbes of westernized populations may no longer mesh well with the human body.\n\nGut microbes are kept slightly removed from the intestinal lining by a thin layer of mucus, and the Western diet seems to erode that protective barrier, bringing microbes too close. (A diet rich in soluble fiber, on the other hand, keeps the mucus barrier thick and healthy.)\n\nCertain food additives also lead to a weakened mucus barrier. Andrew Gewirtz, a microbiologist at Georgia State University, and colleagues have found that the common emulsifiers polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose \u2014 often found in items like mayonnaise and ice cream \u2014 prompt an erosion of the mucus barrier in mice.

Despite his dubious legitimacy, his allies in Congress take advantage of his election to ram through a huge tax cut that blows up the budget deficit while disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. While the big bucks go to the big incomes, however, the tax bill does throw some crumbs at the middle class, and Republicans try to sell the bill as a boon to working families.\n\nSo far this account applies equally to George W. Bush and Donald Trump. But then the story takes a turn.

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "None of that has happened because Guardiola is a magician. He did not arrive at Manchester City and transform it with a sprinkle of stardust. It is all the result of unstinting, unending work, a quest for perfection, a determination that everything should be just right.\n\nHe was the same at Bayern Munich. Guardiola never quite fit in with the Bavarian bonhomie at the perennial German champion. The club\u2019s hierarchy found him too detached, too intense, too draining. But even those who were, in a sense, glad to see him leave acknowledge that Guardiola\u2019s lasting legacy was not the three Bundesliga titles he won, but the way he sharpened and honed and improved everything he could. He made Bayern, a byword for soccer best practices, better.\n\nIt goes well beyond the length of the grass. As his willingness to listen to his grounds staff showed, Guardiola was impressed by the professionalism he found when he arrived at City \u2014 he did not have to make quite so sweeping changes as he expected \u2014 but he has still left no stone unturned.\n\nThis season, for example, he has worked painstakingly on imbuing his team with a sense of identity. He has encouraged the players to take to the field together before games, and to leave as one afterward. It is striking, and deliberate, that City\u2019s whole team celebrates goals together.\n\nMore than just forging a team spirit, though, Guardiola saw that his players needed a story to bond them to their club, and the fans needed something to bond them to their team. He had been struck, during a Champions League match last season, by the contrast in atmosphere between Glasgow\u2019s boisterous Celtic Park and the more subdued Etihad.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd so, with City\u2019s sports psychologists, he has made an effort this year to inculcate in his players not just what it is to play for Manchester City, but what it is to be from Manchester.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen his captain, Vincent Kompany, said in an interview in February that, like the people of Manchester, he \u201cknew how to fall down and get back up again,\u201d he was not just demonstrating his own social conscience, his own bond to the city. He was parroting one of the messages Guardiola has tried to drill into his players.\n\nIt was this all-encompassing approach, as much as his style of play and his track record, that had made Guardiola so appealing to Manchester City, that inspired the club to pursue him for so long.\n\nWhen City fired Roberto Mancini in 2013, it was roundly mocked for suggesting the decision had been reached because it wanted a more \u201cholistic\u201d manager: not just someone who signed players and led training, but someone who might influence every aspect of the club. It was not just a buzzword. Manuel Pellegrini arrived and promptly delivered a title with the players Mancini had collected, but it is in Guardiola that City finally has its holistic manager, and it now may win the Premier League with both a record points haul and by a record margin.\n\nAs at Bayern, City expects Guardiola\u2019s work to outlast him. The club\u2019s hierarchy retains a quiet hope that he can be persuaded to lay down roots in Manchester, but the evidence of his career so far suggests he will stay until 2020, at the latest. Even if he does depart after three or four seasons, all of the little changes, the incremental improvements he has made, will remain.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is his effect on the culture of the country in which he works. Thiago Alcantara, one of his midfielders at Bayern, said after Guardiola left Germany that the coach had \u201cchanged the concept of German football,\u201d with his emphasis on possession supplementing the Bundesliga\u2019s traditional focus on \u201cstrength, power and goals.\u201d It meant, Thiago believed, that Germany could find \u201cthe harmony to go on and become world champions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGuardiola has always been reticent to suggest he might do something similar in England. When he arrived at City, he made it clear that it would be \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to \u201ccome to the country that invented football and believe you have to change something.\u201d But that is precisely what the most successful foreign coaches have done for English soccer since it opened its eyes, as much as its borders, to the rest of the world in the 1990s.\n\nFirst, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger brought with him advances in nutrition \u2014 listening to his former players, it is possible to think the Arsenal manager invented pasta \u2014 but also changes in recruitment and preparation.\n\nA decade later, Mourinho and Rafael Ben\u00edtez revolutionized England\u2019s tactical awareness, introducing unfamiliar systems, new interpretations of positions and even an expanded vocabulary. Ben\u00edtez was lampooned for his belief in zonal marking on set pieces and for his insistence on \u201csquad rotation;\u201d now both are employed by most, if not all, English teams.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The most likely answer is in terms of the details of his style: his devotion to the ball-playing goalkeeper, his willingness to play with a raft of playmakers and, most important, his conviction that there is no such thing as too much possession.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent years, the Premier League has proved fertile ground for teams who play on the counterpunch. In a league where J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool and Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham are lauded, teams that emphasize keeping the ball have come to seem pass\u00e9.\n\nThe title victories of Chelsea in 2017, with just 53 percent possession over the season, and Leicester the year before \u2014 with only 40 percent \u2014 appeared to confirm that keeping the ball was no longer a prerequisite to success.\n\nUntil Guardiola, of course: this year, Manchester City is running at 71.5 percent possession, by some distance the highest since the statistic started being recorded in 2003. It is unlikely that his title victory will make others change their ways \u2014 Klopp, Pochettino and Mourinho are all ideologically wedded to the counterattack \u2014 or make other, less gifted sides follow suit. But it does, at least, puncture a hole in the orthodoxy.\n\nThat is fitting, because the most significant change wrought by Guardiola in his two years in England has been, as it was always likely to be, not in terms of how the Premier League plays the game but in how it thinks about it.\n\nAt the end of Guardiola\u2019s first season in Manchester, Gary Neville, widely regarded as the most perceptive former player in the news media, suggested that City lacked the \u201cpower and strength,\u201d what he termed the \u201cspine\u201d that all English champions tended to have. \u201cI just wonder whether they can play that way,\u201d Neville said, intimating that Guardiola\u2019s approach lacked those qualities. \u201cCan you play that way, with those players, and win this league?\u201d\n\nThe short answer is yes, and with ease, too. The idea that Guardiola would have to compromise his beliefs, to meet English soccer\u2019s conventions halfway, has been comprehensively debunked.\n\nThat is what separates him from Wenger and Mourinho, both of whom at least paid lip service to England\u2019s much-vaunted traditions, its fog-horned exceptionalism.\n\nGuardiola, by contrast, has done no such thing. He said as early as October 2016 that he was \u201cnot going to change my style,\u201d pointing to the number of trophies he had won as a coach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys,\u201d he added. He was told, again and again, that his desire to play through his goalkeeper would not work in England. He responded, simply, that he would not budge \u201cuntil my last day as a coach.\u201d\n\nHe has been vindicated this year. His is a triumph of ideas. He has not had to adapt to the Premier League; rather, the Premier League will now have to adapt to him. He has exposed England\u2019s avowed belief that it is different from every other league as a myth: it is just as susceptible to domination by an outstanding team as the Bundesliga, Serie A or La Liga. Guardiola\u2019s method, his philosophy, works just as well here as everywhere else he has been.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis vision has come to fruition; he has proved his ways work here, and work perfectly. He has spent almost two years making sure everything, every blade of grass, is just as it should be, making sure everything is in perfect condition for his ideas to flourish. Now, against Manchester United, he can claim his reward.", "title": "The Greatness of Pep Guardiola, in a Blade of Grass", "authors": ["Rory Smith", "On Soccer"]}

One friend battled depression and eventually committed suicide.\n\nMr. Douthat continues to display a na\u00efve and distinctly male-privileged view of what exactly it means to be pregnant, give birth, and be a single mother or give up a baby for adoption.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "Trees are everywhere but incidental, it seems, until the seventh tale in the series, about an odd little girl who loves trees more than she loves most people and grows up to be a scientist. As Dr. Pat Westerford she spends years alone in forests doing her research, initially mocked by her peers but eventually celebrated for an astounding (and actually real) discovery: A forest\u2019s trees are all communicating, all the time, via a nuanced chemical language transmitted from root to root. As this revelation dawns, the reader is jolted with electric glimpses of connections among characters in the previous stories. And then we remember we\u2019re in the hands of Richard Powers, winner of a genius grant, a storyteller of such grand scope that Margaret Atwood was moved to ask: \u201cIf Powers were an American writer of the 19th century, which writer would he be? He\u2019d probably be the Herman Melville of \u2018Moby-Dick.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis picture really is that big. These characters who have held us rapt for 150 pages turn out to be the shrubby understory, for which we couldn\u2019t yet see the forest. Standing overhead with outstretched limbs are the real protagonists. Trees will bring these small lives together into large acts of war, love, loyalty and betrayal, in a violent struggle against a mortgaged timber company that is liquidating its assets, including one of the last virgin stands of California redwoods. The descriptions of this deeply animate place, including a thunderstorm as experienced from 300 feet up, stand with any prose I\u2019ve ever read. I hesitate to tell more, and spoil the immense effort Powers invests in getting us into that primal forest to bear witness. It\u2019s a delicate act, writing about tree defenders: In an era when art seems ready to embrace subjects as painful as racism and sexual harassment, it still shrinks from environmental brutality. We may agree that deforested continents and melting permafrost betray the gravest assaults we\u2019ve ever committed against anything or anyone, but still tend to behave as if it\u2019s impolite to bring this up.\n\nImage\n\nIn the kind of meta-conversation that makes a Powers novel feel so famously intelligent, the narrative is seasoned with canny observations on this exact problem. The tree scientist frets about public indifference to her work: \u201cForests panic people. Too much going on there. Humans need a sky.\u201d Elsewhere, a patent attorney becomes profoundly disabled and seeks solace in novels, even while he muses on the limitations of the form. \u201cTo be human is to confuse a satisfying story with a meaningful one. \u2026 The world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people. \u2026 Though I am fake, they say, and nothing I do makes the least difference, still, I cross all distances to sit next to you in your mechanical bed, keep you company and change your mind.\u201d\n\nGiven that Richard Powers has swept the literary-prize Olympics, he should be a household name, but isn\u2019t quite. Critics have sometimes blamed a certain bleakness of outlook, or a deficit of warmth in his characters: As Atwood put it, the story going around is that he\u2019s \u201cnot cozy enough at the core.\u201d I suspect the complaint isn\u2019t entirely Powers\u2019s problem, but rather a symptom of the art/science divide and some potent cultural stereotypes. At the prospect of a science-y genius taking the podium, a lot of the audience expects to be frozen out, or bored.\n\n\u201cThe Overstory\u201d makes a strong case for expecting otherwise. The science in this novel ranges from fun fact to mind-blowing, brought to us by characters \u2014 some scientists, mostly not \u2014 who are sweet or funny or maddening in all the relatable ways. The major players number more than a dozen, all invested with touching humanity, and they arrive with such convincing, fully formed r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, it\u2019s hard to resist Googling a couple of them to see if they\u2019re real people. (They aren\u2019t.) This is a gigantic fable of genuine truths held together by a connective tissue of tender exchange between fictional friends, lovers, parents and children. A computer programmer brings his work home to spend hours inventing games with his son: \u201cNow, Neelay-ji. What might this little creature do?\u201d A cute Eastern European backpacker invites herself for a one-nighter in the vet Douglas\u2019s remote cabin, and he warns that she shouldn\u2019t be out there by herself, looking the way she does. \u201c\u2018How I look?\u2019 She blows a raspberry and whisks her palm. \u2018Like an ill monkey who needs washing.\u2019\u201d Best of all are two aging misanthropes, Patricia and Dennis, who will wreck any unsentimental heart with their gentle discovery that just an hour a day together can make a marriage, providing the nutrient that\u2019s been missing all along.

Kwaidan for us is about our shared values.\u201d The name \u201cKwaidan,\u201d which translates to \u201cstrange stories\u201d in Japanese, is derived from Masaki Kobayashi\u2019s 1965 cult film of the same name. \u201cEditions\u201d describes how each of their collections is distinct but exists in continuity, like a chapter in a book. Referring to the movie, La said they were drawn to \u201cthe unspoken richness, the sets, the weird noises. It\u2019s so rich without saying anything. We wanted to try to capture that.\u201d\n\nFilm is a big influence on the duo, which is fitting, as their first date 14 years ago was to see \u201cThe Shining.\u201d (They\u2019ve been married for nine years.) \u201cThere\u2019s so many levels of depth in cinema,\u201d La says. \u201cThe best movies feel so complete \u2014 like a full vision.\u201d Similarly, the designers approach their work with a cinematic point of view.

More and more new restaurants offer just one or two desserts. And when you go out as often as I do, you start to notice that the one dessert you can count on seeing almost everywhere is an ice cream sundae. In many places, it\u2019s the only dessert.\n\nSome of these sundaes are obvious and unabashed nostalgia trips. These are the ones whose ice cream is piled up in a glass pedestal cup and then capped with whipped cream and the obligatory cherry on top. In this category we have the sundaes at 4 Charles Prime Rib in Greenwich Village and the Office NYC just off Columbus Circle, both elaborate do-it-yourself jobs to which you can add candy in more varieties than the most ambitious trick-or-treater has ever hauled home.\n\nOther restaurant sundaes are more restrained.

They assert that the merger \u2014 which would reduce the number of national wireless companies from four to three \u2014 would give them the scale they need to build a high-capacity wireless network with 5G, or fifth-generation, technology. If the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice approve the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint say, the company won\u2019t raise prices and it will hire more people, rather than reduce the work force, which is more often the case in such mergers. And they say all this will be done while costs are cut by $6 billion a year and profits rise substantially.\n\nAll that\u2019s missing from this list of promises is permanently blue skies.\n\nTogether, Sprint and T-Mobile would have more than 125 million customers, putting the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name, just behind Verizon and AT&T. Before this latest deal was agreed to on Sunday, the four companies had discussed several possible mergers in recent years. Indeed, the wireless business is already very concentrated \u2014 there were six national companies as recently as 2003 \u2014 and a deal that would further consolidate power is troubling. Having fewer competitors emboldens businesses to raise prices and force consumers into long-term service contracts because they know that people don\u2019t have many options. That\u2019s why the F.C.C. and the Justice Department successfully blocked AT&T\u2019s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011 \u2014 and why regulators should be skeptical this time around as well.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear that T-Mobile and Sprint need this deal to roll out a 5G network. Executives of both companies have previously said that they would offer such service across the country and that their networks would be the best in the industry. Now, executives say the companies\u2019 combined wireless spectrum will allow them to offer a 5G service so good that some people will use it to replace their home broadband connection, providing competition to the likes of Comcast and Charter. That sounds great, but there is a long history of telecom executives failing to deliver on grand promises about abundant and cheap broadband.\n\nThere is also plenty of evidence that more competition is good for consumers and the economy broadly. Just look at T-Mobile. After the AT&T acquisition fell apart, T-Mobile slashed prices and offered wireless service without long-term contracts under an aggressive chief executive, John Legere. The bet paid off handsomely \u2014 T-Mobile has added nearly 40 million subscribers in the past five years, and the rest of the companies in the industry have had to lower prices and change how they do business. If AT&T had been allowed to take over, many experts believe, prices would have gone up and cellphone contracts would have become much more onerous.", "title": "Opinion | The Implausible Promises of a T-Mobile-Sprint Merger", "authors": []}

Majuli, where it is located, is a luxuriant island in the Brahmaputra River, close to the border with China and Myanmar. To get there from New York, it takes three days, including a flight to Delhi, plus another 2.5-hour flight from Delhi to Guwahati, the largest city in Assam, followed by a seven-hour drive and a boat ride.\n\nThat is where this Krishna-worshiping order was established in the 15th century by a poet-saint called Sankaradeva, who also introduced the practice of music-making and dance that is at the heart of the Sattriya tradition. The monks there practice the arts every day, alongside their farming duties. \u201cI wake up at 5 a.m., study and rehearse until 7,\u201d Satya Nath Borah, who was given to the monastery at the age of 1 1/2 after the death of his father, explained in an email.

Over the course of the evening at Dancing the Gods, they will take turns onstage in alternating numbers, from the introductory invocation to the final offering to Krishna.\n\nIt\u2019s important, both to the monks and to their female collaborators, that the rules and the spiritual dimension of the performance be preserved, no matter how far from an Assamese prayer hall. \u201cWhen I dance,\u201d Ms. Bora said, \u201cI\u2019m transported back to the shrine on Majuli island.

But the operation had nothing to do with the atrocity in Douma; its timing was coincidental. Israel struck a Syrian air base, T4, at which various aircraft were reportedly operated by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to reports, seven Iranians were killed.\n\n\u201cIsrael has several red lines, which it is not prepared to allow to be crossed, including the transfer of sophisticated weapons or chemical weapons to Hezbollah,\u201d Avigdor Lieberman, the minister of defense, told a session of the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in December 2016. Then he added: \u201cWe have no interest in intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war.\u201d\n\nIsrael is not alone. Much of the responsibility for what is happening in Syria can be laid on the doorstep of the United States, which has largely stood by as hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been massacred. President Barack Obama decided not to act against Mr. Assad, even when the Syrian president crossed the red lines that Mr. Obama himself had drawn. President Trump has continued down this path, apart from a token salvo of Tomahawk missiles a year ago, which certainly did not deter Mr. Assad. The United States now seems poised to strike once more, but will it do enough to change the Syrian president\u2019s calculus?\n\nYears ago, Israel could easily have forced Mr. Assad\u2019s military, stretched to its utmost trying to suppress the rebellion, to halt at least some of its actions against civilians. The Israeli armed forces could have stopped the Syrian Army or at least coerced it into declaring a \u201csafe zone\u201d for refugees with a no-fly zone over it. The claims that this would have entailed a complex or even impossible military operation are rebuffed by the facts: Israel has carried out hundreds of attacks in Syria during this same period.\n\nSyria, in most cases, did not even attempt to defend itself from these attacks. Mr. Assad\u2019s generals seem fully aware of their military\u2019s inferiority. They also knew that by responding with force, they would only bring on themselves more devastation. On Wednesday, a high-ranking Israeli source told me that if Iran were to attempt to retaliate for the attack on its base in Syria, \u201cboth the Assad regime and Assad himself would vanish from the face of the earth.\u201d Imagine if a threat like this were uttered about saving innocent lives.\n\nIsrael has had excellent reasons for not intervening: Operating overtly in a neighboring country would appear as an intolerable interference in Arab affairs to the Arab world, which already hates Israel. And of course, Israel has numerous other security challenges. Moreover, since the West neglected Syria for so long, the situation has grown far more complex: Iran, Hezbollah and Russia are in control. Any Israeli operation now would be far more complicated and would have to be carried out in cooperation with the United States.\n\nThe arguments against an Israeli action are based on weighty considerations. But were there not weighty considerations in the 1940s that stopped the Allies from coming to the aid of Europe\u2019s Jews? And if these explanations were not legitimate then \u2014 and we know now that they were not \u2014 what about today? What is happening in Syria is not the same as the gas chambers of Auschwitz. But does Israel not have an added obligation, over and above that of the other countries, to do something for nations facing genocide and war crimes, especially when they are right on its northern border, and it has proved several times that it is able to do so?", "title": "Opinion | The Jewish State Has a Special Duty to Defend Syrians", "authors": []}

Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, now a booming megacity of 10 million, also suffered widespread destruction, changing hands four times.\n\nThe conflict started when North Korea, which had the backing of the Soviet Union and China, invaded the South in June 1950 and quickly pushed South Korean forces to the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. The United States, under the auspices of the United Nations and with troops led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, invaded behind enemy lines in September at the coastal city of Incheon, pushing the North Korean forces back past their border.\n\nA particularly bloody stage of the conflict came after the allied forces drove the North Korean troops to the Chinese border, and China entered the conflict in October 1950. The ensuing fighting over the mountainous terrain of North Korea was known for its harsh conditions, especially in wintertime.\n\nFor the next two years, the two sides fought to a standstill roughly centered on the area of the 38th parallel, the prewar dividing line between the two Koreas.

Charles Kushner says that he is willing to buy out his partner, but some business associates say that would only double an already money-losing real estate bet.\n\nCompany officials have sought to minimize the effect of the tower\u2019s financial troubles, saying it is one property among many and they marked down its value so it is less than 4 percent of Mr. Kushner\u2019s net worth, estimated at $2.5 billion.\n\nDebt for the Kushners\u2019 portion of the Times Square property at 229 West 43rd Street is also on a watch list, according to Trepp, a firm that analyzes mortgage-backed securities. But both Mr. Kushner and Laurent Morali, the firm\u2019s president, call that building, the former headquarters of The New York Times, an excellent investment. They insisted that the 2016 loan from Deutsche Bank, which is now under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, was an arm\u2019s-length business transaction.\n\nBut financing for a third $800 million project, two towers across the Hudson River in suburban New Jersey, has been delayed by yet more questions arising from the family\u2019s White House connections. The company had hoped to attract $150 million from foreign investors via a federal visa program, EB-5, that offers green cards and eligibility for permanent residence to those who invest at least $500,000 in an American business.", "title": "The Kushners Saw Redemption in the White House.

In 1983, I was in college in Northern California, living in a drab ground-floor apartment just off campus, and on the verge of coming out. Not a place or an age I wish to return to for longer than a flash of remembering. Not a place or an age I wished to be back then either. Where I wanted to be, or thought I wanted to be, existed in the pages of publications like The Village Voice, where photos of Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat at Club 57 made New York into a goal, a place to try to reach. In the gay literary magazine Christopher Street, read surreptitiously on visits to bookstores in San Francisco, I glimpsed not places so much as states of mind: the notion of being both openly gay and a serious writer \u2014 indeed, of being a gay writer, at the time still a radical thought \u2014 as epitomized in its pages by Edmund White, Vito Russo, George Stambolian, Michael Denneny and others.\n\nBy the time I actually moved here, in 2009, at age 48, most of those places from the early \u201980s (and many of the people) were long gone, as were nightspots I\u2019d only heard about \u2014 Danceteria, Paradise Garage and what was once Madonna\u2019s stomping ground, the Fun House. Certain landmarks remained \u2014 like the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of modern gay rights in New York, or the Kettle of Fish bar, once a popular hangout for Bob Dylan and Jack Kerouac, and now a sports bar for fans of the Green Bay Packers. Christopher Street seemed to carry the memory of Christopher Street magazine like an aging face carries the memory of its youthful glamour. In the years since that journal started publishing in 1976 and its shuttering in 1995, the city had been ravaged by crack and AIDS, cleaned up and turned outrageously expensive. The past sometimes seeps through, buried as it is beneath layers of time and history, and inevitably, the present suffers by comparison. I am often reminded of this \u2014 told this, really \u2014 by people my age who lived here through all those years.", "title": "The Landmarks That Made New York a Cultural Capital", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "In the late 1950s, when artists started moving downtown, the area was a sprawling wasteland of low level buildings anchored by two largely industrial areas \u2014 what we now call SoHo and its neighbor immediately to the south, TriBeCa. Both had begun in the 1600s as colonial farmland; by the 19th century, both had transformed into a shopping and entertainment district, with large hotels, upscale department stores, theaters and hundreds of brothels. After the Civil War, the area became an important manufacturing center for textile firms and other industries, and the brothels were gradually replaced by clusters of cast-iron warehouses. By the 1950s, these warehouses were mostly being used for storage or sweatshops, and the neighborhood, increasingly decrepit, earned the nickname Hell\u2019s Hundred Acres.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems destined that artists would colonize this place \u2014 for whom were these cavernous, empty spaces built if not for artists, like Donald Judd playing around with new and unwieldy ideas? \u2014 though it\u2019s hard to overstate just how difficult it was to do. Living in these buildings, which were not zoned for residential occupation, was illegal, and the conditions were bleak: In some cases there was no working plumbing, water, heat or electricity. Artists were required by the city to post warning signs on the exteriors of these buildings that read A.I.R. \u2014 Artist in Residence \u2014 so that if there were a fire, the fire department would know to rescue them.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like being in the country in the middle of the city,\u201d says Richard Nonas, who moved to SoHo in the late \u201960s and to TriBeCa around 1975. He is among a small group of artists who remain in this part of the city, some of whom T gathered for a photo shoot in the area in February. \u201cIt was only toward the \u201980s,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I knew anybody who made enough money to hire an architect or a plumber.\u201d\n\nInconveniences and startling imagery aside \u2014 Red Grooms, who\u2019s had a studio in TriBeCa since 1969, still recalls the day he found a chalk outline of a dead body in front of the door of his former apartment on Mulberry Street \u2014 the area\u2019s transformation into an arts district truly began when a young woman named Paula Cooper opened the first major gallery here on Prince Street in 1968. She was followed in 1971 by Leo Castelli \u2014 the Upper East Side dealer of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol \u2014 and a few other dealers, who opened branches downtown at 420 West Broadway, which became known as the SoHo Gallery Building. By the 1980s, SoHo was once again an important commercial center for the city, host to New York\u2019s most influential galleries and the place where many artists lived and worked. (The mainstream art industry of this time often ignored artists of color, with the notable exception of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who was embraced by the SoHo galleries and had a studio nearby on Great Jones Street. Artists like Lorraine O\u2019Grady, David Hammons and Senga Nengudi were left out of the narrative of SoHo\u2019s heyday, though they did find a home at Linda Goode Bryant\u2019s Just Above Midtown gallery, which opened in 1974 on West 57th Street and moved to TriBeCa in 1980.)", "title": "The Last Artists of SoHo (and TriBeCa)", "authors": []}

This is how Donald Trump does business, and these are the kinds of people he surrounds himself with.\n\nMr. Trump has spent his career in the company of developers and celebrities, and also of grifters, cons, sharks, goons and crooks. He cuts corners, he lies, he cheats, he brags about it, and for the most part, he\u2019s gotten away with it, protected by threats of litigation, hush money and his own bravado. Those methods may be proving to have their limits when they are applied from the Oval Office. Though Republican leaders in Congress still keep a cowardly silence, Mr. Trump now has real reason to be afraid. A raid on a lawyer\u2019s office doesn\u2019t happen every day; it means that multiple government officials, and a federal judge, had reason to believe they\u2019d find evidence of a crime there and that they didn\u2019t trust the lawyer not to destroy that evidence.\n\nOn Monday, when he appeared with his national security team, Mr. Trump, whose motto could be, \u201cThe buck stops anywhere but here,\u201d angrily blamed everyone he could think of for the \u201cunfairness\u201d of an investigation that has already consumed the first year of his presidency, yet is only now starting to heat up. He said Attorney General Jeff Sessions made \u201ca very terrible mistake\u201d by recusing himself from overseeing the investigation \u2014 the implication being that a more loyal attorney general would have obstructed justice and blocked the investigation. He complained about the \u201chorrible things\u201d that Hillary Clinton did \u201cand all of the crimes that were committed.\u201d He called the A-team of investigators from the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, \u201cthe most biased group of people.\u201d As for Mr. Mueller himself, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMany people have said, \u2018You should fire him.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, the raids on the premises used by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, were conducted by the public corruption unit of the federal attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and at the request not of the special counsel\u2019s team, but under a search warrant that investigators in New York obtained following a referral by Mr. Mueller, who first consulted with the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. To sum up, a Republican-appointed former F.B.I. director consulted with a Republican-appointed deputy attorney general, who then authorized a referral to an F.B.I. field office not known for its anti-Trump bias.

I began to jot down on paper who was there, what they were doing, time, what they were saying. \u201cGet it all down, get it all down,\u201d and then a second thought: phone. Call the office, call the office I kept thinking. I hustled down the stairs and started for my room but about half-way I remembered that the phones were busy. I remembered one at the other end of the motel and I started to run in that direction.\n\nSuddenly there were all of these police with shotguns and unholstered pistols and they seemed to be coming from across the street, from the direction where the shot had been fired. I remember a cop coming up to me grabbing my arm and asking which way did the shot come from. \u201cAcross the street, I think. Over there. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAgain I remembered the phone and started to run in that direction. Change. A dime. I had two nickels in my pocket. I felt out of breath but I remember methodically calling the operator. \u201cI\u2019d like to make a credit card call to New York ... area code 212-556-7356. Martha.\u201d Martha answered. \u201cMartha, I\u2019d like to speak to Claude, it\u2019s an emergency. Claude answered quickly but when he did I couldn\u2019t talk.

If a toy breaks at Cometa, it is fixed right away. Likewise, every child is recoverable.\n\nThe people in Cometa don\u2019t only treasure beauty, they assume it. In a world of distrust and betrayal, they assume there is beauty in each person and in every situation, so they lead with an almost unnerving level of hospitality.\n\nThe vocational high school curriculum is built around the idea that machines will soon be doing most physical tasks, but no machine will be able to create the feeling of a loving home.

And the Jews of Israel are highly aware of our role as a small link in a long chain of Jewish history. We are modern Israelis, of course, but our consciousness is one of ancient Jews. In survey after survey, more Israelis choose \u201cJewish\u201d over \u201cIsraeli\u201d as their main identity. And by this they do not refer to a religion (Judaism) but to a nation (the Jewish people).\n\nThus, when celebrating 70 years of statehood, we Jews must engage in a kind of balancing act. On one hand, we need to appreciate the great achievement of building this Jewish homeland in such a short time in such a hostile environment. On the other hand, we need to grasp the smallness of this achievement in the scheme of Jewish history.\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah described the Babylonian exile as a 70-year affair. We consider that short. In the second century BCE, the Hasmonean kingdom, widely viewed as the last period of Jewish political autonomy before the founding of Israel, lasted for about eight decades before it became client of the Romans. This kingdom is still today a source of Jewish pride, but it is also a cautionary tale: Most Israelis plan for a future that extends much further than merely another decade of statehood.\n\nSo being the luckiest Jew ever is a blessing and a burden. The more we have, the more obligated we are to guard it and the more afraid we are to lose it. We\u2019re afraid for psychological reasons: Jews thought they were lucky in the past, and it often ended badly for them (remember Germany in the early 20th century). But we are also afraid because of indisputably dangerous circumstances: There are people out there who want to harm us, deny us what we have and destroy us, from Iranian leaders to Palestinian extremists to anti-Semites around the world.\n\nAnd Israel faces other challenges, some of which are familiar to many countries: economic inequality, populism, homegrown radicalism and illegal immigration. Not even the lucky Jew can ignore these and other challenges that hover like clouds over the future of Jewish sovereignty and success.\n\nStill, Israelis tend to be hopeful. In a survey taken a year ago, 73 percent of Israeli Jews said they were optimistic \u201cabout Israel\u2019s future.\u201d They must see something beyond the challenges that makes them so confident. One of them, I believe, is this sense of being lucky, of being born at such a good time.", "title": "Opinion | The Luckiest Jews in History", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "Design-wise, the most famous collaboration between a writer and a photographer did not end up looking like much of a collaboration at all. Walker Evans contributed a preface to the 1960 reissue of \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,\u201d the study of poor tenant farmers in Alabama, originally published in 1941; \u201cWalker\u201d crops up a number of times in James Agee\u2019s text, but a formal separation is maintained between the tenderly austere photographs of families and their homes \u2014 printed at the beginning \u2014 and the 400 pages of Agee\u2019s highly wrought, much-agonized-over text. This, for Gore Vidal, was no bad thing, because it left Evans\u2019s \u201caustere\u201d photos untainted by what \u201cgood-hearted, soft-headed admirers of the Saint James (Agee) version\u201d so loved about the sharecroppers\u2019 gospel.\n\nWhen it comes to the relationship between a critic or curator writing about photographers or photography, the results span the spectrum of exclusion, segregation and integration. There is not a single photograph in Susan Sontag\u2019s classic \u201cOn Photography.\u201d At the other extreme, the exquisite silence of the plates in lavish monographs is sometimes protected by only the slimmest prefaces or afterwords. At all points in between, the word-image ratio shifts constantly between the writing informing the pictures and the pictures illustrating the writing. But there is one form \u2014 the simplest in many ways \u2014 that permits and encourages a uniquely intimate relationship between writer and photographer.\n\nJohn Szarkowski was for many years the head of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 2000, in the twilight of a provocative, highly influential career, he published \u201cAtget,\u201d a selection of 100 images by the French photographer Eug\u00e8ne Atget, each reproduced on the recto page with an accompanying caption-essay on the facing verso page. With Szarkowski as the best kind of guide \u2014 one whose itinerary allows interludes of undisturbed contemplation \u2014 we wind our way through the haunts of old Paris, emerging from time-shuttered streets into the open skies of the surrounding countryside. Szarkowski had always been a distinctive stylist, but this format enabled him to give free rein to his talents as a writer, which were usually securely tethered by curatorial obligation. He also drew confidence, I think, from an earlier assay at the same form, \u201cLooking at Photographs\u201d (1973), in which he used a single picture by each of the most important photographers in the museum\u2019s holdings to compile a radically synecdochic survey of the medium\u2019s history. The obligation to cover so much ground, to balance what he had to say about so many major figures on such slender plinths, rather limited Szarkowski\u2019s range of literary and thematic movement. With Atget \u2014 whose photographs, appropriately enough, were originally offered as \u201cDocuments for Artists\u201d \u2014 the combination of abundance of subject matter and limited space encouraged a kind of tight flourishing or contained extravagance. Szarkowski\u2019s knowledge of Atget\u2019s work was so extensive that he had scarcely even to think about what he knew. And so the photographs serve as starting-off points for reflections on all sorts of things, including how photography has changed our view of the world: \u201cI do not think that empty chairs meant the same thing before photography as they mean to us now.\u201d\n\nThere is something so harmonious about this many-leveled marriage \u2014 of self-contained essay with self-contained image, of art book with literary text \u2014 that I am surprised by the relative paucity of other examples. Stretching things a bit, you could include \u201cFlickers\u201d (1995), in which Gilbert Adair reproduced and wrote about \u2014 or, more accurately, around \u2014 a single still from one film from each of the hundred years since the invention of cinema. The year 1968 is represented by Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d which \u201cif it is wanting in anything, it is, paradoxically, in a sense of space.\u201d Moving beyond photography, there is the poet Mark Strand\u2019s wonderful little book on Edward Hopper (1994), in which each discrete unit of text focuses on a single painting. Analysis of Hopper\u2019s formal geometry gradually gives way to a narrative in which we see how the figure in \u201cHotel Window\u201d of 1955, for example, finds \u201ca resting place within a moment that is wholly transitional.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDialogue between word and image does not always require two voices, two actors. Joel Sternfeld\u2019s \u201cOn This Site\u201d (1996) comprises photographs of innocuous places; the facing paragraphs of text, also by the photographer, set out the terrible things that happened at each of these unmarked sites. The photographs are not just changed by the accompanying words; the words are like a final stage in the process of development and printing by which an image comes fully into being. Fittingly, this volume was followed by \u201cSweet Earth\u201d (2006), which depicts and offers a history of experimental utopias in America. The dialogue between image and text in each book is complemented by the dialogue between the two books: on the one hand, a dark testament to the enduring capacity of humans to inflict harm; on the other, a perpetual attempt to achieve social ideals \u2014 even if those very ideals condemn a particular enterprise to eventual failure.", "title": "The Magic of Books Where Photography Meets Essays", "authors": ["Geoff Dyer", "On Photography"]}

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nA couple of months after the lawsuit was filed, I paid a visit to the White House to inform Hope Hicks that I wanted to write about Scavino and his value to the president. Hicks was not enthusiastic. The story had already been done, she maintained vaguely, before adding that Scavino was himself unlikely to pull back the curtain any further about his life \u2014 and besides, she hastened to assure me, there really wasn\u2019t much of a curtain to pull back. (Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.) Dan, she said, was simply a selfless public servant who worked tirelessly for the president of the United States. As to his actual value, Hicks offered a curious descriptor I would also hear from several others: Scavino was \u201cthe conductor of the Trump Train.\u201d\n\nFor those who have forgotten the history of that particular phrase, the \u201cTrump Train\u201d began early in the campaign as a quixotic rallying cry. At the time, Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions seemed like a populist burlesque rather than anything that could seriously be called a political movement. But the reality-TV star\u2019s fan base continued to grow, in defiance of polling and Beltway groupthink and in direct proportion (or so it seemed) to his mounting pile of scandals and outr\u00e9 policy proposals. The Trump Train, it soon became clear, was a juggernaut, and before long the phrase became second only to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d as Trump fans\u2019 most cherished meme.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn hindsight, the phrase\u2019s rise is also a good illustration of why Scavino, as the behind-the-scenes cheerleader and relentless documentarian of the Trump movement, deserves significant credit for its success. Perhaps the most profound effect of Scavino\u2019s countless iPhone videos and photos is that they served as proof to so-called \u201cshy Trump supporters\u201d that they were not alone \u2014 that they were in fact (regardless of what the mainstream media reported) poised to make history. As Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s senior communications adviser, puts it: \u201cYou could make the case that without Dan fulfilling his core mission of conveying the excitement, people wouldn\u2019t have realized that they were part of a movement. It was absolutely critical in encouraging people to turn out.\u201d\n\nBut now that they had turned out for Trump and he was America\u2019s 45th president, what did he still need Scavino for? I spent the next six months trying to find out, even as the ranks of \u201coriginals\u201d dwindled. Keith Schiller left in September. Soon after Hope Hicks exited the building on March 29, Scavino \u2014 now the longest-tenured Trump employee in the White House \u2014 took over her office, just outside the Oval. By these measures, he was one of the most powerful people in Washington, despite the fact that no one could explain what Scavino did for a living.\n\nBack in November 2013, before Twitter had fully transformed into the cesspool of outrage and vitriol it is today, a 37-year-old man named Dan Scavino decided to post his own contribution to a trending hashtag, #MentionSomeoneYoureThankfulFor.\n\n\u201cSimple!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would not be where I am today w/o him. Thank you @realDonaldTrump!!\u201d\n\nScavino was then leading the placid life of a suburban striver. Together with his wife of 13 years, their two sons and two Portuguese water dogs, he lived in a four-bedroom house in Dutchess County, N.Y., looking out onto the sixth hole of the neighborhood golf course. An English schoolteacher\u2019s son, he had played tight end and defensive end on his high school football team the year they won state and had kissed the ring of Pope John Paul II. He had in fact twice finagled front-row seats to see the pope, just as he had talked his way into a sales job at Coca-Cola while polishing the company president\u2019s golf clubs during his summer employment as a caddy. His genial hustling had earned him minor celebrity upstate: Scavino frequently dropped in on the studio of the K104.7 \u201cWoodman in the Morning\u201d radio show, and as a philanthropically minded Catholic, he could be counted on to judge a charity cupcake contest and to walk the runway in a \u201cBest Legs in the Hudson Valley\u201d competition.\n\nBut what propelled Scavino\u2019s ascent more than any other factor was his relationship with Donald Trump. The two first met in 1990, when Scavino was a teenage caddy at a Westchester County course that Trump would eventually purchase and rename the Trump National Golf Club. Scavino carried Trump\u2019s clubs, earning a $200 tip from the developer \u2014 who later in the club\u2019s Grille Room told the caddy, \u201cYou are going to work for me one day.\u201d\n\nScavino went on to major in communications at the State University of New York in Plattsburgh; he did a six-month internship at Walt Disney World, then later got a job with the Texas-based Galderma Laboratories as a pharmaceutical rep; he married and settled down. But throughout it all, he held onto the two hundred-dollar bills that Trump had given him. When that same Westchester golf club, which now bore the billionaire\u2019s name, offered Scavino a job as an assistant manager in 2004, he accepted. Four years later, he was the club\u2019s general manager, whizzing around America in the big man\u2019s private plane. After a brief and not altogether successful stint running his own consulting firm, Scavino reached out to Trump\u2019s son Eric in November 2014 to see if he could come back into the fold. On Nov. 8, having heard the rumors of a possible presidential bid, Scavino buttonholed his old boss at Eric\u2019s wedding and said, \u201cWhen you run, I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nWhat Scavino was offering were the services of a registered independent who had no experience in politics. He had only one qualification: He was a Trump die-hard. Lewandowski hired him on the spot. In June 2015, the two men, along with Hicks and the political adviser Sam Nunberg, moved into a cramped office on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. Scavino\u2019s first assignment was to try to find big-ticket contributors to Trump\u2019s campaign, an effort that proved fruitless, as the Republican donor class did not take his candidacy seriously. Scavino would later be enjoined to cultivate relationships within the Republican National Committee, which at that time viewed the bombastic New York businessman and reality-TV star with eye-rolling skepticism. He had no luck with that effort either.\n\nA more suitable job for Scavino materialized shortly after Trump\u2019s formal announcement of his candidacy on June 16, 2015. The campaign had been trying to curry favor with the powerful publisher Joe McQuaid, whose endorsement in The New Hampshire Union Leader was among the most highly coveted in the early primary states. But this charm offensive threatened to come undone when, during Ivanka Trump\u2019s visit on June 24 to announce the opening of a campaign office in Manchester, McQuaid\u2019s daughter was unable to get her photo taken with the socialite. Trump was infuriated when he learned of this. To prevent similar dust-ups in the future, Scavino had another duty added to his portfolio: going to the early primary states to tend to the needs of the local kingmakers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this new role, as with so many of his roles for Trump over the years, Scavino continued to serve as a kind of caddy. He went on food runs for the candidate to McDonald\u2019s and KFC. He faithfully typed out Trump\u2019s tweets as the candidate dictated them. He also wandered the events, climbed the rafters and snapped smartphone pictures, which he then posted on both his and the campaign\u2019s various social-media accounts. It happened that the campaign already had a professional photographer on the payroll. But this was becoming a liability, in that she tended to take hundreds of images at each event, and the candidate would insist on spending hours of valuable time poring over every last one of them. The campaign did nominally have a social media specialist \u2014 Justin McConney, son of the Trump Organization\u2019s controller \u2014 but he lacked Scavino\u2019s instinct for the base, and in any event, McConney was stationed back at Trump Tower, away from the real action on the campaign trail. By early 2016, Scavino had become in essence both the Trump campaign\u2019s traveling photographer and its social media chieftain. And because the self-funding candidate had no intention of spending a dime on media coverage, Scavino with his Facebook videography also became the closest thing the Trump campaign had to an in-house ad maker.\n\nScavino\u2019s willingness to take on other people\u2019s online grunt work made him indispensable to the campaign. Early in the primary, the candidate\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, argued to Trump that Facebook was much more powerful than his preferred platform, Twitter. \u201cEvery Facebook user is probably worth 10 to 12 times more than one of your Twitter followers,\u201d Kushner told him. \u201cAnd look, I think your Facebook page is totally underutilized.\u201d The candidate responded, \u201cCongratulations, then \u2014 you\u2019re now in charge of my Facebook.\u201d Kushner turned around and handed over that job to Scavino.\n\nEven as Scavino\u2019s deployment of campaign imagery onto Facebook helped accelerate the Trump Train, it was Twitter, with its visceral impact, that remained Trump\u2019s abiding love. \u201cSomebody said I\u2019m the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters,\u201d he crowed during an event in South Carolina in November 2015. (The \u201csomebody\u201d was most likely one of his employees.) On his plane or in limousines, he would dictate tweets for Scavino to post. Others, including Scavino, would goad Trump with their own suggestions. (Hope Hicks would supply the choicest put-downs, recalls a former campaign official: \u201cShe\u2019d have absolute daggers.\u201d) Trump would give his missive a final read to make sure that it had not been watered down, and Scavino would hit \u201cTweet.\u201d\n\nNow and again, Trump would enlist Scavino \u2014 whose followers today exceed 475,000 \u2014 to act as a proxy, attacking the campaign\u2019s enemies from his own account. At other times, Scavino took the initiative himself. Before long, the personal feed that had once been a totem of cornball folksiness included harsh attacks on Megyn Kelly, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz and other perceived antagonists. In March 2016, Scavino retweeted a conspiracy video purporting to demonstrate that Cruz was having an affair with a former aide, Amanda Carpenter. Carpenter, who is married with children, went on the air and heatedly denied any impropriety. She also condemned Scavino by name, calling his attack a \u201csmear job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a campaign, and they fight dirty, and they didn\u2019t mind if I was collateral damage in the process,\u201d Carpenter told me. \u201cAnd they won. And no consequences. What Scavino did to me and what he still does to others would get any other professional fired. In Trump\u2019s universe, it\u2019s a qualification. A willingness to engage in lies and smears on behalf of Donald Trump is a sign of loyalty that Trump treasures.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great that I have Twitter now, because I can knock the crap out of people,\u201d Donald Trump told me one afternoon in late March 2016 at his South Florida country club Mar-a-Lago. \u201cI have my own printing press now!\u201d he added with Falstaffian relish.\n\nStill, nothing in Trump\u2019s earliest social media forays would prefigure the towering role that Twitter eventually played in his political branding. Trump opened his @realDonaldTrump account in March 2009, only to ignore it for the better part of two years. Giving in to the urging of his political advisers Roger Stone and Sam Nunberg, Trump began to tweet about his hotel properties and his TV show. Soon he offered up sundry nuggets on his importance to the Yankees (\u201cThey always win when I am there\u201d) and on how to succeed in life (\u201cShow me someone without an ego, and I\u2019ll show you a loser\u201d). Like a fading matinee idol, Trump had an embarrassing tendency to preen, particularly once his musings turned to politics, around the run-up to the 2012 election. \u201cMy daughter Ivanka thinks I should run for president,\u201d he tweeted on Jan. 25 of that year. \u201cMaybe I should listen.\u201d (\u201cHe\u2019d be phenomenal!\u201d Ivanka exclaimed in the linked Hollywood Life article.)\n\nOf course, at that point the microblogging platform played a marginal-at-best role in American political life, even less so in presidential politics. Barack Obama was a reluctant pioneer in this regard. Tweets from his @POTUS account would undergo a policy and legal vetting process, and it could sometimes take days or even weeks before they were finally posted. The thought of using Twitter as a political cudgel \u201cwould have been completely against our values,\u201d says Macon Phillips, Obama\u2019s first digital director. \u201cI think I would have left. I think a lot of us would have.\u201d\n\nAt the time he announced his candidacy in the summer of 2015, Trump himself was unsure of the role Twitter would play in his campaign. His tweets then seemed to demonstrate only the fundamental unseriousness of his presidential ambitions. As the campaign wore on, however, the candidate\u2019s online disparagements no longer suggested a man bent on self-immolation. Rather, they reinforced the campaign talking point that here, at long last, was an honest politician who did not bother to conceal his lesser angels. His incessant howling of personal grievance only helped to show that the aloof titan of Fifth Avenue, mythologized in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d had a tender underbelly. In baring his smallness, the billionaire New York developer managed to collapse the differences between his gilded life and that of white Middle America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday Trump has not so much drained Washington\u2019s swamp as convulsed it with daily electroshocks of presidential id. Journalists now routinely awaken to the sound of a notification on their smartphones, telling them that the president is already up and driving the news in 280-character gonzo fusillades. A far more common spectacle today than a legislative signing ceremony is the image of House Speaker Paul Ryan facing the microphones and, with a mortician\u2019s smile, trying to explain away his party leader\u2019s latest tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s what he does. We\u2019ve kind of learned to live with it.\u201d (Or maybe not: Ryan made it less than halfway through Trump\u2019s first term before announcing his retirement from Congress.) The question of whether Trump\u2019s social media outbursts constitute actual news has been rendered moot by his front-page-worthy announcements on Twitter: that his secretary of Veterans Affairs has been replaced, that he considers his own attorney general \u201cbeleaguered,\u201d that \u201ctrade wars are good,\u201d that \u201cDACA is dead.\u201d The Trump presidency\u2019s defining feature \u2014 its resolute abnormality \u2014 is above all the handiwork of @realDonaldTrump. It therefore stands to reason that Trump\u2019s most valued aide is the one whose job description has no precedent.\n\nScavino\u2019s importance to the president certainly helps explain how he has managed to survive a succession of internecine bloodlettings in the West Wing. But it\u2019s also the case that he is well liked among his colleagues, several of whom offered to help me understand his intrinsic value. Typically such efforts descended into clich\u00e9: \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s as hard-working or as loyal.\u201d \u201cThe one guy who outworked me.\u201d \u201cThe president has zero concern that Dan has any interest in anything but serving him.\u201d \u201cYou never see Dan out there hogging the limelight.\u201d One senior White House official told me that the president trusts Scavino when it comes to personnel decisions. \u201cDan\u2019s a very good judge of people,\u201d he told me. When I asked if he could supply me with any examples of Scavino\u2019s advice-giving, the official replied coolly, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d But one longtime friend of Scavino\u2019s offered an illuminating analogy. \u201cGolf is a sport of the least mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how someone like Dan might float to the top \u2014 by not doing anything wrong.\u201d\n\nOne of Scavino\u2019s main roles is the care and feeding of his boss\u2019s ego. He has learned how to fend off any negativity with a ready supply of superlatives. While Hope Hicks would inform Trump about how some matter might be playing in the mainstream media, Scavino, Hicks told me, would \u201ctell him how things are playing with his people. That\u2019s a gauge for him that the president takes seriously.\u201d Checking in with the base is as easy as looking at his phone. Scavino\u2019s old friend offered an example: \u201cDan would scroll through his Twitter feed and if Franklin Graham says something particularly complimentary, he\u2019ll say, \u2018Look what Franklin Graham just wrote.\u2019 Or if [CNN show host] Brian Stelter says something particularly stupid, he\u2019ll run over and say, \u2018Look what Fake News is doing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore than anyone else in the White House, the director of social media spends his day online, monitoring the #MAGA congregation. \u201cDan talks to the base more than anybody else after the president,\u201d one senior White House official told me. \u201cHe\u2019s the conductor of the Trump Train, and these people know he\u2019s true blue, and he also knows all the influencers.\u201d A year ago, the former chief strategist Steve Bannon shared a West Wing office with Scavino. \u201cHe has his hands on the Pepes,\u201d Bannon recalls, referring to the cartoon frog that serves as mascot to the alt-right. \u201cHe knew who the players were and who were not. He\u2019d bring me Cernovich \u2014 I didn\u2019t know who Cernovich was until Scavino told me.\u201d Bannon was referring to the alt-right blogger Mike Cernovich, who has frequently promoted debunked and scurrilous conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen I asked Cernovich about his relationship with Scavino, he claimed they had none. \u201cNo, never met him, never emailed with him, never D.M.\u2019ed with him, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever tweeted at me,\u201d Cernovich said. In fact, by Cernovich\u2019s standards, the Trump social media director was something of a lightweight. \u201cScavino\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d he said disapprovingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wakes up and says, \u2018Holy hell, I want to break things today \u2014 who do I go after?\u2019 It\u2019s more, \u2018I like my job and the Trump family.\u2019 \u201d Still, Cernovich acknowledged that Scavino had most likely served as a conduit between the alt-right and Trump, if only through his eagerness to bring passionate fans to his boss\u2019s attention.\n\nSince arriving in the nation\u2019s capital, Scavino has kept attacking President Trump\u2019s opponents from his own Twitter account: Nancy Pelosi, Bill Kristol, Kathy Griffin. Last April, he went after Justin Amash, a Republican congressman from Michigan and frequent critic of Trump. Calling Amash \u201ca big liability,\u201d Scavino\u2019s tweet urged, \u201c#TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary.\u201d Not easily intimidated, Amash replied, \u201cBring it on.\u201d But what instead was brought on was an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which concluded that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act, the law that forbids engaging in political activity while acting in your capacity as a government employee. On June 5, the O.S.C. disclosed that it had put Scavino on notice. Though its statement made clear that future violations could result in harsher punishment, it neglected to say that only one individual could mete out that punishment: the president of the United States.\n\nThe full extent of Scavino\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s Twitter regimen has never been fully disclosed. White House officials initially maintained to me that he only typed and posted verbatim what Trump dictated to him, while occasionally contributing anodyne tweets relating to the president\u2019s schedule. (\u201cNews conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.\u201d) Somewhat begrudgingly, one senior official did not deny that Scavino also sometimes corrected Trump\u2019s spelling errors. But the Knight Institute lawsuit had named Scavino, Hicks and Sanders because, as communications staff members, they are likely to \u201csuggest content\u201d for Trump\u2019s tweets, just as Trump\u2019s subordinates did during the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn particular, said one individual who witnessed this interactivity on the campaign trail and another who saw it in the White House, Scavino frequently supplied the litany of details in Trump\u2019s tweets about, say, claims of Crooked Hillary\u2019s various malfeasances or of the F.B.I.\u2019s corrupt activity. \u201cFifty percent of the time, Trump is ripping these out himself, and 50 percent is going to Scavino,\u201d one of them told me.\n\nEvidence of Scavino\u2019s active participation in Trump\u2019s tweets emerged last autumn. On the morning of Oct. 4, Scavino posted to his own account one of the social media director\u2019s usual rants against the media: \u201cNBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!\u201d One minute later, the identical message was posted on his boss\u2019s account as an original Trump tweet. Scavino hastily deleted his first tweet, but not before eagle-eyed users took screen shots.\n\nNone of this should be so controversial, of course. No one believes that Trump writes the speeches he delivers any more than they believe he wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d And in the end, only a fool would suggest that his tweets represent the essence of someone other than Donald J. Trump. All the same, my suggestion to a senior White House official that Trump might have some help in producing his mini-masterpieces was met with heated indignation. I was insulting the president\u2019s capabilities. I was engaging in rank speculation. I was rewriting American history.\n\nStill, the White House official did not once categorically state that Trump was the sole author of every word of his tweets. And in the meantime, Scavino, in the manner of any caddy who knows his place, continually avoided taking credit. He refused to answer even my basic question: What, exactly, did he do?\n\n\u201cWhen I was a first-year government student,\u201d recalled the former Republican National Committee chairman and Bush strategist Ken Mehlman recently, \u201cone of the first articles we had to read was Norman Mailer\u2019s \u2018Superman Comes to the Supermarket,\u2019 which explained how J.F.K. was the man for the television age. It\u2019s very possible that just as Kennedy possessed unique skills for that age, Donald Trump does for the social media age.\u201d With Twitter, Trump has succeeded in subverting the news media, so-called allies and the annoying constraints of human civility. Trump\u2019s oft-repeated vow that he will never stop tweeting may count as his most rational act as president. It may also explain why Scavino could outlast everyone else in the White House.\n\nHe has outlasted Hope Hicks, who used to steam the president\u2019s pants, and Keith Schiller, who \u2014 as I once witnessed backstage at a campaign event in Buffalo \u2014 used to help apply hair product to the postmodern sculpture atop Trump\u2019s head. Managing Trump\u2019s Twitter account, as it turns out, is an even more intimate act, something only Scavino has ever been trusted with. \u201cI told Dan many times during the campaign, \u2018Once we win, you\u2019ll have an entire team,\u2019 \u201d Corey Lewandowski recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him many times since then, and it\u2019s still a one-man operation.\u201d\n\nOn a recent Monday in late March, I dropped by the West Wing to have one last in-person visit with some of Scavino\u2019s colleagues and hopefully catch a glimpse of the social media director. The evening before, Yashar Ali of The Huffington Post had broken the news that Scavino\u2019s wife, Jennifer, had filed for divorce several weeks earlier. I had heard rumors of the split from a former White House staff member who, while praising Scavino\u2019s crazed work ethic and fealty to Trump, casually added, \u201cBy the way, it also destroyed his marriage.\u201d Scavino had long struggled to balance his ambitions with caring for his wife, who suffers from chronic Lyme disease. That day in the West Wing, he was nowhere to be seen by the time I arrived. Scavino had boarded Air Force One with Trump and flown to Manchester to capture images of the president somberly proposing the death penalty for opioid dealers.\n\nThe personal toll of being Trump\u2019s social media director may not end at Scavino\u2019s marriage. Last December, The Washington Post reported that an executive with Vkontakte, Russia\u2019s version of Facebook, had twice emailed Scavino and Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign, offering to promote Trump\u2019s candidacy on the platform. According to an email read to The Post, Scavino\u2019s response to the American intermediary, Rob Goldstone, was effusive: \u201cPlease feel free to send me whatever you have. Thank you so much for looking out for Mr. Trump and his presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nA month after the Post story, Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Scavino a four-page letter. Noting media reports that Scavino is a \u201cconstant presence at Trump\u2019s side,\u201d Feinstein speculated that Scavino would know about the president\u2019s decision to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey, as well as Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The senator therefore was writing \u201cto request documents and to schedule an interview with you in January 2018.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScavino retained the services of an attorney, who informed Feinstein that Trump\u2019s social media director would not be responding to her requests. Without bipartisan prodding from the Judiciary Committee, and with Trump\u2019s backing, he was free to ignore the Senate inquiry. Still, Scavino\u2019s tweet from November 2013 proved prescient in ways he had not expected: He would not be where he was today without @realDonaldTrump.", "title": "The Man Behind the President\u2019s Tweets", "authors": ["Robert Draper"]}

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "What we are only beginning to understand is why women are more susceptible. What factors differentiate women from men, specifically as we reach middle age?\n\nThe first and most obvious thing is fertility. Women are diverse, but we all experience the decline in fertility and the beginning of menopause.\n\nIt turns out that menopause affects far more than our childbearing potential. Symptoms like night sweats, hot flashes and depression originate not in the ovaries but largely in the brain. These symptoms are all caused by an ebb in estrogen. The latest research, including my own work, indicates that estrogen serves to protect the female brain from aging. It stimulates neural activity and may help prevent the build up of plaques that are connected to the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. When estrogen levels decline, the female brain becomes much more vulnerable.\n\nTo determine this, my colleagues and I used a brain imaging technique called PET on a group of healthy middle-aged women. This allowed us to measure neural activity and the presence of Alzheimer\u2019s plaques. The tests revealed that the women who were postmenopausal had less brain activity and more Alzheimer\u2019s plaques than premenopausal women. More surprising, this was also the case for perimenopausal women \u2014 those who were just starting to experience symptoms of menopause. And both groups\u2019 brains showed even more drastic differences when compared with those of healthy men of the same age.\n\nThe good news is that as women mature into their 40s and 50s, there seems to be a window of opportunity when it is possible to detect early signs of higher Alzheimer\u2019s risk \u2014 by doing a brain-imaging test, as we did \u2014 and to take action to reduce that risk.", "title": "Opinion | The Menopause-Alzheimer\u2019s Connection", "authors": []}

Then he said, \u201cI will hit wherever the manager asks me to.\u201d After 10 games this season, Cespedes had three home runs and 10 runs batted in while hitting second. The Mets, as it happened, won nine of those games. That represented the best start in the 57-year history of the franchise.\n\nAs long as baseball has been played, managers have tried to use information to predict the future. Earl Weaver, who won four pennants with the Baltimore Orioles between 1968 and 1986, tracked how his hitters fared against every opposing pitcher. He used the results to help decide when to employ a pinch-hitter or rest a starter. Tony LaRussa, who began a 33-year managerial career in 1979, kept charts that recorded where batters hit each ball, enabling him to move a center fielder or a shortstop a few steps in one direction or another. He figured if a player did something often enough in a certain situation, there was reason to believe he would probably do it again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose were rudimentary analytics. Mostly, the information that managers relied on came from spending time in a dugout, one inning after the next, for 30, 40, even 50 years. \u201cWhen you watch baseball, you see something new every day,\u201d Pete Rose once told me when he was managing the Cincinnati Reds. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been watching baseball for a lot of days.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, the information available to managers has grown significantly. Much of it comes in the form of computer printouts. Every club now employs a squadron of analysts, at the cost of millions of dollars, which basically makes those years of accumulated baseball smarts a lot less valuable. So it\u2019s understandable that executives spending all that money would want managers adept at receiving that kind of input and passing it along to his players. \u201cThe past few years, you\u2019ve seen managers weeded out of this game,\u201d Brian Cashman, who runs the Yankees, told me recently. \u201cThey weren\u2019t willing to embrace the information that was providing better decision-making. Those guys died off like dinosaurs. The days of ownership, general managers and front-office personnel turning over their entire operation to a manager to run a 25-man roster for six months? Those days are over.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Houston Astros, probably the team that relies most on gathering and interpreting data, won the World Series by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers, who rely on it nearly as much. By the time the off-season began, five managers who had combined for 8,946 games of experience over 58 seasons were let go. The casualties included Joe Girardi, who guided the Yankees to within a game of the World Series. The Boston Red Sox and Washington Nationals won their divisions, yet their managers lost their jobs. Collins was two seasons removed from winning the National League pennant with the Mets in 2015, but that didn\u2019t matter either. And if anyone needed more evidence that the value of managerial intuition was plummeting, none of the men hired to replace them had managed a single day in the majors. Three of the five, Callaway, the Yankees\u2019 Aaron Boone and Washington\u2019s Dave Martinez, hadn\u2019t managed at any level, from Little League to the high minors.\n\nIn December, at baseball\u2019s annual winter meetings, each of the novice managers \u2014 the others are Philadelphia\u2019s Gabe Kapler and Boston\u2019s Alex Cora \u2014 sat before an arc of digital recorders in a ballroom of an Orlando hotel for question after question about analytics and their applications. It was as though the reporters were interviewing currency traders. But an aptitude for analytics isn\u2019t what distinguishes these managers from their predecessors, all of whom were at least conversant in the latest metrics, and it no longer differentiates the various franchises. Everyone generates pretty much the same numbers these days, making it clear enough when to shift the third baseman into short right field for a left-handed hitter, or how much each pitcher\u2019s effectiveness diminishes the third time through a lineup. Many decisions that managers previously made by instinct, from filling out lineup cards to choosing relievers, are now worked out at 10 in the morning, if not the previous week, in an office that probably doesn\u2019t even have a view of the field.\n\nThese days it\u2019s the back end of the process that matters, the translating of those decisions into wins through some combination of teaching, coaxing and encouraging. \u201cThe information you have might be terrific information,\u201d Callaway explained when we discussed his approach. \u201cBut no matter how good it is, if they\u2019re not going to buy into it and have confidence that it will help them? You might as well throw it out the window.\u201d\n\nCallaway pitched in the majors for parts of five seasons, compiling a bloated 6.27 earned run average that made it clear why he didn\u2019t pitch longer. His struggles made him receptive to anything that might lengthen his career, including stints in both Taiwan and Korea. \u201cI didn\u2019t make $50 million,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the best pitcher in the world. Maybe if I had been, I would have a different view. Maybe I would say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to listen to that. I don\u2019t need new information. I\u2019m going to do what I want.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor the past five years, he worked as the Cleveland Indians\u2019 pitching coach. During his tenure, he gained a reputation as an uncanny communicator. \u201cHis ability to connect with people stood out right away,\u201d says Derek Falvey, who supervised Callaway from various executive positions in Cleveland and is now the chief baseball officer of the Minnesota Twins. \u201cWhen you hear him talk,\u201d the Indians pitcher Josh Tomlin says, \u201cyou buy into it.\u201d But Falvey isn\u2019t only referring to conversations with players. Callaway also was skilled at receiving and assimilating information that came from above, even if it was provided by someone who hadn\u2019t ever played the game. That set him apart from the previous generation of managers, many of whom still divide the world into baseball people and everyone else. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the ego that said, \u2018I can handle this,\u2019 \u201d Falvey says. \u201cHe\u2019d say: \u2018That guy has something that can really help our pitching staff. How can I understand and embrace what he\u2019s telling me and then translate that to a player?\u2019 \u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He eventually asked six prospective hires to have preliminary discussions. He envisioned a two- or three-tier process, a series of interviews that would winnow down the candidates until a clear choice emerged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo prepare, Callaway wrote a 7,000-word manifesto outlining his managerial vision. \u201cCollaboration and communication,\u201d he stressed, \u201cwill be the biggest key to our success.\u201d As manager, he promised, he would utilize every possible resource, \u201cwhether it be a coach ... with 40 years\u2019 experience or an analytics intern that we just hired out of college.\u201d He would nurture relationships with players, but he rejected the traditional notion of the \u201cplayer\u2019s manager.\u201d \u201cI will always be good about having the front office\u2019s back when it comes to players,\u201d he wrote.

After starting for much of his first two years in the majors, Gsellman was briefly demoted to the bullpen last season, when a dropping arm caused his trademark sinking fastball not to sink as usual.\n\n\u201cIt moved side to side instead of down,\u201d he said.\n\nSo this off-season, with the help of Cressey and Rye in Jupiter, Fla., and a physical therapist, Judy Seto, the director of sports performance at Select Physical Therapy in Los Angeles, Gsellman fixed his body. A Los Angeles native, Gsellman made three visits a week to work on his right shoulder with Seto, who had supervised his rehabilitation after the surgery on his left shoulder.\n\nRye, who talked to Gsellman last summer about a hamstring strain, drew up an off-season program for Gsellman in person. Rye said past problems with Gsellman\u2019s lower body had affected the way he generated and absorbed the force of pitching. An improvement with his legs would alleviate some stress on his shoulder.\n\nThis winter, Gsellman said, he stopped doing powerlifting moves like traditional squats, and instead emphasized leg workouts that helped both strengthen and loosen his limbs. When he addressed his hamstring deficiency, he said, it helped prevent knee pain he had felt in the past.\n\nGsellman also underwent many massages and did stretching to loosen soft tissue in and around his shoulder.\n\n\u201cIn addition to spending time improving his rotator-cuff strength, we focused on getting his upper back and rib cage to sit and move in better positions, which in turn helped his shoulder,\u201d Rye said.\n\nIt was all eye-opening for Gsellman.\n\n\u201cI wonder sometimes: How did I make it through the minor leagues?\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about my body then.

Administrators waited a week as the occupations and support demonstrations grew, and Columbia became worldwide news. Eventually, the police moved in, arresting the black students without violence. But at the other buildings they indiscriminately and brutally attacked not only the occupiers, but students, professors and even journalists who were outside protesting the police busts. In response most of the student body went out on strike, closing the university for the rest of the semester.\n\nThe central role played by the Student Afro-American Society has never been acknowledged in accounts of Columbia \u201968.

Trump should have learned something from firing James Comey; that misstep didn\u2019t stop the investigation but assured that Comey\u2019s book will be a best seller when it comes out next week, and handed Comey the ABC interview in which he apparently compares Trump to a mob boss.\n\nSadly, that\u2019s an apt comparison. Trump\u2019s ethos, ever since he was first sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in 1973, has been about cutting corners. He got away with it when he was a businessman buying $100,000 worth of pianos and stiffing the seller.\n\nNow his pattern of behavior may finally be catching up with him; he and those around him may rue the day he was elected president. Trump himself is probably protected from indictment under Justice Department guidelines, and people like Paul Manafort may be counting on a pardon, but the political price of pardons will be increasingly costly \u2014 and they won\u2019t provide protection from state prosecutions.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d but it\u2019s actually a \u201ccriminal hunt\u201d \u2014 one presided over by Republicans, most of whom he has appointed.

Viking longhouses were windowless, underfurnished, smoky and probably smelly, given that farm animals slept in them. Noma\u2019s dining room, by contrast, is meticulously carpentered together, from the peaked ceiling to the bare floor, out of sanded oak and Douglas fir. It has spindle-legged, custom-built Danish-modern tables and chairs beside glass walls with a view of the pond and woods. The kitchen, which you can see from the dining room, is well ventilated. From time to time you might hear chords of whatever music the cooks are listening to. The animals living inside the complex \u2014 king crabs and mollusks in shades of pink and aquamarine generally seen only on the residents of Bikini Bottom \u2014 are kept in tanks with no noticeable odor. The 42 or so diners are typically well groomed and carefully, if not formally, dressed. Although they are not given to marauding and pillaging, they are not particularly solemn, either.

You will not see one, but if you see greenhouses and a long concrete bunker built into a 17th-century earthen rampart, you are in the right place.

How do you maintain standards of excellence amid the democratization of control? How do you get loosely affiliated people to commit long term, so your movement won\u2019t fizzle out, the way the Ice Bucket Challenge did?\n\nHeimans and Timms emphasize that the best organizations try to blend old and new power structures.\n\nThese organizations are often founded by what you might call disappearing organizers. Somebody comes up with a compelling concept, like TED or Black Lives Matter. The concept gives people a sticky group identity; many people think of themselves as Tedsters. The core idea is spreadable, actionable and connected \u2014 it allows participants to subcreate in local and flexible ways. Tedsters organize and attend over 20,000 local TEDx events. The founder doesn\u2019t dominate the network so much as manage the community.\n\nSuccessful movements create what Marilynn Brewer calls \u201coptimal distinctiveness\u201d \u2014 as Heimans and Timms put it, \u201cmaking people feel like they are part of it and that they can stand out in it.\u201d\n\nThe concepts binding these movements are clear, emotional and concrete and have an implied communal narrative (MeToo). But the successful organizations also feature some structural innovation. They tend to have very low barriers to entry \u2014 no dues, no loyalty pledge up front. But they have ways to incentivize members up the participation ladder, offering premiums for super-participants who adapt, organize and share. The Lego company sets up special events and an ambassador network for its highly dedicated AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego).\n\nAt the Dutch news organization De Correspondent, journalists share story ideas with subscribers before they write them, so they can harvest community knowledge. Heimans and Timms point out that Donald Trump also blends old and new power. He may talk like an authoritarian \u2014 only I can fix this \u2014 but his actual campaign structure was a loose network of self-organizing activists. Trump is what they call a \u201cplatform strongman\u201d \u2014 someone who marshals dispersed participants on behalf of centralizing ends.\n\nThe last few decades have been a social trust apocalypse. The only remaining bonds of trust are local and particular. But people are ingenious. They are figuring out how to build on those ties to weave and redeem the broader social fabric.\n\nI realize my column these days is bipolar, wildly optimistic or pessimistic.

How do you convey chaos?\n\nChaos versus beauty is built into the piece based on this power struggle idea. And for me, the chaos part is not knowing exactly what is going to happen. It becomes chaotic until it is released in the other world, on the other side.\n\nDoes tranquillity win out on the other side?\n\nI think that\u2019s up to each person who listens.

The same is true for some older contestants, like Marcio Donaldson, a tender soul singer who in early appearances seemed as if he might shatter, and Ada Vox, a drag queen with a gargantuan voice who auditioned in earlier seasons as Adam Sanders. (The celebration of Ms. Vox; Ms. Perry\u2019s casual use of queer slang; and the showcasing of the same-sex marriage of Jurnee, one of the finalists, are far leaps for a show that always emphasized heteronormativity, and whose most famous gay contestants, Clay Aiken and Adam Lambert, didn\u2019t come out until after their time on the show.)\n\nIn later seasons of \u201cIdol,\u201d and subsequently on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d these contestant arcs were replaced by judge dramatics. \u201cThe Voice\u201d especially showed that pop stars, if they took the judging chair, would not just be the arbiters of a competition but also stars of their own weekly sitcom.\n\nThe new \u201cIdol\u201d acknowledges this shift without crumbling under it. Ms. Perry is a talented physical comedian and a ham willing to wail over her purported contestant crushes, though as a judge, she\u2019s especially tough on the young female performers. Mr. Bryan is especially tough on the English language; as a judge, he\u2019s Randy Jackson reincarnate.\n\nMr. Richie is the shepherd of this uncertain flock. He is the most firm with criticism, and also the most generous with praise. In the early rounds especially, particularly when the auditioners were young black men, he slipped into a paternal role, offering firm encouragement and stories from the Commodores\u2019 glory (and not-so-glory) days.

During some of the recent rounds, he sported glasses and a fine coat of stubble on his face, distancing tools (though both were gone for Sunday\u2019s live show).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow that the season is at its halfway point, the cracks in the show\u2019s alleged star-making process are becoming clear. Thriving in a series of singing-competition performances is a stand-alone skill that has little to do with music-industry viability (See: most winners of \u201cIdol\u201d and every winner of \u201cThe Voice\u201d). Take Michael J. Woodard, a guileless young singer bursting with energy and equally comfortable with show tunes and dramatic dance music. When Bobby Bones, the country radio D.J. and a guest mentor, tried to shove him into a genre box, he chose \u201calternative R&B,\u201d which isn\u2019t nearly the half of it.\n\nAnd as the season progresses, even the most idiosyncratic singers get good at \u201cIdol\u201d-style performances. They mistake sobriety for maturity, and tend toward the mean, losing the quirks that made them stand out in the auditions.\n\nThis was particularly grueling during the duets round, a new innovation this season in which contestants perform with professional singers who could still benefit from the broad-scale exposure \u201cIdol\u201d offers \u2014 Colbie Caillat, Bishop Briggs, someone named Banners, and also Luis Fonsi, more famous than all of the others combined and quadrupled (in Spanish). For those sturdy in their identity, like the Southern rocker Cade Foehner, this was manageable, but others on less steady ground faded into anonymity.\n\nThat round spelled doom for some of the competition\u2019s best pure singers, like Alyssa Raghu, whose initial audition with Ariana Grande and Nathan Sykes\u2019s \u201cAlmost Is Never Enough\u201d was disarmingly mature, and Shannon O\u2019Hara, whose version of Patty Griffin\u2019s \u201cUp to the Mountain\u201d in the Hollywood Week solo rounds had glorious heft. (Somehow, the dynamic Thaddeus Johnson had already been eliminated by this point, following a sterling gospel version of Ms. Perry\u2019s \u201cRise.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps those early exits merely prove the show\u2019s lie \u2014 that talent is at its center, and there is an abundance of it this year. But again, it is talent suited to a television screen. In addition to the duets, the other significant change to the show from the original is how the herd is culled. In the past, finalists were generally sent packing one at a time in a slow drip that could be dull before it was thrilling. But \u201cIdol\u201d has thickened the middle and rushed the end. This week, in the first public vote of the season, the 14 finalists will be whittled to 10, and in just four weeks the new \u201cIdol\u201d winner will be crowned.\n\nIn the old system, a contestant like Gabby Barrett, a nuclear-warhead singer aimed directly at country radio, might have had the leg up. The shortened format might favor someone less expected \u2014 someone who isn\u2019t inclined to use the show as a step toward a mainstream music career (though the winner gets a guaranteed contract with Hollywood Records, a pop-leaning label) but rather as a distraction on the way to a quieter kind of fame.", "title": "The New \u2018American Idol\u2019: Youth Gone Wild and an Understanding Dad", "authors": ["Jon Caramanica"]}

Instead, he would go to one of the many weekend gun shows around Dallas and take advantage of the so-called gun show loophole to buy firearms from private sellers without a background check or proof of citizenship.\n\nHe would drive back to Mexico with about a dozen guns hidden in refrigerators and stoves in the back of his truck, and sell the weapons in his hometown, a few hours south of the Rio Grande. His most requested weapon, he told me, was the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he could buy for as little as $500 and sell for five times that.

That research reveals an overwhelming consensus that transgender people who have adequate access to health care can and do function effectively.\n\nThe What We Know Project, a research initiative I lead at Cornell\u2019s Center for the Study of Inequality, recently completed one of the largest comprehensive literature reviews to date on the well-being of people who underwent gender transition (which typically involves some combination of hormone therapy and surgery). The advantage of this approach is that a global database search returns the full universe of research on a given topic, making it less likely that results are biased by the selective use of outlier studies.\n\nOur findings make it indisputable that gender transition has a positive effect on transgender well-being. We identified 56 studies published since 1991 that directly assessed the effect of gender transition on the mental well-being of transgender individuals. The vast majority of the studies, 93 percent, found that gender transition improved the overall well-being of transgender subjects, making them more likely to enjoy improved quality of life, greater relationship satisfaction and higher self-esteem and confidence, and less likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, substance abuse and suicidality.\n\nOnly four studies (7 percent) reported mixed or null findings, and none found that the transitioning created more harm than good. Despite recent media focus on anecdotes about \u201ctransgender regret,\u201d actual regret rates across numerous studies were minuscule, generally ranging from 0.3 percent to 3.8 percent. Our review of primary research confirmed the positive findings of at least 16 previous literature reviews.\n\nThe research shows that gender transition improves well-being, and that it can redress the specific health conditions that the military claims are its primary concern, particularly suicidality. A 1999 United States study found a \u201cmarked decrease of suicide attempts\u201d and substance use in its postoperative population. In a 2014 British study, gender transition \u201cwas shown to drastically reduce instances of suicidal ideation and attempts.\u201d The study reported that \u201c67 percent of respondents thought about suicide more before they transitioned and only 3 percent thought about suicide more post-transition.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Pentagon Is Wrong.

Untold before now, there\u2019s a fundamental flaw in the way the United States military screens claims of civilian casualties that surely deflates the total numbers.\n\nThis flaw in accounting for civilian casualties is easily identifiable and highly correctable. And the failure to have fixed it by now means that the Pentagon is probably about to run into a problem on Capitol Hill. Congress, in a new statutory requirement, has called on the Pentagon to send a list of all United States military operations during the past year that were \u201cconfirmed, or reasonably suspected, to have resulted in civilian casualties.\u201d That mandate is likely to bring the flaw into focus.\n\nExperts have long distrusted the Pentagon\u2019s civilian casualty numbers. They point to a staggering discrepancy between official United States statistics and the findings of well-respected nongovernmental organizations like Airwars, which independently track civilian casualties following coalition airstrikes. An on-the-ground investigation, published in The New York Times Magazine late last year, sent reverberations throughout the Defense Department and among former United States officials. Investigative reporters who went to Iraq found that the actual number of strikes resulting in civilian casualties may be as much as 31 times higher than the coalition\u2019s data.\n\nMaybe these independent analyses are too high and the true numbers are somewhere in the middle.

In December, the software developer Qihoo 360 angered many internet users when a blogger discovered that the company was taking surveillance footage from restaurants and gyms in Beijing and broadcasting it without permission onto its platform.\n\nThe rising public anger is taking place amid a similar debate in the United States, over Facebook. But Beijing officials keep the volume lower because personal data is broadly available to another powerful constituency: the Chinese government. Tech companies cooperate with the police in handing over information, with few questions asked. Citizens are resigned to the fact that they are tracked by the government, and there is little pushback about the increased state of surveillance.\n\nSo six months ago, Mr. Deng started buying people\u2019s information, using the Chinese messaging app QQ to reach sellers. He said that the data was easy to find and that he paid a total of $800 for people\u2019s names, genders, phone numbers, online shopping records, travel itineraries, license plate numbers \u2014 at a cost at just over a tenth of a penny per person.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe said he knew he was breaking the law.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "A year after the fall of France, in the spring of 1941, Arendt emigrated to the United States. Through her prolific essays, she began building a reputation as a penetrating thinker with an urbane and unceremonious style that she would attribute to her zest for \u201cpearl diving\u201d in history. Tradition having been shattered by the calamitous events of the 20th century, she saw her task as plucking the precious bits from time\u2019s waves and subjecting them to her critical thinking, without pretending they could be melded back into any grand, systemic whole. She warned her audience that if they attempted to practice her \u201ctechnique of dismantling,\u201d they had to be \u201ccareful not to destroy the \u2018rich and strange,\u2019 the \u2018coral\u2019 and the \u2018pearls,\u2019 which can probably be saved only as fragments.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nIn New York, Arendt\u2019s intellectual acuity and conversational punch swiftly translated into social cachet. After meeting her at a dinner party in the mid-1940s, the literary critic Alfred Kazin was smitten: \u201cDarkly handsome, bountifully interested in everything, this 40-year-old German refugee with a strong accent and such intelligence \u2014 thinking positively cascades out of her in waves,\u201d he wrote in his diary. Though she would only fully embrace the principle of amor mundi, love of the world, after contending philosophically with the cataclysm of World War II, the insatiable curiosity was there early on. \u201cI believe it is very likely that men, if they ever should lose their ability to wonder and thus cease to ask unanswerable questions, also will lose the faculty of asking the answerable questions upon which every civilization is founded,\u201d she declared in one address. Arendt\u2019s sheer delight in intellectual speculation counterpoints her intense ethical commitment to thinking as a form of political engagement.\n\nThe relationship was sometimes uneasy and often controversial, most famously in the case of her account of Adolf Eichmann\u2019s trial in Jerusalem, in which she coined the term \u201cthe banality of evil.\u201d Watching Eichmann testify in his glass booth, Arendt became convinced that he was, above all, an inarticulate buffoon whose wicked deeds resulted from his participation in a bureaucratic structure that dissipated the sense of personal responsibility, and deadened the capacity for cognition. Gershom Scholem, the pioneering scholar of kabbalah, was one of many public intellectuals who felt that Arendt had lost track of the human reality of the Holocaust amid the scintillating twists of her argument. She had failed to reckon with the raw pleasure that playing God over others could afford, and so had overemphasized the role of systemically enforced thoughtlessness in preparing individuals to execute enormous crimes. Recent historical scholarship suggests that Arendt did, indeed, underestimate Eichmann\u2019s ideological passion for National Socialism: Much of his clownish bumbling in Jerusalem may have been a conscious, self-exculpating performance. But her core insight into how even mediocrities can be institutionally benumbed and conscripted into heinous projects remains fertile.\n\nSome of the work anthologized in this volume, edited by Jerome Kohn, comprises Arendt\u2019s responses to current events, like her analysis of the televised 1960 national conventions, in which Kennedy and Nixon were the principal rivals, offering a rather surprising defense of the onscreen experience as a revealing format for viewing those \u201cimponderables of character and personality which make us decide, not whether we agree or disagree with somebody, but whether we can trust him.\u201d Other essays provide deep conceptual etymologies of historical events, key figures and schools of thought. These include her profoundly enlightening study of how Karl Marx fits into the long Western political tradition and her detailed analysis of the challenge that the 1956 Hungarian revolution posed to the Russian military and propagandistic juggernaut. The most dynamic pieces here are Arendt\u2019s interviews, in which the sweep and depth of her ruminations are layered with the caustic wit and engag\u00e9 appeal of her voice. For all Arendt\u2019s opposition to totalitarianism \u2014 and her willingness to implicate Marx in the development of certain totalitarian movements \u2014 Arendt remained unabashedly enamored of Marx\u2019s proposition that \u201cthe philosophers have only interpreted the world. \u2026 The point, however, is to change it.\u201d She relished his determination to wrest higher thought from the supine realm of the Greek symposium and thrust it into the ring of political activism, challenging, as she wrote, \u201cthe philosophers\u2019 resignation to do no more than find a place for themselves in the world, instead of changing the world and making it \u2018philosophical.\u2019\u201d For Arendt, thinking that helped advance the cause of human freedom entailed a form of relentlessly critical examination that imperiled \u201call creeds, convictions and opinions.\u201d There could be no dangerous thoughts simply because thinking itself constituted so dangerous an enterprise.\n\nAlmost every essay in this book contains \u201cpearls\u201d of Arendt\u2019s tonically subversive thinking, and many of her observations push readers to think harder about the language in which political activity is conducted. Reflecting on the numerous allusions to \u201creason of state\u201d that crept into White House discourse after Watergate, she notes how the term became synonymous with national security. \u201cNational security now covers everything,\u201d she commented, including \u201call kinds of crime. For instance, \u2018the president has a right\u2019 is now read in the light of \u2018the king can do no wrong.\u2019\u201d This is no longer a matter of justifying particular crimes, she warns, but rather concerns \u201ca style of politics which in itself is criminal.\u201d The indictment chimes with her taxonomy of the tyrant in an essay titled \u201cThe Great Tradition\u201d: \u201cHe pretends to be able to act completely alone; he isolates men from each other by sowing fear and mistrust between them, thereby destroying equality together with man\u2019s capacity to act; and he cannot permit anybody to distinguish himself, and therefore starts his rule with the establishment of uniformity, which is the perversion of equality.\u201d\n\nSuch observations should give pause to those who would prop up a tyrant for personal ends, and must redouble the opposition\u2019s will to depose that ruler before the public\u2019s capacity for thought and action alike is confounded.", "title": "The Philosopher in Dark Times", "authors": []}

The backlash under Carter was similar, orchestrated by Jerry Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority in 1979 to get Carter out of the White House \u2014 two-thirds of Falwell\u2019s supporters voted for Reagan in 1980.\n\nWhen Carter was visited by a high official of the Southern Baptist Convention, the man told him, \u201cWe are praying, Mr. President, that you will abandon secular humanism as your religion.\u201d Two errors lurked in that sentence and its presumption \u2014 that secular humanism is a religion, and that the Southern Baptists\u2019 religion is a religion. Carter had shocked them by upholding the cancellation of Bob Jones University\u2019s tax exemption (more influence of Roger Williams), supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, calling for a Palestinian homeland and holding a White House Conference on the Families where abortion, contraception, gay rights, divorce and other important social issues were openly discussed.\n\nIn the ideology that the right thinks is a religion, the sin of sins is abortion, though that is not a subject mentioned in the Torah, or the Gospel, or the early church creeds and councils. Even the Catholic Church sees this not as a theological issue but as a matter of natural law, more a subject for philosophers, psychiatrists and scientists than for preachers as such. But science is evil in the rightists\u2019 ideology: Scientists invent nonexistent things like evolution and global warming. The ideology also holds that guns are the very essence of government. Regulate guns in any way and we lose justice, liberty and comity, crushed by an instant tyranny. The ideology also insists that women should be subordinate to men, blacks to whites, and experts to \u201cthe common man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarter was too religious to accept such pseudo-religion. He taught Bible classes all his adult life, with an emphasis on what is in Scripture rather than what is not \u2014 mainly, a regard for the poor, the rejected, the victims of prejudice and injustice. Unlike Barack Obama, who continued and expanded our war in Afghanistan, Carter was a peace president who earned his Nobel Peace Prize, and keeps on earning it with worldwide efforts against war, poverty and disease.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough Carter has only one life to live, he has umpteen memoirs to write.

The nine-story tower completes Koolhaas\u2019s plans for the 200,000-square-foot site, the city\u2019s largest arts destination, after three years of construction. It vastly expands the foundation\u2019s already-extensive exhibition spaces with new galleries reserved for Miuccia Prada\u2019s private collection of contemporary art, and adds a new restaurant and roof-deck bar to the premises as well.\n\nIn a two-decade collaboration with Prada, Koolhaas and his Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) firm have designed foreign headquarters, flagship stores, catwalks \u2014 and even backpacks, but in his vision, the Prada Foundation is unique as a socially-minded project. In a rundown southern precinct of Milan, the foundation, which was inaugurated in 2015, is a remarkable, OMA-designed oasis of the arts comprising of refurbished 1910 distillery warehouses along with a modern, mirrored cinema and a gallery paneled in foamed aluminum.\n\nKoolhaas\u2019s new, 200-foot-tall milk-white concrete tower \u2014 which broke ground when the other buildings were almost finished \u2014 rises up from the far corner of the campus, and soars over the low-lying surrounding neighborhood. Serrated from one point of view, but straight from another, the tower constantly shape-shifts according to the viewer\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s what Koolhaas calls an \u201cunstable\u201d form, a term he has used to describe many of his buildings. The interiors fluctuate as well. They are, as the OMA architect Federico Pompignoli put it, \u201cwhite cube galleries in revolt against the monotony of the typical white cube.\u201d The open-plan exhibition spaces alternate on each floor, with rooms that are either slim tapered wedges or wider rectangles constructed with cantilevered additions that offer vertiginous views over the street below.\n\nInstead of the traditional stark-white walls typically found in galleries, the building features travertine stone floors that contrast against opaline concrete masonry and rough wood. Floor-to-ceiling windows switch directions on each floor, offering differing perspectives over the cityscape, and each level grows a few feet taller than the last \u2014 a changing plan designed to encourage changing exhibitions. At the opening, large-scale works by Carla Accardi, John Baldessari and Carsten H\u00f6ller \u2014 as well as other artists who figure prominently in Prada\u2019s collection \u2014 will be on view.\n\nAlong its blank core wall, which is gripped by a colossal support tube that keeps the narrow building upright, is a glass-framed elevator, large enough to hold 70 people. It climbs the exterior, with views overlooking the corn and rice fields of Milan\u2019s rural outskirts. From the precipitous outdoor terrace of the seventh-floor restaurant, or on the dizzyingly open-to-the-skies rooftop bar, all of Milan spreads out in front of observers \u2014 each of the city\u2019s landmarks dwarfed by the jagged snow-capped Alps hulking along the northern horizon beyond the metropolis.

I wanted to show a country that was already shifting \u2014 and to depict my hopes for women and young people across Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs both a Saudi woman and a film director, I lived for years with the restrictions that my home country imposed on the industry and my daily life before traveling the world with my husband, an American diplomat, to study and make films. I often struggled to do the most basic things as a filmmaker. I had to direct the outdoor scenes for \u201cWadjda\u201d relegated to a van, with a monitor and a walkie-talkie, to adhere to the strict gender segregation rules. I couldn\u2019t start a company without a male sponsor from my family, and I had to hire male production managers. It was infuriating to depend on less qualified people whose names are credited with work that I could have done solo. Six years later, with the changes to sponsorship rules, I am opening my own business this year in my own name: Haifaa Al Mansour Productions.\n\nThe first film I will produce, \u201cThe Perfect Candidate,\u201d tells the story of a young female doctor who runs for municipal office while her father is off touring the country with the reincarnated Saudi National Band, which had been banned under laws prohibiting public music performances. It is a tale that applauds women\u2019s ambitions in politics, celebrates our lost arts and the return of music to our small towns. When I was raising money for \u201cWadjda,\u201d potential partners were skeptical about filming here. Now people are excited. It makes my films a safer investment, and makes Saudi Arabia seem like a more normal place to shoot.\n\nAs a major influencer in the Islamic world, Saudi Arabia sets the tone for how millions of people around the globe approach societal standards and religious life. With a softening of our stance on the arts and social restrictions in general, the message to zealots and ultraconservatives everywhere seems more clear: \u201cYou are no longer a part of the mainstream.\u201d\n\nI am thrilled that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was the first film officially screened in the kingdom earlier this month. It represents everything I love about cinema, and provides the audience with conversations about identity, politics and diversity, through an action-movie thrill ride. To experience a phenomenon like this in public, with friends and family, to laugh and cringe along with strangers, is a privilege. It reminds me of when my father transformed our patio into a makeshift cinema years ago. Although he was probably just trying to keep me and my 11 siblings out of his hair, it was a magical time, of laughter and popcorn under a starry sky.", "title": "Opinion | The Profound Normalcy of a Day at the Movies in Saudi Arabia", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "Let\u2019s recap the kind of power that National Amusements has over the corporate siblings, thanks to its dual classes of stock:\n\n\u2022 Despite owning just over 10 percent of the outstanding shares at CBS and just under 10 percent at Viacom, the Redstones have about 80 percent of the voting power at both companies.\n\n\u2022 With that kind of power, National Amusements could replace the board at either company at any point in time.\n\nIt is that power that allows Shari Redstone to compel CBS and Viacom to explore a merger for the second time.\n\nAt the moment, CBS and Viacom are at loggerheads over both the price of a deal \u2014 the two proposals are roughly $2.8 billion apart \u2014 and the management of the combined company. CBS wants its C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to continue in his position at the merged business, while Viacom wants its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to have that spot. (Ms. Redstone also wants Mr. Bakish to have a high-level position, according to people close to both companies.)\n\nA person briefed on Ms. Redstone\u2019s thinking, who was not authorized to speak publicly about private negotiations, told DealBook that Ms. Redstone isn\u2019t preparing to oust Mr. Moonves, at least at the moment. And a public statement by National Amusements Wednesday suggested that it isn\u2019t ready for such a drastic move yet: \u201cNational Amusements has tremendous respect for Les Moonves and it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201d\n\nCBS said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThe industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves\u2019 record and we think it speaks for itself.\u201d Viacom declined to comment.\n\nThanks to the dual-class stock structure \u2014 something CBS and Viacom share with the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and The New York Times Company \u2014 there\u2019s little that regular shareholders, or management of either company, can do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLegal experts say that National Amusements has fiduciary duties to shareholders of each company, but that the Redstones unquestionably have the power to replace board members.\n\n\u201cYou can stack the board,\u201d said John Coffee of Columbia Law School, though he added that \u201cit might be poor form to stuff the board\u201d before pushing through a merger or C.E.O. change.\n\nCharles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that companies controlled by a dual-class structure can sometimes opt for other shareholders to have a voice. But that isn\u2019t a requirement.\n\nProfessor Elson said that Ms. Redstone has the ability to force through a deal or a board change. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nSo, about that lending boom\u2026\n\nTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.\n\nEach quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.\n\nInvestors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\n\nStill, the obstacles to a bigger expansion are clear. Interest rates are going up, making the cost of borrowing higher. Why, for instance, would large companies take on more debt, at a higher cost, when there is a good chance that the current trade tensions could dampen global growth? And individuals may be reluctant to take on mortgage debt when wage growth is tepid, and higher house prices have left them paying out an increasing portion of their income to service the mortgages. This may explain the dip in mortgage lending in the first quarter. In the period, the four banks made $65 billion of new mortgages, down 9.6 percent from the $72.1 billion they made in the same period a year ago.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nHas Trump changed his mind about the TPP?\n\nHe once denounced the trade pact as \u201ca rape of our country.\u201d But his decision yesterday to reconsider joining \u2014 which surprised his own advisers \u2014 could hearten U.S. businesses and Republican lawmakers who supported it as one of the best ways to box in China.\n\nSenator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told Politico, \u201cIf you want to send a message to China, the best way to do that is to start doing business with their competitors.\u201d\n\nFree-trade backers may point to this reversal, as well as attempts to revise Nafta, as a change of heart by a protectionist president.

Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.\n\nBut the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame.

In turn, the floral style began to mirror the food movement: homespun fantasies of nature\u2019s seasonal delicacies. At wildflower-strewn weddings and in Dutch-still-life-inspired bouquets, the flowers were always exquisite, but also always very polite, chaste even.\n\nSome of the most forward-thinking florists right now \u2014 Brrch and Metaflora in New York, Fjura in London and Muse in Paris \u2014 are channeling the unabashedly sexy and even vulgar brashness of the \u201980s, albeit with an anarchic, surreal and even unsettling edge. They are turning the limiting ideals of good taste on its head to embrace the variety flowers can offer, and how they can make us feel and see in new ways. Consider arrangements such as flesh-pink anthurium bedazzled with fake pearls splayed around orchids dyed in a rainbow of spun-sugar pastels or gold spray-painted palm leaves paired with great arches of mauve-colored ostrich feathers. \u201cWhy do flowers always have to be pretty?\u201d says Brittany Asch of Brrch, who designed the arrangements shown here. \u201cI want to elevate things that disgust people, so that they have to look again and reconsider them. Nature is so much bigger than pretty.\u201d\n\nThese powerful floral riffs make provocative partners of nature and artifice, irony and earnestness, politics and escapism, even utter simplicity and vulgar excess. Why make binary choices when you can turn these distinctions on their head?

He took their side against immigrant rapists, murderous jihadis, plundering trade deals, dangerous city people and disloyal, condescending elites of all parties and persuasions. He promised to use his billionaire superpowers to rig the economy to their advantage. It didn\u2019t matter that he is a transparently corrupt, bigoted, sexually abusive, compulsive liar. He offered the dignity of recognition, promised to fight, and won.\n\nMr. Ryan, who had dreamed of building a more inclusive party, was sincerely horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive white-identity politics. But there wasn\u2019t anything he and the Republican establishment could do about it. They had nothing with which to fight the towering inferno of resentment they had kindled through their arrogant, ideologically driven indifference to the pressing needs of the people they claim to represent.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Trump clinched the nomination, Mr. Ryan became as tame as a poodle. Congressional leaders hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s need for political cover might make him tractable, and that unified government would enable them to finally set America on the path to broad-based prosperity through tax cuts, entitlement reform and the replacement of Obamacare with something no one had bothered to work out.\n\nBut the Republican majority was crippled from the start by the fundamental conflict between a government-shrinking agenda and the immediate material interests of Republican voters. Thus, the only thing Mr. Ryan has to show for his meekness in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s corruption and bigotry is an enormous tax cut that leaves the level of government spending basically untouched, except for interest payments on the debt, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will outstrip annual military spending in five years.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump is bulldozing congressional Republicans into a mass grave. Democrats outnumber Republicans, so the latter depend on a sizable turnout advantage to win elections and sustain minority rule. But Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of scapegoating demagogy, which Mr. Ryan as speaker has done nothing but enable, is a turbocharged Democratic turnout machine that converts swing districts into Democratic seats and converts enormous Republican advantages into razor\u2019s edge contests. Barring a miracle, Republicans are going to lose their House majority, and even their Senate majority, once thought untouchable, is no longer safe.\n\nSo Mr. Ryan has cornered himself, and his party. The Republican base won\u2019t buy what he\u2019s selling, unless it\u2019s awkwardly grafted onto white-identity populism, which is a self-annihilating strategy for mobilizing Democrats to the polls.\n\nThe forthcoming implosion of Mr. Ryan\u2019s party, and his imminent retreat to Wisconsin, illustrates the danger of hidebound ideological overconfidence. Party elites in the grip of dogma can\u2019t see the point of checking in with the people they represent and are blind to new problems the partisan catechism is not equipped to comprehend. If a decent Republican Party one day rises from the devastation Paul Ryan practically invited Donald Trump to inflict, it will be one that has stopped legislating for an imaginary world of self-financing tax cuts, having rediscovered and realigned with the basic interests of aging and working-class white suburban and rural American voters.

(Bad writing apparently has been.) One can be devoted to something \u2014 a band from the \u201990s, surfing, YHWH\u2014 without being able to put that devotion into words.\n\nBut my experience with students has me worried that years of \u201ctexts being read\u201d and \u201ctests being taken\u201d have created the sense in them that whatever they\u2019re devoted to doesn\u2019t matter much to the rest of us \u2014 so long as they know the answers to our questions, so long as they pass the test. Writing so passively and with what they\u2019ve been taught is appropriate and \u201cobjective\u201d distance from topics they often seem disinterested in, these young people signal to me that they\u2019re still waiting for something important or real to happen to them.\n\nPerhaps they feel that only someone who has lived through something momentous \u2014 like the teenagers who survived the Parkland, Fla., shooting \u2014 has earned the right to be heard. It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those young activists writing, \u201cThe rally was held because Congress was lobbied and guns were purchased.\u201d\n\nBut what about those queer devotions and frustrations, experiences and ideas that have stirred an individual heart into peculiarity?\n\nA decade teaching young writers has taught me a great deal. First, we need to value more the complete and complex lives of young people: where they come from, how they express themselves. They have already lived lives worthy of our attention and appreciation.\n\nSecond, we need to encourage young people to take seriously those lives they\u2019ve lived, even as they come to understand \u2014 often through schooling and just as often not \u2014 that there\u2019s a whole lot more we\u2019ll expect of them.

I checked off more than 90 percent.\u201d\n\nI always tell my students that I find these lines heartening. As a writer, I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years reckoning with the joys and tragedies, the shame and grief, commitments to sports and study, of my own pre-college years. A good deal of my writing continues to take me to northern Florida where, when I was young, my father was killed by a drunken driver; the stories I continue to uncover there \u2014 about justice and race and addiction \u2014 begin with me at 5 and continue through my adolescence into this adult life.", "title": "Opinion | The Soul-Crushing Student Essay", "authors": []}

By the 1980s, the conventional acting ideology had been absorbed, filed away, and all that mattered was being smart. These actors knew the Meisner-influenced naturalism of New York\u2019s Neighborhood Playhouse and the elegant crispness of the British school, but they grew up in the 1970s when \u2014 after President Nixon and Vietnam \u2014 nobody believed in any kind of hegemony: American, theatrical or otherwise. So acting transformed in the 1980s into something post-Freudian and hypnotic, like Eric Fischl\u2019s paintings of that moment. Because in that era, being any kind of artist in New York meant you were living through the plague and you were one of its diarists. All shows, from the furthest reaches of the East Village (John Kelly at the Pyramid Club, playing a ravaged Mona Lisa) to the glitzy musicals (\u201cLa Cage aux Folles,\u201d starring Gene Barry) had the slight whiff of death. Death was this generation\u2019s teacher.\n\nDisco was dead, Studio 54 had gone cold and Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gigolo\u201d was the first great film of the decade, starring a young actor, Richard Gere, who had come of age doing Martin Sherman\u2019s \u201cBent,\u201d a 1979 play about gays killed by Nazis. After \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u201d the New York theater continued to lend-lease its loosely organized repertory company to the movies: Kathy Bates, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and her husband Samuel L. Jackson, Amanda Plummer, Sarah Jessica Parker and the rest knew how not to be mere tools of the technology \u2014 they made the camera adjust to them, to their temperatures, their pickpocket eyes. Nobody more so than Willem Dafoe, who labored quietly and deliberately downtown at the Wooster Group, like Houdini practicing escape acts over and over. Perhaps that\u2019s why, in a 2012 interview, he said, \u201cyou do your best things when ... you\u2019re a little scared.\u201d In these years, there was a lot to be scared about.\n\nCut to 2014, and I am sitting in a restaurant having lunch with an emaciated Nichols, now close to his own end. It was a melancholy meal, and we cheered ourselves up by talking about actors and their tricks. We landed on Nathan Lane, whom we had both worked with often and worshiped unconditionally. I sighed, then asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you love them all, more than anything?\u201d He looked at me, his limpid, quicksilver eyes pooling, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.

{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "Image\n\nLike many Texas liberals, Wright has a soft spot for the three Texans who reached the White House \u2014 a feeling no doubt heightened by his loathing of the present occupant. His description of Lyndon Johnson as a champion of the disadvantaged is standard fare; more intriguing is his appraisal of Johnson\u2019s impact on the state\u2019s public image in the 1960s, as America\u2019s culture czars, especially in Hollywood, consciously soured on Texas following the Kennedy assassination in Dallas and Johnson\u2019s escalation in Vietnam, a war he inherited but soon came to define. Wright is correct, I think, in noting how quickly, and harshly, the policy missteps and personal foibles of this president \u2014 his cornpone accent, whopping exaggerations and primitive habits \u2014 were linked to the state he came from. \u201cThe hatred heaped upon him splattered over the rest of us,\u201d Wright says, adding: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change my opposition to that war, but I wish we had been kinder to him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the disappearance of Johnson\u2019s New Deal liberalism in Texas that Wright laments, it\u2019s also the rout of moderate Republicanism as practiced by George H.W. and George W. Bush. Whatever their faults, Wright claims, they are men of character who displayed little of the partisan meanness so prevalent today. He also makes a case for George W. Bush as a good governor, more interested in meeting the state\u2019s social needs than in fighting its culture wars. Recently, the younger Bush broke his silence about the toxic environment in Washington, taking an indirect shot at Trump. \u201cAs he spoke,\u201d Wright recalls, \u201cI wished for the millionth time that he hadn\u2019t invaded Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe Bushes could also be unintentionally hilarious, especially when wrestling with their native tongue. Wright fondly weaves in their most egregious gaffes, not to embarrass the former presidents but to humanize them. Take, for example, Bush the elder on Ronald Reagan: \u201cI have worked alongside him. \u2026 We have had triumphs. We have made mistakes. We have had sex.\u201d (He meant \u201csetbacks.\u201d) Or Bush the younger describing his presidential campaign: \u201cThey misunderestimated me.\u201d Indeed, they did.\n\nPerhaps the clearest indication of Wright\u2019s Texas loyalties can be seen in his choice of a burial plot. His sparkling literary credentials have earned him entry into the exclusive Texas State Cemetery in Austin. On the positive side, it\u2019s home to Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, a civil rights icon, whose simple epitaph reads, \u201cPatriot.\u201d Ann Richards and her longtime companion, the revered Texas writer Bud Shrake, also rest there \u2014 Richards leaving behind some preachy words about fairness, Shrake taking the more direct route: \u201cSo Far, So Bueno.\u201d\n\nBut much of the cemetery is dotted with less agreeable folk. Buried side-by-side are Governors \u201cMa\u201d and \u201cPa\u201d Ferguson \u2014 \u201cMa\u201d becoming the state\u2019s first female chief executive following her husband\u2019s ouster on corruption charges. An early crusader against bilingual education back in the 1920s, she is said to have argued: \u201cIf English was good enough for Jesus, it\u2019s good enough for the schoolchildren of Texas.\u201d Rick Perry and Dan Patrick have plots reserved, as do a fair number of their friends. In picking his spot, Wright seems to have chosen nature over neighborliness. It\u2019s set on a shady hillside near the grave of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, hero of the Texas Revolution and son of the Confederacy, who died at Shiloh.\n\nWright sees no conflict, nor should there be. Liberal Texans complain and fight and continually lose. Like Wright himself, they sometimes contemplate leaving the state, but not many do. There\u2019s a powerful sense of rootedness, a love of the landscape and the laid-back lifestyle, a selective affinity for the culture, and an Alamo-like pride in battling unwinnable odds. As Wright notes of his grave site, and surely of Texas itself: \u201cI had made my choice.\u201d", "title": "The State That Foreshadows America\u2019s Future", "authors": []}

For example, in NBC\u2019s version, Mr. Mulaney\u2019s character had gotten sober at a young age, just as the comedian did in real life, but that got lost in the transition to Fox.\n\n\u201cI did not have self-discipline \u2014 one was not enough,\u201d he said of his own wild-child days. \u201cOne day when I was 23, I thought, \u2018If this were a movie, I would not be rooting for this guy anymore.\u2019 It sounds weird, but that flipped me.\u201d", "title": "The Stealth Success of John Mulaney", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "On a recent Monday in a crowded Newark courthouse, the former Rutgers philosophy professor Anna Stubblefield admitted she touched the penis of a man with cerebral palsy who could not legally consent. In an earlier trial, which I wrote about for The Times Magazine in October 2015, Anna was convicted on two counts of raping the same victim; last summer, that verdict was overturned on appeal. Her guilty plea has now forestalled a second trial, and barring some surprise at the sentencing in early May, she will receive no further time in prison beyond the nearly 22 months she has already served. It seems that this long, complicated story has come to a demoralizing end.\n\nAt the prompting of her lawyer, Anna told the judge that she had intentionally touched the victim\u2019s \u201cintimate parts for the purposes of mutual sexual gratification.\u201d Her guilty plea acknowledged little that was substantive about the case: It did not stipulate, for example, that Anna\u2019s adulterous affair with \u201cD.J.,\u201d a nonverbal man who has been diagnosed with profound physical and mental disabilities, might have been founded on a suspect premise: that he was able to communicate by using a keyboard with her help. It did not concede that D.J. lacks the mental powers of a normal, 37-year-old adult, or that Anna could have been the unwitting author of his typed-out messages, through a sort of Ouija-board effect. It did not walk back the implication that D.J. had in some way played the part of the seducer. Rather, Anna copped only to a narrow, legalistic proposition: that she \u201cshould have known that the victim had been determined to be \u2018mentally defective\u2019 to the point of being incapable of providing consent.\u201d\n\nIn other words, she found a way to cut her losses in the courtroom without denying D.J.\u2019s competence or admitting any doubts about the realness of their love. This was to be expected, I suppose. From my position in the gallery, reporting on the trial, it always seemed to me that Anna was entrapped by the grandiosity of her good intentions. As an academic, she devoted much of her career to social-justice activism and the philosophy of race and disability, warning in her published work that men like D.J. (who is black) were like \u201cthe canary\u2019s canary\u201d in the coal mine \u2014 \u201cthe most vulnerable of the vulnerable\u201d \u2014 and subject to both white supremacist and ableist oppression. In teaching D.J. how to type, using a widely disavowed method known as \u201cfacilitated communication,\u201d she believed she was restoring his right of self-determination: empowering him to take college classes, present papers at conferences and eventually express his longing for the older, married, white woman who had been his savior.\n\nI sensed there was no escaping from this narrative. Spending all those hours next to D.J. at the keyboard, Anna had written both of them into a romance: the activist professor who sacrificed her family, career and eventually her freedom; and her lover, who now would be remanded to a prison cell of silence as a result of their affair, his inner life discounted and ignored. With each step she took in their relationship, it was as if she sank a little deeper into a quicksand of delusion, a kind of erotomania. If she reneged on any claims she had made about D.J.\u2019s intellect, and his capacity to give consent, she would be admitting not only to what might be criminal behavior but also to the idea that she had become a vector of white, able-bodied supremacy \u2014 that she was the boogeyman she had sworn to fight.", "title": "The Strange Case of Anna Stubblefield, Revisited", "authors": []}

Then he grabbed her bag and stepped on the accelerator. She was dragged halfway down the block before she let go. When I saw her a month later, she was still in physical pain from her injuries and emotional pain from having endured a traumatic experience.\n\nMs. T. had raised three successful children as a single mother, while enjoying a prosperous career as the head of a social services agency. She had gone through difficult times before, but she\u2019d always been able to overcome them. Now she was embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t been able to \u201cget over\u201d what had happened.

He has rearranged his family\u2019s life around the subway, making his two children go to bed an hour earlier so he can wake up earlier and give himself more time for the ride to Manhattan.\n\nSubway riders have good reason to assume the worst. Despite an infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars and an emergency turnaround plan heavily promoted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the subway, the system is still faltering \u2014 in January it fell to a new low with just 58.1 percent of all weekday trains arriving at stations on time. Weekends were not much better, with 64.7 percent of trains reaching their terminus on time, a nearly 10 percentage point drop from January 2017.\n\nAs the service grew worse, Mr. Apter, the sightseeing guide, moved from Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, to Astoria, Queens, to shorten his commute to the attractions in Times Square. But now, he gets up at the same time each morning as when he lived twice as far away.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOf all the things that makes tour guides in New York City good, promptness is paramount,\u201d Mr. Apter said. When his commute goes smoothly, that promptness leads to an early arrival \u2014 and a bit of a problem. \u201cI don\u2019t have an office where I can retreat to,\u201d he said. To compensate, before he heads out to meet a group of visitors, he leans on his tour-guide knowledge of the city to identify churches or hotel lobbies where he can sit and wait.\n\nAt Sweet Corner Bakeshop in the West Village, where Ms. Hart works as a barista, the subway is responsible for ferrying the entire staff, from the baker to the chocolatier.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo avoid being late, Ms. Hart added a buffer of time to her commute from Bushwick, Brooklyn. But when the subway operated the way it was supposed to, Ms. Hart would sometimes arrive 30 minutes before the shop opened at 8 a.m. \u2014 only to shiver outside until the bakery\u2019s muffin maker strolled up with the key. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of magical if you arrive precisely on time,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And looking for an alternative on the city\u2019s other major mode of public transit is not necessarily the answer. New York\u2019s public buses, which are operated by the same agency that oversees the subway, have achieved the distinction of having the slowest speeds of any large city in the country.\n\nIf Megan McCormick, a teacher in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, is late, her students are left lingering, waiting for class, she said, unless she scrambles to find someone to cover for her. \u201cEvery morning I feel panicked. By the time I get off the bus it is such a sense of relief that I am finally in control of when I get to work,\u201d she said.\n\nTo cope, she has more than tripled the time she allots for what should be a 20-minute bus commute, even if that means getting there so early that the school is empty of children. In her dark classroom, she listens to a podcast \u2014 one morning, she tested out some new Play-Doh. \u201cMight as well be Zen,\u201d she said.\n\nSome riders say there is a benefit to an early arrival. Dogan Baruh, 41, a real estate broker, no longer factors in a lunch break when he is booking apartment showings across the city because he assumes at some point during the day the subway will get him to an appointment sooner than expected and he\u2019ll have a snack break. He adds 15 minutes of extra time to each journey, hopeful that he\u2019ll find himself with time to kill. \u201cThe positive is I get to potentially finally eat lunch!\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Emig, a bond trader who lives on Staten Island and is running as a Democrat to represent the 11th Congressional District, does much of his campaign emailing from the tiny benches in the cafeteria of the elementary school his twins attend in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where he sits after he arrives from his office in Manhattan. Surrounding him are other parents, folded into the child-size seats, similarly early, he said, looking at their phones until their children are dismissed.\n\n\u201cI remember a decade ago when you could more or less count on the subways to be on time most of the time,\u201d Mr. Emig said. \u201cNow, the worst part about it is just the not knowing, really.\u201d", "title": "The Subway Is So Late, It\u2019s Making New Yorkers Early", "authors": ["Sarah Maslin Nir"]}

Sessions, which upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a Federal District Court last October, presented the appeals court with a straightforward statutory question: whether the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program permits the Justice Department to attach new eligibility rules beyond those Congress established in 2006 when it created the program, which was described by the court as the \u201cprimary provider of federal criminal justice funding to state and local governments.\u201d\n\nCongress granted the department no such authority, the appeals court concluded, nor can the statute be interpreted as bestowing it inherently. To quote Judge Rovner: \u201cWe are faced, then, with conditions on the receipt of critical law enforcement funds that have been imposed by the attorney general without any authority in a manner that usurps the authority of Congress \u2014 made more egregious because Congress itself has repeatedly refused to pass bills with such restrictions.\u201d\n\nWhile formally statutory, the opinion is suffused with a concern of constitutional dimension about an overreaching executive branch within a system of separated powers.\n\n\u201cThe issue before us strikes at one of the bedrock principles of our nation,\u201d Judge Rovner wrote, \u201cthe protection of which transcends political party affiliation and rests at the heart of our system of government \u2014 the separation of powers. The founders of our country well understood that the concentration of power threatens individual liberty and established a bulwark against such tyranny by creating a separation of powers among the branches of government. If the executive branch can determine policy, and then use the power of the purse to mandate compliance with that policy by the state and local governments, all without the authorization or even acquiescence of elected legislators, that check against tyranny is forsaken.\u201d\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t strong enough medicine, her opinion includes this observation: \u201cIt falls to us, the judiciary, as the remaining branch of the government, to act as a check on such usurpation of power.\u201d\n\nIf this case or one like it reaches the Supreme Court \u2014 similar lawsuits have been filed across the country \u2014 the justices will have to take sides. There would seem to be no middle ground. Nor is there middle ground in another front in the new civil war: the Trump administration\u2019s decision, announced on March 26, to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. California, New York, the N.A.A.C.P., and others promptly filed lawsuits.\n\nThe legal complaints assert that requiring people to reveal their citizenship status will predictably depress participation, thereby preventing the government from obeying the constitutional command to conduct an \u201cactual enumeration\u201d every 10 years. Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, wrote in the state\u2019s complaint that the depressed count will predictably cost California \u2014 with its five million noncitizen residents, more than in any other state \u2014 seats in Congress (and therefore also votes in the Electoral College) as well as billions of dollars of population-based federal funding. In other words, while there is little chance that the citizenship question will produce a more accurate census, there is every chance that it will bring about a shift in the national balance of power.", "title": "Opinion | The Supreme Court and the New Civil War", "authors": []}

I\u2019m spending more and more money out of my own pocket, and I can\u2019t have the impact that I want to have with the way things are now.

Teachers told me they were also inspired by other bursts of activism nationwide, from the Women\u2019s March to the Never Again movement for gun control. In Phoenix this week, I went to an organizing meeting in the suburban backyard of an elementary school teacher named Lisa Wyatt, where teachers and parents made plans to knock on their neighbors\u2019 doors to build support for the walkout. \u201cTo see these kids organizing marches across the country, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait a minute, we can do that!\u2019\u201d she told me.\n\nThe impetus for the walkout in Arizona, like those in other states, didn\u2019t come from a teachers\u2019 union, though teachers\u2019 unions have thrown their support behind the action. Instead, it began with a Facebook group, Arizona Educators United, and a hashtag, #RedforEd, which an elementary school music teacher, Noah Karvelis, had created to encourage school employees to wear red in solidarity with their brethren in West Virginia.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the teacher walkouts have happened in states where unions are weak. When teachers lack strong collective representation, scrappy new grass-roots organizations like Arizona Educators United can quickly build followings. Further, states that immiserate their teachers eventually lose leverage over them. It isn\u2019t legal for public employees in Arizona to strike, and teachers could, technically, lose their jobs for participating in the walkout.\n\nBut because of its abysmal salaries, Arizona has such an acute teacher shortage that many schools are already hiring teachers without formal education training, some with only high school diplomas.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. In Margolick\u2019s formulation, the greatest tragedy of 1968 lies in the political devastation wreaked by the dual assassinations of King on April 4 and Kennedy on June 6. In the short span of eight weeks, the country lost its most imaginative moral leader and its most progressive politician \u2014 and with their passings the chance of a meaningful national renewal all but disappeared. This calculus of loss rests on the supposition that the two men shared enough ideology and political motivation to foster a close working relationship following a Kennedy victory in the 1968 (or perhaps 1972) election. We can only speculate about the probability of such a victory or the nature of a hypothetical Robert Kennedy administration \u2014 or about how the administration would have addressed matters of war, poverty and social justice with King advising the new president either openly or behind the scenes. But the author\u2019s projection of such a progressive alliance is intriguing.\n\nPhoto\n\nInterestingly, Margolick, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, demonstrates that a solid M.L.K./R.F.K. combination would have been unthinkable at the beginning of the decade. He devotes much of the book to a painstaking reconstruction of each man\u2019s evolving moral and political consciousness \u2014 a dual narrative that reveals convergence but very little evidence of a developing relationship, either personal or public. Kennedy and King were neither friends nor formal political allies. While they had known each other since October 1960, when Robert Kennedy had phoned a Georgia judge to plead for King\u2019s release from jail, their subsequent personal contact was limited to a few cursory meetings and phone calls. Indeed, during their last four years they seem to have met only once, at a congressional subcommittee hearing on urban poverty. In one of the book\u2019s many clever asides, Margolick acknowledges this startling fact with a reference to Dion\u2019s musical tribute \u201cAbraham, Martin and John.\u201d \u201cKennedy and King may be linked in a famous song,\u201d he writes \u2014 \u201cboth freed a lot of people and died young, it says \u2014 but they saw little more of each other than either saw of Abraham Lincoln.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven so, Margolick makes a strong case that the two leaders ended up in roughly the same place by 1968. Both had become sharp critics of America\u2019s military involvement in Vietnam, yet both had fastened upon the scourge of gross economic inequality as the greatest threat to American democracy. Despite the obvious differences between a pugnacious politician and an idealistic minister, they were essentially on the same page, reading and voicing the same lessons of freedom and redemption for the United States. With a half-century of historical perspective and Margolick\u2019s help, we can now see the full potential for creative collaboration between the politician of promise and the dreamer. But, as the author of this carefully rendered book points out, the celebrated singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte \u2014 one observer who knew both men well \u2014 already recognized this potential during that fateful spring, describing \u201ca Kennedy-King alliance\u201d as \u201cthe right wing\u2019s greatest fear.\u201d", "title": "The Tragedy of 1968: What Might Have Been if King and Kennedy Had Lived", "authors": ["Raymond Arsenault", "David Margolick"]}

Many Republican voters have long been skeptical of the mainstream news media, but their trust in it has fallen sharply since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. And a study by two Yale professors found that Republicans were much more likely to trust hyperpartisan media outlets and news sites that peddle outright falsehoods than are Democrats. That phenomenon has undoubtedly been bolstered by Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of conspiracy theories and his endorsements of Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting, which has compelled news anchors at its local TV stations to read outrageous statements questioning the credibility of other news organizations.\n\n\u201cTrump seems to be succeeding just through the force of his daily verbal assaults in shaking trust in the press and in other institutions that are crucial to our democracy,\u201d says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\n\nWhen the president calls every piece of information he does not like \u201cfake news,\u201d he also encourages politicians in other countries who are not constrained by constitutional free speech protections or independent judiciaries to more aggressively squelch the press. They know that there will be little international condemnation of their actions because one of the most important standard bearers for a free press \u2014 the American government \u2014 is led by a man trying to discredit the free press.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s democracy is clearly flawed \u2014 the same coalition has ruled it since it became independent in 1957, and it has jailed opposition leaders on trumped-up charges \u2014 but it is not in the same league as countries like China and Russia, where freedom of speech is extremely circumscribed. By criminalizing \u201cfake news,\u201d it is heading in that direction. Indian democracy is much hardier, but journalists and free speech advocates are worried about the government\u2019s hostility toward an independent press and fear it will become even more aggressive as next year\u2019s parliamentary elections draw closer.\n\nThis is not a problem just in these countries. The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented an uptick in attacks on the press in Egypt, Myanmar, Poland, Turkey and other countries. Last year, 21 journalists were imprisoned for reporting false news, twice as many as the year before, according to the committee.\n\nMr. Trump is unlikely to change his ways, and his most loyal supporters will support him no matter what he does.

That belongs to the instantly engaging Sunny, the not home-schooled but \u201cno-schooled\u201d daughter of Willow and Steve. They\u2019re \u201calternative\u201d \u2014 as in \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d \u2014 not hippies.

Kit accidentally hurts Sunny\u2019s feelings; she\u2019s businesslike and offhand, ready for the girl to leave. Even when Kit warms up to Sunny, Halpern never lets them fall into mawkishness.\n\nSunny\u2019s story is also a welcome change from the doling out of Kit\u2019s history with Cal and from present-day Kit, who has tunneled so far into herself she\u2019s gone from first-person narration to third. The adult Kit\u2019s shell may be enervatingly thick, but the younger Kit provides some of the novel\u2019s funniest lines and most discomfiting observations, including an encounter with her future in-laws that\u2019s so delicately, productively twisted and inappropriate it filled me with a queasy kind of joy.\n\nI only wish Halpern had employed more of these formidable skills in depicting Kit\u2019s marriage. As Kit\u2019s voice becomes more and more flattened, the depiction of her interactions with Cal loses nuance and texture. That this is presumably deliberate doesn\u2019t stop it from feeling like a missed opportunity. Halpern\u2019s descriptions of Kit and Cal as \u201cfriendly and companionable\u201d and \u201chappily enough married\u201d are clearly intended to show Kit\u2019s failure to examine anything under the surface \u2014 but the surface itself is too often unexamined as well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite these flaws, the novel pays off in sheer plotting. Much as she gave the in-laws a very particular kind of awfulness, Halpern crafts a gratifyingly unexpected, effective answer to the question of what happened between Kit and Cal, with outed secrets and surprising solutions that she plays for minimum melodrama and with realistic warmth.

The fact that Chozick interacted so rarely with Clinton over nearly 10 years of covering her for The Wall Street Journal and then The New York Times is perhaps the most damning evidence of Clinton\u2019s self-destructive relationship with the press. \u201cHow could we communicate Hillary\u2019s \u2018funny, wicked and wacky\u2019 side to voters,\u201d she asks, \u201cif we never saw it for ourselves?\u201d\n\nChozick\u2019s own funny, wicked and wacky side is on full display, with well-drawn sketches of everyone from fresh-faced campaign interns to the candidates themselves. With her lively voice and eye for detail, \u201cChasing Hillary\u201d is an enjoyable read, like \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d meets \u201cThe Boys on the Bus.\u201d Watching Clinton during a town hall gathering was like \u201ccatching up with an old girlfriend who cites G.D.P. statistics over brunch\u201d; going to meet Bernie Sanders felt like \u201cwhen my mom made me visit her emphysemic Aunt Shirley.\u201d Her recollections of her adolescence in Texas and early jobs in journalism are just as spirited: After she told her fourth-grade class that she supported a Democratic candidate, \u201cI might as well have pulled on a skullcap and recited my haftorah.\u201d\n\nChozick admits that she should have done a few things differently. There are stories she wishes she hadn\u2019t written, questions she wishes she hadn\u2019t asked. While she rejects the Clinton campaign\u2019s insistence that the private email server was a nonstory, she regrets that Emailgate became a dominant narrative of the campaign. And in a chapter about The Times\u2019s coverage of the hacked John Podesta emails, Chozick writes that she landed on \u201cthe wrong side of history\u201d because of her own journalistic ambition. \u201cI didn\u2019t raise the possibility that we\u2019d become puppets in Putin\u2019s shadowy campaign,\u201d she says. \u201cI chose the byline. I always chose the byline.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Instead, it\u2019s a behind-the-scenes director\u2019s cut for readers who closely followed the 2016 political coverage. You may have read articles she wrote on the floor of the Orlando airport, in Las Vegas next to a \u201cSex and the City\u201d slot machine, on the M42 crosstown bus. Political junkies will enjoy deciphering her various pseudonyms for Clinton staffers, history junkies will find a valuable first-person account of an extraordinary campaign, media junkies will devour the backstage antics of the traveling press corps. (Chozick only names names when she\u2019s complimenting her colleagues; when she complains, she uses pseudonyms.)\n\nThe problem, of course, is that not everybody is a junkie. And while the chattering class may be intrigued by, for example, Clinton\u2019s flirtation with ABC\u2019s David Muir, ordinary readers may find themselves swimming in references to journalists and staffers who are far from household names.\n\nTo her credit, Chozick opens up about her own attitudes toward Clinton more than most political reporters would. Despite the campaign\u2019s skepticism of her, it\u2019s clear that she admired Clinton. She is acutely aware of the sexist double standards Clinton faced (though readers may rightly wonder why this appeared so rarely in her coverage). She\u2019s inspired by the historic nature of the campaign, and hurt by Clinton\u2019s iciness toward her. Chozick recalls that the first time she saw Clinton at a town hall, when she was covering her for The Journal in 2007, she stood up and clapped (a huge faux pas among journalists). For her, Clinton\u2019s loss is both a personal and a professional blow.\n\nTheir ambitions were aligned \u2014 had Clinton won, Chozick would very likely have been given the historic opportunity to cover the first woman president. But Chozick devotes only a few lines to exploring the broader significance of Clinton\u2019s loss beyond what it means for her own career, despite the global implications of the outcome. She records the facts of her life as they occurred during that period (including personal details about her marriage and her fertility) but rarely grapples with the larger contradictions of being an ambitious woman journalist covering an ambitious woman candidate. And even as she documents a campaign that floundered because it had too much head and not enough heart, Chozick risks falling into the same trap: In trying to outwork her male colleagues and outwit The Guys, Chozick at times seems to lose track of the emotional arc of Clinton\u2019s rise and fall.\n\n\u201cChasing Hillary\u201d is a portrait of two women with shared hopes and weaknesses, both driven and blinded by an ambition that could be possible only in the 21st century, bound by history but not by love. This book won\u2019t make you know Hillary any better. But it will help you understand why you don\u2019t.", "title": "The Walls That Hillary Clinton Created", "authors": ["Charlotte Alter", "Amy Chozick"]}
{"date": "2018-04-14 00:00:00", "text": "Quickly, Americans shifted from a discussion of policy to a symbolic battle over which side, Democratic or Republican, wasn\u2019t respecting soldiers enough. Had the president disrespected the troops with his comment? Had Democrats disrespected the troops by trying to use a condolence call for political leverage? Someone clearly had run afoul of an odd form of political correctness, \u201cpatriotic correctness.\u201d\n\nSince, as recent history has shown us, violating the rules of patriotic correctness is a far worse sin in the eyes of the American public than sending soldiers to die uselessly, the political battle became intense, and the White House was forced to respond. And since in a symbolic debate of this kind nothing is better than an old soldier, the retired Marine general and current chief of staff, John Kelly, was trotted out in an Oct. 19 news conference to defend the president.\n\nHe began powerfully enough, describing what happens to the bodies of soldiers killed overseas, and bringing up his own still painful memories of the loss of his son, who died in Afghanistan in 2010. He spoke with pride of the men and women in uniform.\n\nBut then, in an all too common move, he transitioned to expressing contempt for the civilian world. He complained that nothing seemed to be sacred in America anymore, not women, not religion, not even \u201cthe dignity of life.\u201d He told the audience that service members volunteer even though \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate, but required.\u201d He said veterans feel \u201ca little bit sorry\u201d for civilians who don\u2019t know the joys of service.\n\nTo cap things off, he took questions only from reporters who knew families who had lost loved ones overseas. The rest of the journalists, and by extension the rest of the American public who don\u2019t know any Gold Star families, were effectively told they had no place in the debate.\n\nSuch disdain for those who haven\u2019t served and yet dare to have opinions about military matters is nothing new for Mr. Kelly. In a 2010 speech after the death of his son, Mr. Kelly improbably claimed that we were winning in Afghanistan, but that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know it because successes go unreported\u201d by members of the \u201c\u2018know it all\u2019 chattering class\u201d who \u201calways seem to know better, but have never themselves been in the arena.\u201d And he argued that to oppose the war, which our current secretary of defense last year testified to Congress we were not winning, meant \u201cslighting our warriors and mocking their commitment to the nation.\u201d\n\nThis is a common attitude among a significant faction of veterans. As one former member of the Special Forces put it in a social media post responding to the liberal outcry over the deaths in Niger, \u201cWe did what we did so that you can be free to na\u00efvely judge us, complain about the manner in which we kept you safe\u201d and \u201cjust all around live your worthless sponge lives.\u201d His commentary, which was liked and shared thousands of times, is just a more embittered form of the sentiment I indulged in as a young lieutenant in Iraq.", "title": "Opinion | The Warrior at the Mall", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "The term itself is a relic from the 1990s, the moment in which the ongoing crisis over North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions began. At the end of the Cold War, the only nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula were American. The problem, from an American perspective, was that North Korea wanted to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities of its own. Ultimately, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration chose to withdraw American nuclear weapons from South Korea as part of an effort to seek a diplomatic solution to the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions. For a moment, it seemed like it would work: After the 1991 withdrawal of American nuclear weapons, South Korea and North Korea signed in 1992 a joint declaration on \u201cthe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\n\u201cDenuclearization\u201d was conveniently abstract. That allowed it to capture different aspects of what James Baker, Mr. Bush\u2019s secretary of state, called \u201cthe nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d It covered at the same time the nuclear weapons that the United States withdrew from South Korea, the so-called \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d of extended deterrence provided by the United States, and North Korea\u2019s own nuclear weapons ambitions. It was a shapeless, ill-fitting word. But the alternatives \u2014 \u201cdisarmament\u201d or \u201cnonproliferation\u201d \u2014 were just too narrow.

There are no American nuclear weapons in South Korea (although the North Koreans don\u2019t believe that, and some South Korean politicians have called for their return). More important, North Korea has moved in fits and starts to build a nuclear weapons capability that may be as large as 60 nuclear weapons, including a small number that can strike the United States.\n\nBut diplomats rarely throw phrases away, even once they are outdated. During the 2000s, \u201cdenuclearization\u201d stuck around because the Joint Declaration was North Korea\u2019s only written commitment to abandoning its nuclear weapons after Pyongyang withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003. And so even as the situation has changed, many American policymakers have repurposed \u201cdenuclearization\u201d as a synonym for North Korea\u2019s disarmament.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what it means \u2014 and that\u2019s not how Mr. Kim sees it.\n\nIn his meeting last week with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Kim reportedly committed to denuclearization. But when he does so, he is not offering to abandon the bomb, at least not without very big changes like the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean Peninsula and the signing of a peace treaty. He is terrified of ending up like Saddam Hussein or Muammar Qaddafi, two dictators who abandoned their weapons programs only to be forced from office.", "title": "Opinion | The Word That Could Help the World Avoid Nuclear War", "authors": []}

Not that the country did not change; it did, but France was more interested in resisting change in order to cling to what it had. Words like \u201cflexibility\u201d were suspect. They denoted the Anglo-Saxon model, as it was quaintly called, of a competitive labor market where people could be hired and fired. Moroseness became the badge of honor of a beautiful, seductive can\u2019t-do nation.\n\nThis France meandered into the 21st century, a still significant but increasingly marginal power, when, out of nowhere, along comes Mr. Flexibility. He is young, he\u2019s restless, he\u2019s had it with the tired hypocrisy behind Gallic paralysis; and, almost a year ago, he sweeps to victory in a presidential election. His name, of course, is Emmanuel Macron.

But the vanity is tied to purposefulness and the adaptability is not evasion of risk.\n\nMacron\u2019s strange friendship with Trump is itself risky: the American president is unpopular in Europe, and Macron flirts with being seen as Trump\u2019s poodle. Snuggling up to Donald can be a career-threatening move, as many people have discovered. Macron does not shy away from this danger because, in a world whose American-led order has frayed, keeping Trump from his worst America-first instincts is worth the fight (and coddling).

Comcast, which bid against Disney for the assets in the fall but was spurned by the 21st Century Fox board, on Wednesday made an offer to buy Sky alone.\n\nDisney has not laid out its plans for integrating 20th Century Fox. Mr. Iger has indicated that Disney intends to manage the Fox movie labels as their own entities \u2014 much as it did in the past with divisions that specialized in more mature content, like Miramax Films, Hollywood Pictures and Touchstone. Miramax, founded by Harvey and Bob Weinstein, was a headache for Disney and Mr. Iger sold it in 2010. Hollywood Pictures, known for \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d was folded in 2007. Touchstone was most recently used to distribute DreamWorks Studios films, including \u201cBridge of Spies.\u201d That arrangement has ended.\n\nIn December, when Disney unveiled its agreement with 21st Century Fox, Mr. Iger told reporters that he foresaw no challenges with Fox content because of Disney\u2019s history of \u201cmanaging brands in a compartmentalized way.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of managing brands that are very different in nature.

For instance, a garden gnome sculpture with a pipe is what made \u201cAnt-Man\u201d a \u201csmoking\u201d movie.\n\nGovernment studies have long shown that depictions of smoking in movies and television shows can lead to youth tobacco use. Under pressure, the Motion Picture Association of America said in 2007 that it would for the first time consider portrayals of smoking alongside sex and violence when assessing the suitability of movies for young viewers. Critics have since labeled the move ineffective, in part because the M.P.A.A. does not consider an image related to smoking \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 enough to warrant an R rating.\n\nMost movie studios responded by putting pressure on filmmakers to kick the habit, which reduced tobacco imagery. But Hollywood, citing the need for artistic license, has resisted calls to give an automatic R rating to any movie that depicts smoking. The Motion Picture Association fought off a smoking-related lawsuit last year with a First Amendment defense. It also argued that automatic R ratings for smoking could result in similar demands for anything deemed socially unacceptable, including high-speed driving.", "title": "There\u2019s No Smoking in Disney Films.

A small squad of workers often stands at the entrances of the colony and touches every ant that comes in or out, apparently monitoring the movements of their sisters.

Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. \u201cBoth of them are instinctively more concerned about the American economy and things at home, even if they have very different visions of America.\u201d\n\nMr. Ford, who now teaches at Yale and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said Mr. Trump, like Mr. Obama, was right to worry about \u201cmission creep\u201d in the military\u2019s operations in Syria.\n\nThe American-led coalition, Mr. Ford noted, has recently bombed Syrian forces, backed by Iranian militias and Russian mercenaries, who were advancing on oil fields held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Arab faction that is fighting with the United States against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t about ISIS,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThis was about keeping the Syrians out of the oil fields held by our buddies.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s debates over Syria carry a distinct echo of those during the Obama administration. Both presidents confronted aides pushing more aggressive options. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the Pentagon is pleading for more time to mop up in Syria, warning that a hasty exit will jeopardize the gains made in the campaign against the Islamic State. In Mr. Obama\u2019s case, the C.I.A. and the State Department both advocated arming the rebels.\n\nAt a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, a frustrated Mr. Trump pressed his top military advisers for how long it would take to root out the remaining Islamic State fighters and to train local forces to stabilize Syrian territory freed from the militant group.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Ford recalled, a skeptical Mr. Obama quizzed his aides about how arming a ragtag band of Syrian rebels could lead to a negotiated end to the war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth leaders also share the same skepticism of the motives of allies. Mr. Obama railed against Saudi Arabia, which had lobbied Washington to arm the rebels, as a free rider. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that if Saudis were so eager for the United States to stay engaged in Syria, they should help finance the campaign.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is more transactional in his approach than was Mr. Obama. The former president, his aides said, tended to focus on whether a strategy was financially sustainable over time, while the current president views foreign affairs as a strict balance sheet.\n\nTrump administration officials insist there are other differences. Mr. Trump, they said, agreed to arm the Syrian Kurds \u2014 a crucial step that enabled these battle-hardened soldiers to fight alongside American troops in retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa.\n\nMr. Obama did not arm the Kurds, mainly because his aides were caught up in a debate over whether it would antagonize Turkey. The Turks view the Kurdish militia as closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a separatist group known as the P.K.K., which threatens Turkey. Mr. Obama did come around to supporting the idea of arming the Kurds, but only at the end of his presidency.\n\nMr. Trump, officials said, has given his military commanders more flexibility to deploy troops, which they said had accelerated the defeat of the Islamic State. But analysts said Mr. Obama planted the seeds for the victory by orchestrating the multinational military campaign to begin with.\n\n\u201cWhile Obama and Trump may share an aversion to escalating the conflict, their instincts led in different directions,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cObama was more focused on diplomacy with the key players, while Trump has shown little inclination to focus on the diplomatic track.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s diplomatic ambitions, some argue, are the key to understanding why he shunned deeper involvement in Syria.\n\n\u201cFor Obama, it was fear of alienating Iran from a nuclear deal, the jewel in the crown of his foreign policy,\u201d said Frederic C. Hof, a former special envoy to Syria in the Obama administration. \u201cFor Trump, it is an instinctive belief that anything the U.S. is doing in the Middle East is a waste of time and money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet Mr. Obama, too, lamented that American military adventures in the region usually ended in ashes. He often drew an analogy to Libya, where he had authorized a military intervention in 2011 that left the country in shambles.\n\nWith their reluctance to get involved, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may find themselves united in another way. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump regularly castigated Mr. Obama for withdrawing American troops from Iraq too abruptly in 2011 \u2014 a decision that he said allowed the Islamic State to take root and flourish.\n\nNow, as Mr. Trump pushes his commanders for a speedy exit from Syria, he faces the same danger.\n\n\u201cWhat the Department of Defense is worried about is a three-plus-year military campaign against ISIS going down the drain,\u201d Mr. Hof said. \u201cIf you wanted to write a script for the resurgence of an Islamist regime, this is it.\u201d", "title": "They Have Many Differences, but on Syria, Trump Seems Much Like Obama", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}

Clients described Mr. Groff going to extraordinary lengths to snag more business for his firm. Two men also said that while they were being asked to solicit more clients, Mr. Groff sent them sexually charged messages.\n\nIn the weeks after that shooting in June 2016, Mr. Hansen said he was approached by Mr. Groff, who said he was with the Law Offices of Conrad J.

Others sue to pry open the private internal records of gun makers. A lawsuit can become one more way of speaking for the dead.\n\nTwo survivors of the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., have sent letters of intent to sue to the school district as well as local and federal law enforcement agencies over the response to the shooting and the multiple unheeded warnings about the gunman.\n\nPhoto\n\nStates write their own rules governing how lawyers can solicit business, sometimes requiring them to wait 30 days after a wrongful death or personal injury before approaching potential clients. California law does not allow firms to solicit people who may still be too physically or mentally scarred to make reasonable decisions about hiring a lawyer.\n\nJamie Lynn Gallegos, who survived the Vegas shooting, said she was still in shock when her phone started ringing about two weeks after the attack in October.

Matthew Wolf, the lawyer for Mr. Carrasquillo, said he could not comment publicly about the case.\n\nThe lawsuit brought some public notice to Mr. Groff\u2019s criminal history.

Ask people why they eschew what\u2019s known as active commuting, as many surveys have, and the primary reason cited is time. Those things take too long, most say.\n\nThey\u2019re probably wrong. A new study published in a journal called Transportmetrica A: Transport Science shows that people often overestimate the time required to commute actively, a miscalculation especially common when someone has secured a parking permit near the office.\n\nFor the study, researchers at Penn State solicited the school\u2019s faculty, staff and students to complete an extensive series of online questionnaires about their fitness, health, commuting and parking habits, comfort and ability on a bike or as pedestrians, distance from home to their main workplace on campus and how long they thought it would take them to either bike or walk that distance. Only a few of the 505 respondents went by foot or bike; most of them were students. Estimates of commuting times were then compared with the corresponding route times calculated by Google Maps. The researchers independently timed some of the routes by walking or riding them.\n\nThe survey participants \u2014 faculty and staff members above all \u2014 proved to be generally poor at guessing active-commuting times. About 90 percent of their estimates were too long by at least 10 minutes. The few assessments close to Google\u2019s were almost always made by riders or walkers. Parking availability and distances affected the estimates. Those with parking permits, a fiercely sought-after campus amenity, tended to overestimate active-commuting times significantly; the closer someone lived to the workplace, the better the guesses.

Under the direction of Mr. Botstein and his expansive musical palate, the programming of this new orchestra echoes that of the storied American Symphony Orchestra but is populated with a young group of students who attend Bard and play regularly in New York City.\n\nNow in its third season, the Orchestra Now will perform an intriguing program at Carnegie on Thursday that includes Bart\u00f3k\u2019s classic \u201cConcerto for Two Pianos, Percussion, and Orchestra\u201d with soloists Anna Polonsky and Peter Serkin, but also two substantive curiosities: the Turkish composer Ahmed Adnan Saygun\u2019s snarling Fourth Symphony, and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lajtha\u2019s Symphony No. 7, a colorfully stirring commemoration of the suppressed 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

When Aristophanes\u2019 comedy \u201cThe Birds\u201d made its premiere, at the Great Dionysia drama festival in Athens, a guy named Ameipsias walked away with the top prize. That was in 414 B.C., and you\u2019ve likely never heard of his play. \u201cThe Birds\u201d was runner-up, though, and it\u2019s still going strong.\n\nIn it, two Athenians strike out to build a new utopia in a place called Cloud Cuckoo Land. The play was born at a time when Athens\u2019 great democracy had been laid low \u2014 a theme as resonant recently in the United States as it was in Greece two years ago, when Nikos Karathanos\u2019 modern, large-cast staging of \u201cThe Birds\u201d made its debut at the open-air Ancient Theater of Epidaurus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFull of music, movement and carnality, that production arrives on Wednesday, May 2, at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn, where it will be performed in Greek with English supertitles. Adapted by Mr. Karathanos and Giannis Asteris, it\u2019s the centerpiece of an Aristophanes-inspired citywide festival, produced by the Onassis Cultural Center New York, that\u2019s already underway and continues through July 8. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES\n\nPhoto\n\nDance: Kyle Abraham at the Joyce\n\nMay 1-6, joyce.org.\n\nIn recent years, dance companies long associated with a single artist \u2014 such as the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Stephen Petronio Company and Martha Graham Dance Company \u2014 have made efforts to bring in new voices, commissioning works and restaging classics by choreographers other than their founders. Though younger than those troupes, Kyle Abraham\u2019s A.I.M., founded in 2006 (and formerly known as Abraham.in. Motion), is trying out something similar. For its Joyce Theater season the ensemble will perform works not only by Mr. Abraham but also by Andrea Miller, Bebe Miller and Doug Varone.\n\nProgram A features a new dance by Andrea Miller and Mr. Abraham\u2019s first solo in nearly a decade, \u201cINDY,\u201d which should be a treat: though his dancers are excellent, Mr. Abraham has the most intuitive understanding of his own lush movement.

Then he broke viewers\u2019 hearts by abandoning perhaps the only woman who could tolerate him after all that: Jules (Amanda Peet), the hard-drinking owner of a minor-league Pennsylvania team, who returned Brockmire to his rightful place in the booth. And fell in love with him.\n\n\u201cBrockmire\u201d was always about more than baseball, and Jules\u2019s sweet saltiness transformed his ferocity into something almost profound. Alas for Peet fans, Season 2, which began April 25 and airs Wednesdays on IFC, is a veritable bro-fest. It picks up in New Orleans as Brockmire chases his career and sinful temptation under the protective eye of his roommate and producer, Charles (Tyrel Jackson Williams), leaving viewers to wonder who will set Brockmire right this season.

The bomb, thought to have been dropped by the British Royal Air Force, had been discovered at a construction site for faculty buildings on the edge of Goethe University.\n\nLondon itself was hit with thousands of German bombs in 1940 and 1941, a period known as the Blitz.

Suddenly, this announcement came and there is instability,\u201d said Ms. Jalakam, 32, who now finds herself worrying about everything from day-to-day spending to vacation plans.\n\nAcross the country, thousands of Indian families are caught in a similar dilemma because of the outsized role that they play in the H-1B visa program.\n\nThe annual visa scramble began this week, with applications delivered by the truckload to government processing centers. The petitions represent tens of thousands of foreigners vying for the opportunity to work in the United States for three years or longer.\n\nMany are Indian software engineers and computer programmers recruited by American technology companies that say they cannot find enough talent in this country. Among the applicants are Indian math and science teachers headed for rural schools, as well as physicians and other professionals.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the H-1B program has spawned controversy. During his campaign, President Trump invited Americans displaced by H-1B workers to his rallies. Since taking office, he has ordered the program\u2019s overhaul, and his administration has taken steps to tighten scrutiny of applications.\n\nStill, demand for the visas continues unabated. In 2018, for the sixth consecutive year, the federal government was so flooded with petitions it stopped accepting them within a week. On Friday, officials announced they had reached their annual cap within five days and would resort again to a computer lottery to select the targeted 85,000 recipients. Universities and research organizations are exempt from the cap.\n\nNearly 365,000 H-1B petitions were approved in the 2017 fiscal year. This number includes first-time applications subject to the cap and renewals, which are not capped. Three-quarters of them went to Indian nationals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir success has been a mixed blessing. Tens of thousands of Indians on the temporary visas were later sponsored by their employers to remain permanently in the United States, but their families are in limbo, stuck in a ballooning backlog of green cards that are approved but cannot yet be issued.\n\nWhile skilled workers from most countries receive permanent residency a year or two after applying, Indians must wait a decade or longer because of their large numbers. The delays have meant that until recently thousands of women, many highly educated, remained at home while their husbands worked.\n\nChildren must also wait. If their family\u2019s green card is not approved before they turn 21, the children are no longer eligible for legal residency as dependents and must leave the country, though they may have spent much of their lives in the United States. The much-debated legal protection for so-called Dreamers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, applies to children who entered the country illegally, not to the offspring of legal immigrants.\n\nThe Obama administration attempted a partial fix to the problem in 2015, authorizing temporary work permits for spouses of H-1B visa holders who were in the pipeline to get a green card. Under the program, known as H-4EAD, an estimated 100,000 spouses, overwhelmingly women, have obtained work permits.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was free from a cage to fly in any direction I want,\u201d Ms. Jalakam said of her work authorization that year.\n\nLast fall\u2019s announcement that the temporary work program would soon be scrapped has energized Indian women. Many who had sunk money into property and other investments with earnings from their jobs took to Twitter, using #standwithh4ead and #saveh4ead to raise awareness of their plight.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Francis Cissna, director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security agency that issues the permits, said the Trump administration\u2019s priority was to protect American workers. \u201cThe reason there is a lot of concern about Americans being displaced is because it is happening,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nIn January, the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents titans like Apple, IBM and Microsoft, argued in a letter to the administration that revoking spousal work permits could prompt foreign talent to leave the United States and put American companies at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\u201cTheir valued, long-term employees will choose to leave their companies for other employment opportunities in countries that allow these workers and their families to raise their standard of living,\u201d the council warned.\n\nDoug Rand, former assistant director for entrepreneurship in the Obama administration, said Indian immigrants have long been \u201cessential for American technological innovation\u201d and offering work permits to spouses makes sense. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for these outrageous backlogs, they would be Americans already,\u201d he said.\n\nThe backlog that is creating the problem is a byproduct of immigration laws drafted decades ago.\n\nIn 1965, Congress established that no country could receive more than 7 percent of green cards issued in a year. In 1990, it determined that only 140,000 employment-based green cards could be granted annually, and each family member requires a separate card.\n\nThen the rise of the tech sector created a surge in demand for workers. Indians had the skills that American companies prized, so employers turned to the nonimmigrant H-1B visa to import them. Down the road, companies chose to sponsor many of the visa holders for green cards, which because of the annual caps created the current backlog.\n\nIn June 2015, the latest year for which official data is available, about 300,000 Indians, including spouses and children, were waiting for their permanent residency cards. Indians in the green-card process since 2008 are only now receiving them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNo one should be stuck waiting more than 10 years for a green card. It hurts employers and employees and their families,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. \u201cIndians are being held hostage by our broken immigration system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome families have had to wait so long that they fear their children will reach adulthood and be forced to leave.

He was named teacher of the year for the district in 2015-16.\n\nMr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s green card application, which includes his family, was approved in 2012. They are still waiting for the cards to be issued. Given that the wait time is 10 years, and getting longer, he is worried. In seven years, his 14-year-old daughter, Sivani, will be considered an adult. His son, Sarvan, will turn 21 in nine years. At that time, they will no longer be eligible for green cards as Mr. Vishnubhotla\u2019s dependents and could be forced to return to India.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to split our family,\u201d Mr. Vishnubhotla said.\n\nTeachers who arrived after him, including some whom he trained from Jamaica, Venezuela and elsewhere, already have permanent residency.\n\nJigar Madlani, a software engineer in Parsippany, N.J., came on an H-1B and hisgreen card was approved in 2013. But none of the family\u2019s cards have been issued, and he fears his wife, Heta, will soon lose her ability to work.\n\nArmed with an H-4EAD permit, she was hired in late 2015 as a case manager for New Jersey\u2019s 211 line, handling calls from drug addicts, homeless families, victims of domestic violence and others in crisis seeking help.\n\n\u201cI had no identity in this country.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "Fear. Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders may have worried that scaling back its investment bank would cause too much financial pain. Those operations last year provided 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue, so paring back the investment bank could have a big impact on the top line. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank hardly has the earnings to absorb the costs of a deep restructuring. In the first quarter of this year, a good period for Wall Street as a whole, Deutsche\u2019s investment bank posted a paltry return on equity of 1.4 percent. The potential cost of a far-reaching restructuring is also hard to assess. Deutsche Bank may be entangled in uneconomic trades that would cost large sums to exit. Fears of toxic exposures were stoked earlier this month, when it was reported that the European Central Bank had asked Deutsche Bank to estimate the costs of winding down its trading operations.\n\nConfusion. Deutsche Bank\u2019s leadership structure may have allowed big problems \u2013 like serious issues with I.T. \u2013 to fester and made it harder for leaders to take decisive actions. The bank had two C.E.O.s for a time. And any C.E.O. of Deutsche Bank has to work with two boards, one of which is a supervisory board that can have significant sway over strategy. A big question still hanging over Deutsche Bank is whether Paul Achleitner, the chairman of Deutsche Bank\u2019s supervisory board, is the right person to oversee the institution\u2019s next steps.\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nWhich banks stand to benefit from Deutsche Bank\u2019s retreat?\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.\n\nThe German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s scale of trading\n\nLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.\n\nDeutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\n\nWhich banks stand to benefit\n\nJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.\n\nThe cloud lifts Amazon and Microsoft\n\nAmazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.\n\nAmazon\u2019s numbers\n\n\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\n\n\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27.

Shares of Facebook fell nearly 19 percent in the weeks after The New York Times reported that the political consulting firm had acquired the private Facebook data of tens of millions of users \u2014 the largest known leak in Facebook history.\n\nSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.\n\nRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree).

But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.\n\nThe key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\n\n\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in tech: Twitter did well in the first quarter \u2014 but where is its growth coming from?

Nasdaq is open to future cryptocurrency trading. What happened as Mt. Gox fell.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat Qualcomm said about NXP\n\nThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.\n\nHere is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\n\n\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201d\n\nA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\n\n\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIs the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\n\nIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\n\nFrom Mr. Jackson\u2019s speech in Cleveland yesterday:\n\n\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline.

In his responses, Mr. Zuckerberg was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how Facebook will respond to its enormous challenges.\n\nOn balance, the hearing probably leaves Facebook and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.\n\nLegislation to rein in social media companies is now a possibility. Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg gave a response often heard from C.E.O.s: \u201cI think if it\u2019s the right regulation, then yes.\u201d Senator Graham then secured something of a commitment from Mr. Zuckerberg to work with the Senate on what regulations are necessary.\n\nA Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.\n\nRecidivism may now be taken more seriously. One of the reasons that Facebook is under scrutiny is that it has been the source of several scandals. Patience has apparently worn thin in the Senate. Facebook has not convincingly explained why it took so long to reveal Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of the data of 87 million users. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, sounded bewildered by that misstep: \u201cYou apologized for it. But you didn\u2019t notify them. And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million Facebook users?\u201d Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a stringent government response.\n\nLarge technology companies sense an economic threat. Mr. Zuckerberg made an intriguing comment that suggested Facebook could, in theory, offer a paid version, presumably to users who do not want ads or to share certain data with Facebook. He said: \u201cThere will always be a version of Facebook that will be free.\u201d This suggests that Facebook has begun to think about how it can adapt to a situation in which it gets access to less data from users. In other words, it may be taking a threat to its business model seriously.\n\nThe fact that Facebook\u2019s stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nWall Street likes Zuckerberg\u2019s performance\n\nInvestors certainly liked Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\nFacebook\u2019s shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.\n\nAfter being down as much as 24 percent this year, Facebook is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday\u2019s gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.\n\n\u2014 Matt Phillips\n\nTo regulate, or not to regulate\n\nAmong the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether Facebook needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. Zuckerberg said he open to Facebook being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nBut some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.\n\nHere\u2019s Senator Sullivan\u2019s question to Mr. Zuckerberg:\n\n\u201cRegulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that\u2019s a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we\u2019re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?\u201d\n\nIn other words, if the government decides to crack down on Facebook, could that end up holding back the next Facebook?\n\nMr. Zuckerberg conceded that that would be a risk.\n\n\n\nIs Facebook a monopoly?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for Facebook.\n\nIn the weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, many have said that Facebook can\u2019t be fixed and needs to be broken up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. Zuckerberg to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook has a lot of competitors.\n\nThen Mr. Graham pointed out that if a customer has a problem with the Ford they bought, they can buy a car from another auto maker. Here\u2019s their back-and-forth.\n\nMr. Graham asked: \u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook?\u201d\n\nMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cWell, we provide a number of diff...\u201d\n\nMr. Graham: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a monopoly?\u201d\n\nMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201d\n\nGenerations collide\n\nThe gap in knowledge about how Facebook\u2019s business works was on display at times during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of Facebook, so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.\n\nAt that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. Zuckerberg how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSir, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.\n\nMr. Hatch replied: \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nRegulation ahead?\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.\n\nHe said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201d\n\nIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201d\n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Cecilia Kang\n\nFacebook as a proxy for Silicon Valley\n\nMr. Zuckerberg is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.\n\nMr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying \u201cthe tech industry has an obligation to\u2026restore the public\u2019s trust.\u201d Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Zuckerberg, who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.\n\n\u201cI started Facebook when I was in college,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2014in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it\u2019s wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. Zuckerberg is a long way from his dorm room\u2014on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade\u2014and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he\u2019s mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Roose\n\nPhoto\n\nThe must-watch Facebook hearings start at 2:15 p.m. E.T.\n\nThat\u2019s when Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees; you can watch here.

After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.\n\nElsewhere in Facebook news: Wildlife preservation advocates complained to the S.E.C. that the company is serving ads on the pages of wildlife traffickers.\n\nPhoto\n\nWall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate\n\nBank of America will stop lending money to gun manufacturers that make military-inspired firearms for civilian use, such as the AR-15-style rifles that have been used in multiple mass shootings, a company executive said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,\u201d Anne M. Finucane, vice chairwoman at the Bank of America, said on Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe bank works with \u201cjust a handful of manufacturers,\u201d with whom it has had \u201cintense conversations over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Finucane said.

Shares in T-Mobile were up 5.7 percent as well.\n\nLet\u2019s recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn\u2019t quite been able to cross the finish line (which I\u2019ve covered multiple times over the years):\n\n\u2022 Sprint pursued T-Mobile in 2011, but lost out in the end to AT&T \u2014 which failed to complete the deal after the Justice Department sued to block that combination.\n\n\u2022 In 2014, Sprint, now owned by Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, held talks with T-Mobile, but eventually broke off the discussions after Washington regulators hinted strongly that they would move to block a union.\n\n\u2022 The two companies tried again in 2017, but this time the talks \u2014 which culminated over dinner at Mr. Son\u2019s home in Tokyo \u2014 fell apart because of disagreements about control over the combined company.\n\nBut there\u2019s little surprise that the companies wouldn\u2019t give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut since SoftBank\u2019s acquisition, Sprint has continued to labor under an enormous debt load and has struggled to catch up to T-Mobile as the most popular low-cost carrier. Sprint's operating income declined over the course of last year to $648 million in its fourth quarter. It also has reported losses in all but two quarters since 2015 (its $7.2 billion profit in the fourth quarter arose from the Republican tax overhaul).\n\nT-Mobile, by contrast, has done better, having gained customers by emphasizing its low prices and network improvements. Its operating income in the fourth quarter came to $950 million, while its net income totaled $2.7 billion (another beneficiary of the tax cuts).\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nPiercing the attorney-client privilege\n\nThe report in The New York Times that the F.B.I. seized records from the office of President Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer Michael D. Cohen raises a host of issues about how prosecutors might be able to review those materials. One challenge will be dealing with the attorney-client privilege, which shields communications between lawyers and clients from any outside review.\n\nUnder Justice Department guidelines, when a lawyer\u2019s office is search there must be procedures in place \u201cto ensure that privileged materials are not improperly viewed, seized or retained.\u201d One means to deal with privilege issues is to put in place a \u201ctaint team,\u201d consisting of agents and government attorneys who are not part of the underlying investigation to review the seized materials to determine what is arguably privileged.\n\nOnce that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.\n\nDespite President Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is dead,\u201d the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.\n\nThe government would not have to prove a crime to avoid the privilege, only that there is enough evidence to support a reasonable belief that an otherwise privileged communication was for the purpose of committing a criminal or fraudulent act. In fact, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Zolin, prosecutors could ask a judge to review the communications privately to decide whether they may yield evidence of a potential crime or fraud.\n\nThis is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don\u2019t be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose \u2013 whatever that might be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter J. Henning\n\nAn interesting dissenter: One critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that the Cohen raids violated attorney-client privilege is George Conway, who\u2019s of counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz \u2014 and the husband of Kellyanne Conway.\n\nPhoto\n\n(For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway\u2019s link points to the Justice Department\u2019s policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)\n\nThe C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office now says that by 2027, the United States\u2019 budget deficit will be $1.6 trillion larger than it previously expected, thanks in part to President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, which sharply cuts revenues. But close observers of the Treasury bond market \u2014 where Uncle Sam will have to turn to borrow the money it needs to cover those budget gaps \u2014 say it will doubtless be much higher.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists point out that the C.B.O.\u2019s projections only extrapolate discretionary spending increases through 2019 fiscal year, whereas the bank\u2019s analysis points to more spending through 2021 fiscal year, raising the Goldman\u2019s deficit projections higher.\n\nElsewhere, Jefferies economists noted that the analysis from the C.B.O. doesn\u2019t take into account the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual reduction of the amount of government bonds it is holding, which means that the Treasury has to replace the Fed as a buyer.\n\nAll else equal, the disappearance of a buyer like the Fed \u2014 which can create as much money as it needs \u2014 along with surging supply of Treasury borrowing needed to cover deepening deficits should add up one thing: Sharply higher interest rates.\n\n\u2014 Matt Phillips\n\nCritics\u2019 corner: The Peterson Foundation said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that lawmakers have added significantly more debt on top of an already unsustainable trajectory.\u201d Harm Bandholz of UniCredit said, \u201cThe C.B.O. strongly contradicts the administration\u2019s claim that the stimulus will pay for itself.\u201d\n\nThe political flyaround\n\n\u2022 A year before Apollo Global Management lent millions of dollars to Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner reportedly approached its co-founder Josh Harris about leading the Office of Management and Budget.

His harmonies and inventive instrumentation create an otherworldly realm. As the composer Pierre Boulez once remarked, the characters \u201cfloat\u201d in time and remain \u201cphantoms.\u201d\n\nThe preparation of a critical edition for the opera\u2019s orchestral score has yet to completed, however.

From 1907 to 1911, and again from 1916-17, a year before the composer died of cancer, he was heavily invested in writing an opera based on \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\u201d going through three versions of the libretto based on the translation of Charles Baudelaire.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The result would combine investigative storytelling and first-person narrative, in which the reporter\u2019s experience \u2014 her document digs, her dead ends, the patterns she learned to follow \u2014 become an inextricable part of a story about the Islamic State that is perhaps the first of its kind.\n\nIt was a story, for Ms. Callimachi, about changing the way the world views Mosul, the Islamic State and terrorism \u2014 transforming these from distant, military terms to something more human, relatable and visceral. \u201cWe have a long history of underestimating groups like ISIS,\u201d she said. \u201cIf history is a guide, we should expect that the organization will both rebound and metastasize.\u201d\n\nWith the goal of avoiding that kind of oversimplification in mind, The Times put together a multipart project that would bring readers directly into Mosul, through Ms. Callimachi\u2019s eyes. The Times\u2019s first narrative nonfiction podcast series, \u201cCaliphate,\u201d will be released on Thursday to subscribers. For the text story featuring the documents, \u201cThe ISIS Files,\u201d published last week, a digital design team created an interactive experience that allowed readers to view annotated documents showing chilling, quotidian details of the elaborate bureaucracy that ISIS had created \u2014 including things like D.M.V. records, arrest records for children goofing off in prayer services and property seizure records.\n\nIt was first and foremost a human narrative, about not only the kinds of people who led ISIS, but also the ones who joined it. \u201cWhat we kept talking about was, picture you live in Brooklyn, and tomorrow scary men with guns come and say, \u2018We\u2019re in charge now.\u2019 What do you do?\u201d said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor at The Times who edited and oversaw the project.\n\nAudio was a natural fit for such a project, and Ms. Callimachi, who has been reporting on extremist groups for The Times since 2014, a natural guide. Andy Mills, an audio producer and reporter for The Times, knew he wanted to pair the two, in part because much reporting about the Islamic State thus far lacked an immediacy that brought the story into the homes of listeners and stuck with them. \u201cWhen you hear the voice of someone like Michael Barbaro of \u2018The Daily\u2019 or Ira Glass on \u2018This American Life,\u2019 they feel almost like you know them. Like you have shared memories together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things about the Islamic State \u2014 and this is partly by their design \u2014 is that they feel so entirely the opposite.\u201d\n\nWhile the documents illuminated how a militant bureaucracy functioned and introduced the people it governed, the audio series introduced another human narrative \u2014 that of the reporter. In addition to the soundtrack of war, with bombs and bullets flying overhead, there is Ms. Callimachi\u2019s role as protagonist and guide \u2014 listeners hear her fears, her motivations and her determination to understand the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI hope that readers and listeners will come away with a more refined understanding of ISIS,\u201d Ms. Callimachi said. And beyond their interactions with the stories she has crafted, she hopes they will uncover stories of their own. The Times plans to release the 15,000 pages, potentially through a partnership with a university, for those who are interested in learning from the blueprints. What\u2019s at stake, she said, is an underestimation of an infrastructure that is likely to grow in size and sophistication over time.\n\nAs Ms. Callimachi put it, \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting a bunch of guys in a cave.\u201d", "title": "Through a Reporter\u2019s Eyes, Making ISIS Make Sense", "authors": ["Melina Delkic", "Katie Van Syckle"]}
{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "But the Heat made changes for Game 2 that changed the tenor of the series. They ramped up their defensive pressure along the 3-point line. They played with a brand of physicality that Brown described as a new experience for his young players, many of whom are wading into the choppy waters of the playoffs for the first time.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd the Heat turned to Wade, back in South Beach for the twilight of his career. On Monday, in his 174th career playoff game, he collected 28 points and 7 rebounds in 26 minutes.\n\n\u201cThere was a rhythm and a calmness to his game,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWade, beyond his prime at age 36, comes off the bench now. Coach Erik Spoelstra limits his minutes. These are necessary concessions to ensure that his limbs remain intact, that he does not crumble into a fine dust. But Wade is still capable of revving up his basketball time machine, still capable of rescuing his teammates, still capable of roasting defenders.\n\n\u201cTo be able to hush a whole crowd \u2014 that\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d Wade said after the game. \u201cThat\u2019s a feeling that I hope my son feels one day. That\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, there was a profoundly old-school feel to the way he filleted the 76ers. He relied on a steady diet of midrange jumpers, a shot ridiculed by the league\u2019s growing mass of number-crunching analysts. In the modern N.B.A., the long 2-pointer is about as popular as pleated pants. Only Wade seems capable of making it look fashionable again.\n\nFor his part, Wade emphasized the importance of experience, of which he has a wealth. He talked about the lessons he had drawn from Game 1, including the various ways that the 76ers had defended him. He talked about sitting in his hotel room the night before Game 2 and pondering how he could help his team. He settled on one theme.\n\n\u201cJust to be aggressive,\u201d he said.\n\nWade also talked about the mental calculations he made as Game 2 wore on. Watching from the bench, he noticed one play that the 76ers like to run, with Ben Simmons, the 76ers\u2019 talented first-year guard, bouncing a pass to Dario Saric at the elbow. Wade said he told himself that if the 76ers ran that play late in the game, he would be ready for it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

Wade, who was defending Ersan Ilyasova in the corner, jumped out to strip Saric and race away for a dunk that destroyed the 76ers\u2019 momentum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor all of Wade\u2019s exploits on offense, Brown assessed that steal as the \u201cdefining moment\u201d of the game. Wade likes to use that word, too: moment. At this stage of his career, as his familiar physical gifts fade, he searches for his moments, and he savors them. On Monday, he packed a playoff game full of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not always going to be able to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for the most part, to be able to come through for your team when they need you to, that feels good. The reason I was brought here was for a game like this.\u201d\n\nWhile the postseason is second-nature to Wade, it is a new adventure for most of the 76ers. Simmons has now appeared in two playoff games. Embiid has yet to make his debut.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s value in experiencing something,\u201d said J. J. Redick, one of the few veteran players on the 76ers. \u201cIt\u2019s way more important than just talking about something. Now that they\u2019ve experienced it and that we\u2019ve all experienced it as a group, I think we\u2019ll be better off because of it.\u201d\n\nBrown said that Jim O\u2019Brien, one of his assistant coaches, had told him something that resonated: Before a playoff series really starts, each team needs to get punched in the mouth. The 76ers landed the first blow. Behind Wade, the Heat responded with a flurry of their own.\n\n\u201cSo here we go,\u201d Brown said.", "title": "Throwing it Back, Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade Takes the 76ers to School", "authors": ["Scott Cacciola", "On Pro Basketball"]}

From that moment in 1997 when he slipped the winner\u2019s green jacket over his willowy frame after a staggering 12-stroke victory, Woods was the high-performance engine that drove golf forward financially, demographically and, possibly to his eventual detriment, athletically.\n\nThis week, Woods acknowledged his history of coming back too soon from surgeries.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, definitely,\u201d said Woods, who noted the pattern. He had knee surgery in December 2002 and won the first tournament he played less than two months later. He had his first back surgery in 2014 and played two competitive rounds less than two months later. He had two more back operations in the fall of 2015 and, 14 months after the second one, he returned for the event in the Bahamas that he hosts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pushing the boundaries of our bodies and minds and, unfortunately, a lot of times we go over the edge and we break down,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut thank God there\u2019s modern science to fix us and put us back together again.\u201d\n\n[READ MORE: Players to Watch at the Masters]\n\nNo one can know for sure whether Woods overdid his training, which began when he was 2 years old, but his vulnerability and medical odyssey over the last few years have made a case for restraint, for appreciating the longer potential career arc that differentiates golf from other professional sports like football.\n\nAfter winning 79 tour titles in his first 18 years as a pro, Woods has not had a victory since August 2013. His last major title came in 2008. He has spent much of the last three and a half years struggling to make the cut or recovering from surgery.\n\nWoods is still lean, fit and powerful, as measurements of his club-head speed attest, yet the supple 21-year-old Masters champion has given way to a brittle 42-year-old locked in battle with an undefeated opponent: time. \u201cIs anybody in here who is in their 40s ever going to feel like they did in their 20s?\u201d Woods asked a roomful of reporters last fall, before he began what figures to be a proud champion\u2019s last stand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWoods\u2019s decision last spring to have spinal fusion surgery, which he called \u201ca last resort\u201d after three less complex operations, seems to have restored him, at least for the moment. \u201cI got a second chance on life,\u201d Woods said on his website last week. \u201cI am a walking miracle.\u201d\n\nAfter everything Woods has put his body through, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder if, in retrospect, he wishes he had done anything differently. But regret is not in Woods\u2019s repertoire, as he demonstrated when I addressed that direct question to him. He answered as if he had followed the only path that was clear to him.\n\n\u201cAs an athlete, we\u2019re always pushing ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best ones push themselves beyond human limits. And that\u2019s what separates them.

But he did a double take when he glanced out the car window on a ride from the suburban course to the team hotel in downtown Boston during the 1999 Ryder Cup. Jogging on the side of the road toward the city was a 23-year-old Woods, the youngest United States team member by four years.\n\nAt the hotel, Love said, he asked Woods: Why run? Why not rest?\n\n\u201cI have to run,\u201d he recalled Woods saying. Love persisted: \u201cEverybody in Brookline knows you\u2019re here. Can\u2019t you just run on a treadmill?\u201d\n\nWoods replied, \u201cI can outrun them.\u201d\n\nIn his 20s, Woods obsessively ran about 30 miles a week. His motivation, he said, was to improve his endurance, but he also found the rhythmic footfalls calming. \u201cI just find it peaceful,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with Men\u2019s Fitness.\n\nPhoto\n\nWoods also lifted heavy weights, an activity players before him had avoided in the belief that big muscles would restrict flexibility and impede their swings. Woods made it his mission to change the perception that golfers were not real athletes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith his collared shirts barely containing his muscles, Woods routinely clobbered courses \u2014 and the competition. His athleticism and dominance increased golf\u2019s appeal to younger players like Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth, who were proficient at multiple sports.\n\n\u201cTiger\u2019s is the last generation that went through high school and got laughed at for playing golf,\u201d said Arron Oberholser, a Golf Channel analyst who played for San Jose State against Stanford when Woods was there.\n\nThe work that Woods put in to make golf look cool and effortless was on display even before he entered high school. The summer before his freshman year, he was at the Navy Golf Course near his Cypress, Calif., home from sunup till sundown. He would hit a bucket of balls for every club in his bag and then play the course.\n\nAs a freshman, Woods was always the first player on the practice range, which rubbed off on his older teammates, who had been more inclined to dig into a basket of fries than a bucket of range balls.\n\n\u201cHe changed high school golf,\u201d said Don Crosby, who coached Woods at Western in Anaheim, Calif. He added, \u201cWhen the other kids saw him out on the range hitting balls, they stopped going to the snack bar.\u201d\n\nWoods began chiseling his body \u2014 and golf\u2019s image \u2014 soon after he arrived at Stanford. The authors Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian, in their new unauthorized biography \u201cTiger Woods,\u201d wrote that the freshman Woods obtained his own key to the weight room from the football coach, Bill Walsh, who had guided the 49ers to three Super Bowl titles.\n\nThe key was his golden ticket, allowing him to lift whenever he wanted. Once Woods turned pro, it wasn\u2019t long before he filled out the sweaters that once hung loosely on him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2005, Luke List was an amateur playing at the United States Open in Pinehurst, N.C. One morning in the weight room of the hotel where he was staying, List stumbled upon Woods running on a treadmill.\n\n\u201cHe was in there for an hour and a half, and he was doing some pretty impressive lifting,\u201d List recalled, adding, \u201cI ended up spending longer watching what he was doing than working out.\u201d\n\nAs Woods is well aware, the game can strain bodies all by itself. He has been swinging a club since he was a toddler and competing in tournaments since he was 4 years old.\n\n\u201cWe put a lot of shearing on our spines, a lot of rotation,\u201d Woods said of golfers in general. \u201cOn top of that, we hit hundreds of thousands of shots and so it\u2019s the cumulative effect. And I\u2019ve been playing tournament golf for 38 years, so it\u2019s a lot of shearing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBrandt Snedeker, an eight-time tour winner, has noticed that after all those years of dedication to the game, Woods\u2019s right pinkie is misshapen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hooked like it\u2019s meant to be on a golf club,\u201d Snedeker said.\n\nUnstoppable\n\nOn the final nine of the 2013 Barclays, Woods was stalking what could have been his sixth PGA Tour victory of the year when a week of back spasms caught up with him. After hitting a shot from the 13th fairway, he fell to his knees as if struck by lightning.\n\nWoods did not withdraw. Somehow he kept going and even birdied two of his last three holes to finish one stroke behind the winner, Adam Scott. Still ailing, Woods completed 12 competitive rounds over the next four weeks.\n\nIt was a familiar script. He had always played through injuries, sometimes in defiance of medical advice. Two weeks before the 2008 United States Open, a doctor told Woods that the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee required him to use crutches for a few weeks, stay off his feet for three more weeks and then begin physical therapy.", "title": "Tiger Woods Bulked Up and Broke Down.

If he were to win this tournament, he said, it wouldn\u2019t even qualify as the greatest comeback of all time in golf.\n\nWoods mentioned Ben Hogan, who in 1949 was driving a car that collided head-on with a Greyhound bus. Hogan\u2019s left leg was mangled. He sustained fractures in his left collarbone, left ankle, pelvis and a rib. He developed blood clots. After being sidelined for a little more than a year, Hogan returned at age 37 and won the last six of his nine majors, including two Masters.\n\n\u201cI mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships,\u201d Woods said, insisting that Hogan\u2019s comeback qualified as the greatest in sports because of \u201cthe pain he had to endure, the things he had to do just to play, the wrapping of the leg, all the hot tubs, and just how hard it was for him to walk, period.\u201d\n\nJack Burke Jr., the 1956 Masters champion, was competing when Hogan returned. Now 95, Burke watched the telecast of Thursday\u2019s round from the Champions Golf Club in Houston, which he helped start.\n\nWhen Hogan returned, Burke said, there much less fanfare. \u201cThe tour didn\u2019t have the reputation that it does now because of television,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came back, and it was like nobody knew he had been gone.\u201d", "title": "Tiger Woods Is More Dogged Than Dazzling in His Return to the Masters", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "In retrospect, it\u2019s not clear how closely the two disasters \u2014 the marital blowup and then the golf meltdown \u2014 were related. Tiger actually played pretty well for a while after his life started unraveling \u2014 though his last major victory, at the U.S. Open, was in 2008 \u2014 and a lot of his golf woes were probably physical rather than psychological.\n\nYet it\u2019s hard not to read a moral dimension into the Tiger story, and the forthcoming biography by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian (\u201cTiger Woods\u201d) only deepens your sense that all along this was a tragedy in the making. Tiger\u2019s success, if you believe the authors \u2014 and they make a persuasive, if sometimes overstated, case \u2014 came at enormous cost. That Tiger\u2019s father, Earl, was a sort of blowhard Svengali we already knew; especially after he had had a few drinks, he was always going on about how his son was the \u201cChosen One\u201d who would \u201cchange the course of humanity.\u201d The new revelation here is that his Thai mother, Kultida, was just as ruthless, a tiger mom urging her son to be an \u201cassassin\u201d on the course.\n\n\u201cYou have to go for the throat,\u201d she told him. \u201cbecause if all friendly, they come back and beat your ass. So you kill them. Take their heart.\u201d Together Earl and Kultida raised their son in what amounted to a golf-themed isolation chamber. He was allowed no friends or other interests; starting in kindergarten, he went straight from school every day to the practice range, where Mr. Benedict and Mr. Keteyian estimate he put in something like 10,000 hours by the time he was 12. This regimen produced arguably the greatest golfer ever but also, and not surprisingly, a less than fully formed human being. The strippers and sleazy girlfriends are the least of it. Tiger in this biography emerges as almost robotically cold and distant, someone who never picks up a check if he can help it, who cuts off his friends suddenly and without explanation, who doesn\u2019t even apologize after trashing the house he rents every year in Augusta. He\u2019d be loathsome if he weren\u2019t so pathetic.\n\nOr if he hadn\u2019t seemed to turn a new leaf. Mr. Benedict and Mr. Keteyian claim that, having hit bottom, Tiger has now rediscovered his humanity, so that his story is really one of redemption. What they couldn\u2019t have predicted is how quickly, after another back operation just a year ago, his game has also rebounded.

That threshold was lowered to a simple majority in 2013 by Democrats, and they say that if they now relented on debate time, they would have little recourse to challenge nominees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey also note that new disclosures that derailed the nomination of Dr. Ronny L. Jackson as the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs illustrate the need to make sure there is sufficient time to scrutinize nominees sent over by the Trump White House.\n\nThey contend that Mr. McConnell cannot hail the number of judges the Senate has confirmed and simultaneously complain about a slow pace. And they say that staff turmoil and rampant ethics issues in the Trump administration have clogged the pipeline with multiple confirmation fights for the same position, including secretary of state, secretary of health and human services, the director of the C.I.A. and now the secretary of veterans affairs.\n\n\u201cOur Republican colleagues bemoan the pace of the nominations, but we see with the administration\u2019s quick, sloppy vetting process that the Senate\u2019s need to vet nominees is more important than ever before,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday. \u201cJust let\u2019s look at the cabinet.

With little to no Democratic support, it cannot pass the Senate under existing rules.\n\nHowever, Mr. McConnell could use a parliamentary tactic to impose the new requirements by a simple majority vote just as the former Senate leader Harry Reid did in 2013 to weaken the ability to filibuster executive and judicial branch nominees except for those to the Supreme Court. Mr. McConnell used the same approach in 2017 to limit the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees as he pushed Neil M.

But he was dealt a stinging setback in Alabama, after his scandal-scarred prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Roy S. Moore, was defeated in a special election for the Senate by the Democrat, Doug Jones.\n\nWhile Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump have yet to repair their rift, the president\u2019s moves against China represent a policy victory for his excommunicated aide. During his final weeks in the White House, Mr. Bannon kept a whiteboard in his office, on which he had scrawled a calendar for trade actions against China, the European Union and others.\n\nThe rollout was delayed for a few months after other advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the national economic council, persuaded Mr. Trump that he should not impose tariffs at the same time he was pushing a tax-cut bill, because it would antagonize Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nLater, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin warned the president that protectionist moves would pummel the stock market, which Mr. Trump views as a barometer of his success. That was true last week, when the market plunged over fears of a trade war with China. But Mr. Trump\u2019s more conciliatory tone over the weekend fueled a modest rebound on Monday.\n\nMr. Bannon blamed the news media and Wall Street for fanning fears of a trade war, even as he conceded that the tariffs would drive up the price of some consumer goods in the United States and that China\u2019s retaliation against soybean imports could hurt American farmers.\n\n\u201cThe American consumer is going to pay 3 percent more for their products at Walmart,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverything is about the American consumer, but what about the American worker?\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Bannon is gone from the White House, officials there still share his views, not least Peter Navarro, the director of trade and industrial policy. An economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China,\u201d Mr. Navarro is the intellectual driver of the trade policy.\n\nFor Mr. Bannon, the trade dispute is part of a larger narrative about how China has systematically exploited the United States, building up its middle class on the backs of American workers by exporting the overcapacity in its steel and other industries. China, he said, posed a far greater threat to the United States than Japan, the Soviet Union or any other historic rival.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor 20 years, we\u2019ve not confronted the most significant threat this country has faced,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time in our history where we really have a competitor with an economy that could be vastly larger than ours.\u201d\n\nChina, moreover, has dedicated itself to dominating next-generation industries like artificial intelligence and robotics. It is waging economic and information warfare against the United States \u2014 a step short of actual war, though he said that was now more likely than in 2016, when he predicted, \u201cWe\u2019re going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is far greater than trade; this is far deeper than tariffs,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of the coming confrontation with China. \u201cThis is about a confrontation, on a global scale, between two systems.\u201d", "title": "To Bannon, Tariffs on China Will Be Ultimate Test of Trump\u2019s Beliefs", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}
{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "Partly, this is a question of money and influence. Like almost every cultural organization in Cuba, Acosta Danza is connected to the government and subject to government approval. As a favored son, who has often returned to perform, Mr. Acosta has been granted some prime real estate for rehearsal space, among other privileges, by the Ministry of Culture. But the government-sponsored salaries are at Cuban rates, so it helps that Mr. Acosta has other connections.\n\nAcosta Danza is also supported by Sadler\u2019s Wells, one of the foremost dance theaters and commissioning organizations in Britain. Its artistic director, Alistair Spalding, said in a recent interview that Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2014 which has been producing Cuban-themed and Acosta-and-Friends-style shows for more than a decade \u2014 now arranges international tours for Acosta Danza and subsidizes the dancers\u2019 salaries on those tours at much higher rates. (\u201cSome dancers have already been able to buy houses,\u201d Mr. Acosta reported proudly.) Its financial support also pays the fees of big-name choreographers like Mr. Cherkaoui, a Sadler\u2019s Wells associate artist whose high-profile client list has lately included Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nIn this way, a remedy for one problem facing Cuban dance \u2014 limited funds \u2014 helps address another: weakness in choreography. Cuba is famous for producing dancers the rest of the world finds astonishing, many of whom go abroad or even \u201cdefect\u201d in the Cold War sense, but that reputation doesn\u2019t extend to the development of choreographers.\n\nMr. Acosta blames cultural isolation: \u201cYou can\u2019t make great Champagne in a closet.\u201d For decades, Cold War politics and poverty have limited the access that Cuban dancers have had to changes in technique and taste shared by the rest of the dance world. Lately, the situation has been improving, but there\u2019s a lot of catching up to do. When Mr. Acosta says he wants to bring the world to his dancers, importing world-class choreographers is a crucial component of what he means.\n\nMr. Acosta\u2019s hope, he said, is that these choreographers will expose not just his dancers but the whole Cuban dance scene to global trends, ideas and standards of excellence. Yet he is also aware of a potential pitfall: that by stocking his repertory with the work of sought-after choreographers (Pontus Lidberg, Justin Peck and, still on his wish list, Crystal Pite) he might make Acosta Danza indistinguishable from the many companies that also present their dances.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne strategy is to encourage choreographers to use Cuban music and designers. Another is to favor dancemakers from the Spanish-speaking world. Two pieces on the City Center program are by lesser-known Spanish choreographers: \u201cAlrededor no Hay Nada,\u201d a dark but jazzy ensemble work that Goyo Montero made for Ballet Nacional in 2006, and \u201cTwelve,\u201d an intricate team exercise in tossing water bottles, by Jorge Crecis. More significantly, though, the remaining two works are by Cubans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne is \u201cEl Cruce Sobre el Ni\u00e1gara,\u201d which Marianela Bo\u00e1n created for Danza Contempor\u00e1nea in 1987. By including this piece, a duet that translates the difficulty of tightrope walking into dance, Mr. Acosta acknowledges that his project isn\u2019t starting from scratch. Soon after Ms. Bo\u00e1n created it, she founded her own company, DanzAbierta, part of a wave of troupe-founding and creativity at that time. (That Ms. Bo\u00e1n and many others of her generation later left Cuba to pursue their artistic ambitions is another reminder of the challenges.)\n\nThe other is \u201cNosotros,\u201d by Ra\u00fal Reinoso, who will perform in it. He\u2019s in Acosta Danza, but until recently was a member of Danza Contempor\u00e1nea. Why did he make the switch? Because, he explained over the phone from Havana, Mr. Acosta immediately embraced him as both a dancer and a choreographer. Mr. Reinoso said he hadn\u2019t initially considered \u201cNosotros,\u201d an intimate duet he created with his girlfriend, Beatriz Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz, as a work for public consumption, but Mr. Acosta saw and liked it, and put it into the repertory.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I haven\u2019t really seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing that outsiders are always saying about Cuban dancers. As for Mr. Acosta, he stressed that his project was still in a very early stage. \u201cThis will take years to develop,\u201d he said, but so far the going has been less tough than he expected.

After World War II, a powerful coalition of Texas oil interests and Detroit auto manufacturers helped push through the Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956 that jump-started the interstate highway system. Railroad companies were encouraged to dump passenger service, and this \u2014 among other factors \u2014 helped bring massive structural transformation to the country: broadening the footprint of suburban sprawl, addicting Americans to petroleum, changing agricultural and retail patterns and, as a footnote, sending the once-mighty American passenger train into the perpetual nursing home of Amtrak.\n\nOther global examples, both historic and recent, show how state metamorphosis manifests in the railbed. Russia became a bicontinental power by extending its rails into Siberia. Benito Mussolini famously took credit for Italian rail upgrades. The British unified thousands of principalities in colonial India not through language but through railways, and when the government of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sought to ramp up the economy in the mid-2000s, it cut hiring quotas at Indian Railways and promoted round-the-clock freight loading. China sought to hit six percent growth targets through the last decade by building a stupendous $508 billion network of high-speed trains knitting together its major cities. Last year, Kenya opened the Madaraka Express between the port at Mombasa and the capital of Nairobi that can carry 22 million tons of cargo a year, strengthening its dependence on imports and deepening its reliance on Asia.\n\nThe calls to reform France\u2019s SNCF is partly coming from the outside \u2014 the European Union requires members to open railways to competition by January 2019. Still, Mr. Macron is taking aim at an institution that \u2014 for all its glories and faults \u2014 comes close to representing the soul of France itself, a representation of the permanent state indifferent to the winds of politics ever since Emperor Napoleon III provided a state guarantee of interest to bondholders in 1852, and instructed Georges-Eugene Haussmann to give the marbled palaces of railway stations an honored place in his redesign of Parisian boulevards.\n\nLines radiated outward from the Gare du Nord, Gare de l\u2019Est and Gare d\u2019Orsay, among others, creating a Paris-centric concept of the hexagonal nation that persists today: The historian Jules Michelet perceived it as a grand tool of unification. \u201cThe chateau represents pleasure, the caprice of one man; the railway is for everyone\u2019s use, bringing France together, bringing Lyon and Paris into communion with one another,\u201d he is reported to have said after a ride to Versailles. Gustav Eiffel made himself a celebrity engineer with railway bridges before he ever attempted a tower, and France remade its countryside with suburbs anchored to railway stations.\n\nThe heavy hand of Paris brought distinctively French touches: padded seats even in third class, an unwieldy timetable the size of a dictionary, the grandeur of the high-speed TGV, and a class of civil servants who call themselves cheminots with essentially a job for life and guaranteed sick leave, which created the old French joke that working for the railway must be dangerous because its employees are always getting ill.\n\nFrom 1910 onward, the unions have made rail strikes a predictable element of the national vocabulary and a fearsome weapon deployed against unfriendly French politicians. When he was prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9 tried to reform the SNCF. He lasted only two years in office after a set of strikes in 1995 made commuters miserable and turned him into a pariah.

In the past few years, geneticists have isolated a number of gene variations that are strongly associated with serious heart conditions and can be pinpointed with genetic testing.\n\nBut providing people with genetic information suggesting that their hearts are menaced without also offering them possible ways to stave off that threat seems callous.\n\nThankfully, some past studies have hinted that people\u2019s lifestyles, including how they eat and exercise, can ease even strong inherited risks for heart problems.\n\nBut most such studies have examined a range of lifestyle issues.\n\nFor the new study, which was published this month in Circulation, researchers at Stanford University and other institutions decided to focus specifically on the role of physical fitness.\n\nBecause they also wanted to include a large and varying group of people in the study, they turned to the trove of data gathered in Britain in the U.K. Biobank, which houses health information about more than 500,000 men and women who were between ages 40 and 69 at the study\u2019s start in 2006.\n\nAll of the participants had provided blood and saliva samples for genetic testing, filled out extensive questionnaires about their exercise and other health habits, and in some cases, sweated on a stationary bike or treadmill and later squeezed a vise-like gadget to quantify their aerobic fitness and muscular strength. Some also wore activity monitors for a week to objectively track how much they moved.\n\nThe researchers zeroed in on the 482,702 men and women in the study who had had no known heart disease at the start, genetically typing their tissue samples, looking for various snippets of genes known to raise heart disease risk. They also stratified them into three groups, based on how fit and strong they were.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many did, according to their health records, especially if they carried any of the gene variants associated with cardiac conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut physical fitness changed that calculus significantly, the data showed.\n\nThose men and women with the highest aerobic fitness halved their statistical likelihood of developing heart disease, no matter how worrisome their genetic profiles, the scientists found.\n\nIn essence, if people were fit, they were less likely to have heart problems than someone who was less fit, even if their genes predicted heart disease.\n\nStout grip strength likewise reduced cardiac-disease risk, although not quite to the same extent.\n\n\u201cWhat this tells us is that you can mitigate some of your genetic risk for heart disease by being fit, no matter how high that risk may be,\u201d says Dr. Erik Ingelsson, a professor of medicine at Stanford who oversaw the study.\n\nThe data intimate, too, that the amount of fitness required is not huge. The people in the high-fitness group \u201cwere not athletes,\u201d Dr. Ingelsson says. They engaged in moderate activities, like walking, according to their activity questionnaires.\n\nThe study can\u2019t tell us, though, precisely how much we need to exercise to get the best protection against genetic heart disease, he says, because the number of people who wore fitness trackers was too small for such determinations.\n\nIt also is an associational study, meaning that it shows links between higher fitness and lower disease risk. But it cannot prove that one caused the other.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing, the study raises a raft of new questions about the complicated interplay of genes, environment and lifestyles. Like heart disease risk, aerobic fitness and muscular strength each can be affected by genetic inheritance, Dr. Ingelsson says, and certain gene variants involved in physical fitness might alter the workings of other variants affecting heart disease risk, or vice versa, even before someone hits the sidewalk for a brisk walk.\n\nDiet, smoking, weight and other aspects of health and lifestyle can also change how some genes affect other genes.

Some, like Kom\u00e9 and Fukumoto Sushi & Yakitori Izakaya, offer a familiar menu of nigiri, sashimi and sushi rolls. Newer places like Kyoten Sushiko and Otoko, in the South Congress Hotel, are tiny destinations for intricate, expensive omakase.\n\nAnd now, some kitchens are taking the next step: integrating Japanese cooking with the traditional foods of Texas.\n\nPhoto\n\nTakuya Matsumoto and Tatsu Aikawa, chefs and business partners who opened Kemuri Tatsu-ya last year, are the leading lights of this new hybrid cuisine. Mr. Matsumoto, who is better known as Tako, calls the restaurant\u2019s marriage of Texas smokehouse and Japanese bar food \u201ca pretty good representation of us as Japanese Texans. It\u2019s not that much different than Tex-Mex, really.\u201d\n\nMr. Cole stepped up to the same task in early April, opening Loro, which he calls an Asian smokehouse. His collaborator is Aaron Franklin, the chef and owner of Franklin Barbecue, an Austin landmark where the hourslong lines that regularly form outside are nearly as famous as the brisket served inside.\n\nWhile Mr. Cole\u2019s restaurants in Austin, Houston and Dallas are based, albeit loosely, on the fundamentals of the Japanese sushi tradition, the menu at Loro is dominated by meat cooked in a hardwood smoker and paired with Asian-inspired sauces and sides. The space is designed in part to resemble a classic Texas dance hall. (Loro is the sixth restaurant operated by Hai Hospitality, Mr. Cole\u2019s company, with a seventh, Uchi Denver, scheduled to open this summer.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cole said the inspiration for Loro flowed from his belief that the signature cuisines of Japan and Texas are naturally compatible. \u201cSlicing the meat to order, serving it directly to the customer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so similar to what we do with sushi.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Franklin said, with a smile, that the restaurant will test Mr. Cole\u2019s theory that Texas barbecue is, as Mr. Franklin put it, \u201cthe overcooked, red-meat version of sushi.\u201d\n\nMr. Franklin, a 40-year-old former rock guitarist, is a partner in Loro as well as its resident barbecue expert. He led a recent tour of the space on South Lamar Boulevard, not far from the original Uchi, along with James Dumapit, 33, an Uchi and Uchiko veteran and Loro\u2019s chef de cuisine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to stray too far from the central Texas tradition,\u201d Mr. Dumapit said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rub yellow curry over brisket, for example, because Aaron does brisket obviously very well.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe credibility that Mr. Franklin provides Loro is fairly obvious. More complicated is the role that Mr. Cole, a white man born in Florida, has played in making Japanese food fashionable in this trend-conscious city.\n\nSpurred by a passion for sushi that he acquired without leaving the state of Texas, Mr. Cole rose through the kitchens of Japanese-run restaurants in Austin, slowed but undeterred by the fact that he is not Japanese.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make sushi because you are white,\u201d Mr. Cole said he was told by the first boss he asked for permission to cut fish. A compromise was ultimately reached: Mr. Cole would roll sushi behind the kitchen\u2019s closed door, where diners couldn\u2019t see him.\n\nAfter a year and a half, he was allowed to make sushi in front of customers. \u201cBut only at lunchtime,\u201d he said. \u201cMy tip jar was full every day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cole is quick to credit the Japanese chefs he has labored alongside in Austin for sharing their expertise. Foremost among them is Mr. Fuse, the chef and owner of Musashino Sushi Dokoro, where Mr. Cole worked for more than seven years, starting in 1993.\n\nMr. Fuse demanded that Mr. Cole learn to speak, read and write Japanese as part of his culinary training. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am today if not for him,\u201d Mr. Cole said of his mentor.\n\nMr. Fuse is held in high esteem by Austin chefs. Both Takehiro Asazu, of Kom\u00e9, and Kazu Fukumoto, of Fukumoto Sushi, apprenticed under Mr. Fuse, who is known around town as Smokey.\n\nHe is also known to be reclusive. Mr. Fuse did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Mr. Aikawa, a former pupil, relayed the chef\u2019s response: \u201cIt\u2019s not my style. I\u2019m a ninja.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Mr. Cole\u2019s signature dishes \u2014 like smoked yellowtail and Asian pear, or maguro and goat cheese \u2014 are often built on nontraditional pairings.\n\nPhoto\n\nKayo Asazu, 42, who owns Kom\u00e9 with her husband, Mr. Asazu, 44, says Mr. Cole made experimentation a distinguishing element of Japanese food in Austin.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see things like that in Japan,\u201d she said. (The couple, who were born and raised in Japan, also operate two locations of the Japanese-style coffee shop Sa-T\u00e9n.)\n\nMr. Cole is not the only non-Japanese chef in Austin who has hitched his star to the country\u2019s cuisine. Mr. Phan, of Kyoten Sushiko, was born in Houston to Vietnamese immigrants. Stacy Chen, who was born in Taiwan but moved to Austin as a child, modeled her new restaurant, Yoshi Ramen, on a shop her Taiwanese grandmother ran in Osaka.\n\nPhoto\n\nPaul Qui, 37, a native of the Philippines, was executive chef of Uchiko when he won the ninth season of \u201cTop Chef\u201d in 2012, a star-making moment for both Mr. Qui and the Austin restaurant scene. He established his own aesthetic \u2014 pan-Asian, with a soft spot for sushi and Southeast Asian spices \u2014 with the food trucks and restaurants he opened in Austin and, more recently, Houston. (In 2016, Mr. Qui was arrested on charges of domestic violence, an incident that has cast a shadow over his empire and career; the case against him was recently dismissed, after the woman involved declined to serve as a witness.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmanda Turner, 31, grew up in Dallas, \u201cwatching anime, wishing to go to Japan.\u201d She said she felt she had \u201chit the jackpot\u201d when she landed a job at Uchi while she was still in culinary school.\n\nToday, Ms. Turner is chef de cuisine at Juniper, an Italian restaurant, but she is looking forward to this summer, when she\u2019ll begin a three-month apprenticeship at the acclaimed Tokyo restaurant Nihonryori RyuGin.\n\nWhen she returns to Austin, Ms. Turner said, she hopes to open a Japanese restaurant of her own. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of precedent for white men to take possession of another culture\u2019s food,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a black woman. I\u2019d like to change that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Aikawa and Mr. Matsumoto, of Kemuri Tatsu-ya, don\u2019t face those kinds of questions around cultural appropriation and Japanese food. Both chefs were raised in Austin\u2019s tight-knit Japanese-American community \u2014 Mr. Aikawa, 36, was born in Tokyo, and Mr. Matsumoto, 38, is the son of Japanese immigrants \u2014 and gravitated to restaurant work to supplement their income as hip-hop D.J.s.\n\nBoth are sushi enthusiasts \u2014 they spoke over a platter of plum-mackerel and toro-radish rolls at Musashino, where Mr. Aikawa got his start. But a stint working at Urasawa, the Michelin-starred sushi restaurant in Beverly Hills, Calif., caused Mr. Aikawa to adjust his ambitions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to run a restaurant where I\u2019m charging, like, $1,000 a person,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, he moved back to Austin to open Ramen Tatsu-ya with Mr. Matsumoto in 2012. They apply the discipline of the sushi bar to the broth-making in their ramen shop. It spawned a second location in 2015.\n\nIn recent years, the two chefs have become more comfortable with their natural instinct to blend the foods of Texas and Japan. On trips to Lockhart, a Texas barbecue mecca, Mr. Aikawa would bring his own rice and return with brisket to feed his staff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the ramen entrepreneurs started brainstorming for a restaurant they planned to open inside a former barbecue joint in East Austin, they asked themselves, Mr. Aikawa said, \u201cWhat if there was a Japanese guy in Texas 100 years ago? What would he be cooking at a roadhouse?\u201d\n\nThe answer is Kemuri Tatsu-ya. The restaurant and bar, decorated with Texas flags, taxidermy and vintage signs in Japanese, is as much of a mashup as the food and drink. The menu includes sake, sochu and local craft beer; smoked fish collar, eel and gochujang-rubbed pork ribs; two types of brisket ramen; and beef tongue and chorizo tamales made with sticky rice.\n\nKemuri\u2019s success \u2014 its owners have leases on two new Austin restaurant spaces \u2014 suggests that the city\u2019s diners are plenty ready for whatever Loro has in store.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne might expect Mr. Franklin, the barbecue maven, to be wary of taking liberties with smoked meat, considering the stringently traditional fare on which he built his reputation. The only sides on Franklin Barbecue\u2019s menu (coleslaw, potato salad, pinto beans) are absent from Loro\u2019s, supplanted by dishes like coconut-scented rice and papaya salad.\n\nAt Franklin Barbecue, he said, \u201cthere would be anarchy in the streets if we changed anything or tried to get fancy.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Franklin is also a product of Austin\u2019s cross-cultural forces. He appears energized by the opportunity to recast his smoked meats with shishito salsa verde and house-made hoisin.\n\nThough the meat at Loro is \u201csuper traditional, just salt and pepper,\u201d Mr. Franklin added, there is freedom for his partners \u201cto do what they do, making really rad sides and sauces.

He didn\u2019t seem sure.\n\nActing is useful to Mr. Hollander anyway. Liam Neeson, who starred with Mr. Hollander on Broadway 20 years ago in David Hare\u2019s \u201cThe Judas Kiss,\u201d wrote, \u201cHe\u2019s small in stature, yet when he performs he becomes huge.\u201d\n\nMr. Hollander\u2019s self-consciousness rarely follows him onstage. A good role, he said, is like taking a paid vacation from himself. Each television show, each movie, each play, it\u2019s a chance to disappear into a character. \u201cIt\u2019s like going on holiday without having to get on an airplane,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nObviously \u2014 obviously? \u2014 the Zurich of \u201cTravesties\u201d is a nice place to land.

Will audiences understand it? \u201cOnce you\u2019ve given up the attempt it becomes very, very enjoyable,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Wood created the role of Henry Carr, winning a Tony Award for his pains; Antony Sher played it a generation later. When Mr. Hollander and Mr. Marber discussed the revival, they knew they wanted to make Carr a more poignant figure, his younger self haunted by the war that wounded him, his older hassled by senility. \u201cIt\u2019s a comic role, but Tom is able to make it a tragic role as well, which is what I wanted,\u201d Mr. Marber said.\n\nCarr is always dreaming up titles for his memoirs: \u201cFurther Recollections of a Consular Official in Whitest Switzerland,\u201d \u201cMemories of Dada by a Consular Friend,\u201d \u201cZurich by One Who Was There.\u201d Does Mr. Hollander, who has written teasing columns for The Spectator (I\u2019m partial to the one about Joan Collins), ever plan on writing a memoir?

For decades he\u2019s told interviewers that he\u2019d like to marry and have children. He\u2019s never managed it. \u201cI always thought it would happen. It didn\u2019t happen. I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself,\u201d he said. Then he made the joke about attacking the roast chicken.\n\nMr. Marber has wondered if some kind of wound, some kind of loneliness enables Mr. Hollander\u2019s acting.

That score left Finau, who had injured himself while celebrating a hole-in-one in the tournament\u2019s par-3 contest, in a tie for second place with Matt Kuchar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of a miracle, if you ask me,\u201d Finau said of his performance.\n\nWhen Finau walked off the 18th green Thursday \u2014 with a slight limp \u2014 it had been only about 24 hours since television cameras captured him running backward with his arms over his head as he rejoiced during the largely ceremonial par-3 contest.\n\nThings went from winsome to gruesome quickly, as Finau\u2019s left foot landed off-balance and the ankle bent awkwardly while he slid to the turf. The distorted ankle was plain to see, and the view became more cringe-worthy as cameras captured Finau reaching down with his left hand and popping the ankle back into place.\n\nOr as Finau, 28, said Thursday evening, looking back on the injury and a video of it that he had already watched several times: \u201cI saw where it was and I knew where it needed to be. I popped it back in and tried to be as smooth as I could be.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on Wednesday evening Finau, who was playing in his first Masters, left the golf course to be examined by doctors. Withdrawing from the tournament seemed a likely outcome.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty devastating,\u201d his father, Kelepi Finau, said Thursday as he stood near the Augusta National clubhouse. \u201cTony had waited a long time to play in the Masters. It had been almost a lifelong dream, and now we were getting ready to pack up without him playing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut a magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed that the only serious damage was torn ligaments. It was, Finau said, a sprained ankle, albeit a bad one.\n\n\u201cTony called me about 11 p.m. last night and said, \u2018Hey, Dad, I think I\u2019m going to play tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Finau\u2019s father said.\n\nAfter a hefty amount of athletic tape was applied to Finau\u2019s ankle, he went to Augusta National and headed to the practice range early.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d have to compensate for the injury and couldn\u2019t put all my weight on the left foot in my swing,\u201d Finau said. \u201cWith my caddie, we came up with a plan that let me swing without making it worse \u2014 because I want to play four rounds here.\u201d\n\nFinau bogeyed the first hole on Thursday \u2014 a typical occurrence for Masters rookies, even those with two healthy ankles. And then he settled down.\n\n\u201cI think my injury masked a little of the pressure,\u201d Finau said later, \u201cbecause I had to worry about my foot.

When he birdied the par-5 14th hole, he was in the lead at four under. He wobbled \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 on the final holes but finished with an impressive up-and-down par on the 18th hole after he sprayed his approach shot into the crowd adjacent to the green.\n\nA few minutes later, Kelepi Finau, who came to the United States in the mid-1960s from the island of Tonga, was in tears trying to summarize the turn of events. He talked about how his son, who was born and raised in Utah, had been inspired to give up football and basketball to concentrate on golf when he watched Woods\u2019s inaugural Masters victory in 1997.\n\n\u201cTiger made golf look cool,\u201d Kelepi Finau said. \u201cAnd to think Tony\u2019s now been given this opportunity to play here is just wonderful.\u201d\n\nKelepi Finau wiped his eyes.\n\n\u201cThis is a holy place in the game of golf,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have faith and feel the spirit of the grounds.

Not all of those recent expulsions have come during Mr. Macron\u2019s time in office, yet his government seems determined to make clear that France now has a far lower tolerance for radical preaching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the terrorist organizations, the armies of Daesh, the imams of hate and death that we are fighting,\u201d Mr. Macron said, referring to the Islamic State, in a speech last week honoring Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, a police officer who died in terrorist attack at a supermarket in southern France after swapping himself with a hostage.\n\n\u201cWhat we are fighting is also is this subterranean Islamism, which advances through social networks, which accomplishes its task invisibly, which works silently on the weak and the unstable, betraying even those it claims to represent, who, on our very soil, indoctrinate through proximity and daily corrupt,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\nThe expulsion of Imam Doudi was recommended by the Marseille authorities under a French law regarding \u201cdeliberate acts tending to provoke discrimination, hatred and violence toward an individual or a group.\u201d\n\nIn a confidential investigative report seen by The New York Times, the authorities blamed Imam Doudi\u2019s \u201cpatient and insistent proselytizing\u201d for helping to turn a quarter of Marseille\u2019s practicing Muslims \u2014 the largest concentration in France \u2014 into practitioners of Salafism, an ultraconservative movement within Sunni Islam. For the country as a whole, the proportion of Muslims who are Salafists is much lower, about 5.5 percent.\n\nImam Doudi\u2019s influence, the report noted, extends all over France and even \u201cgoes well beyond the country\u2019s frontiers\u201d and throughout Europe, as other countries, in particular Germany, have had their own troubles with Salafist preachers and monitor them carefully.\n\nYet few seem as bewildered that the government would turn on the preacher now than Imam Doudi himself, a slight, worried-looking man who pulled at his straggly beard occasionally in an interview at a pastry shop.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was greeted without special ceremony as he strolled through his low-rise immigrant neighborhood north of the old port of Marseille, though everyone seemed to know him.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOf course I know they were listening,\u201d Imam Doudi said, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe relationship that I\u2019ve had with the population and the authorities has always been clear and correct,\u201d he insisted.\n\n\u201cAnd suddenly they are saying that Salafism is a danger for France,\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cObviously, I challenge that idea.\u201d\n\nMarseille \u2014 France\u2019s second-largest city, one-fifth Muslim \u2014 is not especially radicalized. Other cities in the south of France, like Nice, have had higher numbers of young people leave to fight in Syria, and greater proportion of Muslim residents on the government\u2019s terrorism watchlist.\n\nBut virtually all of the fines in Marseille for wearing a face-covering, head-to-toe veil \u2014 which is illegal in France \u2014 have been imposed in the vicinity of Imam Doudi\u2019s mosque, the police say. The authorities are growing increasingly concerned about the potential for radicalization \u2014 especially since two young women were killed in a knife attack at the city\u2019s main train station in October.\n\nThe Sounna mosque where Imam Doudi preached, on the Boulevard National in the Third Arrondissement of Marseille, was closed by officials in December. They cited Imam Doudi\u2019s sermons, saying they could \u201cprovoke acts of terrorism.\u201d\n\nHere and elsewhere in France, Salafism is increasingly seen as the enemy, a menacing way-station to terrorism.

There are sects that pretend to be Salafist \u2014 Al Qaeda, Daesh \u2014 but are not,\u201d Imam Doudi said. \u201cThese are extremists, and in our preaching we are opposed to them.\u201d\n\nImam Doudi and his lawyer insist that many of his preachings are merely stock phrases taken directly from Islam\u2019s sacred texts and are not meant to be taken literally.\n\n\u201cIn the Quran, you\u2019ll find verses justifying lapidation\u201d \u2014 death by stoning \u2014 \u201cand jihad,\u201d Imam Doudi said. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll read them.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Nabil Boudi, supported the assertion. \u201cIt\u2019s a formula you\u2019ll hear in every sermon,\u201d Mr. Boudi said. None of the phrases cited by the government explicitly justify terrorist attacks.

One woman was thrown several feet into the air. A man was hit midsection before falling. Another was smashed in the head.

One has even placed a small bet on nuclear fusion.\n\nWorried that pressures to mitigate climate change could eventually curb demand for their fossil fuel products, oil and gas firms are making major investments in an increasingly diverse array of businesses. On Wednesday, the French energy giant Total made the latest such deal, agreeing to buy a small electricity utility that would give it a foothold in the delivery of clean energy to customers.\n\nThe deal, worth 1.4 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, for Direct Energie, which has 2.6 million customers in Belgium and France, appears to stand in stark contrast to Total\u2019s traditional business. Total makes healthy profits producing oil and natural gas through enormous projects in complex and often-dangerous places, including in countries like Qatar and Angola.\n\nBut the deal fits what appears to be an accelerating trend \u2014 at least in Europe. Lacking a clear way to see how the energy industry will evolve over the coming decades, major oil companies have been investing in a wide range of activities, in the hopes of finding winners or, at worst, learning from the experience. In particular, they are making deals in cleaner energy technologies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the end of last year, for instance, the British energy company BP announced a $200 million deal with Lightsource, a solar power developer.

Court filings say that money flowed into them from one person and then out to another in a manner suggesting a Ponzi scheme. The filings also said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been transferred in recent years to two convicted drug dealers. The records further indicated that Mr. Peralta owed large sums to the state tax authority and was substantially in debt to a capo in the Genovese crime family.\n\nBut what pushed the case forward \u2014 and finally undid Mr. Peralta \u2014 was a series of seemingly innocuous transactions. In his accounts, court papers said, the authorities found numerous deposits from a company called JSR Capital \u2014 among them, a $250,000 check with \u201cliquor loan\u201d written on its memo line.\n\nFollowing the money, investigators learned that JSR was a real-estate firm with offices on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks south of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.

He had arrived in New York in his late teens from Los Angeles, where he grew up as the scion of a wealthy family that was staunchly pro-Israel and active in Republican Party politics. His father, Robert Rechnitz, a successful real-estate developer, had served as a finance chairman on Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and was a prominent donor to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. But the family\u2019s real money belonged to Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s cousin who owned a chain of California nursing homes that ultimately fell afoul of state and federal regulators.\n\nAfter attending Yeshiva University in Upper Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and tried to make a go of it in New York City real estate. For his first few years, those who knew him said, he worked in minor jobs at middling firms like Marcus & Millichap. But in 2007, he edged closer to success, taking a post at Africa Israel USA, the American subsidiary of the international development firm Africa Israel, which was owned by the billionaire diamond dealer Lev Leviev.\n\nBy his own account, Mr. Rechnitz started slowly at Africa Israel, fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning for its New York chief executive. But as he later testified, he enjoyed the company\u2019s ambience of \u201ctrophy properties\u201d and \u201cluxury developers.\u201d Within a few years, as he progressed at the firm and eventually became its director of acquisitions, Mr. Rechnitz began to make connections to the machers and scoundrels who populated the world of New York real estate \u2014 something else he seemed to enjoy.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a young man so schooled in networking,\u201d said someone who had dealings with him at the time and requested anonymity to avoid the investigation. \u201cHe made his life all about connective tissues.

Some were born with differences of sex development (intersex conditions) that mean their bodies have a blend of male-typical and female-typical traits.\n\nA 2014 study by I.A.A.F.-affiliated scientists estimates that 7 in 1,000 elite women athletes have a Y chromosome with hyperandrogenism, a rate \u201c140 times higher than expected in the general population.\u201d And that 7 in 1,000 figure would be even higher if it counted all the differences of sex development that can cause hyperandrogenism.\n\nBut the truth is that no elite athlete\u2019s body can be called fully \u201ctypical\u201d in a statistical sense, and every other type of inborn advantage is allowed in sports. You can be born with natural advantages in terms of muscle development, oxygen processing, vision \u2014 all of those are allowed, without question. We\u2019d never entertain the idea that Michael Phelps should be barred from swimming competitions because his extraordinary \u201cwingspan\u201d gives him an advantage.\n\nAs Chand put it in her court testimony: \u201cI am unable to understand why I am asked to fix my body in a certain way simply for participation as a woman. I was born a woman, reared up as a woman, I identify as a woman and I believe I should be allowed to compete with other women, many of whom are either taller than me or come from more privileged backgrounds, things that most certainly give them an edge over me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that men who naturally make extraordinarily high levels of testosterone are allowed to play without question. Additionally, the World Anti-Doping Agency, which regulates doping in sports, allows men who can prove they have naturally low levels of testosterone to take testosterone supplementation without considering it doping. So how is this just about natural hormone levels and fairness \u2014 and not actually about cultural norms of sex and gender?\n\nElite sports agencies also allow non-intersex women to manipulate their hormones, through birth control pills, to ensure that they are at the most advantageous part of the menstrual cycle when they compete. That\u2019s considered fair. In fact, I learned about this from a world-class marathoner who admitted, at an I.O.C. meeting in 2013 where she and I were consulting on sex-testing, that she does this herself.\n\nBut women born with differences of sex development are subject to a whole different set of principles. For them, natural advantage is considered unfair, and unlimited testosterone is understood to be something men get to enjoy, even though all women also make it naturally.", "title": "Opinion | Track\u2019s Absurd New Rules for Women", "authors": []}

According to the I.A.A.F., most women, including elite female athletes, have testosterone levels from 0.12 to 1.79 nanomoles per liter, while the normal male range is 7.7 to 29.4 nanomoles per liter.\n\nWith testosterone levels between five and 10 nanomoles per liter, the I.A.A.F. said, women gain a clear performance advantage derived from a 4.4 percent increase in muscle mass, a 12 percent to 26 percent increase in muscle strength and a 7.8 percent increase in hemoglobin, which transports oxygen in red blood cells.\n\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage,\u201d the I.A.A.F. said in the regulations and supporting documents obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe regulations follow a 2017 study, commissioned by the I.A.A.F. and published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, which showed that women with elevated testosterone levels gained a competitive advantage from 1.78 percent to 4.53 percent in events such as the 400 meters, the 400-meter hurdles, the 800 meters, the hammer throw and the pole vault.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven a small edge can mean the difference between a gold, silver or bronze medal, or finishing off the podium entirely, in events decided by tenths or hundredths of a second, the I.A.A.F. said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That case involved an Indian sprinter named Dutee Chand. The new regulations would not affect her events, the 100 and 200 meters.\n\nMany factors affect performance, and the I.A.A.F. has struggled to show conclusively that elevated testosterone provided women with more of a significant competitive edge than factors like nutrition, age, height, weight, access to coaching and training facilities, and other genetic and biological variations like oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\nEven before being officially published, the new I.A.A.F. regulations have come under criticism.\n\nBecause the hammer throw and the pole vault, which showed the highest performance advantage for women with elevated testosterone in the 2017 I.A.A.F. study, are not included in the new rules, the regulations appear to be arbitrary and political and not based on solid science, said Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist and visiting senior fellow at the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale, who has written extensively on hyperandrogenism and athletic performance.\n\n\u201cJust when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, it has,\u201d she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\n\nShe and others have argued that the I.A.A.F.\u2019s rules will force some women to undergo hormone therapy that could adversely affect their health; will be humiliating; will disproportionately affect women from developing nations who do not conform to Western standards of femininity; and will ultimately lead to some elite women quitting the sport.\n\nFemale athletes with elevated testosterone levels will essentially face a \u201cchoice of no choice,\u201d Ms. Karkazis said.\n\nMuch of the debate about female athletes and hyperandrogenism has focused on Semenya, winner of the 800 meters at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the recent Commonwealth Games, held in Australia, where Semenya won the 800 and 1,500 meters, an Australian runner named Brittany McGowan expressed her frustration about competing against athletes with elevated testosterone, telling reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s tough for a lot of women in the 800 meters, 400 meters and 1,500 meters at the moment to compare ourselves and be judged by our governing bodies on those times.\u201d\n\nBut a study published in April in the Journal of Sports Sciences noted that Semenya\u2019s average faster speed of 1.49 percent in the 800 fell far short of the 10 percent performance advantage that men generally have over women.\n\nPaul Melia, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, said in an interview from Ottawa on Wednesday that because athletes with hyperandrogenism identify and live as females, and present physically as females, \u201cthey have a human right to participate in sport in the gender they identify with.\u201d\n\nMr. Melia continued: \u201cIf the I.A.A.F. applies that policy and a woman whose naturally occurring testosterone falls outside that range, they\u2019re going to say to her: \u2018We\u2019re not preventing you from competing.

I think the way poems are taught to high school students is completely counterintuitive; it sets up this sense of being the poem\u2019s adversary. The poem is sort of sneakily trying to outsmart you. Whereas children live in this sense of perpetual metaphor. We even use song and verse to teach kids. And then there comes a time when we somehow estrange them from that, without wanting to, perhaps.\n\nWOODSON I completely agree. I mean it\u2019s our first language \u2014 we put words together with all this white space and it gets figured out. And then that gets forgotten. I remember by fifth grade I was terrified of poetry. It was consumed not for joy, but to be tested on. But I don\u2019t understand why readers aren\u2019t buying poetry. They must still have that fear in them.

Your books tell these beautiful stories of survival and triumph.\n\nWOODSON Growing up I felt so ashamed and guilty, but no one was talking about it as triumph, right?

I was like, oh no, here we go. Harriet Tubman, Phillis Wheatley, the poet who learned to write from her nice white master. Nat Turner of course, because he died. Those were the biographies we got.\n\nMy daughter had an assignment where everyone in the class had to write a journal of someone from the 18th century. Her school has lots of kids of color, but everyone wanted to write from the white point of view. So I came in and said, I\u2019ll write that! I wrote a journal of an enslaved girl. There was joy, there was playing, there was hard work, and there was resentment that she had to be enslaved to a white girl her same age. I wrote four journals that they still use. In my final one the girl finds out that the master\u2019s daughter who she\u2019s been enslaved to is her half sister. And then I was like, O.K. teachers, you can take it from there.

{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "To Smith, poetry is a shortcut to honest conversation, a way of getting past small talk to probe the spots where our culture is most sore. \u201cLiterature allows us to be open, to listen and to be curious,\u201d she told me over lunch in Princeton, N.J., where she\u2019s the director of Princeton University\u2019s creative-writing program, not long before her trip. When she reads poetry, her voice is deep and clear, but in conversation she speaks so softly that I sometimes had trouble understanding her. \u201cI want to just go to places where writers don\u2019t usually go, where people like me don\u2019t usually show up, and say: \u2018Here are some poems. Do they speak to you? What do you hear in them?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe answers might be painful. Smith\u2019s poetry \u2014 written in everyday language, without neologisms or convoluted syntax \u2014 is easy to take in, but it can be difficult to process. Much of her latest book is devoted to examining the history and legacy of slavery. The long poem \u201cI Will Tell You the Truth About This, I Will Tell You All About It,\u201d which elicited murmurs from the audience each of the three times I heard Smith read it, collages snippets of letters and depositions from African-Americans enlisted in the Civil War and their families. The language of the documents can be stilted, even bureaucratic. \u201cI am the only living child of Dennis Campbell \u2014 /My father was George Jourdan and my mother was Millie Jourdan \u2014 /My mother told me that John Barnett was my father.\u201d But the cumulative effect of these unadorned statements is unexpectedly powerful, a litany of wrongs crying in the plainest terms for redress.\n\nAudio recorded by Tracy K. Smith. Tracy K. Smith reads an excerpt from her poem \u201cI Will Tell You the Truth About This, I Will Tell You All About It.\u201d Audio\n\n\u201cYou want a poem to unsettle something,\u201d Smith told me. She lowered her voice almost to a whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep and interesting kind of troubling that poems do, which is to say: \u2018This is what you think you\u2019re certain of, and I\u2019m going to show you how that\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s something more that might be even more rewarding if you\u2019re willing to let go of what you already know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLake city sits along Route 52 in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, nearly 90 miles northeast of Charleston, past Goose Creek and Moncks Corner, past Lake Moultrie and the Black River Swamp, past strip malls and a Santee Cooper power plant and auto-parts stores and Domino\u2019s pizza joints. It was an unseasonably hot day in late February, and the white blossoms on the Bradford pear trees lining the straight, flat highway barely fluttered. As we turned onto Lake City\u2019s main drag, a trio of teenagers slouched through the parking lot of a strip mall. Our destination, an unassuming brick Methodist church, was down the road from a nail salon and the El San Jose Mexican restaurant.\n\nEvery seat in the church\u2019s modest sanctuary was filled when Smith took the lectern for the first of three readings in 24 hours. Her tour was planned by the local congressman, Representative James E. Clyburn, currently the third-ranking House Democrat, who accompanied Smith at each stop. Born in nearby Sumter and first elected to serve this district while Smith was still in college, Clyburn, who is African-American, greeted many in the predominantly black crowd by name. \u201cWe tend to feel that in order to be anybody, you got to hail from the big city,\u201d Clyburn joked, introducing Smith as an \u201cAir Force brat.\u201d Born in Massachusetts, she grew up in Fairfield, Calif., midway between San Francisco and Sacramento. The town is home to Travis Air Force Base, where her father worked for much of her childhood; later he was an engineer on the Hubble Space Telescope. Parts of \u201cLife on Mars,\u201d Smith\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning third book, are inspired by his work.\n\nThe youngest by far of five siblings, Smith grew up under the close supervision of her mother, a former schoolteacher and religious Christian. Tracked into gifted programs early on, she was the kind of girl who asked other children if they had ever invited Jesus into their heart, but she also enjoyed watching sitcoms and listening to the Mary Jane Girls. Friends described her family as \u201cjust like the Huxtables,\u201d she writes in her 2015 memoir, \u201cOrdinary Light,\u201d evidence that \u201cthere was such a thing as a happy black family.\u201d\n\nThis seemingly idyllic childhood was punctuated by racism \u2014 both implicit and outright. Smith\u2019s parents came from the South, and she writes that she grew up with the knowledge that \u201cpain was part of my birthright. ... The very particular pain that was tied up in blood, in race, in laws and war.\u201d Like many children who feel the burden of an older generation\u2019s history, she feared the reckoning it would require. Though she knew the aggression she experienced to be \u201ca mild, diluted version of what roamed about more brazenly in generations past,\u201d she soon had her own stories to tell. \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you were white?\u201d a white girl asked. A white boy on the school bus ripped off her necklace, saying, \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d When a white classmate in her Christian youth group insisted on addressing her only as \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d Smith offered little challenge. \u201cI fed my own voice to the familiar silence that came around whenever it smelled pain,\u201d she writes in \u201cOrdinary Light.\u201d \u201cI fed the silence every time this strange tall girl called me out of my name, just as I fed the silence every time I failed to ask my mother and father what names Jim Crow had tossed their way when they were my age.\u201d\n\nThe real story of the book is the gradual dawning of difference and what it meant \u2014 to the outside world and to her. \u201cAt such a young age, you begin to understand that there are these different ways you belong,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cAnd there is this constant awareness of figuring out: \u2018How do I belong? To what extent don\u2019t I belong?\u2019 It\u2019s almost like an involuntary math that you\u2019re doing from moment to moment in your life, based on where you are and who you\u2019re with, that most \u2014 well, that white people don\u2019t do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory is a heavy thing everywhere,\u201d Smith said at the lectern in Lake City, taking a sip of water from a large crystal glass. She was wearing a bright red blouse with a beige scarf and long, straight silver earrings. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. \u201cWade in the Water,\u201d the poem she opened with, was inspired by a performance she attended last year by the Geechee Gullah Ring Shouters, a group dedicated to preserving the traditional African-American culture of the Lowcountry. As Smith and other members of the audience entered the room, one performer greeted them by saying, \u201cI love you.\u201d The words continued to reverberate in Smith\u2019s mind as she watched the performance.

The three rules you need to bear in mind when discussing the stock market are (1) the stock market is not the economy (2) the stock market is not the economy (3) the stock market is not the economy. And stocks move for all sorts of reasons, or no visible reason at all.

The two came close to war in 1974, when Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied its north in response to a coup by Greek Cypriots who wanted to unite the island republic with Greece. In 1987 and 1996, disputes over sea and territorial rights in the Aegean again nearly led to war. Turkish warplanes continually fly into the 10-mile airspace around islands declared by Athens and over islets whose sovereignty Turkey questions. Ankara\u2019s declaration that the two uninhabited Imia islets are Turkish has raised the stakes: urgent mediation by the United States in 1996 prevented conflict over the islets, resulting in an agreement that neither side would dispatch ships there or raise flags on them.\n\nToday such mediation is less likely. Having grown accustomed to expressing outspoken criticism of the United States because of Washington\u2019s objections to Turkey\u2019s invasion of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in Syria, Mr. Erdogan is not likely to back down in any confrontation with Greece. President Trump\u2019s recent statement that United States troops would leave Syria \u201cvery soon\u201d \u2014 whenever that may be \u2014 must have boosted Turkey\u2019s self-confidence.\n\nEuropean mediation could be even less effective.

The Turkish minister of European Union affairs, Omer Celik, tweeted, \u201cSolidarity is meaningful only when it is legitimate.\u201d\n\nAnkara clearly does not feel threatened by criticism that could weaken ties with the European Union. It is also keen to point out that it can control the flow of refugees and migrants, whose mass influx in 2015 shook politics in many European countries, suggesting that they may need Ankara\u2019s good will more than it needs theirs.\n\nMr. Erdogan may have wanted to stir passions with a dynamic foreign policy as he marshals support for presidential elections that may be held any time before late 2019. Even as he undermines Ataturk\u2019s legacy in order to change Turkey, he has co-opted the message of secular nationalist parties with his tough talk against Greece.", "title": "Opinion | Trash-Talking Toward Conflict?", "authors": []}

Roosevelt\u2019s order applied to people living in the United States, many of them citizens, while Mr. Trump\u2019s order concerned nationals of other countries living abroad.

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Those abilities will be crucial as deputy secretary, as Mr. Muzinich will have a much wider mandate. While the tax law has been passed, the carrying out of such a major piece of legislation will be a consuming task for an understaffed Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the Treasury Department. The department is also responsible for developing and executing economic sanctions on terrorist groups and on countries such as North Korea and Russia. And the department is at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to prevent China from capturing intellectual property through corporate mergers and acquisitions.\n\nMr. Muzinich\u2019s portfolio will also include the department\u2019s debt management, a critical role given the government\u2019s increasing borrowing needs stemming from the new tax law.\n\n\u201cIt has been mystifying to me that they could go so long without a deputy at Treasury,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as Treasury\u2019s deputy secretary during the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy role to keep vacant. It seems to have taken Treasury off the field in several major policy battles.\u201d\n\nMr. Muzinich\u2019s nomination will require Senate confirmation. Given his role in the tax law, Democrats are likely to grill him on the merits of deep tax cuts for the rich and for corporations. He will also have to publicly defend the Treasury Department\u2019s position that the tax cuts will be self-financing despite many mainstream analyses that project they will add heavily to the deficit.\n\nJosh Bolten, a former chief of staff for President George W. Bush who got to know Mr. Muzinich during Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, said that Mr. Muzinich\u2019s range of experiences would serve him well in a position that will require him to frequently speak on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a high-quality person who, I think, will in the most civil of ways always speak up when he thinks something is wrong and will always, again in a very civil way, give a good, reasoned judgment,\u201d Mr. Bolten said.", "title": "Treasury\u2019s Tax Law Architect, Justin Muzinich, Is Tapped as Deputy Secretary", "authors": []}
