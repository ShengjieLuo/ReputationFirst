The team needed help, having just endured a third consecutive season with at least 90 losses, and Anthopoulos had a knack for high-impact trades.\n\nBut there were no deals for stars like Josh Donaldson, David Price or Troy Tulowitzki, who carried Toronto to a deep playoff run in 2015 after Anthopoulos acquired them as the Blue Jays\u2019 general manager. In Atlanta, essentially, Anthopoulos simply waited for the season to start. He moved around some contracts in a deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he had worked as an assistant the last two seasons, but that was about it.\n\n\u201cI talked to some people that had gone through the same thing and they all, to a man, said, \u2018In hindsight, I should have waited and given it a little bit of time,\u2019\u201d Anthopoulos said. \u201cSo the big thing was we weren\u2019t going to trade any prospects at all, unless it was just an absolute no-brainer. And the challenging part about it was we may miss a window to sell high on a player. But the flip side was that there may be a player that wasn\u2019t highly regarded that we may have traded who would have come back to bite us. So I do think it\u2019ll balance out.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Anthopoulos cited outfielder Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., who soared to the No. 1 overall spot in this year\u2019s Baseball America prospect rankings, from 67th the year before.

The reversal puzzled her, she said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI was quite surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I started doing this research, I couldn\u2019t find anything negative on his writing. People on the left and the right were celebrating his writing. And then people started sending me headlines saying Gorsuch is a terrible writer.\u201d\n\nMs. Varsava did not analyze Justice Gorsuch\u2019s writing on the Supreme Court. But she has read his opinions, and she had some tentative explanations for the recent critiques.\n\n\u201cHis Supreme Court opinions feel a bit more heavy-handed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a little contrived, a little too much.\u201d\n\nShe gave an example, citing the opening line from Justice Gorsuch\u2019s first majority opinion: \u201cDisruptive dinnertime calls, downright deceit and more besides drew Congress\u2019s eye to the debt collection industry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Varsava said the alliteration was showy and jarring. \u201cIt just seemed like not something a justice should be spending so much time on,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though alliteration is pleasing, it should be a bit more subtle than that.\u201d\n\nMore recently, she said, Justice Gorsuch seemed to hit his stride in a majority opinion in a water dispute that started with this observation: \u201cWill Rogers reportedly called the Rio Grande \u2018the only river I ever saw that needed irrigation.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Justice Gorsuch has real gifts as a writer, he said, and assessments of his writing have had a partisan tinge.\n\n\u201cWhy is Gorsuch so divisive even when it comes to something as nerdy as writing style?\u201d Mr. Guberman asked. \u201cOne explanation could be that his writing seems highly personal \u2014 not personal in the sense of conversational but personal in the sense that he\u2019s trying to call attention to himself.\u201d\n\nIt is true that most Supreme Court opinions are impersonal, but that is because they are generally written in a colorless bureaucratic style.\n\nJustice Gorsuch\u2019s writing, by contrast, is informal, full of lively idioms and nicely paced. He uses contractions, short sentences, a varied vocabulary, the active voice and the second person. He has a talent for narrative storytelling, sometimes presenting the factual background of a case as an engaging yarn.\n\nMs. Varsava\u2019s study looked at Justice Gorsuch\u2019s roughly 175 published majority opinions when he sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. She compared them to the majority opinions of his colleagues on the appeals court in some 3,000 opinions.\n\nJustice Gorsuch used 3.9 contractions per 1,000 words, while other judges averaged 0.8. He started sentences with short conjunctions like \u201cand,\u201d \u201cbut\u201d and \u201cso\u201d 4.9 times out of every 1,000 words, compared to an average of 1.5. He used foreign words, including legal Latin, about half as often as his colleagues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn all, Ms. Varsava found, \u201cGorsuch\u2019s style is considerably less formal and conventional than average, which likely makes his opinions seem more down-to-earth and less legalistic than other opinions \u2014 qualities that might increase his appeal and enable him to reach a wider audience.\u201d\n\nMs. Varsava also tested the swagger of Justice Gorsuch\u2019s appeals court opinions in light of what she called \u201chis reputation for self-assuredness and overconfidence\u201d by counting \u201cterms of certainty\u201d like \u201cclearly,\u201d \u201csurely\u201d and \u201cdecidedly.\u201d It turned out that he did use those kinds of terms more than twice as often as the average judge.\n\nBut Justice Gorsuch was also about twice as likely to use \u201cterms of hesitancy\u201d like \u201cpossibly\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d Ms. Varsava concluded, with a bit of hesitancy of her own, that \u201che might have a proclivity for qualifiers in general.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch is 50, and he just celebrated his first anniversary on the Supreme Court. He will most likely have decades to hone his style.\n\nMr. Guberman said the shortcomings in Justice Gorsuch\u2019s writing could settle into something more satisfying over time.\n\n\u201cDespite all his talents and brilliance,\u201d Mr. Guberman said, \u201che makes writing look hard, not easy, as if he\u2019s fiddling with a sentence and then looking up to see if anyone is applauding the latest line.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "Most jurisdictions abolished these formal rules in the 1970s. Even so, skepticism of the accuser remains an informal barrier to justice today. Victims of sexual assault \u2014 a population overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, comprising women \u2014 confront a system that is generally unresponsive to their claims. The sexual assault enforcement gap is particularly wide in cases involving women of color, immigrants, L.G.B.T. individuals, women in poverty and sex workers. Across the board, sexual assault allegations generally are treated with incredulity at every stage of the criminal process, resulting in an extraordinary rate of case attrition. Most accusations are dropped well before ever reaching a jury.\n\nMany survivors forgo the criminal justice system altogether for fear of how their cases might be mistreated. Apart from the personal and professional risks involved in reporting an assault, would-be accusers rightly fear that their allegations will be met with unwarranted skepticism \u2014 a pervasive problem I call \u201ccredibility discounting.\u201d\n\nNot every sexual assault allegation is true, of course. But what is troubling is the large gap between commonplace perceptions of falsity and actual falsity. This is a particular worry in the criminal justice setting, where law enforcement officers often disregard reports of sexual violence before they are fully investigated, having assumed at the outset that the complainant is probably lying. In one 2008 study, more than half of the police detectives interviewed said they believed that 40 percent to 80 percent of sexual assault complaints are false.\n\nThis default to doubt the accuser is unjustifiable. The quality of research on false rape allegations varies widely, but studies that have independently evaluated whether an allegation was false found false report rates ranging from 2 percent to 8 percent. Among them, a study on policing and prosecuting sexual assault in Los Angeles concluded that 4.5 percent of all sexual assaults made to the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 were false. Another study that analyzed sexual assault allegations reported to one university in the Northeast over 10 years found that 5.9 percent were false. Moreover, research suggests that the types of reports most likely to be considered false \u2014 namely, those involving people who know each other or were intoxicated \u2014 are the least likely to be false.\n\nOf late, to overcome this discounting, sexual assault survivors have joined forces, telling their stories in numbers that greatly enhance the likelihood they will be believed in the court of public opinion. Outside of the courtroom, Bill Cosby, whose retrial began last Monday in suburban Philadelphia, has about 60 accusers. Harvey Weinstein, who has not yet been charged with a crime, has over 80. Larry Nassar, the doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics who pleaded guilty before trial, has twice that number of accusers.\n\nTo be sure, numbers like those don\u2019t necessarily translate into success in the courtroom. But we may be on the cusp of a cultural shift in our orientation to sexual assault and its survivors.", "title": "Opinion | #MeToo Comes to the Cosby Courtroom", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "Needless to say, it also relieves the pressure on partners to meet annual billing targets.\n\nMs. Saeed conceded that the lockstep-compensation system removes a powerful lever of management control. It puts a high premium on partner selection and development, and requires attention to ensure that partners uphold all aspects of the social compact, not just in terms of their contribution but also in how they reflect the values of the partnership. A desire to change the Cravath system and the resulting internal friction was a factor in some of the recent departures.\n\n\u201cKirkland is the antithesis of Cravath when it comes to compensation,\u201d said Bruce MacEwen, president of Adam Smith, Esq., a consultant to law firms, who writes widely about their economics. \u201cIt\u2019s very individualistic and competitive, with a very big spread between the highest- and lowest-paid partners. But Kirkland has a reputation for excellence that rivals Cravath\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that Kirkland, which has expanded rapidly from its Chicago headquarters, has been on a roll. The American Lawyer\u2019s annual survey of the largest law firms measured by revenue shows that it took in $3.165 billion last year, displacing Latham & Watkins from the top spot \u2014 an achievement Kirkland partners will celebrate next week at their annual retreat in Southern California\n\nKirkland\u2019s 19.4 percent growth rate in revenue last year compared with the previous year was the largest of any firm on The American Lawyer\u2019s list. Although its traditional strength has been in private equity transactions \u2014 a field it dominates \u2014 it was also ranked first last year by the website Mergermarket in mergers and acquisitions, with 447 deals.\n\nCravath has never aimed to be the biggest firm, in terms of revenue or number of lawyers. But it does put a premium on profitability. This year, Kirkland edged out Cravath on that count, too, with average profits per equity partner of $4.7 million, according to The American Lawyer. (The figures don\u2019t account for Cravath\u2019s gold-plated pension plan, which is among the most generous in the profession.)\n\nKirkland has shaken up the profession and expanded its practice by poaching top partners not just from Cravath, but from other prominent, old-line firms, including Latham and Skadden Arps Meagher Slate & Flom. It has raided the venerable Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York for so many partners that one Kirkland partner, in a widely circulated email, referred to Simpson as \u201cKirkland\u2019s AAA farm club.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the lockstep system, which is still used by a dwindling number of law firms, albeit some of the most prestigious, Kirkland\u2019s approach is a star system known somewhat pejoratively as \u201ceat what you kill.\u201d", "title": "$11 Million a Year for a Law Partner?

They include laws against criminal invasion of privacy, voyeurism, impersonation or fraud, harassment and stalking.\n\nOn the federal level, courses of action include copyright infringement and computer fraud and abuse claims, according to Without My Consent, a nonprofit organization that combats online invasions of privacy and breaks down the legal remedies that are possible in all 50 states.\n\nIn the California case, Ms. Doe already held the copyright to the sexually explicit images that she had shared privately with Mr. Elam because she took them herself. But when he started to publish them without her permission, she registered her ownership, which is a prerequisite for her to seek relief under federal copyright laws, Ms. D\u2019Amico said.\n\n\u201cIn many instances it is easier for a victim of revenge porn to have photos of herself and himself removed from a website if they own a copyright registration,\u201d said Seth A. Gold, the lead lawyer on the Doe case.\n\nThe judgment included $450,000 for copyright infringement, $3 million for severe emotional distress and $3 million for other damages, including stalking and online impersonation with intent to cause harm.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt least 36 states have some laws that penalize the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images, representing a national patchwork of different standards and punishments for an activity that transcends borders.\n\n\u201cFrom a victim perspective, it can be exceedingly difficult to figure out,\u201d Christine M. Gagnier, a lawyer and board member of Without My Consent, said. \u201cThe photograph is on the internet, so the harm is happening in a variety of places.\u201d\n\nCalifornia, for example, has a nonconsensual pornography law with misdemeanor penalties, she said. The law was used in a case in which a former Playboy model was sentenced to community service in 2017 for secretly photographing a naked older woman in a Los Angeles gym and then posting the picture online.\n\nLegislators have tried to fill the gaps in federal law. In 2016, Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, introduced the Intimate Privacy Protection Act. A bipartisan second version, called the Enough Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate last November.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to gain support and are talking with the relevant committees about next steps,\u201d said Josh Connolly, Ms. Speier\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cWe treat this as a privacy violation, which we think it is. That is the heart of the violation, rather than what the intent is of the individual.\u201d\n\nThe K&L initiative has counseled thousands of victims of sexual cyber harassment since it started, Ms. D\u2019Amico said. In 2017, a couple in the Seattle area was awarded $8.9 million in a judgment against an Arizona man who posted sexual images they had shared with him online, and sent them to people they knew, court documents said.\n\n\u201cA lot of times individuals will engage in victim blaming,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Amico said. \u201cBut when images are shared within the confines of a private relationship, it is recognized that there is a right to privacy there.\u201d", "title": "$6.4 Million Judgment in Revenge Porn Case Is Among Largest Ever", "authors": ["Christine Hauser"]}

Another SoHo holdout, this gallery arrived on Mercer Street in 1982; it often mounts shows of politically engaged work, and takes a particular interest in Jewish and Israeli artists. The group exhibition \u201cViolated! Women in Holocaust and Genocide\u201d features 30 artists whose art portrays the legacy of the Shoah for Jewish women, as well as female suffering in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur. If much of the art here has greater moral clarity than aesthetic ambition, one searing work on paper makes the show worth a visit on its own: a vision of Auschwitz, picturing emaciated female prisoners and sadistic female kapos, drawn by the survivor Ella Liebermann-Shiber one month after the liberation.\n\nBORTOLAMI through May 5; 39 Walker Street, bortolamigallery.com. When the shrewd Italian gallerist Stefania Bortolami relocated from Chelsea to Walker Street last spring, she ratified the emergence of this dowdy north TriBeCa street as an art world thoroughfare. Nicol\u00e1s Guagnini, an artist on her roster, has curated a cerebral group show, \u201cHuman Applause,\u201d whose artists imbue repeated forms with humanistic qualities. Sitting on a gridded bench by Superstudio, the radical Italian architecture firm, is an iPad looping a video by the Venezuelan painter Eugenio Espinosa, performing with a gridded fabric; a painting of repeated amoeboid forms by Claude Viallat, the grand man of the French movement Supports/Surfaces, continues the play between repetition and creation.

It hasn\u2019t yet moved into its new permanent home on White Street, but this enduring nonprofit, led now by Jay Sanders, the Whitney\u2019s performance alumnus, is doing what it does best from its Walker Street rental: essential shows by emerging artists and by historical figures too little celebrated. The Chicago painter Miyoko Ito (1918-1983), who was born in Berkeley and interned during World War II, is one of the latter: her strange abstract paintings, informed as much by Giorgio Morandi\u2019s sallow still lifes as by the legacy of Surrealism, come as a revelation. In a palette of chartreuse, ocher, cinnamon and gamboge, Ito overlaid uncommon shapes, such as a rectangle rounded and pinched at the top like a loaf of Wonder Bread, into compositions of preternatural calm.", "title": "10 Galleries to Visit Now Around SoHo and TriBeCa", "authors": []}

Plus, a sizable portion of the art audience has taken to doing its looking online, raising the question: Why have physical galleries at all?\n\nBecause they\u2019re the only places where you truly see new work, experience it. Scale, texture, light, air, mood; all that changes when you\u2019re physically present, shifting positions, moving in close, backing away, hearing noise from the street. Most of the galleries on the Lower East Side are still storefront-size, scaled for shopping, and open on Sundays. They put you in intimate contact with objects, sensations and ideas so you can examine them, stay with them, make them your own.\n\n17ESSEX through May 26; 17 Essex Street, 17essex.info. This is one of the neighborhood\u2019s smaller spaces, but it holds a big conceptual world in a project by Ala Younis. Born in Kuwait, she contributed an outstanding installation to the Guggenheim\u2019s 2016 show of new art from the Middle East, a piece called \u201cPlan for Greater Baghdad,\u201d which featured the contributions of Western starchitects \u2014 Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright \u2014 to the creation of the city. In an update at 17Essex, Ms. Younis focuses on the work of women in the realization of that plan. The cast of players is formidable, from major architects like Ellen Jawdat, Wijdan Maher and Zaha Hadid to Balkis Shararah, who smuggled research material into Abu Ghraib prison when her architect-husband, Rifat Chadirji, who rebuilt Baghdad after Iraq\u2019s 1958 revolution, was jailed there, to help him complete a book. Ms. Younis\u2019s show is formally spare and compressed. The story it tells is huge.\n\nLMAK GALLERY through April 29; 298 Grand Street, LMAKgallery.com. While Ms. Younis charts the hidden history of a city, Nayda Collazo-Llorens surveys a wide-open cosmos in \u201cUnmappings.\u201d Like many artists who claim dual homes, Ms. Collazo-Llorens \u2014 born in Puerto Rico, educated in the Northeast \u2014 is global-minded, viewing the world both at ground level and from above, which are the perspectives we find in a wall installation made up of more than 300 framed fragments of oceanic maps that take us from the Caribbean to the Sea of Tranquillity on the moon. The back-and-forth between the terrestrial and the celestial suggests that cultural identity is all about transition, and nomadism is universal citizenship.\n\nPhoto\n\n47 CANAL through May 27; 291 Grand Street, second floor, 47canal.us. The American artist and writer Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (1951-1982), one of the most intriguing figures of the 1970s, seems to have dropped from view for a younger generation.

Against a flickering projection of white light, Ms. Wu sets an assemblage of small objects that refer to images in the film: trains, an airplane, a mop, the silhouette of an urban skyline. \u201cMemory, time, silence, words, and whiteness\u201d were the essence of Cha\u2019s art, wrote the art historian Moira Roth, as they are of Ms. Wu\u2019s homage.", "title": "10 Galleries to Visit Now on the Lower East Side", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

If the Upper East Side is filling up with all kinds of newcomers, the German art dealer Michael Werner represents the new old guard: He opened his first gallery here in 1990. His current show, \u201cPer Kirkeby: Paintings and Bronzes From the 1980s,\u201d reflects Mr. Werner\u2019s stable of (mostly male, mostly European) artists. The dark, murky canvases and expressive abstract bronzes are drawn partly from Mr. Kirkeby\u2019s studies in the 1960s, when he traveled in Greenland and the Arctic while working on a master\u2019s degree in geology.\n\nHALF GALLERY through May 9; 43 East 78th Street, halfgallery.com.

In Ginny Casey\u2019s \u201cSkeleton Key,\u201d the murky-hued paintings are populated with curvy, vaguely surrealistic objects, like a chair with arms, a metronome the size of an armoire or a key too large for any human\u2019s door.\n\nGAGOSIAN through May 25; 976 Madison Avenue, gagosian.com. In the portfolio of galleries that make up the Gagosian empire, the bookstore might be the most fun. This is at least the case with the display of Jonas Wood\u2019s prints that is thereright now. The works spill into the book-selling space, which Mr. Wood has covered with wallpaper in a tennis-ball motif. Other prints play around with images of vases, remaking historical Greek versions or those painted by Matisse into goofy creations, like a vessel that has the words \u201cDiet 7Up\u201d on it. Sports, often ignored in \u201cfine\u201d art, is also a favored theme; Mr. Wood conjures the image of the slacker artist sitting on his couch, watching basketball, tennis or gymnastics, if he must.\n\nPhoto\n\nACQUAVELLA GALLERIES through May 25; 18 East 79th Street, acquavellagalleries.com.

Scorsese\u2019s visceral direction and propulsive pacing seduce the viewer right alongside Mr. Hill \u2014 his bravura set pieces go beyond showing off, adroitly dramatizing both the appeal of criminal and the dread of its walls closing in. Ray Liotta masterfully conveys Hill\u2019s affability and how it degenerates into sweaty desperation; Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and (especially) Joe Pesci shine in their memorable supporting roles.\n\n\u2014\n\nRay Liotta, left, and Kevin Costner in \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d Universal Pictures\n\n\u2018Field of Dreams\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nKevin Costner crafts one of his finest performances in this clever but tender drama from director Phil Alden Robinson, which was nominated for the best picture Oscar for the class of 1989. Costner plays Ray Kinsella, a child of the \u201960s who settles down on an Iowa corn farm but finds himself hearing voices and seeing visions \u2014 all of which give him the unorthodox advice of plowing under some of his corn and building a baseball diamond. What happens next is an unlikely mix of magical realism and genuine emotion, bolstered by splashes of real sports history and thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef.

William James, the team leader of a special Army unit dedicated to diffusing and disposing of on-the-ground bombs and improvised explosives in Iraq, circa 2004. It sounds like a suicide mission, and James\u2019s reckless tendencies alarm even that team. Bigelow, who for her work on this film became the first woman to win a best director Oscar, grippingly conveys James\u2019s inner turmoil using action rather than verbose monologues, and the results are terse, efficient and frequently terrifying.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger in \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d Miramax Films\n\n\u2018Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger was nominated for a best actress Oscar for her charming and uproariously funny work as the heroine of the best-seller by Helen Fielding, here adapted with style and grace by director Sharon Maguire.

Thankfully, advances in visual effects allowed the director Gary Winick to take another crack at the book in 2006, giving \u201cBabe\u201d-style voice to live-action animals (and casting such stars as Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Buscemi and John Cleese for those voices). Dakota Fanning is marvelous as Fern, the little farm girl who treats Wilbur the pig as her house pet, while the child actor Dominic Scott Kay is delightful as the voice of Wilbur. Winick\u2019s sweet and sensitive approach to material does right by White\u2019s text, at long last.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo and Patrick Swayze in \u201cTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

Patrick Swayze is utterly disarming as the den mother of the trio, whose cross-country trip to the Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant is diverted by car trouble into a back-road small town, and Wesley Snipes delivers his one-liners with screwball snap. But John Leguizamo, then a newcomer, steals the show as \u201cChi-Chi Rodriguez,\u201d the \u201cdrag princess\u201d in training. His performance is energetic, upbeat and enjoyable, and the movie offers much of the same.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cHigh School Musical.\u201d Fred Hayes/Disney\n\n\u2018High School Musical\u2019 / \u2018High School Musical 2\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: May 2\n\nIn what is presumably one more step in Disney\u2019s much-discussed exodus from Netflix to a streaming service of its own, more than two dozen Disney Channel original movies and series \u2014 including \u201cPhineas and Ferb,\u201d the \u201cCheetah Girls\u201d trilogy and the \u201cCamp Rock\u201d films \u2014 are exiting Netflix on May 2. The biggest of the bunch are the first two films in the \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d series, which made the likes of Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale into household names. They\u2019re light as a souffl\u00e9 and about as substantial, but the stars are charismatic and the dancing is dazzling (director Kenny Ortega was best known before this as the choreographer for films like \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d and \u201cOne From the Heart\u201d). And fans of the franchise don\u2019t have to be entirely heartbroken \u2014 Netflix is adding the (theatrically released) third installment on May 1.\n\n\u2014\n\nWill Ferrell in \u201cTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.\u201d Suzanne Hanover/Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: May 12\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWill Ferrell re-teamed with his \u201cAnchorman\u201d co-writer and director, Adam McKay, for this 2006 sports comedy, which features Ferrell playing another self-assured blowhard, surrounded by sycophants. This time, that character is Ricky Bobby, a Nascar superstar whose life of high speeds and lucrative endorsements comes to a crashing halt. It\u2019s as broad and silly as his and McKay\u2019s previous collaboration, but it also hints at McKay\u2019s later pivot to social commentary (he was a multiple Oscar nominee for \u201cThe Big Short\u201d). McKay sets this story in the so-called Red States, and subtly subverts both the conventional wisdom about that world and about those it sees as outsiders. To do all of that, while landing so many solid laughs, is no small accomplishment.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cThe Jungle Book.\u201d Disney\n\n\u2018The Jungle Book\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: May 30\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis 2016 family adventure from Jon Favreau uses astonishing advances in computer-generated animation to update the 1967 Disney animated classic (itself based on the stories of Rudyard Kipling).

Little Neel Sethi is both appealing and heartbreaking as young Mowgli, the \u201cman cub\u201d raised by the creatures of the jungle; Bill Murray\u2019s Baloo and Idris Elba\u2019s Shere Khan are the standouts of a stellar voice cast.\n\n\u2014", "title": "11 Great Titles Expiring From Netflix in May", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library\u2019s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city\u2019s rich photographic heritage \u2014 surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century\u2019s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers \u2014 whose new novel, \u201cThe Overstory,\u201d is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts \u2014 and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen\u2019s \u201cHigh-Risers,\u201d about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It\u2019s not a happy story, but it\u2019s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nBERENICE ABBOTT: A Life in Photography, by Julia Van Haaften. (Norton, $45.) The photographer Berenice Abbott (1898-1991) was born in Ohio and fled to Greenwich Village after dropping out after one year at Ohio State University. In 1920s Paris, she took sensitive and indelible portraits of Jean Cocteau, James Joyce and others. After returning to New York, she became a revolutionary chronicler of the modern metropolis. Julia Van Haaften, the founding curator of the New York Public Library\u2019s photography collection, has written the first full-dress biography of her. \u201cThis is a vital work of American cultural history, and it wedges in so many personalities and vistas that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes.\n\nNATURAL CAUSES: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer, by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Twelve, $27.) At 76 years old, Barbara Ehrenreich has decided that she is old enough to die, and she has sworn off annual exams, cancer screenings and other measures those with health insurance are expected to take. \u201cNatural Causes\u201d takes aim at the wellness movement as a whole, at our tendency to treat aging as an outrage or, worse, as a sin. The book is \u201cpeevish, tender and deeply, distinctively odd,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cThe pleasures of her prose are often local, in the animated language, especially where scientific descriptions are concerned. Her description of cells rushing to staunch a wound is so full of wonder and delight that it recalls Italo Calvino.\u201d\n\nFUTUREFACE: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging, by Alex Wagner. (One World, $28.) Alex Wagner was born in 1977, in Washington, D.C. The only child of a Burmese mother and a white American father, she grew up listening to histories of \u201cmigrations, escapes, settlement, assimilation.\u201d In \u201cFutureface,\u201d she embarks on a quest to find out as much as she can about both sides of her family, beyond the gauzy stories that have been handed down. The book \u201craises urgent questions having to do with history and complicity,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. \u201cWagner is determined to look at her family with the coldest eye, making excuses for no one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTHE OVERSTORY, by Richard Powers. (Norton, $27.95.) The science of botany and the art of storytelling merge to ingenious effect in Powers\u2019s magisterial new novel \u2014 a story in which people are merely the underbrush and the real protagonists are the trees that the human characters encounter. In her review, Barbara Kingsolver calls it a \u201cmonumental\u201d book, and notes that by following various characters as they interact with the forest, Powers \u201caccomplishes what few living writers from either camp, art or science, could attempt. Using the tools of story, he pulls readers heart-first into a perspective so much longer-lived and more subtly developed than the human purview that we gain glimpses of a vast, primordial sensibility, while watching our own kind get whittled down to size.\u201d", "title": "11 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "THE CHANDELIER, by Clarice Lispector. Translated from the Portuguese by Benjamin Moser and Magdalena Edwards. Edited by Benjamin Moser. (New Directions, $25.95.) Lispector\u2019s characteristically hypnotic second novel, originally published in 1946 in her native Brazil, has just been translated into English for the first time. \u201cNo one sounds like Lispector \u2014 in English or Portuguese. No one thinks like her,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. The book, about the interior life of a young, unhappy woman named Virginia, is \u201cuniquely demanding \u2014 it\u2019s baggy, claggy and contentedly glacial,\u201d Sehgal writes, but it\u2019s also \u201ca vulnerable and moving performance \u2014 with a heart-stopping payoff.\u201d\n\nTHE STREET PHILOSOPHY OF GARRY WINOGRAND, by Geoff Dyer. (University of Texas Press, $60.) Dyer\u2019s latest book, physically imposing and visually sumptuous, pairs 100 brief essays by the author with 100 photographs by Garry Winogrand, including 18 color photographs previously unpublished. Winogrand, born in 1928, \u201ccaptured the fallout from the midcentury American moment \u2014 those few decades, from the 1950s on, when placid middle-class prosperity started to give way to something less affluent, more fragmented and harder to define,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. \u201cDyer\u2019s accompanying texts wear their erudition lightly. He makes ample and appreciative use of Very Serious Ideas from the likes of Erich Fromm, Marshall Berman and Richard Sennett, but it\u2019s the specifics in the pictures themselves that most excite his imagination.\u201d\n\nTHE HOUSE OF BROKEN ANGELS, by Luis Alberto Urrea. (Little, Brown, $27.) In Urrea\u2019s sprawling, tender, funny and bighearted family saga, the de La Cruz clan gathers in San Diego to celebrate the 70th birthday of its patriarch, who is dying of cancer. \u201cUrrea is intent on both celebrating the particularities of Mexican-American life and attacking the anti-Mexican racism that has been a part of American culture ever since the United States conquered quite a bit of Mexico,\u201d Viet Thanh Nguyen writes in his review. \u201c\u201cWhat is Urrea\u2019s novel but a Mexican-American novel that is also an American novel? American in the broadest possible sense, from the United States of America, north of the border, to Mexico and by implication all of the other countries south of the border that are also American. The novel disrespects borders.\u201d\n\nTHE CADAVER KING AND THE COUNTRY DENTIST: A True Story of Injustice in the American South, by Radley Balko and Tucker Carrington. (PublicAffairs, $28.) Tracing the wrongful convictions of two men in Mississippi in the early 1990s, the authors ask whether problems in our justice system stem from basic incompetence, bald racism or both. \u201cJunk science convicted these men; real science set them free,\u201d our reviewer, Elie Mystal, writes. \u201cThe inability of judges and jurors to tell the difference is why innocent men languish in jail while the prosecutors who put them there run for higher office.\u201d\n\nFAREWELL TO THE HORSE: A Cultural History, by Ulrich Raulff. (Liveright, $35.) Raulff ranges far and wide to tell the story of the complicated relationship between humans and horses \u2014 an elegy that is labyrinthine in the varied places it goes, but never frustrating. \u201cHe layers fact over myth over military anecdote over personal memory over Darwin over Napoleon over Tolstoy over Gehlen until the book resembles an oil painting of outrageous complexity, so thickly laden with paint that it would take years to scrape down to its blank canvas,\u201d C. E. Morgan writes in her review. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold play, a kind of intellectual onslaught. \u2026 Raulff mostly succeeds and succeeds remarkably.\u201d", "title": "11 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

For Season 2, the writer-producer Noah Hawley plans to expand this quasi-psychedelic, prog-rock-inspired universe while taking further advantage of his appealingly eccentric supporting cast \u2014 which includes the magnificent Aubrey Plaza as a slippery chaos agent.\n\n\u2014\n\nSTARZ\n\n\u2018Howards End\u2019\n\nStarts: April 8, Starz\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe multi-Oscar-winning 1992 movie version of E.M. Forster\u2019s novel \u201cHowards End\u201d was one of the most popular films from the producing-directing-screenwriting team of Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and it helped initiate a wave of high-class literary adaptations and period dramas. This new four-part TV mini-series \u2014 already acclaimed during its BBC run last year \u2014 was written by Kenneth Lonergan and stars Hayley Atwell as a freethinking aristocrat who attempts to bridge the gap between her old-money and working-class friends. As with the film and the book, the TV adaptation concerns the inequitable distribution of privilege, between classes and genders.\n\n\u2014\n\nBBC America\n\n\u2018Killing Eve\u2019\n\nStarts: April 8, BBC America\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe British writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge is best-known for creating and starring in the slice-of-life comedy series \u201cFleabag,\u201d but her new show \u201cKilling Eve\u201d is a real change of pace. Based on the work of the novelist Luke Jennings, this cat-and-mouse thriller stars Sandra Oh as a meticulous secret agent whose latest assignment involves chasing down a skilled but psychopathic assassin (Jodie Comer) whom she secretly admires. Although \u201cKilling Eve\u201d is about two women trying to murder each other, expect Waller-Bridge to spend at least some time each episode exploring how people become trapped by their own senses of self.\n\n\u2014\n\nPrime Video\n\n\u2018Bosch\u2019 (Season 4)\n\nStarts: April 13, Amazon\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn its first season, this Amazon adaptation of the novelist Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch police procedurals came across more like a heavy prestige drama than the sophisticated genre show it was always meant to be. Seasons 2 and 3 corrected its course, leaning more on Connelly\u2019s clever plotting and his eclectic cast of characters, many of whom represent conflicting aspects of the Los Angeles criminal justice system. The sense that law and order in Los Angeles is a delicate structure held in place by bitter rivalries should be a prominent element of Season 4, which is based on the book \u201cAngels Flight,\u201d wherein Detective Bosch investigates the murder of a crusading, anti-cop attorney.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2018Lost in Space\u2019\n\nStarts: April 13, Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe original 1960s version of \u201cLost in Space\u201d was cheap-looking and hopelessly square, but still found a devoted fan base, thanks in large part to its depiction of a loving family \u2014 and their helpful robot \u2014 surviving the universe\u2019s dangerous unknowns by sticking together. Judging from the early trailers, Netflix\u2019s remake is going to be much more special effects-driven, and hipper to boot, with Molly Parker taking the lead as the Robinson clan\u2019s matriarch and Parker Posey playing the morally ambiguous opportunist Dr. Smith.\n\n\u2014\n\nHBO\n\n\u2018Westworld\u2019 (Season 2)\n\nStarts: April 22, HBO\n\nApril 22, HBO Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nHBO has had a tough time producing another series as talked-about and internationally successful as \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d But given how much chatter the first season of \u201cWestworld\u201d generated, it is likely that Season 2 \u2014 arriving nearly a year and a half later \u2014 could become a sensation. After a finale in December of 2016 that spilled some big secrets and shook up the power structure at the show\u2019s futuristic, robot-populated theme park, the story seems poised to move into another phase, expanding the action to incorporate new locations, new characters and new mysteries for fans to argue about online.\n\n\u2014\n\nIFC\n\n\u2018Brockmire\u2019 (Season 2)\n\nStarts: April 25, IFC\n\nApril 25, IFC Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the 2017 TV season\u2019s most pleasant surprises, the raunchy comedy \u201cBrockmire\u201d took what seemed like a thin concept \u2014 an alcoholic former major league baseball announcer tries to resuscitate his career in the minor leagues \u2014 and gave it unexpected depth and soul. Last year ended on a mini-cliffhanger, as that comeback threatened the budding romance between Jim Brockmire (Hank Azaria) with the woman who helped save him: a sports-loving small-town entrepreneur played by the excellent Amanda Peet. Fans of Season 1 are no doubt looking forward to more of Jim\u2019s rich-toned, colorfully phrased vulgarity, along with more of the show\u2019s nuanced understanding of what \u201csuccess\u201d means in 21st-century America.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nHulu\n\n\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 (Season 2)\n\nStarts: April 25, Hulu\n\nApril 25, Hulu Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSeason 2 of this Hulu adaptation of the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood will have a hard time topping Season 1, which scored an Emmy for best drama series (unprecedented for a streaming series) and also became a relevant conversation piece in a year when sexist privilege made international headlines. But on the assumption that Elisabeth Moss will continue to give a superb performance as a sex slave in a theocratic society \u2014 and with Marisa Tomei, Cherry Jones and Clea DuVall joining the cast \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe this show will keep going strong, even as it moves further beyond the source material.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cKing in the Wilderness\u201d (HBO, April 2), \u201cFamous in Love\u201d (Freeform, April 4), \u201cNational Treasure: Kiri\u201d (Hulu, April 4), \u201cJersey Shore Family Vacation\u201d (MTV, April 5), \u201cThe Boss Baby: Back in Business\u201d (Netflix, April 6), \u201cPaterno\u201d (HBO, April 7), \u201cAn American Murder Mystery: The Staircase\u201d (ID, April 8), \u201cUnforgotten\u201d (PBS, April 8), \u201cNew Girl\u201d (Fox, April 10), \u201cRellik\u201d (Cinemax, April 13), \u201cWyatt Cenac\u2019s Problem Areas\u201d (HBO, April 13), \u201cThe Circus\u201d (Showtime, April 15), \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d (AMC, April 15), \u201cCivilizations\u201d (PBS, April 17), \u201cInto the Badlands\u201d (AMC, April 22), \u201cThe 100\u201d (The CW, April 24), \u201cGenius\u201d (Nat Geo, April 24), \u201cArcher\u201d (FXX, April 25) and \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d (ABC, April 30).", "title": "11 Shows We\u2019ll Be Talking About in April", "authors": ["Noel Murray"]}

I was back and forth from the group home in upstate New York, and I would do people\u2019s lawns, clean out their garages, babysit, really anything. I used to do well. I would make $10 for babysitting, $5 for raking leaves. My first major job was at Wyckoff Hospital, and I didn\u2019t like it. I was hired to transcribe medical records via Dictaphone. I could type really fast in high school \u2014 90 words per minute. I wish I still had my first paycheck, because I was so proud. Going to the bank to cash it, I felt like such a grown-up. I was a hustler even back then.\n\nThurston Moore, Musician\n\nAt this point in my life I knew I wanted to make records, but I didn\u2019t know how to make them. I found a job in the back of the New York Post asking for a shipping clerk. I went up there and it was Masterdisk, a place that cut records \u2014 people like Frank Zappa or Bryan Ferry would come in. So I got to see how it worked. I\u2019d take the acetates of the records and deliver them to different places in midtown, like RCA Studios. The more I got involved with my band, the Coachmen, and then Sonic Youth, though \u2014 well it prohibited me from having a very cogent day job. I kept not going to work. And there was no way to contact me, because I couldn\u2019t afford a telephone. Eventually I would go in and sheepishly say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d They kind of liked me and would let it go, but at some point they let me go. Then, by maybe the third or fourth Sonic Youth album, we had a good enough profile where we could actually use a really good mastering studio: Masterdisk. It was kind of like, welcome back.\n\nEric Goode, Entrepreneur\n\nMy roommate, Shawn Hausman, and I worked for Steve Mass, designing different spaces in the Mudd Club. We\u2019d have these absurd hours: painting a Renaissance ceiling in the basement at 4 in the morning. We also worked on movies, because Shawn\u2019s father was in the industry. We\u2019d stay out all night and then go and do location scouting or production work on different films. When there wasn\u2019t film work we would do what you would call art directing work for other nightclubs, including Studio 54 and Danceteria, before starting our own. The motivation in those days was definitely not money. We were just barely surviving.\n\nAndre Walker, Fashion Designer\n\nI made quite a few friends selling T-shirts outside of my mom\u2019s store in Brooklyn, pulling kids off the street to participate in my fashion shows. I was selling T-shirts from 11 years old. I would hand-paint them, cut them, fringe them \u2014 what I would see people in the Village doing when I was much younger. Then I started cutting fabric and gluing it together with Magic Stitch and, eventually, sewing. We had a big house, so it was very, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my house and get dressed up, wear clothes and take photos.\u201d That would be an after-school activity, listening to everything from Polyrock to Gang of Four to LiLiPUT to Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & the Bunnymen, you name it. I was making $100 on a slow day, because usually I\u2019d sell at least 10 or 15 T-shirts, so I always had money on me. My mom used to hide money everywhere.

He celebrates the release with a quartet featuring the brothers Zaccai and Luques Curtis \u2014 whose Truth Revolution Records released the album \u2014 on piano and bass, and Mark Whitfield II on drums.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "title": "14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "CAROLINE DAVIS at the Jazz Gallery (April 13, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ms. Davis, an alto saxophonist, arrived in New York a few years ago by way of Chicago, and last month she released her third album, \u201cHeart Tonic,\u201d an impressive collection of twisty, chattering originals performed by a spry quintet. Ms. Davis will play music from that disc here with the rhythm section from that band \u2014 Julian Shore on piano, Tamir Shmerling on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums \u2014 as well as Noah Preminger on tenor saxophone.\n\n646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc\n\nFESTIVAL OF MALI at Brooklyn Bowl (April 14-16, 8 p.m.). The offerings at this three-night festival provide a cross sample of the country\u2019s music \u2014 from the kinetic churn of the Songha\u00ef vocalist and guitarist Sidi Tour\u00e9 on Saturday to the gentler admonishments of the griot supergroup Trio Da Kali on Sunday. The series closes on Monday with Fatoumata Diawara, a beguiling talent on vocals and guitar whose music splits the difference between the other two headliners while admitting folk influences from around the world.\n\nbrooklynbowl.com\n\nTERRACE MARTIN AND FRIENDS at National Sawdust (April 13, 8 p.m.). Mr. Martin has no problem weaving a contemporary Angeleno sound out of the common thread that already runs through 1970s jazz-funk and 1990s G-funk. An enterprising multi-instrumentalist, he primarily plays the saxophone; his signature sound is a high, zigzagging squeal. But Mr. Martin has also become one of Los Angeles\u2019s most sought-after producers, working with Herbie Hancock, Kendrick Lamar and a growing list of other pop and hip-hop stars. It\u2019s less common for him to lead his own band, let alone in New York. Catch him here at the helm of a talented group featuring James Francies on keyboards, James Genus on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums.\n\n646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org\n\nCHRISTIAN MCBRIDE\u2019S NEW JAWN at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola (through April 15, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Mr. McBride has more clean, fastidious power than almost any other bassist around \u2014 it makes him a kind of dream sideman. But most of his creative energy these days gets spent on his own ensembles, and the most recent of them is a big winner. The New Jawn quartet has a roguish, brawny sound, sprung from the earthy drumming of Nasheet Waits and the sharp-elbowed horn playing of Josh Evans on trumpet and J. D. Allen on tenor saxophone (on previous engagements, the saxophonist has been Marcus Strickland).\n\n212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys\n\nPHAROAH SANDERS at Le Poisson Rouge (April 19, 8 p.m.). A doyen of spiritual jazz, Mr. Sanders is known for his mantralike compositions, often featuring no more than two chords and a repetitious theme. They tend to open onto acres of space where the tenor saxophonist can improvise and conjure. At 77, Mr. Sanders \u2014 an N.E.A. Jazz Master \u2014 still performs with ardor, often singing as well as blowing the horn. And on jazz standards he can still channel the beaming, late-1950s sound of his mentor, John Coltrane.\n\n212-505-3474, lpr.com\n\nSFJAZZ COLLECTIVE at Jazz Standard (through April 15, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Since its founding in 2004, this rotating all-star band has focused on the catalog of a different modern composer every year, interrogating and rearranging their tunes. But the current season is about taking stock of the collective\u2019s own book \u2014 by now quite an overstuffed volume. On Friday, the group will release a double-disc collection featuring originals by its members, as well as new takes on arrangements from past seasons. At Jazz Standard, the group will play some of those originals, as well as its versions of pieces by Miles Davis, the collective\u2019s 2016 honoree. The group\u2019s current lineup features the tenor saxophonist David S\u00e1nchez, the trumpeter Sean Jones, the vibraphonist Warren Wolf, the alto saxophonist Miguel Zen\u00f3n, the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the pianist Edward Simon, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Obed Calvaire.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "title": "14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

There are two story lines for the Messthetics: It\u2019s a reunion band, bringing together the bassist Joe Lally and the drummer Brendan Canty from Fugazi, an iconic Washington, D.C., post-punk ensemble; and it\u2019s a place of ascent for Anthony Pirog, an extravagantly creative young guitarist hailing from Fugazi\u2019s hometown. And the music that this trio creates has a double identity, too: sometimes a tangle of electric laceration, elsewhere an ethereal sprawl.\n\nthebellhouseny.com\n\nNICHOLAS PAYTON QUARTET at Smoke (April 20-22, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Payton has gone from being a straight-ahead jazz prodigy from New Orleans to an advocate for a pan-African musical approach, and a restless experimenter in his own right (case in point: his most recent album, \u201cAfro-Caribbean Mixtape\u201d). He performs here with Taylor Eigsti on piano, Barry Stephenson on bass and Jonathan Barber on drums \u2014 a band suggesting that Mr. Payton will be leaning toward the acoustic-jazz side of his sound.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nSOF\u00cdA REI at the Stone (April 24-28, 8:30 p.m.). Ms. Rei, a vocalist hailing from Argentina, sings in a windblown, mountains-high voice, but she often sounds like she might be withholding something, too. It\u2019s as if maybe the full delivery might be too overpowering \u2014 an engrossing suggestion. On Tuesday, Ms. Rei will perform a portion of John Zorn\u2019s newly released, 11-volume collection, \u201cThe Book Beriah,\u201d the closing installment of his epic \u201cMasada\u201d series. On Wednesday, she performs material from her own most recent album, a dedication to the Chilean folk icon Violeta Parra. On Thursday, she presents a gathering of eight vocalists titled \u201cSlides, Stills & Snapshots.\u201d\n\nthestonenyc.com\n\nTOMEKA REID QUARTET at the Jewish Museum (April 26, 7:30 p.m.). When playing in a swing rhythm, Ms. Reid creates a flow with her cello that\u2019s tensile and quick \u2014 like so much free jazz of the 1970s and \u201980s \u2014 but also earthy and more sturdily organized. Her playing has a sandpapery warmth and a stately power, and often a thick backbone of funk. Here she performs with Mary Halvorson on guitar, Jason Roebke on bass and Tomas Fujiwara on drums, the quartet behind a strong self-titled album from 2015. The concert is presented through a partnership between the Jewish Museum and Bang on a Can.\n\n212-423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org\n\nMATANA ROBERTS at the Park Avenue Armory (April 24, 7 and 9 p.m.). Ms. Roberts is an alto saxophonist with a big, blooming tone. She\u2019s also a historically minded conceptualist, digging deeply into the workings of memory and taking up arms against the present-day traumas that will haunt us in the years ahead. Her primary musical form is the long suite, but recently she\u2019s also solidified a visual art practice. Ms. Roberts is represented by the Fridman Gallery in Lower Manhattan, where her second solo exhibition, \u201cJump at the Sun,\u201d is on view through Wednesday. In the mixed-media works presented there, she uses combinations of sound, musical scores, old photographs and other collaged items. This concert, uptown at the Park Avenue Armory, coincides with the closing of that show and features Ms. Roberts joined by a poet known as Geng and a sextet of snare drummers.\n\n212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\n\nEditor\u2019s Pick\n\nBC35 RECORD RELEASE SHOW at St. Vitus (April 20, 7 p.m.). Thirty-five years ago, in an old factory space in Gowanus, Brooklyn, the producer and musician Martin Bisi established BC Studio, where he\u2019s has been at the controls for underground classics such as Sonic Youth\u2019s \u201cBad Moon Rising\u201d and the Dresden Dolls\u2019 self-titled debut. Fittingly, Mr. Bisi is honoring this anniversary with a righteous racket: first by releasing a compilation with bands he has produced, as well as some he put together and one that was resurrected for the occasion, and then by celebrating that album with those groups at clubs in Brooklyn, Boston and Philadelphia. This Greenpoint stop will feature New Old Skull, a reunion of members of Live Skull; Excop, an improvisational instrumental collusion between the bassist Algis Kizys (Swans, Foetus, Of Cabbages and Kings) and three members of Cop Shoot Cop (Jack Nantz on bass, Phil Puleo on percussion and Jim Coleman on electronics); Nowhere Near, with Mr. Bisi on guitar, Bob Bert (Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch) on drums, Ryan SkeletonBoy (the Art Gray Noizz Quintet) on bass, and Ivan Lip (Pop. 1280) and Alyse Lamb (Parlor Walls) on guitar; as well as the psychedelic churn of White Hills and the sonic abrasiveness of Tidal Channel.

Walsh published an article in Boston magazine about \u201cthe untold story of how Van Morrison fled record-industry thugs, hid out in Boston and wrote one of rock\u2019s greatest albums.\u201d The album was the sylvan, ineffably spiritual \u201cAstral Weeks,\u201d released in 1968, when Morrison was 23. Walsh\u2019s article included less-than-sylvan details about cash handoffs to gangsters, someone smashing an acoustic guitar over Morrison\u2019s head and insights from the singer\u2019s first wife, Janet Rigsbee (\u201cBeing a muse is a thankless job, and the pay is lousy\u201d).\n\n\u201cAstral Weeks\u201d was recorded in New York City, but it was \u201cplanned, shaped and rehearsed in Boston and Cambridge,\u201d Walsh writes in his new book, which shares its title with the album. \u201cThis fact has been a secret kept in plain view.\u201d What exactly this secret yields is a question that the book never quite answers.

It opens with a fresh angle on one of the stalest scenes in music history, when Bob Dylan went electric at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "Original headline: \u201cUntucked Shirttails, the New Pennants of Rebellion,\u201d from July 2004.\n\nA new normal: Strange how some fashion fads that seem destined to last for months somehow endure for decades. The backward baseball cap, for example, blew up as a rebellious teenage fashion flourish in the 1980s, but instead of going the way of acid-washed jeans and Members Only jackets, the look evolved into a bedrock element of the bruh uniform for 30 years running. Every bit as rule-flouting, but even more ubiquitous, is the untucked dress shirt. This seemingly fleeting fashion trend attracted arched-eyebrow skepticism in this Styles article by Guy Trebay, which appeared on the front page of this newspaper at the peak of mid-aughts metrosexuality. \u201cThis may be remembered as the summer when new sartorial frontiers in the workplace were definitively breached \u2014 and in a manner destined to agitate bosses and parents everywhere,\u201d Mr. Trebay wrote. \u201cMen are letting their shirttails wave, a fact true not just of polo shirts or square-cut tropical styles designed to be worn outside of trousers but of broadcloth dress shirts with tapered tails never meant to see light of day.\u201d\n\nWinds of change: When it comes to launching a style trend into the mainstream, it takes an army of influencers, and the untucked shirt managed full mobilization. By 2004, fashion-forward editors like Jim Nelson of GQ and Nick Sullivan of Esquire, along with seemingly every male celebrity under 50, were doing their best to make respectable this once-slovenly look, which also happened to dominate the front rows of the Milan men\u2019s wear shows that year. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of nonfashion fashion look,\u201d Joe Zee, the well-traveled style editor, told Mr. Trebay in 2004. \u201cAll the young Hollywood types, the young heroes who are cool, like Jake Gyllenhaal, Orlando Bloom and Spike Jonze, wear their shirts untucked. It\u2019s one of those looks that\u2019s meant to seem like there\u2019s no effort, although we know that it\u2019s really thought out.\u201d\n\nThe deeper context: Men under 30 might find it strange that anyone other than cops, accountants and Capitol Hill types ever tucked in a button-down shirt. But for decades, the untucked look was relatively rare on the fashion landscape, outside of slumming college students and madras short-clad preppies summering in Nantucket. O.K., the look had some precedent in American culture: the more rebellious of the bobby soxers, those rebellious teenage girls of the early Sinatra years, shocked grown-ups nationwide by rocking untucked shirts along with rolled dungarees, saddle shoes and, obviously, bobby socks. Among men, however, flapping shirttails were relatively rare. Even rock \u2018n\u2019 roll iconoclasts like the Rolling Stones of the 1960s and CBGB-era Blondie of the 1970s tended to politely tuck in their button-downs. That all began to change, however, in the casual-everything, dot-com era of the late \u201990s. Suddenly, sneakers and hoodies transformed into office wear among proto-Mark Zuckerbergs. Even Wall Street banks and law firms dallied, fairly risibly, with \u201ccasual Fridays.\u201d By the middle of the next decade, the untucked shirt became the \u201cdefault for a generation still searching for a middle ground between the traditional coat-and-tie uniform for the workplace and the Internet-era alternative of outfits best suited for mowing the lawn,\u201d Mr. Trebay wrote.\n\nA new generation gap: This is not to say there was no pushback. \u201cFor decades, the sartorial establishment took the part of Mom and Dad,\u201d Mr. Trebay wrote. \u201cTucked shirttails looked neater. They were more efficient, suaver and also, it should be noted, kept one from being taken for the pizza guy.\u201d The squares, however, were destined to lose this battle. As much as employers initially pushed back against casual clothing in the workplace, \u201cconcerned that sloppy dress correlated with shoddy output,\u201d the \u201cmarch of casualization is not so easily stopped,\u201d Mr. Trebay concluded. \u201cInfluenced, perhaps, by the crisp Latin American guayabera or by the adolescent ease of urban hip-hop clothes, the untucked dress shirt may not yet have made inroads at law offices or financial institutions. But the style is well-entrenched in Hollywood executive cadres \u2014 at the lineup on stage at a screening of the Harry Potter movie in New York last month nearly all sported the look \u2014 and among influential fashion types.\u201d", "title": "2004: How Untucked Shirts Became a Male Uniform", "authors": []}

Drafting running backs at the top of the first round is cool again, and that is great timing for Barkley, who has the potential to be a special player at the pro level. Barkley runs a 4.4 40-yard dash, has a 41-inch vertical leap and did 29 reps on the bench press at the combine. Elliott didn\u2019t participate in the bench press but was worse in the 40 (4.47 seconds) and in the leap (32.5 inches). The physical gifts were turned into production in college, with Barkley rushing for 3,843 yards and 43 touchdowns in his three years at Penn State, and developing into a solid pass-catching option out of the backfield as a junior. He does not break many tackles, and may take some time to learn pass-protection, but there is little doubt that he can be a star.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[Read more about the Giants\u2019 pick here.]\n\nHow he fits: Even with quarterback Eli Manning\u2019s future in doubt, the Giants made the wise decision to take the best player in the draft. The three top quarterbacks available are all talented but also have some question marks about how good they will be. Almost no one doubts that Barkley will be an immediate superstar.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. New York Jets: Sam Darnold \u2014 QB, Southern California\n\nDarnold is the happy medium of the first-round quarterback options. At 6-foot-3 and 221 pounds he is not quite as big as Josh Allen but he has a more typical pro build than Baker Mayfield. He has the arm to make any throw and has shown decent accuracy as well, while being far more mobile than you might guess. His 40-yard dash time of 4.85 seconds was just one-hundredth of a second slower than Mayfield and wasn\u2019t enough slower than Allen\u2019s 4.75 for that to tip the scales in Allen\u2019s favor. The biggest drawback with Darnold, beyond a troubling propensity for turnovers, is a slow and deliberate release that could be a major issue in the N.F.L.\n\n[Read more about the Jets\u2019 pick here.]\n\nHow he fits: The Jets\u2019 biggest needs were at quarterback, cornerback and edge rusher. Josh McCown can hold down the fort at quarterback for the time being and Teddy Bridgewater has a ton of potential (and a ton of risk) as a backup, but Darnold is too talented to pass up. He could easily take over the starting job this season but he has the luxury of not having to if his development goes slowly.\n\n4. Cleveland Browns: Denzel Ward \u2014 CB, Ohio State\n\nWard is fast. Really fast. His 4.32-second 40 tied for the fastest mark among defensive backs at the combine and he used that speed, along with strong instincts in man coverage, to find consistent success at the college level. He did not generate many turnovers, with just two interceptions over three seasons, but he broke up 15 passes as a junior thanks to his ability to read plays. On intelligence and speed he should step in as a starter-level player immediately, with the main concern for him being his size. At 5-foot-11 and 183 pounds, he is far smaller than the receivers he will be asked to cover, and even with a 39-inch vertical leap he could be prone to losing battles for passes thrown above the shoulder level. He could also potentially be a liability in terms of tackling, though plenty of poor-tackling cornerbacks have proven their worth in the past.\n\nHow he fits: With the quarterback situation settled (the Browns hope), Cleveland took a risk by skipping over Bradley Chubb and going with Ward, the best defensive back in the draft. The Browns have Myles Garrett on the defensive line already, so they may have just wanted to get an elite talent on another level of their defense, but Ward presents at least slightly more risk than Chubb.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Denver Broncos: Bradley Chubb \u2014 DE, North Carolina State\n\nChubb won both the Hendricks and Bronko Nagurski awards as the nation\u2019s top defensive end and top overall defender thanks to his 10 sacks and 23 tackles for a loss. The numbers were impressive, but even more so because they were nearly carbon copies to what he\u2019d done as a junior in 2016, when he had 10 sacks and 21 tackles for a loss. With a 4.65-second 40-yard dash he is among the fastest defensive linemen in the draft, but he matches that with a rangy (for his position) build of 6-foot-4 and 270 pounds. He has found success both outrunning offensive linemen and also running through them. His game could still use some pro refinement, but he has relatively few question marks for his ability to be an immediate impact player.\n\nHow he fits: Everyone expected the Broncos to take a quarterback but the team decided to reload its strength on defense by taking the best defensive player in this draft. Chubb doesn\u2019t necessarily fill a need, but the prospect of he and Von Miller terrorizing quarterbacks makes the team\u2019s struggles on offense at least somewhat less of an issue. They still badly need a quarterback, however.\n\n6. Indianapolis Colts: Quenton Nelson \u2014 OG, Notre Dame\n\nOffensive tackles have finally begun to be appreciated by a widespread audience, but guards still tend to be overlooked, which is why Nelson\u2019s status near the top of most draft boards makes him stand out so much. At 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds he is built like a tackle, and he uses his off-the-charts power to move through a defense in a way that has inspired comparisons to Larry Allen. Only 11 guards have ever been selected in the first five picks of the draft (none since 1985), and the only one since 1988 to crack the top-nine was Jonathan Cooper who went to Arizona at No. 7 in 2013. But Nelson\u2019s size, strength and technique make him perhaps this draft\u2019s most can\u2019t-miss talent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow he fits: Colts running backs are popping bottles of champagne. Nelson is a wrecking ball and he is the type of offensive line prospect who can single-handedly make the team dangerous. It\u2019s unusual for a guard to go this high in the draft but Nelson will instantly make their team better. He was the top offensive line prospect in the draft by a mile and the Colts, a team that theoretically doesn\u2019t need a quarterback, recognized that he was too good to pass up.\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Buffalo Bills: Josh Allen \u2014 QB, Wyoming\n\nThe first trade of the draft. The Bills gave up the No. 12 pick and two second rounders for a chance at Allen, who is easily the most divisive of the elite quarterback prospects (and no, it\u2019s not because of a few dumb tweets he sent while he was in high school). He\u2019s big (6-foot-5, 237 pounds), he\u2019s fast enough to be considered mobile (4.75-second 40) and he\u2019s got arm strength to spare. But he developed late, which led to very little recruitment coming out of high school, and he has yet to show an ability to have the accuracy necessary to succeed in the N.F.L. The combination of a lack of ability to throw on the run, a tendency to make poor decisions, and a sense that he does not necessarily have much control of where the ball ends up leaves him as a quarterback who can look elite on one play and inept on the next. If it is simply a matter of him still learning the game, then he could develop into something special, but there is a tremendous bust risk in picking him high in the draft.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on ESPN, Allen addressed the Bills trading up for him despite the controversy over offensive tweets that he\u2019d sent in high school. \u201cI\u2019m going to make them look like they\u2019re the smartest people out there,\u201d he said.\n\nHow he fits: With Tyrod Taylor gone and Nathan Peterman being terrible, the Bills needed a quarterback and they got one that some people thought was the top overall player in this draft. There are certainly question marks about Allen but he\u2019s played in cold weather and he has slightly more upside than Josh Rosen, so the team is hoping they bet big and will win big.\n\n8. Chicago Bears: Roquan Smith \u2014 LB, Georgia\n\nSmith is sort of the antithesis of Tremaine Edmunds. He\u2019s not nearly as large (6-foot-1, 236 pounds) and while he has elite speed there are questions about if he is strong enough to play in the middle of the field. Where he makes up for that is in natural linebacker instincts. He is a smart player, a strong leader, and is the type of guy coaches will trust to make decisions on the field.\n\nHow he fits: The Bears\u2019 biggest need was at linebacker and Smith fits the bill. The team is hoping he\u2019s a new version of Brian Urlacher, and the concept is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. He could be a true anchor for their defense.\n\n9. San Francisco 49ers: Mike McGlinchey \u2014 OT, Notre Dame\n\nHe is the top-rated tackle in the draft, but McGlinchey is far overshadowed by his linemate Quenton Nelson. That being said, McGlinchey brings a huge frame (6-foot-8, 309 pounds with 34-inch arms) and he is pro-ready in terms of technique and instinct. The limitations to his game all revolve around his strength and his ability to deal with power rushers. If he can add some bulk without losing his mobility, that could help alleviate the concern.\n\nHow he fits: McGlinchey is the second Notre Dame offensive lineman to go in the first 10 picks, and while he\u2019s not nearly the prospect that Nelson is, he\u2019s a solid tackle who can be an anchor on either side of the line for San Francisco. He now has the job of protecting Jimmy Garoppolo who went from backup in New England to face of the franchise in San Francisco in the span of five games.\n\nPhoto\n\n10. Arizona Cardinals: Josh Rosen \u2014 QB, U.C.L.A.\n\nThe second trade of the draft sent the tenth pick from Oakland to Arizona so the Cardinals could get their new franchise quarterback. They gave up three picks (15, 79 and 152) to get Rosen, who is not the kind of player who will wow anyone at a combine, but has good size (6-foot-4, 226 pounds) and a track record for the Bruins that suggests he has a deep understanding of the position even if he does not have the strongest arm or the most athleticism. His experience playing under center means there will not be much of a learning curve at the pro level, and he has shown the personality to be a strong leader off the field as well as on it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe concern with Rosen is entirely how durable he will be. His narrow frame would be a concern even without his history of injury problems so a team betting big on him has to be concerned of what that could mean for him, especially if he ends up in an environment with poor pass protection.\n\nThis is the first time in the N.F.L.\u2019s common draft era (1967 to present) where four quarterbacks were selected in the first 10 picks. While Allen and Rosen fell farther than some expected, the quarterback class has made history before any of them have thrown a pro pass.\n\nHow he fits: Sam Bradford is a good quarterback who has plenty of good football left to play, but his fragility is a huge concern. Getting a young player who can benefit from watching Bradford play before ultimately taking over is a solid move for the Cardinals. That being said, Rosen has an injury history as well, so the team has plenty of risk at the position even with two good quarterbacks on the roster.\n\n11. Miami Dolphins: Minkah Fitzpatrick \u2014 S, Alabama\n\nHe was an instant success for talent-laden Alabama thanks to a nose for the ball, and that continued as he finished his three-year college career with nine interceptions, four of which he returned for touchdowns. He has played some cornerback but will probably be a safety in the N.F.L. where he will have the ability to participate in all aspects of the defense. He is a strong tackler, has great freelance instincts and, other than some questions as to his ability to handle man-to-man coverage as a corner (something he will likely not be asked to do), he should be the type of player who arrives in the pros ready to start.\n\nHow he fits: The Dolphins probably wanted a quarterback, but they didn\u2019t want one bad enough to trade up and Fitzpatrick is a solid pick here as a defensive back who could solidify the middle of the field for Miami. It\u2019s somewhat surprising that he went before Florida State\u2019s Derwin James, but the Dolphins may have considered him to have more upside.\n\nPhoto\n\n12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Vita Vea \u2014 DT, Washington\n\nA mammoth tackle at 6-foot-4 and 347 pounds, Vea was already known for otherworldly strength and he proved it at the combine with 41 reps on the bench press. Despite that size and raw power, he moves remarkably well for an interior lineman. He could use some refinement to correct some issues, and may need a coach who can motivate him to break some bad habits, but physically he is ready to be an impact player from Day 1.\n\nHow he fits: Vea doesn\u2019t fit. He makes room for himself. The Buccaneers got an anchor for their defensive line and they were paid with two second rounders for their trouble. There were players higher on most draft boards available, so the pick is certainly a surprise, but a defense that had plenty of holes just got a giant stopper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n13. Washington Redskins: Da\u2019Ron Payne \u2014 DT, Alabama\n\nA key playmaker in Alabama\u2019s national championship victory, Payne was a 350-pound goliath at the start of his college career but slimmed down to just over 300 while remaining just as strong. He may have to add some of that bulk back in the pros, but he has shown no ill-effects in terms of power when attacking the line of scrimmage and may just be the rare slender (slender is relative in this case) tackle, who succeeds based on top-notch run-stopping ability and excellent technique.\n\nHow he fits: This is the second consecutive year that the Redskins took a defensive lineman from Alabama, so they must have liked what they got in Jonathan Allen. It was almost shocking that history didn\u2019t repeat itself with the Redskins lucking into the best safety in the draft (Derwin James) like they did in 2004 (Sean Taylor) but Payne and Allen know each other well and could make defensive line a huge strength for the Redskins.\n\nPhoto\n\n14. New Orleans Saints: Marcus Davenport \u2014 LB/DE, Texas-San Antonio\n\nThe Saints paid a huge price to get Davenport. They sent Green Bay the Nos. 27 and 147 picks along with a first-rounder next year. A tall (6-foot-6) and fairly slender (264 pounds) edge rusher, Davenport has gotten steadily bigger and stronger since entering college and could presumably continue to develop, which would certainly help if a team hopes to use him as a defensive end in a 4-3 scheme. He\u2019s fast and aggressive, but his burst is somewhat lacking as are his instincts. That all adds up to him being far from a sure thing, but having the potential to be something special in the right environment.\n\nHow he fits: This one is a surprise. The Saints sent a nice package of picks to Green Bay to get an edge rusher who is undoubtedly a difference-maker on defense but isn\u2019t the type of guy who most draft boards had rated highly enough to warrant such an outlay. If Davenport starts piling up sacks at the pro level no one will question this pick, but any rookie struggles will be compounded by the knowledge that the team gave up next year\u2019s first-round pick as well.\n\n15. Oakland Raiders: Kolton Miller \u2014 OT, U.C.L.A.\n\nMiller is a giant at 6-foot-9, but he is fairly slender for a tackle at 309 pounds. While he has athleticism to spare for a player at his position, he has not quite figured out how to let his length compensate for his limitations in terms of a strong base. That will probably require an adjustment period at the pro level, but a player of his size who moves like can is such a rarity that teams will not require much convincing to be patient.\n\nHow he fits: The Raiders had been strong on the offensive line in recent years, but they\u2019ve had some turnover and some injuries so they selected a mammoth left tackle to protect Derek Carr\u2019s blind side. It could be a few years before he\u2019s worthy of his lofty draft position, but there is reason to believe he will be there. At 6-foot-9, all Miller needs is the right coach to figure out how to best utilize his perfect size at tackle.\n\n16. Buffalo Bills: Tremaine Edmunds \u2014 LB, Virginia Tech\n\nThe Bills already pulled one trade in this draft to get quarterback Josh Allen and now they\u2019ve done another to get Edmunds. They gave up the Nos. 22 and 65 in exchange for the 16th pick and a fifth-rounder \u2014 and that might be a steal for this guy. Standing 6 foot 5 inches with long arms and a fairly narrow frame, Edmunds does not look like a typical linebacker, but the son of Ferrell Edmunds, a two-time Pro Bowler at tight end, uses his size and as a huge advantage to succeed at any of the linebacker positions. There are few players to match him up with historically, but one similar player was Julian Peterson, a tall linebacker who on any given play could line up at safety, any linebacker position, or even as a defensive end. The concerns about Edmunds rest on whether he has the next-level instincts that truly great linebackers tend to possess. That will not be an issue for several years, however, as he can compensate so much athletically that he has time to learn the finer details of the game while still being a star.\n\nHow he fits: There was no reason for anyone to believe that Edmunds would still be available this deep in the draft, so the Bills\u2019 rebuilding process got another jolt with the selection of an absolutely huge inside linebacker who can do so many things that he can help all over the field. He might have a rough adjustment to the N.F.L., especially since he\u2019s still a teenager, but he\u2019ll get there.\n\nPhoto\n\n17. Los Angeles Chargers: Derwin James \u2014 S, Florida State\n\nHe only played 26 games in college, but James has the perfect size (6-foot-2, 215 pounds), strength (21 reps on the bench press) and speed (4.47 in the 40-yard dash) to be a game-changing safety. His game could use some refinement but he has continued to improve and his big personality should make him a leader on the field. Some injuries in the past, including an A.C.L. repair, should be noted, but any flaws he has on the field are correctable through coaching.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow he fits: It was a long wait, but James looked ecstatic to be heading to Los Angeles. He immediately strengthens the middle of the field for a defense that was strongest on the edges and the Chargers got a player who is a top-10 talent at 17.\n\nPhoto\n\n18. Green Bay Packers: Jaire Alexander \u2014 CB, Louisville\n\nThe Packers had traded down earlier in the draft, but with Alexander available they went back up in a trade with Seattle. They gave up the No. 25 pick along with picks in the third- and sixth-rounds, but they get a guy who was one of the two top cornerbacks left on the board. It is not great when you\u2019re an undersized cornerback to have spent the bulk of your junior season either out with an injury or limited by said injury. But Alexander showed enough skill in his sophomore season to make him a worthy first-round pick, even if the team selecting him feels he will need to find a permanent home as a nickel corner to help protect him. A good performance at the combine helped rescue some of the draft stock that had tanked based on his lost 2017 season.\n\nHow he fits: The Packers\u2019 secondary was a huge liability last year so they tried to address that need with a player who carries a solid amount of risk but understands the position well and could be a top cornerback if things go right. He\u2019s also a talented punt returner, something the Packers need. He\u2019s certainly exciting and Green Bay just has to hope he can turn that outsized attitude into a consistent career.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Dallas Cowboys: Leighton Vander Esch \u2014 LB, Boise State\n\nA 6-foot-4, 256-pound linebacker with a nose for the ball, Vander Esch is an athletic freak who developed into a pro prospect in college after not having made much noise in high school. He looks and plays like a former basketball player, and has shown an ability to make tough tackles, but there is a sense that he is still learning the game after just one year as a starter in college.\n\nHow he fits: The Cowboys needed more defense and they are hoping Vander Esch can be a diamond in the rough. It must have killed Jerry Jones to not take a player more worthy of headlines (like Alabama\u2019s Calvin Ridley) but Vander Esch might be the smarter pick. There is some bust potential, however, if he plateaus in development.\n\nRaiders Trade a Third-Round Pick for Steelers\u2019 Martavis Bryant\n\nIt didn\u2019t involve a first-round pick but the Oakland Raiders made one of the biggest moves of the day by trading a third-rounder (No. 79) for Pittsburgh\u2019s Martavis Bryant. A big-play wide receiver who stands 6 feet 4 inches, Bryant has at times looked like an emerging superstar but he had off-field problems lead to him missing a season with a suspension and once he came back the team never seemed to warm back up to him. A new start with Derek Carr throwing to him in Oakland could be huge for both him and the Raiders.\n\n20. Detroit Lions: Frank Ragnow \u2014 C, Arkansas\n\nRagnow wasn\u2019t on many draft boards at the start of this year\u2019s draft process, but he rose quickly as people took a closer look at his film and his combine results. At 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds, he is enormous for a center, and he plays the game with a physical style that is what a lot of teams hope for at the position. He\u2019s not a top-tier athlete, and may struggle with faster players, but he will fall back on a big personality and a solid amount of coachability to get where he needs to be.\n\nHow he fits: This is a bit of a reach at 20, with plenty of players left on the board with better pedigrees, but the Lions must have fallen in love with the thought of him at center, and they figured he would not be there when they pick again at 51.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n21. Cincinnati Bengals: Billy Price \u2014 C, Ohio State\n\nPrice can play guard and center, but doesn\u2019t play a particularly disciplined game, and sometimes borders on too intense. He will need to find a way to channel that energy in a more efficient manner, especially in a league where he does not have the same amount of physical advantage. He is one of the strongest players in the draft and he likes to show that early and often.\n\nHow he fits: Like the Lions, the Bengals had a need so they reached to get a center. The good news is that Price was ranked ahead of Frank Ragnow on most draft lists, so their reach was slightly less ... reachy, than Detroit\u2019s.\n\nPhoto\n\n22. Tennessee Titans: Rashaan Evans \u2014 LB, Alabama\n\nThe Titans gave up the Nos. 25 and 125 picks to get Nos. 22 and 215. They did so to get Evans, the Alabama linebacker du jour. Stuck behind a host of talented players in his first few years with the Crimson Tide, Evans finally got his chance as a senior and, as many expected, he thrived. While he did not run the 40 as the combine, it\u2019s believed he has the speed to be an elite inside linebacker in 3-4 offense and has displayed a willingness to work on his game that will be music to a his new coaches\u2019 ears.\n\nHow he fits: The Titans probably needed an edge rusher more than an inside linebacker, but Evans is a tremendous value pick at 22 and the price they paid in trade was not too extreme. Tennessee Coach Mike Vrabel, who played for the Patriots, undoubtedly was attracted to someone who could play several different positions on defense. If Evans had lasted another pick he almost certainly would have gone to New England.\n\n23. New England Patriots: Isaiah Wynn \u2014 G, Georgia\n\nThere is some debate about whether Wynn is a guard or a tackle, but the 6-foot-3 313-pounder is certainly a prospect who could mold into a quality player at either position. He is both fast and agile for a player of his size and the reason for the ambiguity about his position is because he has shown such a strong ability in pass protection to go with his top-tier run-blocking. He just has to prove he\u2019s strong enough.\n\nHow he fits: The Patriots, unsurprisingly, took a player who is pretty clearly a prospect and they will work out where he plays later. He can either add bulk and stay at guard or refine his technique and play tackle. Considering Bill Belichick is his coach, he might just be asked to do both.\n\n24. Carolina Panthers: D.J. Moore \u2014 WR, Maryland\n\nHe plays the game somewhat similar to another former Terrapin, Stefon Diggs, but Moore is slightly larger. His speed (4.42 in the 40) and his leaping ability (39.5 inches) will be huge assets, and he really blossomed in terms of production as a junior, which is a trend teams will hope continues as he makes the leap to the pros. He needs to work on routes, and to figure out how to win battles for the ball with cornerbacks, but the raw tools are there.\n\nHow he fits: Calvin Ridley would probably like to have a word with the Panthers about how he was not the first wide receiver off the board, but Moore had incredible combine numbers. If he can clean up his game and learn to make the most of his physical ability, he could be a huge complement to the Panthers\u2019 offense with Cam Newton throwing and Christian McCaffrey making plays all over the field.\n\nPhoto\n\n25. Baltimore Ravens: Hayden Hurst \u2014 TE, South Carolina\n\nA two-sport athlete, Hurst was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2012 as a pitcher. In a sign of true versatility, he was a pitcher, converted to an infielder, and now he\u2019s a first-round pick as a tight end in the N.F.L. That path puts him on the older side at 24, but he has the size and strength to succeed as a tight end, and he plays the game with an almost reckless attitude that has served him well. He may need to work on disguising his routes more, but that could come with more coaching.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow he fits: The last first-round pick of Ozzie Newsome\u2019s legendary career as an executive was a tight end, which seems just about perfect. They call him Garnet Thor, and he\u2019s taken an odd path to the N.F.L., but Hurst is not a gimmick. There is not an endorsement for a tight end much stronger than Newsome, a Hall of Fame tight end, picking you in the first round.\n\n26. Atlanta Falcons: Calvin Ridley \u2014 WR, Alabama\n\nRidley\u2019s overall college statistics did not really live up to the potential he showed as a freshman in 2015 when he had 89 receptions for 1,045 yards, but he finished his three-year career at Alabama with 19 touchdowns. While he\u2019s not exactly ideal size for a wideout (6-foot-1, 189 pounds), he has 4.43 speed in the 40 and is known for running exceptional routes. He had more drops than you would expect from a player who seems so otherwise refined in technique, but some of that might be a result of his anticipation of hits, which could become more pronounced in the N.F.L. where he will regularly face defensive backs that are far bigger and stronger than he is.\n\nHow he fits: Putting Ridley on the field with fellow Alabama alum Julio Jones could not be more perfect. Talent evaluators think the N.F.L. game will unlock the potential in Ridley, which could make this pick one of the best in terms of value in the entire draft. It is hard to think of a better role model for him than Jones, even if Ridley cannot match his new teammate\u2019s physical stature.\n\n27. Seattle Seahawks: Rashaad Penny \u2014 RB, San Diego State\n\nPenny is a fast (4.46 in the 40) back who is decently sized (5-foot-11, 220 pounds). He\u2019s an old-fashioned volume guy at running back who just tries to wear defenses down and breaks more than a few tackles. He doesn\u2019t always make the right lane decisions, though, and tacklers with better technique tended to catch him easily and bring him down.\n\nHow he fits: The Seahawks\u2019 offense was completely one-dimensional last season so they desperately needed a running back. That being said, Louisiana State\u2019s Derrius Guice and Georgia\u2019s Sony Michel would have been far more logical picks than Penny, who doesn\u2019t profile as a star at the N.F.L. level. Maybe Seattle knows something no one else knows about him.\n\n28. Pittsburgh Steelers: Terrell Edmunds \u2014 S, Virginia Tech\n\nHis brother already went with the No. 16 pick, and now it\u2019s Terrell\u2019s turn. He\u2019s far smaller than Tremaine but he can play near the line of scrimmage and deliver big hits, but is not lost in man-to-man coverage. He needs to get more consistent in tackling, and occasionally has mental lapses, but he has the talent to thrive.\n\nHow he fits: Edmunds\u2019s selection became somewhat secondary after Ryan Shazier, the Pittsburgh linebacker who endured a horrific spine injury in Week 13, walked onto the stage to introduce the pick. It was an incredible moment, with Shazier being assisted on his way out but standing on his own at the podium. Make no mistake: Edmunds is the type of player who could be a strong fit in Pittsburgh\u2019s system. This is the first time brothers have been taken in the first round in the same year.\n\nPhoto\n\n29. Jacksonville Jaguars: Taven Bryan \u2014 DT, Florida\n\nHe has a lot to learn about the position, and it\u2019s a total unknown if he can develop the instincts necessary to thrive, but he is a risk worth taking with the reward being a 6-foot-5, 291-pound hard-worker who could theoretically play anywhere on the defensive line. It is a leap of faith, though, as he has never produced much statistically and there is a chance that he is a tackle in an end\u2019s body.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow he fits: There will never be enough top-notch defenders for Jacksonville. They already had a defense that gave every opposing team nightmares and now they\u2019ve added the son of a Navy Seal who can wreak havoc in the middle of the field.\n\n30. Minnesota Vikings: Mike Hughes \u2014 CB, Central Florida\n\nHe does not have a ton of experience at the position and he does not have ideal size or speed, but Hughes has made teams interested by showing strong physicality, tracking the ball well in the air and having good hands when he has the opportunity to snatch a pass away from a receiver. He needs work as a tackler, and will get bullied by larger players, but the team the Vikings might be just as interested in him as a return specialist as they are in his ability to be a defensive back.\n\nHow he fits: He\u2019s had a whole host of off-the-field issues which caused his stock to drop. The Vikings hope they\u2019ve done their due diligence to evaluate whether his problems are behind him, but the 49ers thought they had a steal last year in Reuben Foster only for that young linebacker\u2019s troubles to continue to affect his career. If Hughes can keep himself on the field, he could be an injection of youth for a Minnesota secondary that has a ton of talent but is getting long in the tooth.\n\n31. New England Patriots: Sony Michel \u2014 RB, Georgia\n\nAnyone who watched the Rose Bowl is probably wondering why Michel was not off the board earlier. The Georgia running back absolutely torched Oklahoma. But while he\u2019s a strong runner for his size, he does not, at this point, make the sharp cuts that are expected in the N.F.L. and there is a belief that he was somewhat of a product of Georgia\u2019s excellent blocking scheme. The big play potential is there, though, so the Patriots must believe they can refine his game into something special.\n\nHow he fits: New England went with a pair of players from Georgia with their two first-round picks, and while Michel showed off some serious explosiveness in his final year with the Bulldogs, he might be a mild reach ahead of Derrius Guice. This is the Patriots, though, so they undoubtedly have a plan to unlock Michel\u2019s talents in a way that no one else has thought of yet.\n\nPhoto\n\n32. Baltimore Ravens: Lamar Jackson \u2014 QB, Louisville\n\nBaltimore executed a trade with Philadelphia so they could take Jackson. While Josh Allen may have a lot of questions about how he can succeed at quarterback in the N.F.L., Jackson faces one with even bigger consequences for player and team: Is he a quarterback?\n\nIt is interesting that his accuracy as a thrower is often seen as a non-starter despite his completion percentage in college being higher than Allen\u2019s, but it is likely a combination of that and his size (6-foot-2, 216 pounds) that has people wondering if his athleticism would translate better at wide receiver. The best bet with Jackson may be to forget the concept of position and simply consider him a football player. Someone with his speed, agility, and throwing ability could certainly help a team with a creative offensive coordinator provided he is willing to open his mind to possibilities that don\u2019t necessarily have him under center on every down.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Field Yates, the Ravens traded the Nos. 52 and 125 picks along with a 2019 second-rounder for the Nos. 32 and 132 picks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow he fits: It takes away some of the poetry of Ozzie Newsome taking a tight end with his final first-round pick, but this pick shows off Newsome\u2019s willingness to take big risks. Jackson\u2019s value to the Ravens won\u2019t be known for some time, but there\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t participate in the offense in a wildcat formation along with Joe Flacco, not unlike Colin Kaepernick did in his early days with the 49ers and Alex Smith. That could give him a soft entry as a passer so he can convince the doubters that he is what he says he is.", "title": "2018 N.F.L.

The strong consensus had been that he would go much higher, giving the Chargers a steal this low. With three A+\u2019s, two A\u2019s and just one B, his G.P.A. was a 3.98. \u201cJames is an explosive athlete who can be an enforcer in the box, cover slot receivers or play deep safety,\u201d wrote USA Today.\n\nGood grades also for these picks: Tremaine Edwards (Bills, No. 16) \u201cAn incredible player with a rare combination of size and speed,\u201d Bleacher Report.

If it helped me get locked in for later in the game, it was worth it.\u201d\n\nIn past eras, there might have been hitters particularly adept at frustrating pitchers by fouling off pitch after pitch. But those types of hitters are increasingly rare, having given way to swinging for the fences. Brett Gardner of the Yankees, who sometimes seems to hit the ball out of the catcher\u2019s glove with a late, defensive swing, might be an exception. He had a 12-pitch at-bat that helped the Yankees close out a Game 5 win in their division series against the Cleveland Indians last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know very many guys that work on a craft of spoiling a pitch,\u201d said Kinsler, a leadoff hitter for much of his career. \u201cI think it just happens.

The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men.

This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico\u2019s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico.

The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish.

This must-see retrospective \u2014 curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA\u2019s photo chief \u2014 opens with Mr. Shore\u2019s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of \u201cAmerican Surfaces\u201d and the steely precision of \u201cUncommon Places\u201d \u2014 landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA\u2019s smudged iPads.

More devout than Vel\u00e1zquez, more shadowy than Murillo, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n was little known outside Spain until the mid-19th century, when Manet and his friends found the seeds of modernism in his frisky, open brushwork and streamlined form. The Frick is now showing a baker\u2019s dozen of the Spaniard\u2019s biblical portraits, of an aged, hunched Jacob and the sons who would become the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with most of the paintings on loan from a castle that until recently belonged to the Church of England. The gents pose in a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob\u2019s foretelling of their destinies in Genesis. Two are especially compelling: Judah, child No. 4, decked out in a fur-trimmed coat and vamping alongside a kindly lion, and Joseph, who forgoes the Technicolor dreamcoat for a blue sash and a belt stitched with gold.

This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works \u2014 a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris\u2019s \u201cMan at the Caf\u00e9\u201d (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration.

These massive wooden crests \u2014 in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows \u2014 served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met\u2019s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns.

Henson began presenting the short TV program \u201cSam and Friends\u201d before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother\u2019s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends.

It\u2019s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar\u2019s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and \u201980s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century.

It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan\u2019s most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or \u201cthe beauty of tight binding.\u201d Given the venue, it\u2019s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki\u2019s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral.

Zoe Leonard\u2019s reverberant retrospective does. Physically ultra-austere, all white walls with a fiercely edited selection of objects \u2014 photographs of clouds taken from airplane windows; a mural collaged from vintage postcards; a scattering of empty fruit skins, each stitched closed with needle and thread \u2014 it\u2019s an extended essay about travel, time passing, political passion and the ineffable daily beauty of the world.

Taking a second run at the splashy theme-show extravaganza, the Met Breuer has greater success. This one is certainly more coherent since it centers entirely on the body and its role in art, science, religion and entertainment. It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist\u2019s dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return any time soon.

The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person\u2019s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring.

All of this photographer\u2019s strengths are on view in this deftly chosen and admirably displayed exhibition that covers most of her 40-plus-year career. The 108 images here (47 of which have never been exhibited before) provide a provocative tour through Ms. Mann\u2019s accomplishments and serve as a record of exploration \u2014 into the past, into this country\u2019s and photography\u2019s history, stamped with a powerful vision.

Fans of Latin American architecture are overly besotted with the modernist era: Luis Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s color-saturated houses in Mexico City, Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s cutting-edge presidential palace in Bras\u00edlia. But this eye-opening show turns the clock back 100 years and shows how six cities \u2014 Buenos Aires; Havana; Lima, Peru; Mexico City; Rio de Janeiro; and Santiago, Chile \u2014 used architecture and urban design to express new national ambitions. Vintage photographs disclose how in Mexico\u2019s sprawling capital its new republican government erected statues of Cuauht\u00e9moc, the last Aztec emperor, while Argentina plowed out lordly avenues in imitation of Haussmann-era Paris. All these cities had keen architectural ambitions, though if you have to pick the most sophisticated, it\u2019s Rio in a landslide. Stare at Marc Ferrez\u2019s jaw-dropping 1895 panoramic photograph of the erstwhile Brazilian capital, with Sugarloaf Mountain looming over Botafogo and Flamengo, and book the next flight.

This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico\u2019s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

Featuring stark black-and-white photographs of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as faded ephemera that memorialized them, this exhibition reveals the various ways in which the lives of these two influential figures were juxtaposed. It also traces the circuitous routes that belatedly pointed Kennedy toward the more incendiary goals King set first regarding civil rights, poverty and the Vietnam War. (Sam Roberts)\n\n212-873-3400, nyhistory.org\n\n\u2018ALBERTO SAVINIO\u2019 at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-30s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment.

After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike \u2014 Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective \u2014 curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA\u2019s photo chief \u2014 opens with Mr. Shore\u2019s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of \u201cAmerican Surfaces\u201d and the steely precision of \u201cUncommon Places\u201d \u2014 landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA\u2019s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)\n\n212-708-9400, moma.org\n\n\u20182018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE\u2019 at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum\u2019s fourth triennial exhibition, \u201cSongs for Sabotage,\u201d is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it\u2019s also the best looking. There\u2019s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it\u2019s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art \u2014 easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects \u2014 that art fairs suck up.

This well-done survey begins with the American Regionalist\u2019s little-known efforts as an Arts and Crafts designer and touches just about every base. It includes his mural studies, book illustrations and most of his best-known paintings \u2014 including \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d and \u201cThe Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.\u201d Best of all are Wood\u2019s smooth undulant landscapes with their plowmen and spongy trees and infectious serenity.

Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its usefulness.

This is the first museum survey of the Vietnam-born Danish artist, who draws his art from his life and the history he has lived through, recycling family mementos, found letters and artifacts, as well as random materials, into a very spare, poetic and astute study of power, colonialism, and the lives of refugees and of objects. The Guggenheim\u2019s rotunda looks nearly empty at times, and there are lots of labels to read, but it is ultimately worth it.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil\u2019s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or \u201ccannibalism.\u201d Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila\u2019s three most important paintings, including the classic \u201cAbaporu\u201d (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

An exhibition in the form of a chokehold, the third of the Neue Galerie\u2019s recent shows on art and German politics pushes into the years of dictatorship, with paintings, drawings and photographs by artists deemed \u201cdegenerate\u201d by the Nazis \u2014 as well as by those who joined the party or who thought they could shut out the catastrophe. (You will know the dissidents, like Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka; the fascists and sellouts are less known.) Gazing at ornery still lifes of dolls and dead flowers, or dreamy landscapes in imitation of an earlier German Romanticism, you may ask to what degree artists are responsible for the times in which they work. But then you see \u201cSelf-Portrait in the Camp,\u201d by the Jewish German painter Felix Nussbaum \u2014 made between his escape from a French internment camp and his deportation to Auschwitz \u2014 and you know that there can be no pardon.

The Met\u2019s exhibition of the nation\u2019s first major landscape artist and progenitor of what would be called the Hudson River School is gorgeous, politically right for right now and a lesson in the mutability of art history. Politically, Cole\u2019s art is conservative, but it\u2019s also work that challenges and complicates that term. And this show is precisely about complication. Just as Cole is most realistically and revealingly seen and judged against the background of his time, so is the exhibition, coming as it does in this confounding MAGA moment.

Mount Kumgang, or the \u201cDiamond Mountain,\u201d lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang\u2019s Olympic Stadium, but it\u2019s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries\u2019 worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics.

This is the first museum survey of the Vietnam-born Danish artist, who draws his art from his life and the history he has lived through, recycling family mementos, found letters and artifacts, as well as random materials, into a very spare, poetic and astute study of power, colonialism, and the lives of refugees and of objects. The Guggenheim\u2019s rotunda looks nearly empty at times, and there are lots of labels to read, but it is ultimately worth it.

This well-done survey begins with the American Regionalist\u2019s little-known efforts as an Arts and Crafts designer and touches just about every base. It includes his mural studies, book illustrations and most of his best-known paintings \u2014 including \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d and \u201cThe Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.\u201d Best of all are Wood\u2019s smooth undulant landscapes with their plowmen and spongy trees and infectious serenity.

This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works \u2014 a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris\u2019s \u201cMan at the Caf\u00e9\u201d (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration.

Micro and macro collide to visceral, even wondrous effect in these large, astoundingly detailed photographs of European cathedrals and churches, most dating from the 11th to the 14th centuries. Stitched together from hundreds of small digital images, the photographs ignore the laws of perspectival recession.

In contrast to the PBS series \u201cThe Vietnam War,\u201d this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there\u2019s graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters.

More devout than Vel\u00e1zquez, more shadowy than Murillo, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n was little known outside Spain until the mid-19th century, when Manet and his friends found the seeds of modernism in his frisky, open brushwork and streamlined form. The Frick is now showing a baker\u2019s dozen of the Spaniard\u2019s biblical portraits, of an aged, hunched Jacob and the sons who would become the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with most of the paintings on loan from a castle that until recently belonged to the Church of England. The gents pose in a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob\u2019s foretelling of their destinies in Genesis. Two are especially compelling: Judah, child No. 4, decked out in a fur-trimmed coat and vamping alongside a kindly lion, and Joseph, who forgoes the Technicolor dreamcoat for a blue sash and a belt stitched with gold.

Stillwell.\n\nThe government\u2019s case against the defendants \u2014 presented at a spellbinding three-week federal trial \u2014 was built on the testimony of Paul Le Roux, a murderous kingpin who trafficked in guns, drugs and gold, and employed a private army of mercenaries on four continents to protect his assets and kill on his behalf. After Mr. Le Roux, 45, was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration in Liberia in late 2012, he began to cooperate with the government as they rounded up and prosecuted the members of his sprawling organization, in an effort to reduce a possible life sentence.\n\nMr. Hunter, a former United States Army sergeant with Special Forces training, was among the first to be caught. In 2013, Mr. Le Roux helped the D.E.A. set up a sting operation in Phuket, Thailand, during which they arrested Mr. Hunter, 52, for conspiring to kill one of their agents and a federal informant. Because the charges in that case included a plot to bring cocaine to New York, it was handled by prosecutors in Manhattan, who are also handling the murder in the Philippines, on the grounds it evolved from the same investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the case that ended on Wednesday, Mr. Le Roux recounted that in early 2012, just before he was captured, he asked Mr. Hunter \u2014 his chief of security \u2014 to arrange the murder of Catherine Lee, a real estate agent who Mr. Le Roux suspected had been stealing from him. Mr. Hunter, he recalled, then reached out to Mr. Samia, a onetime Army sniper, and Mr. Stillwell, a firearms instructor, both of whom lived in the small town of Roxboro, N.C. Flight records showed that Mr. Samia, 43, and Mr. Stillwell, 50, traveled to Manila weeks later.

But that\u2019s the goal of Casa Fernando Pessoa, a museum and cultural center in the residential Campo de Ourique neighborhood. Situated in the final home of the bespectacled author, the site is a treasure trove of Pessoa\u2019s early 20th-century works \u2014 most published posthumously \u2014 including poems written under three well-developed heteronyms. Through interactive exhibits, engage with the poet\u2019s language: \u201cI\u2019m beginning to know myself. I don\u2019t exist.\u201d There\u2019s also a collection of portraits of Pessoa \u2014 fittingly, in diverse styles \u2014 including paintings by J\u00falio Pomar.

Beyond the picture-perfect downtown waterfront, British Columbia\u2019s capital is an exhilarating blend of cultures, from Canadian and First Nations to Chinese and European (especially British). There are three universities, thriving arts and cultural institutions, significant historic preservation, a celebrated local food scene and Canada\u2019s mildest climate: That means year-round forest visits, biking and golf; gardens galore (daffodils in February); even beehives downtown (at the Fairmont Empress hotel; atop the Harbour Air floating terminal). There is wildness too: \u201cbear jams\u201d disrupting traffic, cougar sightings and soaring eagles, towering ancient trees, log-strewn beaches and distant snowy peaks.\n\nFriday\n\n1) 3 p.m. EARLY DAYS\n\nThe blocks north of the Empress and west of Douglas Street, including Chinatown, comprise the Old Town. Start at Bastion Square and Wharf Street, overlooking the harbor, where James Douglas founded Fort Victoria in 1843 as an outpost of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. This area became the heart of commerce, industry and government, swelling in size after the 1858 Fraser Gold Rush drew thousands of immigrants. Next to the Old Victoria Customs House is a grassy overlook with a display telling the history of British settlement and the indigenous Lekwungen people. Check out the lively Bastion Square pedestrian area of shops, restaurants and cafes, music and markets; then, on Government Street, browse through Munro\u2019s Books, situated in a century-old bank, and founded in 1963 by the Nobel Prize-winning Canadian writer Alice Munro and her then-husband. Detour through Trounce Alley (note the 125-year-old gaslights), then walk east on Fort Street to La Taqueria to snack on Mexican tacos amid festive music and colorful tiles. A juicy carnitas taco with pickled red onions and salsa is 3 Canadian dollars, or about $2.35, and a Baja fish taco with cabbage, salsa and chipotle mayonnaise is 6 dollars; wash it down with Mexican fruit soda or local beer.", "title": "36 Hours in Victoria, British Columbia", "authors": []}

But when she graduated and enrolled in a local community college, she didn\u2019t stay in touch.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pantaleo, with two more years of high school ahead of him, was heartsick but not the moping type. Instead of pining for Ms. Jewell or settling into a relationship with another girl, he immersed himself in sports. In 1985, the year he graduated, he won a wrestling scholarship to the University of Michigan. By 1987, he had won titles including a world freestyle championship. In 1992, two years after he graduated college and the same year he was ranked No. 1 in the world in his weight class, he earned a spot as an alternate on the United States Olympic wrestling team. And so his love life was stalled.\n\nMs. Jewell\u2019s love life, on the other hand, was taking flight. After plunging into a career in the health industry in the mid-1980s and landing a job as a regional supervisor for Jenny Craig in Michigan in the \u201990s, she was ready to settle down. In 1998, she got engaged to the man she would marry the next year.\n\nMr. Pantaleo, by then a Grosse Pointe, Mich., high school teacher with a stint as a Michigan State University wrestling coach behind him, was not spared Ms. Jewell\u2019s happy news.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is the funny part,\u201d Mr. Pantaleo said. \u201cI left East Lansing, where I was a coach, and moved back to the Detroit area where Diana was in 1997 to teach. In the spring of 1998, I finally reconnected with her.\u201d By chance, the gym he joined, in Clinton Township, Mich., was in the same strip mall as Ms. Jewell\u2019s Jenny Craig office. Mr. Pantaleo was working out when he bumped into Ms. Jewell, also a gym member.\n\n\u201cHer personality, her smile, the twinkle in her eye, the way she says my name \u2014 all of that God-given stuff was still there, she hadn\u2019t changed a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was still captivated. I had butterflies when I saw her. I was thinking, maybe I finally have a shot with Diana.\u201d The next day, he sent her flowers.\n\nMs. Jewell, still as friendly as in high school, agreed to go rollerblading with Mr. Pantaleo a few weeks after the chance gym meeting. In her helmet and kneepads, she told him about her new boyfriend, who would become her fianc\u00e9 later that year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

You just kind of go, Oh, I guess I missed my shot, and try to regroup.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Jewell moved to Charlotte, near Mr. Pantaleo\u2019s former job in East Lansing, with her husband the next year. Mr. Pantaleo continued teaching until 2009, when an assistant wrestling coaching job at Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Va., opened. His nephew was on the team.\n\nLiberty, founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, is a Christian university. Mr. Pantaleo was not the religious type when he started out there. \u201cI had a friend who was always trying to get me to go to church. I would say, I\u2019m not going into any church. My feet will burn up!\u201d he said. But the job at Liberty, he said, connected him with his spiritual side. In 2011, when the college dropped its N.C.A.A. Division I wrestling program, he returned to Michigan a devout Christian.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Jewell, struggling in her marriage by then, was also finding comfort in her faith. At the 2011 get-together with high school friends that reunited them for the second time since high school, they bonded over talk about God. Still, Mr. Pantaleo\u2019s romantic timing was off. Ms. Jewell\u2019s divorce was not final until 2016. Both were morally opposed to dating until she was legally single.\n\n\u201cI think the divorce had already happened psychologically when Joe came back into her life,\u201d said Robin Crouch, Ms. Jewell\u2019s pastor at First Baptist Church in Charlotte. \u201cBut she knew she had to set boundaries if she wanted to look back and say, \u2018What I did was right for Lacy and for my faith.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Pantaleo wouldn\u2019t have his first kiss with Ms. Jewell until Jan. 27, 2017. When it finally came, during a dance around the living room he now shares with Ms. Jewell in Charlotte, he had a song cued: the Jackson Five\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be There.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Crouch, who had encouraged that first kiss, anticipated Mr. Pantaleo\u2019s herculean patience. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of person who sets goals and goes after them,\u201d Mr. Crouch said. \u201cHe brought the same intensity he showed in his athletic career, when he was a champion, to his relationship with Diana. He knew he couldn\u2019t get there overnight.\u201d\n\nA little less than a year after that long-awaited kiss, on Jan. 5, 2018, Mr. Pantaleo, now the director of marketing at the human resources firm America\u2019s Back Office in Sterling Heights, Mich., asked Ms. Jewell and Lacy to take a day trip with him to Roseville.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018We should take Lacy by the school and show her where we met,\u2019\u201d he said. Ms. Jewell needed convincing; she wasn\u2019t sure her daughter would be interested. Lacy, though, was on board.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pantaleo planned to propose and had armed himself with a 1.8 carat diamond solitaire bought at a Lansing jewelry shop. He enlisted Lacy to keep his secret days earlier.\n\nIn Roseville, Mr. Pantaleo arranged for a friend who works for the school district to let them in since school was closed for holiday break. Ms. Jewell and Lacy followed Mr. Pantaleo to the spot where he dropped his books all those years ago.\n\n\u201cHe got down on one knee and said, Will you be my wife?\u201d Ms. Jewell said. \u201cI said yes, forever.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, on Vedado Way Beach in Naples, Fla., Mr. Pantaleo, wearing a white button-down shirt and khakis, finally married Ms. Jewell, barefoot and in an ivory French lace dress by Grace Loves Lace, before a circle of only six guests. Lacy was maid of honor; Mr. Pantaleo\u2019s brother Dan Pantaleo was best man. Mr. Crouch, now retired and living in West Virginia, officiated.\n\nAs Mr. Pantaleo watched Ms. Jewell walk toward him over a path in the sand laid with rose petals, he was in tears. \u201cMy heart is so happy today,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a short ceremony, Mr. Crouch reflected on the 36-year odyssey that delivered Ms. Jewell to Mr. Pantaleo. \u201cThey just wanted to do it right. And they have,\u201d he said.\n\nPost-wedding, Lacy expressed her happiness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for a better person in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nMonths earlier, she had summed up the couple\u2019s long but triumphant journey in a picture posted on Instagram: \u201cThirty-six years later, it IS possible to get out of the friend zone, y\u2019all,\u201d she wrote.", "title": "36 Years Later, He\u2019s Out of the Friend Zone", "authors": ["Tammy La Gorce"]}

The winner will receive 25,000 pounds, or almost $35,000, and the other nominees will each receive \u00a35,000.\n\nThe Turner Prize, founded in 1984, could be likened to the Oscar of the art world, and it can give a major boost to an artist\u2019s career.

Altman, M.D. joined The New York Times science news staff in 1969, and is believed to be the first licensed physician to work as a daily newspaper reporter.\n\nNew York and the rest of the world, including The New York Times, were ill-prepared for the arrival and spread of a new disease (later named AIDS) when the first cases were recognized among gay men in 1981. For three years, while fear tore through the gay community, the world\u2019s most sophisticated laboratories could not identify the cause. Experts debated various candidates (among them: toxins, drugs, sperm in the bowel) until the discovery of the retrovirus H.I.V. Even after epidemiologists documented that the virus spread only through sexual contact, childbirth or injections of contaminated drugs and blood, disbelievers shunned public restrooms and restaurants for fear that it could be passed through food and flatware. Many hospital workers avoided AIDS patients and left trays by the door where occupants were too weak to pick them up. Some doctors refused to treat AIDS patients.\n\nAt the time, medicine was celebrating the eradication of a naturally occurring disease (smallpox) from the world for the first time and installing the first artificial hearts in humans. Earlier, I had written about the discoveries of the Ebola and Lassa fever viruses and the Legionnaire\u2019s disease bacterium, as well as the ways in which health workers stopped outbreaks of these infections. Few thought \u2014 and certainly no one I know went on record to predict \u2014 that AIDS would become one of the worst pandemics in history, infecting an estimated 76 million people and killing 35 million of them.\n\nAt Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, where, in the late 1970s, I was an attending physician in addition to working as a reporter at The Times, I saw a small number of young patients with unusual infections. Others had enlarged lymph nodes throughout their body. Many had been injection drug users. These cases baffled the medical staff.\n\nMy plans to write about the mysterious ailment before my first article about AIDS appeared on July 3, 1981 were thwarted by assigned coverage of the attempted assassinations of President Reagan and Pope John Paul II and by two broken elbows, souvenirs of an accident in Italy. My initial article focused on 41 cases of a rare cancer, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, in homosexual men (The Times did not allow people to be described as \u201cgay\u201d at that time) who also had seriously abnormal immune systems. But whether these immune issues were the cause of, or resulted from, their ailment was unknown. Many in the gay community ridiculed the article as a needless scare. Scientists who went on to become international leaders in battling AIDS considered this collection of cases to be an oddity, until a broader picture emerged in the advancing months and years. In 1985, I traveled through Africa to report that in many sub-Saharan countries, AIDS infected nearly as many women as men through heterosexual intercourse. I went on to write several hundred articles about scientific discoveries of the virus, its uncanny ability to trick the immune system and the development of drugs that now make AIDS a chronic disease. Despite these and other advances, it is still transmitted in this country and the world.\n\n\u201cRare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals,\u201d by Lawrence K.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "In Finland, for example, the Northern lapwing and Eurasian curlew have usually built their ground nests on barley fields after farmers have sown their crops in the spring. But as temperatures have risen, the birds are now increasingly laying their eggs before the farmers get to the fields, which means their well-concealed nests are more likely to get destroyed by tractors and other machinery.\n\nLooking at 38 years of data, researchers found that farmers in Finland are now sowing their fields a week earlier in response to warmer temperatures, but the birds are laying their eggs two to three weeks earlier. \u201cThis has created a phenological mismatch,\u201d said Mr. Santangeli, the lead author of the study. \u201cThe response we\u2019ll see is declines of these birds.\u201d\n\nCaribou show up late for lunch\n\nCaribou in western Greenland follow a strict seasonal diet. In the winter, they eat lichen along the coast. In the spring and summer, they venture inland to give birth to their calves and eat the Arctic plants that grow there.\n\nAs Greenland has warmed up and sea ice has declined, however, those inland Arctic plants have been emerging earlier \u2014 with some plant species now greening 26 days earlier than they did a decade ago. But the caribou have not shifted their migration as quickly. And scientists have documented a troubling trend in the region: More caribou calves appear to be dying early in years when the spring plant growth preceded the caribou\u2019s calving season.\n\nWhile that study only found a correlation between warmer temperatures and caribou calf deaths, \u201c it\u2019s consistent with the idea that mismatch is disadvantageous,\u201d said Eric Post, an ecology professor at the University of California, Davis. When Arctic plants green up earlier, they may become tougher and less nutritious by the time the caribou get there and start eating them.\n\nWhy don\u2019t the caribou speed up their migration? One possibility is that their reproductive cycles respond most strongly to seasonal signals like the length of the day, whereas plants respond more strongly to local temperatures, which are rising.\n\nIn theory, if given enough time, the caribou might eventually adjust as natural selection takes its course and favors individuals that calve earlier. But with the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the globe, Dr. Post said, \u201cthe question is whether things are changing too fast for evolution to matter.\u201d", "title": "5 Plants and Animals Utterly Confused by Climate Change", "authors": []}

For example, when discussing Mr. Steele, the Republican report uses suspicious terms, like saying he \u201cclaimed\u201d to have obtained his allegations from \u201cpurported\u201d high-level Russian sources. But when discussing testimony by witnesses who explained away various meetings with Russians, the report instead presents what they said with neutral terms, like \u201cstated,\u201d or uses words connoting the idea that they were acknowledging a truth.\n\nOne example of that concerns testimony by Rob Goldstone, who helped set up the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and Russians. He wrote in an email to Donald Trump Jr. that the visitors wanted to provide damaging information about Mrs. Clinton that was \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d But Mr. Goldstone later told Congress that he had no evidence supporting that statement, saying he had embellished his email with inaccurate information to get a response. The report says Mr. Goldstone \u201cadmitted\u201d this exonerating account.\n\nAn Attack on Leaks, and James Clapper\n\nThe Republican report is scathing about leaks to the news media that have brought to light various information about Trump-Russia contacts. Against that backdrop, it declares that James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, gave \u201cinconsistent testimony\u201d about his discussions of the so-called Steele dossier with Jake Tapper, the CNN anchor. (Many news outlets had copies of the dossier but did not report on its existence because they were unable to verify its contents. But in January 2017, CNN reported that intelligence officials had briefed Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, about the dossier, and BuzzFeed published it shortly after.)\n\nThe Republican report said that Mr. Clapper initially denied discussing the dossier with journalists but subsequently \u201cacknowledged\u201d having discussed it with Mr. Tapper and \u201cadmitted\u201d possibly talking about it with other reporters, too. The Democratic report portrays this passage as written to \u201csmear\u201d Mr. Clapper with a \u201cdark insinuation,\u201d saying it promotes a \u201cnarrative that former Obama administration officials, such as Clapper, leaked classified or sensitive information to the media.\u201d The Democratic report notes that the dossier was not classified.\n\nIt also provides an excerpt from a transcript of Mr. Clapper\u2019s testimony. It shows that he was asked whether he had discussed the dossier or intelligence related to Russia with journalists and replied \u201cno.\u201d But then, asked whether he confirmed or corroborated the dossier\u2019s contents to Mr. Tapper, Mr. Clapper acknowledged discussing the dossier with Mr. Tapper but said that was \u201cwhen it was out all over the place.\u201d The transcript is ambiguous about whether that meant they discussed it before or after CNN reported the briefing.", "title": "5 Takeaways From the House Report on Russian Election Meddling", "authors": []}

Well-maintained and well-lit roads are preferable to smaller ones, and have better access for emergency medical services should they be necessary. Ask if the driver has been behind the wheel for more than eight hours and if there is backup for long journeys. Most bus and tour companies that operate aboveboard should be willing to have this conversation with you, and those that aren\u2019t should arouse your suspicion. If you have doubts, consider taking a train or hiring a private car service with a local driver who is familiar with the region.\n\nAvoid Night Travel\n\nOvernight buses are a perennial favorite of budget-minded travelers who want to save on hotel stays. In some cases that may be true, but in many countries, particularly in rural areas, taking a bus at night or in early dawn hours is strongly discouraged because drivers often turn off their headlights; they falsely believe it saves the vehicle\u2019s batteries. The danger is exacerbated when roads are in bad condition, where visibility is poor, and in mountain areas with narrow, winding roads.\n\nIn countries with higher road safety standards and bus companies that operate more transparently, overnight bus trips may be an affordable and comfortable option, but it\u2019s critical to do your homework before booking one.\n\nSpot Red Flags Before You Depart\n\nBottom line, if something seems amiss, speak up. If a driver is being reckless or speeding, politely ask that he or she slow down. Be assertive. If the situation does not improve or if the driver seems impaired or overly fatigued, get off the bus as soon as possible. If you don\u2019t speak the language, ask a local to assist.\n\nAvoid buses in poor condition or that are crowded and top-heavy, which can offset the center of gravity. Check if the bus\u2019s tires are bald or low on air, or if the name of the company on the bus is unclear.

Is yours? Here\u2019s an opportunity to find out: Audience members sign up as they would at an open mike to offer riffs of their own as they watch clips from bad movies.

Yang recently published a book about his experiences coming of age as an immigrant in California. His family moved to the United States from Hong Kong when Mr. Yang was 13.

Unsurprisingly, the comedian Mike Birbiglia spends a lot of time around other comedians, whether it\u2019s backstage before shows or afterward at the bar. One thing he came to realize about comedians as a result is that while his comedy counterparts obviously bring the jokes while onstage, offstage they tell longer real-life tales that are just as entertaining. For this event, Mr. Birbiglia welcomes the effortlessly hilarious comedians Chris Laker and Jacqueline Novak to tell, as it were, their whole stories.\n\n718-638-4400, unionhallny.com", "title": "6 Comedy Shows to Catch in NYC This Weekend", "authors": ["Kasia Pilat"]}

In it, she lives out her dreams of being a matchmaker, \u00e0 la Patti Stanger (and persistent, impatient moms everywhere), and sets up dates between people who fill out a Google form with details like what they\u2019re looking for and descriptions of themselves.

He remained firmly in power thanks to the support of Russia and Iran.\n\nMr. Assad has essentially been under siege since the Syrian civil war began more than seven years ago. In that time, he has dealt with the war, airstrikes, sanctions, Islamic State militants, a variety of rebel groups and a crumbling economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Syrian state news media reported that many of the missiles had been intercepted, the Syrian presidency\u2019s Twitter account posted a video that appeared to show Mr. Assad showing up for just another day at the office.\n\nThe events depicted could not be independently verified.\n\nCapitol Hill remained divided.\n\nThe reaction in Washington was divided along party lines, with the strikes bringing praise from Republicans and criticism from Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.\n\n\u201cThe Butcher of Damascus learned two lessons tonight the hard way,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. \u201cWeapons of mass destruction won\u2019t create a military advantage once the United States is done with you and Russia cannot protect its clients from the United States.\u201d\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, complained that Mr. Trump had not sought permission from Congress.

(At the meeting, the Security Council later rejected a Russian resolution condemning the missile strikes.) But the speed and the tone of the Russian reaction on Saturday, stressing that the attack had not resulted in a direct confrontation and was rather limited, suggested almost relief on the part of the Kremlin.\n\nAccording to Russian state news media, President Vladimir V. Putin condemned the missile strikes as an \u201cact of aggression against a sovereign state\u201d and against the United Nations Charter.\n\nGen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff for the armed forces, had warned that Russia would \u201ctake retaliatory measures,\u201d but he included an important caveat: Russia would attack missiles and the platforms from which they were launched only in the event that Russian military personnel were placed in danger.\n\nThe Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, stated that it would discuss the airstrikes \u201cnext week.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMay avoided a conflict at home.\n\nMrs. May has said she believed there was a need to send a strong message about the use of chemical weapons, but she also had compelling diplomatic and political reasons to support the United States \u2014 and to carry out the strikes as soon as possible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne imperative was the desire to reciprocate the support London has received from the United States in the dispute with Russia over the poisoning of a former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia S. Skripal, on British soil.\n\nMrs. May, who made an explicit connection between the airstrikes in Syria and the poisoning of the Skripals, benefited from the timing of the airstrikes, two days before lawmakers were to return from vacation. While not obligated to consult Parliament, she may have felt constrained to do so and could easily have lost a vote on a strike, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2013.\n\nBritain also wants to prove its use as an ally to Mr. Trump at a time when its international influence is under question because of its withdrawal from the European Union, and when it hopes to strengthen trade ties with the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor France, a red line was crossed.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had prepared his nation for this moment: He had discussed the possibility of airstrikes and made clear early in his presidency that the use of chemical weapons was a red line.\n\nWhile pressing for a military response to the use of chemical weapons, Mr. Macron has also said he wants to work on a peace deal for the region, creating a dual-pronged strategy that has support in France. Mr. Macron has cultivated a closer relationship with Mr. Trump than other Western leaders, but he has also reached out to Mr. Putin.\n\nHe will visit both presidents in the coming weeks: Mr. Trump at the end of April and Mr. Putin in May.", "title": "7 Takeaways From the Airstrikes on Syria", "authors": ["Michael Wolgelenter"]}

Where in New York City can you find more than 30,000 loose Lego bricks just waiting to be played with? (Yes, that means other than under your own sofa cushions, bed covers and carpets.) The answer is Scandinavia House, the center for Nordic culture, which is honoring the 60th anniversary of this signature Danish invention with the exhibition \u201cLego Bricks: A Celebration!\u201d Opening on Saturday with snacks, live music and other free festivities, it features thousands of the building pieces within an interactive play zone. It also details the Lego Group\u2019s history: The name comes from the first two letters of each of the words in the Danish phrase \u201clege godt,\u201d which means \u201cplay well.\u201d On view through Aug. 4 and accompanied by a series of children\u2019s workshops, the exhibition demonstrates what a talented grown-up can do with Lego, too: The artist Sean Kenney has created mosaics, busts, models of plants, reproductions of architectural landmarks and even larger-than-life sculptures.\n\n212-779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org\n\nOPEN STUDIO FOR \u2018NICK MAUSS: TRANSMISSIONS\u2019 at the Whitney Museum of American Art (April 28, 10:30 a.m.-3 p.m.). Ballet is often much more than movement: It can also incorporate costume design, visual art, acting and storytelling, disciplines that the artist Nick Mauss explores in \u201cTransmissions,\u201d his installation at the Whitney. In this program, young visitors can investigate them, too. (A parental advisory: The exhibition, on a different floor from the open studio, includes some nude photographs.) Alexandra Albrecht, a member of Mr. Mauss\u2019s rotating cast of performers \u2014 the exhibition features live dances daily \u2014 will appear at the open studio from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., showing participants how to shape their bodies to reflect personas.

To many people, polar bears, which inhabit the Arctic Circle, are already pretty far up. But in this production, they go way, way up \u2014 into the atmosphere. Created and performed by Eilidh MacAskill and Fiona Manson and presented by the London-based Unicorn Theater, this Queens show focuses on the title characters\u2019 comic efforts to retrieve a balloon, which include energetic leaps, tree climbing and ultimately a rocket launch. Although a preshow movement-and-music workshop with the cast, at 12:30 p.m., has very few available spaces, plenty of seats remain for the performance, a wordless 50-minute journey that is geared to preschool travelers.\n\n718-463-7700, ext. 222; flushingtownhall.org\n\n", "title": "7 Things to Do With Your Kids in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

Imagine getting professional instruction in dancing the first movement of a Jerome Robbins ballet \u2014 no tuition, audition or previous experience required. That\u2019s the opportunity the library will present to children on Friday as part of a yearlong series of events commemorating Robbins\u2019s 100th birthday. Recommended for dance fans 5 and older, the program will center on \u201cGlass Pieces,\u201d a ballet that was choreographed to music by Philip Glass and captures the breakneck pace and fierce purpose of pedestrians on New York streets. (Robbins was a city native.) An evocative picture book \u2014 Salvatore Rubbino\u2019s \u201cA Walk in New York\u201d \u2014 will be read to the young participants, who will then learn the dance from Deborah Lohse, a choreographer and performance artist. Each child will leave with not only the memory of the steps, but also a free copy of the book. (Space is limited, and registration is required.)\n\n212-621-0208, nypl.org/events\n\nCATSBURY PARK CAT CONVENTION at Convention Hall and the Paramount Theater, Asbury Park, N.J. (April 7-8, 11 a.m.-7 p.m.). This isn\u2019t the Asbury Park that Bruce Springsteen immortalized \u2014 he didn\u2019t add meows to any of his tracks \u2014 but this temporary addition to the boardwalk still promises to be worth a road trip. With proceeds benefiting Catsbury Park, a local cat cafe and rescue organization, this festival will host appearances by celebrity animals like Lil Bub and Nala, as well as seminars on cat care and a D.J. providing feline-themed tunes. Children may especially enjoy attractions like cat trivia, cat bingo, a cat costume competition and a yoga session with cats.\n\ncatsburyconvention.com\n\nDISCOVER OPERA! \u2018OPERAPUNZEL\u2019 AND \u2018THE MAGIC FLUTE\u2019 at the Manhattan School of Music (April 8, 2:30 p.m.; April 9, 6:30 p.m.). Rapunzel won\u2019t be alone in letting down her hair: Nothing is staid or formulaic during these free concert performances from the Manhattan School of Music\u2019s outreach program. Intended to introduce children to opera, the double bill leads off with \u201cOperapunzel.\u201d The hourlong work by Mark Janas (and the cast) sets \u201cRapunzel\u201d in a 1960s hair salon and explains the art form\u2019s terms and elements. It will be followed by a 45-minute adaptation of Mozart\u2019s fanciful \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d (If your family isn\u2019t ready for an opera doubleheader, the school will also offer a relaxed, lower-volume \u201cOperapunzel,\u201d geared toward children on the autism spectrum or with special needs, on Sunday at 11:30 a.m.)\n\n917-493-4428, msmnyc.edu/performances\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018THE LITTLE BLACK FISH\u2019 at Triskelion Arts (through April 8). This children\u2019s tale from the 1960s by the Iranian writer Samad Behrangi doesn\u2019t sound particularly subversive: Its title character longs to explore the world beyond his small pond and see what influence he can have on others. Nevertheless, the story\u2019s nonconformist theme was strong enough to cause Iran\u2019s prerevolutionary government to ban the work. But while Mr. Behrangi\u2019s career was brief, his fiction has lived on, and now Maaa Theater Company has adapted \u201cThe Little Black Fish\u201d for the stage. Combining music, narration, physical theater and video, this Brooklyn production illuminates an adventure in which a tiny hero has a huge impact.\n\n571-212-7796, blackfish.bpt.me", "title": "7 Things to Do With Your Kids in NYC This Weekend", "authors": ["Laurel Graeber"]}

The interactive digital stories published by KaZoom Kids Books have heroes and heroines unlike those in most children\u2019s works: They\u2019re black and Latino. Now the Harlem School of the Arts is bringing three of these tales to the stage in a theater festival starring its students and some of their parents. The productions are adaptations of \u201cTaking the E Train\u201d and \u201cEverybody Loves Cake,\u201d stories about a Latino family by Lapacazo Sandoval, and \u201cAlyssa Marissa and Her Magical Hair,\u201d by Angela Williams, which follows an African-American second grader as she learns to love her unruly curls.

For centuries, young people have been agents of change, and PEN America, the literary organization promoting freedom of expression, is actively encouraging them. This year, its PEN World Voices Festival, whose theme is \u201cResist and Reimagine,\u201d is featuring Next Generation Now, a new series of more than a dozen programs aimed at aspiring writers and political advocates from preschool through high school. Little Activists: A Workshop and a Mini-March, at 3:30 p.m. at Town Stages, invites children in the second and third grades and younger to meet Leila Sales, author of \u201cThe Little Book of Little Activists,\u201d and some of the children she has written about. Family Affair: Color Me Abstract, from 1 to 4:30 p.m. at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, offers art-making and writing workshops for ages 4 through 12 led by the authors Tony Medina and Liza Jessie Peterson. These events are free with R.S.V.P.; some of the others require tickets.

How do you explain the Holocaust to children? The short film \u201cThe Number on Great-Grandpa\u2019s Arm\u201d offers a simple answer: Let a child do it. Presented by HBO and the museum, the documentary captures the tender relationship between Elliott Saiontz, 10, and his 90-year-old great-grandfather, Jack Feldman, a survivor of Auschwitz. Elliott provides much of the narration in the 19-minute movie, which juxtaposes archival photographs and film clips with Mr. Feldman\u2019s soft-spoken recollections and the hand-painted animation of Jeff Scher, which, though haunting, is less grim than historical footage. Produced and directed by Amy Schatz, the film is at the heart of this museum installation. Visitors can see the documentary on a continuous loop alongside hundreds of its images, including 24 of Mr. Scher\u2019s original watercolors. Although Mr. Feldman suffered greatly \u2014 first sent to a labor camp at 14, he never saw his parents again \u2014 he seems happy to be alive, surrounded by the love of the generations that the Nazis tried so hard to erase.\n\n646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org\n\nTHE PUPPET MASTER: THE COMPLETE JIRI TRNKA at the Walter Reade Theater (April 20-25 at various times). \u201cPuppet\u201d is a word that can conjure pure silliness and slapstick, but the work of the Czech filmmaker Jiri Trnka (pronounced YIR-zhee TURN-kah), a pioneer in puppet animation, is sophisticated, elegant, intricately beautiful and occasionally dark. This touring series from the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which has billed it as the first complete United States retrospective of the career of Trnka (1912-69), has fairy-tale films that children in elementary school may enjoy, as well as political allegories that teenagers can appreciate. Some of the family-friendly titles are \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Nightingale\u201d (1948), a dialogue-free version of a Hans Christian Andersen story; \u201cBayaya\u201d (1950), a medieval adventure with English subtitles; and \u201cTales and Collaborations,\u201d a program of shorts whose subjects include circuses and toys.

According to the memo, Mr. Rinc\u00f3n was shuttled between a series of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s properties, where he was tortured and questioned by Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cousin, Juan Guzm\u00e1n Rocha. Even though Mr. Guzm\u00e1n ordered the interrogators not to kill Mr. Rinc\u00f3n until he got there, the memo claimed that by the time he arrived, Mr. Rinc\u00f3n was dead.\n\nThe memo clearly sought to portray Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, 58, as a calculating and violent man. In 2006, for instance, after relaxing over lunch, he had two members of the Zetas beaten, the government said, then shot them both in the head \u201cwith a long gun.\u201d According to the memo, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n then \u201cordered his workers to dig a hole in the ground, throw the bodies in the hole and light the bodies on fire.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Eduardo Balarezo, said on Tuesday that he was reviewing the memo and would \u201crespond in due course.\u201d\n\nFor several months, Mr. Balarezo has been arguing \u2014 mostly to no avail \u2014 that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n cannot get a fair trial with the severe restrictions placed on him in custody and the sensational publicity surrounding the prosecution. On Monday, he filed his own court papers asking the government to provide him with the criminal histories of the various drug lords, couriers, enforcers and accountants that prosecutors may put on the stand \u2014 as many as 40 witnesses, some of whom may be allowed to testify under aliases.\n\nThose witnesses will likely be the ones who describe the brutalities the government included in its memo, but their accounts will not be the only evidence presented. Prosecutors wrote that they also had satellite photos of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and his operation, seized drug ledgers, dozens of videos, thousands of intercepted phone calls and emails, and more than 300,000 pages of documents. They said they might even offer evidence about payments Mr. Guzm\u00e1n made to his lawyers as \u201cproof of the defendant\u2019s unexplained wealth and substantial income.\u201d\n\nAnd yet there remain certain things that the government does not want the jury to hear. The memo said that included any suggestion of the charitable works that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n performed in Mexico or his recent announcement through a lawyer that he was planning to run \u2014 from his jail cell in New York \u2014 for the Mexican Senate.\n\nThe government has also asked the presiding judge, Brian M. Cogan, to exclude any mention of the interview that the actor Sean Penn conducted with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n for Rolling Stone magazine in 2015 while Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was hiding at a safe house in the hills of Mexico. The government took issue with the interview because in it, Mr. Penn referred to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n as \u201ca Robin Hood-like figure\u201d and alleged that the American drug-buying public was complicit in his crimes.", "title": "7 Tons of Cocaine in Jalape\u00f1o Cans: The Evidence Against El Chapo", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

In 1991, she was bitten by one of the dogs after she tried to break up a fight between some of them, Reuters reported.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only victim; her mother\u2019s chauffeur at the time was also bitten and had to receive a tetanus shot.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time relationships between the dogs and the royal staff have sometimes been strained. In 1999, a royal footman was demoted after he allegedly spiked the dogs\u2019 food and water with gin and whiskey. He was reportedly caught when an exam on one of the dogs found traces of alcohol in its blood.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018Barking All the Time\u2019\n\nIt also appears that not everyone in the royal family has shared the queen\u2019s enthusiasm for her fleet of corgis. In a television interview in 2012, Prince William, the queen\u2019s grandson and the second in line to the British throne, expressed some issues with the dogs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re barking all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she copes with it.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry, his brother, has also registered a noise complaint. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 33 years being barked at,\u201d he told the BBC in 2017.\n\nOne person who did receive the dogs\u2019 approval?

In the taped skit, James Bond (played by Daniel Craig) travels to Buckingham Palace to escort the queen to the Olympic opening ceremony. Joining Willow were Holly, who reportedly died in 2016, and Monty, who died in 2012.\n\nThe corgis are featured in close-ups as they greet Bond, follow him and the queen down the stairs of the palace and stay still as a helicopter takes off for London Stadium.\n\nWillow and Holly, along with their dorgi cousins, were also featured prominently in a Vanity Fair cover that celebrated the queen\u2019s 90th birthday. In a photograph taken by Annie Leibovitz, Holly sits next to queen in Windsor Castle while Willow, Vulcan and Candy roam at her feet.\n\nThe Corgis in Pop Culture\n\nOver the nearly 80 years that the queen has owned the corgis, they have become so closely associated with her that the dogs have even made their way into pop culture depictions of the monarchy.\n\nThe dogs are featured in \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d the 2010 movie depicting King George VI\u2019s ascension to the throne. The corgis are prominent enough throughout \u201cThe Queen,\u201d in which Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Elizabeth during the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana in 1997, that the dogs portraying them received awards for their onscreen performances.\n\nMs. Mirren later played opposite corgis again on stage as the queen in the play \u201cThe Audience\u201d in 2013.\n\nMore recently, the corgis\u2019 appearance in the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d has been credited for renewing interest in the breed in Britain.\n\n\u201cPeople used to have the impression that while corgis were in the spotlight, because of the queen, they could be seen by young people as an older person\u2019s dog,\u201d David Robson of the Kennel Club told The Telegraph in February. \u201cNow that\u2019s changed, partly because we are seeing the character of the younger queen surrounded by them.\u201d", "title": "8 Decades of British Royal Corgis Reportedly at an End", "authors": ["Michael Gold"]}

Of all the political threads that permeate Wolitzer\u2019s 12th novel, the most interesting is the challenge of intergenerational feminism.

As one of the leading lights of the Czech New Wave in the 1960s, Forman joined a generation of young filmmakers that built a creative bulwark against communist oppression.

Forman denied the allegorical implications of the premise, which details the calamitous efforts of a volunteer fire department to give a party for its former leader, but the film nonetheless belongs on the satirical continuum between \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d and Armando Iannucci (\u201cVeep,\u201d \u201cThe Thick of It\u201d). Over a brisk 73 minutes, the outbreak of disasters include a beauty contest with homely and stage-shy contestants, a rash of disappearing raffle prizes and an actual fire that breaks out across town.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Visions of Eight\u2019 (1973)\n\nWhere to watch: FilmStruck, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFor \u201cVisions of Eight,\u201d Forman and seven other internationally renowned directors were commissioned to participate in an anthology film about the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Forman\u2019s \u201cThe Decathlon\u201d is the sixth and longest, a peculiar juxtaposition of individual sporting events and musical performances, mostly from a Bavarian folk band. Each event is presented without context \u2014 his interest in documenting the winners and losers is nil \u2014 and Forman shoots extensively in slow-motion, emphasizing the pregnant moments before the athletes start to compete.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nOnly three films in Oscar history have swept all five major categories (picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay): \u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d and Forman\u2019s adaptation of the novel by Ken Kesey, which frames the conflict at a mental hospital as an allegory for a polarized culture. At the center of that conflict is a battle of wills between Randal P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convict who bluffs his way into the psyche ward, and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who runs the place like a sinister warden. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d has a big, generous sense of humor, but there\u2019s humanity, too, in McMurphy\u2019s championing of patients who are more vulnerable to Ratched\u2019s abuses than he is.\n\n\u2014\n\nMovieclips Classic Trailers\n\n\u2018Hair\u2019 (1979)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAfter establishing his counterculture bona fides with \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d Forman took on the challenge of adapting Gerome Ragni and James Rado\u2019s Broadway smash about a New York hippie enclave rebelling against the Vietnam War. There\u2019s an urgency and danger missing from Forman\u2019s musical, which was a decade removed from the tempest around the original production.

Doctorow\u2019s historical novel about the early 1900s, he worked on his largest canvas to date. But rather than give \u201cRagtime\u201d the \u201cNashville\u201d treatment, Forman and his screenwriter, Michael Weller, focused mainly on revealing this world through the story of an African-American jazz pianist (Howard E.

Murray Abraham). In telling the story through Salieri\u2019s perspective, \u201cAmadeus\u201d becomes a drama about deranged jealousy and betrayal as Salieri fumes over his prodigious counterpart, who is seen as immature and unworthy of his superior talent. Yet through the heat of Salieri\u2019s contempt, Mozart\u2019s compositions come alive with fresh urgency: \u201cAmadeus\u201d isn\u2019t a stodgy costume piece for classical music fans only, it\u2019s a gripping drama about a divine gift and its costs.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Valmont\u2019 (1989)\n\nWhere to buy: iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nArriving just a year after the superb \u201cDangerous Liaisons,\u201d this adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos\u2019s epistolary novel \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses\u201d was doomed to fail. And did just that, sinking under a bloated production budget and lackluster reviews. The side-to-side comparison did no favors to Forman\u2019s version, which didn\u2019t have the same snap, especially in the role of Valmont, which Colin Firth couldn\u2019t play with anything close to John Malkovich\u2019s malevolent panache. But now, from a greater distance, the virtues of \u201cValmont\u201d are better appreciated, particularly Annette Bening\u2019s deliciously nasty turn as the Marquise de Merteuil, who inspires the cruel erotic gamesmanship that eventually curdles into tragedy.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The People vs. Larry Flynt\u2019 (1996)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cIf the First Amendment will protect a scum bag like me, it will protect all of you.\u201d With that quote as its prevailing sentiment, Forman\u2019s fleet biopic about the \u201cHustler\u201d pornographer turned free speech crusader Larry Flynt doesn\u2019t underplay Flynt\u2019s seamier side \u2014 well, maybe a little \u2014 but it does use it as a stress test for a cherished Constitutional principle. Woody Harrelson plays Flynt as an irreverent wild card whose life lurches from porn trailblazer to Christian convert, until finally landing him in a protracted legal battle with Jerry Falwell. Courtney Love is equally good as his wife Althea, whose fortunes are troubled first by addiction and later by contracting H.I.V.\n\n\u2014\n\nMovieclips Classic Trailers\n\n\u2018Man on the Moon\u2019 (1999)\n\nWhere to watch: HBO, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWorking again with the \u201cLarry Flynt\u201d screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Forman sank his teeth into this lively biopic about another cultural provocateur, Andy Kaufman. Jim Carrey famously immersed himself in the role of Kaufman, the anti-comedy legend who played Latka on \u201cTaxi\u201d but shaped his persona in late-night and stage performances that were rife with inside jokes, offensive behavior and weird sideshows.

If you don\u2019t pay the right amount you owe, your payment that month does not count toward the forgiveness that occurs after 120 payments.\n\nDr. White said she would never forget when the FedLoan phone representative discovered she was in what\u2019s called \u201cpaid ahead\u201d status. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s this nasty little thing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. What followed was a Kafkaesque stretch of confusing statements and, ultimately, a double-digit number of months that did not count toward her forgiveness total.\n\nAccording to Keith New, a spokesman for FedLoan, which is a part of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency and is the servicer for the forgiveness program, the initial confusion resulted from the fact that \u201cinformation was not provided surrounding the difference in paying the installment amount versus the bill due amount and how the paid ahead status can affect qualifying payments.\u201d\n\nGiven that FedLoan could have been clearer here, will it arrange for the payments that Dr. White made during this period of confusion to count toward forgiveness? I asked, but Mr. New did not reply.\n\nThe Wrong Employer\n\nOnly certain jobs \u2014 perhaps a quarter of all forms of employment \u2014 qualify for public service loan forgiveness. Just to be sure, everyone in the program ought to submit what\u2019s known as an \u201cemployer certification form\u201d each year to make sure that his or her employer qualifies or still qualifies.\n\nEdge cases have already been the subject of litigation, as I outlined in a 2016 column. But Chris Golding, who works for the North Carolina Nurses Association in Raleigh, N.C., did not know that. Others at the association thought that it qualified, but you can\u2019t get an instant reading on the matter in the time it takes to consider a job offer.\n\nAlas, when Mr. Golding submitted his form, he received a reply last November saying that he was not eligible. There was no detailed explanation, and Mr. Golding said he was unable to get one when he called FedLoan.\n\nThe rules state that an employer must provide a \u201cqualifying public service.\u201d In Mr. Golding\u2019s case, the governing language would appear to be a requirement that an organization\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d purpose is to provide \u201cpublic health\u201d services. Mr. Golding is a registered nurse. He does not treat patients, but he does support other nurses through education.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. New, the FedLoan spokesman, added a bit more detail. \u201cWhile his employer is a nonprofit 501(c)(6) organization, its primary purpose is not one that would be considered as a public service,\u201d he said. He added that FedLoan\u2019s customer service department had consulted with its own compliance services division in making that determination.\n\nMr. New also said FedLoan\u2019s phone representative had told Mr. Golding in November that he could provide documentation supporting the \u201cpurported public service his employer provides for further consideration.\u201d\n\nMr. Golding said he intended to do just that, with the help of his boss and perhaps the organization\u2019s attorney. Meanwhile, he asked me a question that has no good answer: \u201cHow is anyone supposed to make a decision about where to work if they can\u2019t get a reading ahead of time about whether an organization is eligible?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Wrong Loan\n\nWhen the public service loan forgiveness program began, people who had already taken out student loans in the Federal Family Education Loan, or F.F.E.L., program were supposed to switch to something called \u201cdirect\u201d loans to be eligible.\n\nMany people never got the message, however, and spent years making payments only to discover that they had been in the wrong loan program. Other borrowers did not always understand what kind of federal loan they had, since statements could be unclear.\n\nJennifer Johnson, a Brooklyn social worker, said she had contacted Citibank, her loan servicer at the time, in 2010 in an effort to get enrolled in public service loan forgiveness. She recalled being told that she needed to be in a federal loan program to be eligible and get on some kind of an income-driven repayment plan, which she did.\n\nDuring the years that followed, Ms. Johnson said, she regularly searched the web for information on the public service loan forgiveness program to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed any other requirements. In 2015, she became aware of the existence of the employer certification forms, which did not exist when the forgiveness program began. She filed one just to have her employment on record.\n\nThen came the reply, which indicated that none of her payments had counted toward the magic 120 number because she was in an F.F.E.L. loan. Citibank had not made her aware of this, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy first hope was that maybe it was a mistake,\u201d Ms. Johnson said, describing an ensuing phone call to her loan servicer for clarification, which ended in her sobbing. No one had much consolation. \u201cThey told me that it was a new program and that there wasn\u2019t really a system for it yet,\u201d she said.\n\nSo did Citigroup fail her, given that she is certain that she made it perfectly clear that she wanted to be in public service loan forgiveness? \u201cWhile we have fully exited the student loan servicing business, we looked into this matter from seven years ago and have found no confirmation that the conversation transpired as Ms. Johnson suggests,\u201d said Mark Costiglio, a Citigroup spokesman.\n\nTo be clear, Citigroup is not accusing her of making it up. It could not verify that its communication with her had happened as she described it. Nor could it verify that it hadn\u2019t. But logic would suggest that if it had told her that she was in the wrong loan, she would have switched it right quick.\n\nAnd if it didn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t the Department of Education\u2019s ombudsman or her congresswoman and senators take up her cause?\n\nConfusion With the Servicer\n\nLawyers were early adopters of the public service loan forgiveness program, given that many of them run up six-figure law school debts and have ample opportunities to perform public service as a prosecutor, as a public defender or through other legal work.\n\nSo it was with Myles Braccio, a Phoenix prosecutor who elected to go into and stay in that line of work because it would allow him to wipe away his debt. He loved his contracts classes in law school, so he would seem to be well equipped to slay any bureaucracy.\n\nBut this week, he told me a hair-raising story of FedLoan\u2019s giving him bad advice about loan consolidation, wiping away close to two years of qualifying payments, restoring them after he complained to the federal Department of Education\u2019s ombudsman\u2019s office and then taking them away again after he made another inquiry because he was so paranoid that it would mess up his payment count again.\n\nSince then, he said, he has not been able to get straight answers from FedLoan. I asked Mr. New for a few, and he said Mr. Braccio\u2019s account was \u201cin review as we are working to confirm employment time-frame eligibility requirements.\u201d He added that Mr. Braccio\u2019s employer had provided \u201cconflicting\u201d information. Nonsense, Mr. Braccio replied; there is no conflicting information related to the years when he was eligible for loan forgiveness.\n\nAnd why did it take my intervention to extract this explanation? \u201cWe base our life decisions off of what they are telling us,\u201d Mr. Braccio said. \u201cBut you get one person after the other who has absolutely no idea what they are doing.\u201d", "title": "A $350 Million Fund Helps Many Public Servants.

But in stable areas \u2014 such as the southwestern part of CAR where we traveled \u2014 investments in infrastructure, particularly paved roads, should take precedence. Without working roads to transport people and goods, economic opportunity is difficult to find.\n\nThe empty road laid bare this reality in CAR, where people throughout the country are deprived of essential resources. The Global Hunger Index ranks the country as the hungriest in the world, and in a place that\u2019s arguably the world\u2019s most neglected political and humanitarian crisis, government doesn\u2019t exist in most places to fill in the gaps. Compounding the political instability, the United Nations says its humanitarian plan for the country is only 2 percent funded. So although we didn\u2019t see any road improvement projects in our travels, it\u2019s encouraging that the World Bank has invested in some construction projects to improve trade with neighboring countries. However, more robust foreign investment, which is required for large-scale infrastructure projects, is unlikely to precede peace.\n\nAnd when people can\u2019t move from one place to the next, it causes all sorts of problems.

That\u2019s because phones were designed as multipurpose devices, which also means they lack some important features, like a handgrip or optical zoom, which gets you closer to your subject without degrading image quality. (Instead, phones mostly use digital zoom, which often degrades image quality. So, avoid zooming in digitally. Instead, \u201czoom with your feet\u201d or simply walk closer to your subject, if you can.) Here are several tips for getting better results.\n\n1. Orientation: Be sure to orient your phone horizontally. \u201cWhen I\u2019m watching the news and there\u2019s footage from a bystander that\u2019s in portrait mode,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb, \u201cthat\u2019s an immediate signal that it\u2019s an amateur video.\u201d He says that while Instagram and Snapchat seem to be \u201caiding and abetting\u201d users to create more portrait- or vertically-oriented footage, it\u2019s best to avoid it.\n\n2 Avoid Back Lighting: \u201cAvoid having a window or light source behind your subject, since he or she will look silhouetted,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb. Instead, have the light source more to the side of you or behind you.\n\n3. Use both hands: \u201cAlways have two hands on the phone,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb. \u201cIt may seem rudimentary, but it makes a big difference. Phone lenses generally have optical image stabilization built in, so they\u2019re pretty stable already. But using two hands produces even steadier footage.\u201d It also avoids what he calls the Jell-O effect. \u201cIf you\u2019re moving the camera around too quickly, it can have a wavy quality to it.\u201d Using two hands lessens the chance of creating this effect.\n\n4. Lock Focus and Exposure: Mr. Nachtrieb suggests tapping on your phone\u2019s LCD (on the point you want to focus on), which will lock focus on Google Android devices, or holding your finger in place, which locks focus on the Apple iPhone.\u201cIn low light, your phone\u2019s camera will hunt for focus.\u201d That makes it look less professional. Most phones let you also lock or manually adjust the exposure, too.\n\n5. Improve Your Audio, Too: Most video pros say good quality audio is essential for powerful video. The good news is that the microphones on smartphones have improved in recent years. What\u2019s more is that audio accessories, such as Bluetooth microphones, can make the audio in your video projects sound outstanding (which we\u2019ll get to in a moment).\n\nHere are two audio tricks: Borrow a second phone, start recording audio, and place the phone in your subject\u2019s pocket. \u201cThen, shoot video on your phone from far away,\u201d says Mr. Nachtrieb. \u201cYou can always sync up the audio tracks later in video editing.\u201d And when interviewing subjects, don\u2019t interrupt their replies, says Mr. Nachtrieb.", "title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Taking Great Video on Your Phone", "authors": []}

He said that the pills helped him pack on five pounds of muscle in four weeks, which he documented on his website, \u201cPrimalHacker.\u201d He argued that informed adults should be allowed \u201cto experiment on ourselves and improve our biology,\u201d but added, \u201cthis is definitely a use-at-your-own-risk type of supplement.\u201d\n\nAnti-doping officials have known about SARMs for some time and have seen an increasing number of elite athletes using them. Since 2015, the United States Anti-Doping Agency has imposed sanctions on more than two dozen track and field stars, weight lifters, cyclists, mixed martial artists and others for testing positive for a variety of SARMs, most frequently one called ostarine.\n\nLast year, Joakim Noah, a center for the New York Knicks, was suspended for 20 games for testing positive for a SARM. The college basketball star Allonzo Trier of the Arizona Wildcats was also suspended for using SARMs. And in October, a top CrossFit Games competitor, Ricky Garard, was stripped of his third-place title after testing positive for two SARMs: ostarine and testolone.\n\nWhile the underground use of SARMs has made them controversial, the drugs could one day serve a crucial purpose for many patients.\n\nScientists developed SARMs decades ago to counter the age-related decline in muscle and strength that tends to begin around middle age and that can contribute to falls and broken bones. Many chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart failure and kidney disease, are also punctuated by a loss of muscle and physical mobility.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But they act on many tissues throughout the body and have been tied to a litany of potential side effects, including prostate problems and cardiovascular events.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSARMs were designed to selectively target skeletal muscle and spare other tissues, in an attempt to reduce some of these unwanted side effects. A number of trials are looking at their usefulness in cancer patients, people recovering from hip surgery, and postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence linked to weak pelvic muscles.\n\nA three-week trial at Boston University demonstrated that LGD-4033, a SARM developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals, was safe and tolerable in healthy men, producing \u201csignificant gains in muscle mass and strength\u201d without raising levels of a protein linked to prostate cancer. But it had other effects as well, for instance causing a drop in HDL cholesterol, the protective kind, which raised questions about its effects on heart health.\n\n\u201cLong-term studies are needed to clarify the effects of long-term SARM administration on cardiovascular risk,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nThomas O\u2019Connor, a doctor who founded a men\u2019s health clinic and wrote a book called \u201cAmerica on Steroids,\u201d said that many of his patients are anabolic steroid users who turned to SARMs because they were told that they were safe and nontoxic. He said that since 2010 has seen \u201chundreds, maybe over 1,000 men on SARMs\u201d from all walks of life: police officers, defense workers, amateur athletes, accountants and others.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to determine the precise impact of SARMs because many people who use them combine them with other drugs, supplements and substances, Dr. O\u2019Connor said. But one thing he often sees among people using SARMs is that their cholesterol profiles worsen and their liver enzymes rise, a sign of increased strain on their livers. Some also experience diminished sex drive, hair loss, acne and irritability, though it\u2019s often difficult to know whether it\u2019s the SARMs causing these symptoms or some other unlisted ingredients in the products.\n\nAs a longtime power lifter, Dr. O\u2019Connor said he relates to a lot of his patients and understands their desire to be bigger, stronger and fitter. But he counsels them to give up the drugs they are using because they are jeopardizing their health.\n\n\u201cI always tell them the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are illicit agents.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "Spotify\u2019s main cost is what it pays record companies for the music it streams to its customers. As Spotify has grown, that expense has fallen as a share of its total revenue, which shows that Spotify is negotiating increasingly advantageous deals with record companies.\n\nThat has bolstered Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin, which measures how much money a company keeps after paying out the costs directly related to generating its revenue. Last year, that margin was 21 percent of revenue at Spotify, well up from 14 percent in 2016.\n\nCrucially, though, Spotify has said it expects its gross margin to expand to as much as 35 percent over the longer term. In other words, as Spotify\u2019s spending on music grows, so will its leverage over record companies. And it may well achieve its gross margin target. After all, Netflix, which occupies a similar position in the market for streaming video, has a gross margin of 35 percent.\n\nBut Spotify\u2019s main rivals could complicate things. What if Amazon offered record companies better terms than Spotify? That would reduce Spotify\u2019s bargaining power, making it harder to deliver wider gross margins investors are expecting. And Amazon, along with Apple and Google, has far deeper pockets to slog it out over the long term.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nHow does Spotify\u2019s first day stack up?\n\nSpotify\u2019s unusual path to the public markets was a success.\n\nOn its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the music streaming service finished with a valuation of $26.5 billion.\n\nSpotify\u2019s shares opened at $165.90 before closing at $149.01.\n\nThat\u2019s well above the high of $132.50 that its shares changed hands at in private transactions this year. It\u2019s also well above the $137.50 the WSJ reported its private shares were trading at during the past week.\n\nSpotify had eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing. That meant there was no \u201cdeal price\u201d for investors to reference on the first day of trading and no underwriters acting as stabilizing agents if the stock began to plunge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite all that, Spotify\u2019s valuation at the close on Tuesday ranks among the highest for a tech company debuting on an American exchange.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the tech companies with the 10 biggest market capitalizations after their first day of trading, courtesy of Dealogic:\n\nAlibaba \u2014 $233.9 billion\n\nFacebook \u2014 $81.7 billion\n\nPalm \u2014 $53.3 billion\n\nInfineon Technologies \u2014 $47.9 billion\n\nJD.com \u2014 $28.9 billion\n\nSnap \u2014 $28.9 billion\n\nGoogle \u2014 $27.2 billion\n\nSpotify \u2014 $26.5 billion\n\nTwitter \u2014 $24.9 billion\n\nAgilent \u2014 $20.1 billion\n\nPhoto\n\nTesla\u2019s shares rise on production numbers\n\nShares of the electric carmaker are up 3.3 percent Tuesday after the company released production data Tuesday that showed progress in producing its mass-market Model 3.\n\nTesla said:\n\n\u2022 It built 2,020 Model 3s in the past seven days. That fell short of its goal of 2,500 by the end of the quarter.\n\n\u2022 Tesla produced 9,766 Model 3s during the quarter.\n\n\u2022 In total, Tesla produced 35,000 cars in the first quarter.\n\n\u2022 It has delivered 8,800 Model 3s during the first quarter, below the 8,800 analysts expected according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022 In all, Tesla delivered a record 29,980 vehicles during the quarter.\n\n\u2022 The company said it expects Model 3 weekly production to reach 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The combined deliveries of the Model X and Model S came to 21,800 cars, the lowest total in several quarters.\n\nContext\n\nTesla\u2019s stock and bond prices have plunged amid concerns about how much cash the company is using as it struggles to speed up assembly and sales of the Model 3. With a starting price of $35,000, the car is supposed to be more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other cars. The company has been counting on a quick expansion of its Model 3 business to increase revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Amazon continue\n\nThe president reiterated his claim that Amazon is \u201ccosting the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money\u201d in a post to Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nShares are essentially flat on the day.\n\nThe accusation is the latest in a string of critical tweets that began Thursday about the e-commerce giant. As The Associated Press pointed out over the weekend, Mr. Trump is misrepresenting Amazon\u2019s record with the United States Postal Service.\n\n\u201cPackage delivery has been a bright spot for a service that\u2019s lost money for 11 straight years. The losses are mostly due to pension and health care costs \u2014 not the business deal for the Postal Service to deliver packages for Amazon. Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn\u2019t been enough to offset declines in first-class letters and marketing mail, which together make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue. \u201cWhile the Postal Service\u2019s losses can\u2019t be attributed to its package business, Trump\u2019s claim that it could get more bang for its buck may not be entirely far-fetched. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the Postal Service was charging below-market rates as a whole for parcels. The post office does not use taxpayer money for its operations.\u201d\n\nCould Mr. Tump\u2019s criticism lead to action against Amazon?\n\nGabriel Sherman over at Vanity Fair reports on a few of the ideas being tossed around, including pushing for the Postal Service to renegotiate its contract with Amazon and encouraging \u201cattorneys general in red states to open investigations into Amazon\u2019s business practices.\u201d\n\nWall Street analysts are largely advising investors to ignore the noise. But even if changes were made to sales tax collection, that may end up benefiting Amazon. Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, writes:\n\n\u201cNothing can be certain, except death and taxes \u2026 and more Trump tweets on Amazon. We believe sales tax collection changes would have limited impact on consumer use of Amazon and could actually help Amazon\u2019s relative competitive positioning in domestic e-commerce.\u201d\n\nElliott takes on Korea Inc. again\n\nElliott Management has acquired a $1 billion stake in Hyundai Motors, Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis.\n\nLast month, Hyundai simplified its ownership structure. The aim was to resolve the group\u2019s circular shareholdings, which critics have long said give too much power to Hyundai\u2019s controlling Chung family at the expense of shareholders, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cWhile this step is encouraging, more needs to be done to benefit the companies and stakeholders. Elliott calls on management to share a more detailed roadmap as to how it will improve corporate governance, optimize balance sheets, and enhance capital returns at each of the companies. Elliott looks forward to engaging with management and other stakeholders directly on these issues, and to offering recommendations regarding the proposed plan.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the market slump?\n\nS.&P. 500 futures are up this morning, suggesting yesterday\u2019s market rout may not continue. And European and Asian markets didn\u2019t fall as sharply as did the U.S.\u2019s. But what\u2019s behind the markets dropping 4 percent so far this year? A couple of ideas:\n\n\u2022 Washington (and Beijing), again: China\u2019s tougher-than-expected retaliatory tariffs gave investors more reason to fear a trade war. American pork and fruit producers are among those sweating. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s unorthodox and unpredictable decision-making is likely to keep markets on edge,\u201d Mike Ryan of UBS Wealth Management told the FT.\n\n\u2022 Tech, again: The FAANG stocks are still weighing down the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq, as the likes of Facebook and Google face the prospect of greater regulation and President Trump repeats his attacks on Amazon.

Analysts expect S.&P. 500 companies\u2019 earnings to grow 25 percent this year. But rising interest rates worldwide could affect revenue growth.

It would allow users \u2014 and rivals \u2014 to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.\n\nAlso: Mark Zuckerberg just mused about greater transparency to Vox, and suggested an independent appeals process to review content on Facebook.

In recent decades, thanks to the efforts of Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority \u2014 one of the few functioning institutions in this country \u2014 the park has also become a sanctuary for leopards, antelopes and a robust population of white and black rhinos.\n\nBut it was the birds of prey that I had mainly come to see. Over the past six months I have been researching a book that deals in part with Jeffrey Lendrum, described by British police as one of the world\u2019s most prolific wildlife thieves and smugglers.\n\nRaised in Bulawayo in the 1970s, at the height of the Rhodesian bush war that brought the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe to power, Mr. Lendrum began climbing into Matobo\u2019s hard-to-reach nests as a boy. He would later turn his agility and ornithological expertise to controversial ends, roaming from Tierra del Fuego to northern Quebec, and snatching the live eggs of wild falcons \u2014 reportedly on behalf of wealthy Arab falconry enthusiasts. (Mr. Lendrum was convicted of stealing eggs in Britain in 2010 and in Chile in 2015, and served time in prison, but insists he did it to save falcons that would otherwise have perished in the wild.)\n\nIn the course of my reporting I have begun tracing Mr. Lendrum\u2019s footsteps around the world, viewing the aeries of peregrines in the Rhondda Valley in Wales, and flying with a falcon in a hot-air balloon in Dubai. Now I had come to southern Africa see where his journey had begun.\n\nMr. Brebner and his wife, Jen, another bird enthusiast, picked me up at my guest cottage in Bulawayo in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, and we headed down a two-lane tarmac road toward Matobo. It was just two weeks after the military coup that had unseated Mr. Mugabe after 37 years in power. \u201cThe roadblocks are gone now,\u201d Mr. Brebner said, referring to the ubiquitous checkpoints that had appeared in the last two years of Mr. Mugabe \u2019s rule.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhat did you discover?\n\nHe was what the F.B.I. at the time called a special correspondent, which meant that he was someone the F.B.I. reached out to and had very cordial relationships with, and very cooperative relationships with for the majority of his broadcasting career. That included, of course, his cooperation with the F.B.I. to discredit Martin Luther King.\n\nWhat specific things did he do to discredit Dr. King?\n\nIn collaboration with the F.B.I., he laundered some of their counterintelligence for them. So for example, the F.B.I. would pass along some information to him on King about, perhaps, King being a communist, and then Michaux would, of course, scrub that intelligence and present it in some of his broadcasts or sermons. In all, what he does is he colludes with the F.B.I. to preach sermons that discredit Martin Luther King and also even engage in a protest of Martin Luther King that was cleared by the F.B.I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat were some lines of attack that Elder Michaux took against Dr. King?\n\nOn the same day that the F.B.I. writes a memo that says that King is the most dangerous Negro in the world, on that same day they reach out to Michaux and he preaches a sermon against the March on Washington. So the March on Washington has already occurred and, about a month later, Michaux preaches a sermon criticizing the March on Washington and questioning King\u2019s religious commitments. The sermon basically says that King, his religious commitments are questionable, and this whole entire dream that Martin Luther King has will never ever happen and will never come about by marching and protesting. But it will only come about by sort of seeking the Christian conversion of individuals in America.\n\nAnd it questioned his motivations, right?\n\nThe sermon says that King is being motivated not by the Bible, not by religion, but by something else. And of course the F.B.I. is distributing throughout Washington that King is a communist. And so the sermon is sort of used to sort of provide air cover for the kind of counterintelligence the F.B.I. is engaging in as it relates to Martin Luther King.\n\nWere there other times when Elder Michaux was used to further criticize or delegitimize Dr. King?\n\nA second moment is when Martin Luther King and J. Edgar Hoover have a public spat. King tells a New York Times reporter that the F.B.I. cannot sort of investigate segregation if the F.B.I. has segregationists in it. He questions the F.B.I. and their commitments to racial justice and equality. Eventually, Hoover responds by saying that Martin Luther King is the most notorious liar in the country and that King should not be trusted. So when they have this public spat, the F.B.I. reaches out to Michaux and, again, he obliges and helps them. He writes an open letter, releases it to the media, to the newswires at the time, saying that it was Martin Luther King\u2019s fault, and that Hoover is a good Christian servant who is working to ensure the morality of the nation.\n\nHe has help from the F.B.I. in constructing this letter. He\u2019s given information illegally by the F.B.I., inserts it into the letter, sort of vouching for the F.B.I.\u2019s efforts in racial justice.\n\nAnd finally in 1965 he engages in a protest. Martin Luther King is fresh from the march at Selma. He is then in Baltimore with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, planning their summer plans, and Michaux reaches out to the F.B.I., let\u2019s them know that he\u2019s going to be protesting outside the hotel. So about 100 members of his congregation \u2014 between 100, 125, according to The New York Times \u2014 are outside marching, protesting King with signs such as \u201cCommunist termites are inside\u201d and \u201cGod save America.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think is the big takeaway now?\n\nWe have these African-Americans who are part of this evangelical advisory board in the executive branch. At the same time, we know from documents that have recently been released by the F.B.I. that the executive branch is overseeing the Department of Justice and the F.B.I., who are following Black Lives Matter protesters. I think it allows us to see how these televangelists, who make connections with the executive branch, can be used as religious cover for what the F.B.I. and the executive branch more broadly wants to do.\n\nAs April 4th rolls around, we\u2019ll see Trump and, I\u2019m sure, ministers across the country who will be praising Martin Luther King, praising his ministry, mourning his untimely death. But yet their policies and their commitments will be really far from Martin Luther King. In actuality, I think we\u2019ll see they\u2019re in a tradition with Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux.", "title": "A Black Evangelist Who Opposed Dr. King", "authors": ["John Eligon"]}

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "A clue is that 7 percent of ancient DNA samples from Europe and the steppes contain DNA of the plague microbe that caused medieval Europe\u2019s Black Death. Perhaps steppe peoples acquired plague, developed some immunity with exposure, and transmitted it to unexposed European farmers, thereby decimating them. It would be ironic if Europe\u2019s first farmers succumbed to an introduced disease, because other diseases introduced by European colonists of the New World after 1492 equally decimated Native American populations.\n\nMy last example: What was the origin of Polynesian people, who colonized every habitable Pacific island from Tonga to Hawaii within the last few thousand years? Archaeological and linguistic evidence had already shown that Polynesians can be traced back to the island of Taiwan. But what happened to them between their leaving Taiwan and their reaching Tonga?\n\nThe astonishing answer is: genetically, nothing! The first proto-Polynesian culture located archaeologically on islands east of the Solomons is called the Lapita. DNA of early Lapita skeletons from Vanuatu and Tonga is mostly Taiwanese DNA, with little or no contribution from the Papuan peoples inhabiting the New Guinea region through which Taiwanese farmers passed en route to Vanuatu and Tonga. That sexual abstemiousness is unexpected. But Papuans subsequently reached those Pacific islands and mixed with the Lapita first arrivals, because the islands\u2019 modern inhabitants do carry Papuan genes.\n\nAs with any new scientific methodology, new genetic methods tend to alter previously held beliefs about the course of human history. And some readers will certainly find Reich\u2019s conclusions unpalatable. Japanese may not like hearing that they share 80 percent of their DNA with Koreans. Reich\u2019s collaborators from India didn\u2019t like hearing that their own DNA samples attested to massive past migrations into the Indian subcontinent. Native Americans may not like hearing that 10,000-year-old Native American skeletons whose repatriation and reburial they seek have no demonstrable connection to tribes living in the same geographic area today. Those reactions are inevitable, but Reich bends over backward to present both the evidence and the uncertainties.\n\nWhat should you expect when you read this book? Don\u2019t expect an oversimplified story. Population genetics is a complicated, fast-moving field with many uncertainties of interpretation. To tell that story to the broad public, and not just to scientists reading specialty journals, is a big challenge. Reich explains these complications as well as any geneticist could; others rarely even try. Some of Reich\u2019s conclusions will surely be superseded within a few years. But few subjects fascinate us as much as human origins. Humans have been on the move not just since Columbus\u2019s voyage of 1492, but throughout our long history. The ancestors of modern Japanese, Indians and Native Americans didn\u2019t become fixed in their modern locations in ancient times and simply stop moving. If you want to understand our origins over the course of the last 100,000 years, this book will be the best up-to-date account for you.", "title": "A Brand-New Version of Our Origin Story", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "The Marine Corps likes to present itself with dutiful seriousness. \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d is a counterpoint to that. It is a tribute to the service\u2019s permanent underclass, the young grunts who are too weary to feign enthusiasm anymore. (The strip\u2019s title is derived from slang for the holder of a junior rank \u2014 lance corporal \u2014 who will never be promoted and thus will depart the corps as a terminal lance.)\n\nThe Pentagon speaks of duty, commitment and national defense. Mr. Uriarte\u2019s troops seem to have boarded the wrong bus. They are anxious, lonely and bored. Sick of slogans and tired of being casually hazed and verbally abused, they take refuge in drawing penises inside the porta-potties that dot their bases and outposts. They find chaplains creepy and lifers tiresome. Their corps is a bizarre professional ecosystem where the working caste masturbates, binge-drinks, watches porn and plays video games in the barracks and then reports to work hung over.\n\nIn art as in life, it is not that these lance corporals are unwilling to train or to fight. It\u2019s that America\u2019s wars give them little opportunity to train and fight smart. Much of their deployed time is spent on duties that accomplish little, or worse, cause harm to others and themselves. In this dispiriting system the only privilege many of them can claim is the power to look down on even newer Marines \u2014 the \u201cboots,\u201d a clueless population subject to harassment and ridicule.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf this sounds like a hard sell to a proud service, \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d fans have rewarded Mr. Uriarte\u2019s unflinching take and reportage with a full embrace. The nearly 691,000 followers of the \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d Facebook page are almost four times the number of active-duty Marines. In just three years, its newer Instagram account has swelled to 287,000 fans, the largest proportion of whom are 18- to-24-year-olds. The strip\u2019s own website averages about one million unique visitors a month, and its reach is further boosted by the publication of a less offensive version in the Marine Corps Times, an independent biweekly newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Uriarte, formerly a terminal lance himself, attributes the success to an unusual trait for a comic strip: accuracy. \u201cI think \u2018Terminal Lance\u2019 has done very well because while it has been critical, it\u2019s been honest,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the strip has not generated complaints. Senior Marines often contact Mr. Uriarte to grouse about unflattering portrayals, including his characters\u2019 excessive drinking. Some try to root out his sources. But the corps and its illustrator have found a measure of peace.\n\n\u201cIf you are a grunt and can\u2019t laugh at this stuff, you\u2019d go crazy,\u201d Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine commandant, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cEvery time I see his comic I read it. If nothing else it makes you ponder his point, or just laugh out loud.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight Mr. Uriarte\u2019s success looks like a plan. He enlisted in the Marines in 2006, when he was 19, hoping to become a professional artist with time. He had been drawing and sketching since he was kid and was seeking a challenge and the rich story lines he expected to find in grunt life.\n\n\u201cI consider myself an artist before anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole thing was really to inform my artwork, from a weird 19-year-old perspective.\u201d\n\nHe spent his first combat tour, in 2007, as a machine-gunner in the turret of an armored truck, escorting his company commander around. By his second tour, in 2009, he had talked himself into a job as an official photographer.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe next year, with only a few months left on active duty and no promotion in sight, Mr. Uriarte started \u201cTerminal Lance,\u201d publishing under his own name. He had a smartphone, a website and a subject: his fellow disgruntled Marines, who had almost no voice of their own. He channeled it.\n\n\u201cThey essentially created a monster,\u201d he said, of the corps. \u201cI wonder if they regret not promoting me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTerminal Lance\u201d immediately attracted attention, including from a sergeant major who summoned Lance Corporal Uriarte to his office and sent him to see a Marine lawyer. The lawyer told him not to use real names \u2014 a warning he did not always heed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He became part of a growing network of Marines attuned to problems plaguing their cohort: cycles of deployments leading to despair, post-traumatic stress disorder and difficulties readjusting to civilian life. Two members of his former infantry company committed suicide.\n\nAll of this informed \u201cTerminal Lance.\u201d Staff Sgt. Kevin T. Hoffman, a Marine based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., was drawn to Mr. Uriarte\u2019s strip as it launched, when he was a lance corporal recovering in a hospital from wounds suffered in a bomb attack in Afghanistan.\n\nHe recognized it as real. The strip resonated with him, he said, because it \u201cmade me reflect and miss the barracks and my friends.\u201d He reads it still, even as a supervisor himself. Mr. Uriarte has \u201cbeen able to remain a figurehead because his experiences are timeless,\u201d Staff Sergeant Hoffman said.\n\nOver the years the strip has come to focus on the experiences of two main characters, Abe and Garcia, who in many ways are foul-mouthed millennial updates on Willie and Joe, Bill Mauldin\u2019s comic-strip characters of World War II.\n\nGarcia is likable and reasonable, a Marine who accepts the corps\u2019 absurdities, indignities and tedium in stride. Abe is often selfish, unimpressed and eager for the weekend. He seems born not to fight, but to complain, and is not even sure why he volunteered.\n\nBut Mr. Uriarte\u2019s work has evolved past Abe\u2019s brief and often one-sided episodes of venting. In \u201cThe White Donkey,\u201d his graphic novel, he used the characters to venture into more serious themes, confronting the violence at the center of the infantry\u2019s purpose and presenting a grim view of Marines eager for war.\n\nSet in 2007 during the occupation of Iraq, it includes a scene where an Iraqi police officer stands silently beside Abe and Garcia as they talk and smoke cigarettes. Abe is disgusted. Violence has declined. He has seen little action \u2014 except for an unarmed civilian he mistook for a suicide bomber and shot. He finds Iraq ugly. He admits he hates the place.\n\nThe Iraqi officer startles the Americans by revealing he speaks English and understood everything Abe said. \u201cWould it make you feel better to kill someone?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou came here to kill brown people like me, yes? Why not kill me now?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe spares no disgust for the occupier\u2019s journey. \u201cI have met many of your type over the last few years, coming here to fulfill some personal conquest, but you never stop to think about how arrogant you are,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seek some enlightenment at the expense of my people.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Uriarte, who modeled Abe in part on his younger self, the scene is both self-lacerating and a hint of perspective gained. It is also a challenge to his core readership, as are his occasional statements on personal social media standing up for gays in the military, women in the corps and gun control.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Mr. Uriarte works on a second graphic novel, he acknowledges that he is growing older than his subjects. He said he expects his work will eventually leave the corps behind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep doing this forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\nThat day does not seem soon. For now, Mr. Uriarte remains fully engaged with the corps and his illustrated version.\n\nWhen an annoyed Marine wrote to Mr. Uriarte demanding that he reveal a source behind a recent video, Mr. Uriarte did not drift into a discussion about the First Amendment or the role of anonymous sources in keeping the public informed.\n\nLike a proper terminal lance, his reply was dismissive and defiant, in keeping with what his fans might expect. \u201cYour mother,\u201d he shot back.", "title": "A Comic Strip About the Marines: The Few, the Proud, the Bored Out of Their Minds", "authors": ["C.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "Six years later, Douthat, a columnist for this newspaper, has become the successor to the conservative Catholic doyen William F. Buckley Jr. (who once took him sailing \u2014 and skinny-dipping \u2014 on Long Island Sound). His ascendance has come at an odd moment: The right wing dominates politics, but so-called conservatives have traduced the ideals that drew him to the movement. Small-government congressmen have dropped commitments to rein in federal spending; evangelicals (those champions of traditional marriage) are supine in their support of the sexual predator in the White House. And after a third of a century in which John Paul II made the papacy \u201ca rallying point for resistance to the redefinition of Christianity,\u201d the church is led by a pope who has no use for the culture-war schema of resistance and accommodation \u2014 who sees the church called to \u201cgo to the peripheries\u201d rather than strive to restore Christianity as the vital center.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo Douthat Francis is an accommodationist, and decline has reached the apex of the church. \u201cThis is a hinge moment in the history of Catholicism,\u201d he declares, \u201ca period of theological crisis that\u2019s larger than just the Francis pontificate but whose particular peak under this pope will be remembered, studied and argued about for as long as the Catholic Church endures.\u201d\n\nWhat immediately follows is an adroit, perceptive, gripping account of Catholic controversializing. Douthat sets out the liberal and conservative \u201cmaster narratives\u201d about the Second Vatican Council and then offers a third narrative that deftly blends the two. He sketches the life and times of the future pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Argentine Jesuit archbishop of Buenos Aires. There\u2019s commentary on past controversies and a brief history of Catholic teaching on marriage, from Matthew 19 (\u201cWhat God has joined, let not man put asunder\u201d) to Humanae Vitae, the 1968 encyclical in which Pope Paul VI upheld the ban on artificial birth control.\n\nIt\u2019s strong stuff, conversationally lively and expressive. Apt on-the-spot paraphrase abounds: \u201cIn his famous in-flight news conference coming back from Rio\u201d Francis \u201cseemed to indicate an interest in the remarriage issue, offering a positive-seeming mention of Eastern Orthodoxy\u2019s practice on divorce. \u2026 But the furor over gay priests and `Who am I to judge?\u2019 overshadowed these remarks.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. Thank you for subscribing. An error has occurred. Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnd then, as Douthat reaches what he sees as the heart of the matter \u2014 the Vatican synods on marriage and the family in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 his culture-warrior tendencies stir fully to life. He casts the synods as a battle: warring factions, attacks and frontal assaults, purges and collaborators. Francis\u2019 openness to the German cardinal Walter Kasper\u2019s proposal to relax the ban on divorced-and-remarried people in Germany receiving Communion at Mass is framed as a liberal pope\u2019s \u201ccrusade to change the church.\u201d Although Francis has invited free discussion more than any previous pope, his efforts to shape the synod\u2019s outcome (he is the pope, after all) are seen as \u201cstage-managing\u201d and \u201cdeck-stacking.\u201d The synod fathers\u2019 disputes are rolled down the slippery slope and deemed a \u201cfull-scale theological crisis\u201d in which the hope that Francis would foster unity and renewal is undone by the supposed liberals\u2019 supposed desire to accommodate \u201cthe sexual revolution and all its works.\u201d\n\nDouthat\u2019s own position is traditionalist-cum-literalist: Any relaxing of the Catholic teaching on marriage \u2014 one man, one woman, one time \u2014 means that core teachings can be changed; if core teachings can be changed, the Catholic Church is no longer the Catholic Church; and if the church is not the church, all hope is lost. From this fixed position, he slyly derides other positions, especially the liberal outlook.\n\nAs a first draft of history, \u201cTo Change the Church\u201d is a high-wire act, an effort to maintain a balance between theology and polemics for a wide public. And yet the air is thin up there, the wire narrow and tight. From above, Douthat, seeing every act as a tactical move in the culture wars, pushing every hypothesis to its limit, ignores human experience. Left out is the prospect that Francis called a synod about marriage and family not because he wanted to fly the flag of the sexual revolution but because marriage and family are where so many people in our time encounter the paradoxes of body and soul, self-fulfillment and self-sacrifice. Left out is the fact that Catholics don\u2019t skirt the church\u2019s teaching on marriage just to make things easier for themselves; they say, \u201cBy what right do those child-abuse-indulging clerics tell me that my marriage is adulterous while twice-divorced, thrice-married Newt Gingrich is now a Catholic in good standing, living in Rome as the spouse of his ex-aide/girlfriend who is the United States ambassador to the Vatican?\u201d Left out are the signs that the traditionalists don\u2019t want to tamp down divorce so much as bar the door to same-sex marriage. Left out is the truth that sexual behavior is more fluid than the culture-war schema allows: that there are conservative libertines as well as liberals who live marriage faithfully (even chastely). Left out are people like Gabby, who live off the grid of the culture wars \u2014 as does Douthat himself, a conservative whom liberal institutions have educated, sponsored and let thrive.\n\nLeft out, especially, is the home truth that the Catholic Church has changed already. Vatican II was at once the church\u2019s response to a crisis and the perpetuation of it. In less than five years the council fathers made changes whose number and scale dwarf the modest proposals floated in Francis\u2019 pontificate \u2014 made them over the objections of Bill Buckley and other pundits who styled themselves as more Catholic than the pope. The biggest change had to do with the church\u2019s relationship to Judaism, other churches and other religions. In a few strokes, Jesus\u2019 hard saying \u201cNo one comes to the Father except through me\u201d and its Catholic expression (\u201cOutside the church there is no salvation\u201d) were softened and qualified. The change was profound and tradition-defying. Ever since, the church has affirmed the integrity of other faiths; ever since, Catholics have had to ask themselves, \u201cWhy be Catholic, when other ways are O.K., too?\u201d Ever since, there has been no one clear answer.\n\nThis is not to say that people entering into Catholic marriage shouldn\u2019t fully grasp the church\u2019s understanding of the sacrament and its obligations. It is to say that the view of marriage as a marker in a culture war \u2014 a doctrinal asymptote, a line that may be approached but not crossed \u2014 is itself a greatly diminished view of marriage. Fidelity is going into new forms; like it or not, Catholics, right up to the pope, have to work out the implications as we go. The slope is slippery now and forevermore. Truly, it has been all along.", "title": "A Conservative Catholic Begs the Pope: Lead Us Not Into Temptation", "authors": ["Paul Elie", "Ross Douthat"]}

These are not normal families, not happy or sad families, but families so cracked and mythologically weird that they are more like interesting old ruins. They are families as written by Hans Christian Andersen with the poetry of Auden, both of whom used fairy-tale imagery to explain our suffering.

And why should the classic filled and folded French omelet have a reason to claim or disclaim any relationship to the frittata, other than the fact that both are made from beaten eggs?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say a frittata is a mixture of whisked eggs cooked in a frying pan. It can be thick or thin, flipped and cooked entirely in the pan, finished in the oven or under the broiler, or prepared in a baking dish. (It can also be depressingly dry and overcooked, but that\u2019s not our goal here.) A frittata is a perfect light lunch or supper accompanied by a rather large mixed-green salad \u2014 an easy standby when you don\u2019t feel like cooking.", "title": "A Deluxe Asparagus Frittata, Topped With Burrata", "authors": []}

Addiction, they say, is not a question of free will or a correctable character flaw, as a lot of people would like to believe. Rather, it is an affliction of the brain that needs to be treated as one would any chronic illness.\n\nOne possible approach, an experimental vaccine, draws attention in this offering from Retro Report, a series of short video documentaries exploring major news stories of the past and their lasting impact. This vaccine would be intended principally for men and women already hooked on heroin or related opioids like Oxycodone and fentanyl \u2014 people who would be at risk of death should they detoxify and then relapse, as all too many do.\n\nIf it works, the vaccine would stop opioids by effectively blocking them from reaching the brain by way of the circulatory system. At the same time, it would not interfere with other treatments for addicts, like methadone and buprenorphine, or with a compound like naloxone that reverses overdoses.\n\nThe vaccine is designed to create high levels of antibodies, said Dr. Gary Matyas, an immunologist who has been developing it at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, in Silver Springs, Md. \u201cYou inject heroin, the antibodies basically grab all the heroin, bind it all up, and the heroin can\u2019t cross the blood-brain barrier,\u201d he told Retro Report. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s no high.\u201d Presumably, in time, the heroin would be expelled from the body like any waste product.", "title": "A Drug to End Addiction?

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nCENSUS\n\nBy Jesse Ball\n\n272 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99.\n\nJesse Ball is one of our most prolific experimentalists. His last few novels, starting with the excellent \u201cSilence Once Begun,\u201d demonstrate a mature style that feels less like an experiment than a means to communicate deep emotional truths without the clutter of too many narrative conventions.\n\n\u201cCensus,\u201d Ball\u2019s eighth and latest novel, may be his most emotionally affecting book to date. It is also his most transparent. In a candid preface, Ball explains that he wrote \u201cCensus\u201d in memory of his brother, Abram Ball, who had Down syndrome. Ball sets out to write a book that captures \u201cwhat it is like to know and love a Down syndrome boy or girl.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cCensus,\u201d a father and son journey across a nameless, dystopian land. The father, a recent widower and retired doctor, has just received news that he is dying. Both he and his wife had always meant to travel, but because their son was born with Down syndrome, they talked themselves out of it. The cruelty of others kept them from the road: \u201cEver since he was born, our lives, my wife\u2019s, mine, bent around him like a shield.\u201d Now, with his wife passed on, his son grown and his own end very near, he devises a plan to become a census taker, which will take him and his adult son on a cross-country road trip.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe census itself is part of the novel\u2019s central mystery. It is both a survey of the population and an existential measurement. The father explains, \u201cI must, in speaking to a person, know what is special about that individual, and that data must pass through me \u2026 in such a way that what is \u2026 most special about the nation \u2026 could be known and felt.\u201d He asks participants to tell their own unique stories, after which they are marked \u2014 tattooed \u2014 on a rib, proof that they have been tallied. While the census may sound like an Orwellian device, Ball is more concerned with his characters\u2019 emotional lives than with authoritarian foreboding. The father and son move from region to region, entering strangers\u2019 homes, administering the census. With each new encounter a story from the narrator\u2019s life is revealed. The best of these recall him falling in love with his wife, a renowned clown and performance artist who is also one of the novel\u2019s most dynamic characters. In one lovely scene, prompted by his encounter with two eccentric sisters who conjure the Beales of \u201cGrey Gardens,\u201d the narrator remembers a performance in which giant pieces of silverware, a knife and fork, hovered overhead as his wife and other clowns evaded them. In a novel that ruminates so heavily on death, such memories provide a celebratory sense of joy.\n\nWhile Ball accomplishes the stated goal of his preface, bringing the son with Down syndrome to life, the census itself leaves a little to be desired. If the narrator aims to hear each citizen\u2019s story, that which is \u201cmost particular, most special,\u201d he never shares enough details to make a lasting impression. This creates a kind of flatline with regard to the central conceit. Without more of the particulars, \u201cthe small, the overlooked,\u201d it\u2019s hard to understand what the census is meant to measure.\n\nYet the spare and episodic encounters do take us to some tender places. In one scene, a mother who raised a girl with Down syndrome recognizes the narrator as someone who sees what she sees in their children: \u201cThey experience the world just as we do, maybe even in a clearer light.\u201d More than a dystopian tale, \u201cCensus\u201d is a profound and stirring meditation on love, loss and paternity.", "title": "A Dying Father, His Son and One Last Road Trip", "authors": ["Alex Gilvarry", "Jesse Ball"]}

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "As our open-sided Land Cruiser rolled through the reserve, I was impressed by how varied the landscape was. Because of all the rivers and lakes, wide swaths of the Selous are impenetrable \u2014 picture green, overgrown, scratchy and thorny bush. I can only imagine how grueling and tortuous it was for the first batch of explorers, like Frederick Selous, the Victorian hunter and collector whom the reserve was named after, to hack their way through this place. But the Selous also contains wide-open areas, with wavy yellow grass and, in the distance, jagged brown hills; in between are cool forests.\n\nThat afternoon we found ourselves in a cool forest. A light rain fell, more like a mist. It softly brushed our skin, tiny droplets sticking to the hairs on our arms. Our falcon-eyed guide, Zacharia, had found some lion spoor near the road and he was tracking it deeper and deeper into the forest. \u201cThere!\u201d he finally said, and we all followed where his finger was pointing. Just up ahead a lioness and her three cubs wrestled on a log. We drove even closer and Zacharia cut the engine. We rolled to a stop just a few feet away. Oblivious to us, the lions pawed each other\u2019s heads, pushed each other off the slippery log, tumbled down and hit the muddy ground and sprang back up, training for the rigors of hunts to come. It was as if they were playing king of the mountain but there was clearly a point to it.\n\nWhat made our experience even sweeter was that we were by ourselves. So many times when you\u2019re on safari and spot lions in action, the drivers get on the radio and next thing you know, several other trucks come chugging in, tourists popping out the sunroofs of their trucks, snapping photos like crazy. Here, we were the only car for miles.\n\nThat\u2019s the magic of this place. It\u2019s all yours. My friend Rob Ross spent four years photographing it for a lavish photo book, \u201cThe Selous in Africa: A Long Way From Anywhere.\u201d (Some of Ross\u2019s shots illustrate this story.) He slogged through mucky water, got chewed up by tsetse flies, waited in the intense heat for sleepy wild dogs to wake up and go on a hunt (and sometimes they didn\u2019t feel like it), and he still considers those four years the most rewarding of his life.\n\nWhere else, he asks, can you \u201cactually feel like you might have been the first person to stand where you\u2019re standing for 10 or a hundred or a thousand years?\u201d\n\nI guess the dominant feeling I had in the Selous was being free. Lake Manze Camp made that feeling even deeper. We didn\u2019t have to keep anyone else\u2019s schedule. Shaun gave us a four-wheel drive truck and assigned us a driver and a guide. We could get up when we wanted and drive (or boat) around when we wanted and have our meals in the bush, if we wanted.\n\nEvery part of the reserve we visited brought the same joys: few cars, zero garbage, trees and plants and wildflowers that couldn\u2019t have looked much healthier, and lots of animals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Shaun put it on our last evening when we gathered for a final beer by the fire: \u201cThere are now traffic cops in the Kruger.\u201d (He was referring to South Africa\u2019s best known wildlife park, which has paved roads cutting across it and the occasional traffic jam.) \u201cThis,\u201d Shaun said, spreading his arms as wide as possible, \u201cis the real Africa.\u201d\n\nOver the years, in my travels across Africa, I\u2019ve heard that claim many times, in many different places. Who knows what the \u201creal\u201d Africa is. So many of us outsiders seem to be on a search for the Africa we imagined. And for the Africans who live in this part of the world, what we romanticize is simply their home.\n\nBut that said, there is something undeniably special, and moving, about these last undisturbed places. And standing outside in the dying twilight, surrounded by miles of bush, in the middle of one of the last great untouched spaces left on the continent, I knew exactly what Shaun meant.", "title": "A Family Adventure in the Wild Heart of Tanzania", "authors": ["Jeffrey Gettleman"]}

Others suggest that the truck driver, who had only recently completed his training, may have encountered a problem when turning his vehicle left onto Highway 35 and was struck because of a moment\u2019s inattention by the bus driver.\n\nBut no one knows, and there is no obvious explanation. On Wednesday it claimed another victim: Dayna Brons, the team\u2019s athletic therapist.\n\nThe crash, which also injured 13 people, occurred at about 5 p.m. The skies were clear, and the highway free of snow and ice. For the truck driver, the sun was directly ahead as he headed west on Highway 335. But at that time of day, it is still relatively high in the sky.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking: \u2018Is this a really dangerous intersection?\u2019\u201d said Art Lalonde, a farmer who is the top elected official of this small rural municipality. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not. You can see for miles and it\u2019s absolutely straight.\u201d\n\nAt the spot where Highway 335 crosses over Highway 35, the remains of the truck and bus have been taken away. But the air was pungent with the odor of diesel fuel and churned-up earth covered with peat moss, the truck\u2019s cargo.\n\nA shrine, started with a flower cross left by the police, was slowly growing. Stuffed animals, flowers, cards and crosses made from hockey sticks had accumulated. A truck driver stopped, ran out to leave a solar-powered lamp and burst into tears before running back to his cab.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection, known as Armley Corner, has a notorious past. Six white crosses mark a collision in 1997 that killed six family members. They were in a pickup truck that went through the Highway 335 stop sign and was then hit by a tractor-trailer truck traveling on Highway 35.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe oversize stop signs, warning lights and streetlights on Highway 335 appeared the next year.\n\nLike many rural highways in Saskatchewan, which has a population of 1.1 million, traffic volume is comparatively light. According to the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure, between 1,100 and 1,320 vehicles travel daily on Highway 35, the road the hockey team took; Highway 335, the truck\u2019s route, has about half that amount of traffic.\n\nWhile fatalities from bus crashes are rare in Canada, collisions involving them are relatively common. According to Transport Canada, a federal department, between 2010 and 2015, the most recently available dates, buses were involved in 4,026 collisions, with 574 passengers injured. But during that period, only one passenger died.\n\nThe players traveling on the bus ranged in age from 16 to 21. Most had left their families elsewhere in Western Canada and come to live with families in Humboldt to advance their hockey careers.\n\nFor them and other members of junior hockey teams across the country, buses become almost as much a part of their lives as ice rinks. While team bus travel is not unique to hockey, as a winter sport it often means taking to the road in potentially dangerous weather.\n\nThe routes plied by junior teams like the Broncos often follow secondary highways linking remote communities. The Broncos were going northeast from Humboldt, population 4,800, to a playoff match against their archrivals in Nipawin, population 4,000.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFor me, it was 21 years on a bus.\u201d said Dean Brockman, a former head coach of the Broncos \u201cWhen you live on a bus, 85 percent of the time you feel like it\u2019s safe.

The closest one was about two miles away.\n\nWhatever happened, the bus and the truck collided with colossal force. The crash largely removed the roof from the bus and the two heavy vehicles traveled a considerable distance, both apparently on their sides, before coming to a stop in a small field to the northwest.\n\nBrian Starkell, the chief of the Nipawin Fire Department, was one of the emergency workers on the scene. He said he had never come across such carnage in his 40-year career.\n\n\u201cNobody should ever have to see that,\u201d he said. A crane was needed to move the bus roof out of the way and, he said, firefighters shimmied under its wreck to extract some of the injured.\n\nSean Brandow, the team\u2019s chaplain, was driving to the game behind the team.

Margot\u2019s main fear is that someone will take her daughter away. The gun is \u201clike an umbrella in the rain,\u201d she tells Pearl, perhaps the attitude of many women: 80 percent of those gunned down in the United States by intimate partners are women.\n\n\u201cGun Love\u201d is the American half of a diptych of novels by Clement about gun traffic between the United States and Mexico, the first being \u201cPrayers for the Stolen\u201d (2013). A longtime resident of Mexico who is now president of PEN International, she is well aware of the statistics: More than 70 percent of the 74,000 firearms confiscated in Mexico between 2009 and 2014 came from the United States, and nearly $276 million was tied up in Mexican contracts with American-based gun manufacturers between 2015 and 2016. Oddly enough, Florida, the location of the trailer court around which much of the action in \u201cGun Love\u201d unfolds, leads the nation in both the number of mobile home parks and concealed weapons permits. \u201cIn our part of Florida things were always being gifted a bullet just for the sake of it,\u201d Pearl observes. In the more than 10 years since the passage of Florida\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law, giving widespread legal immunity to people who use lethal force in self-defense, the number of \u201cjustifiable homicide\u201d cases in the state has nearly tripled. In 2012 the unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was gunned down and his killer later acquitted as a direct consequence of \u201cStand Your Ground.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nClement\u2019s turn to fiction is oddly dreamy for such a topic, as if to suggest the self-delusion of the real-life actors involved. \u201cMy mother was always full of birthday-candle wishes,\u201d comments Pearl, who habitually steals cigarettes in a kind of self-immolation of her own. But the writing is crisp and the images sharp: a field of 63 Barbies buried up to their knees around a trailer; the hatching of conjoined twin alligators \u201cstill with white pieces of eggshell on the green, scaly back they shared.\u201d\n\nTrailer parks in fiction often stand as metaphors for the fear of homelessness; to live in a car parked beside one is that much more frightening. It encourages descriptions of surreal coping, such as one in which Margot fingers the dashboard: \u201cThat was Mozart, she said. Did you like it?\u201d The denizens of the trailers, distinguishable by who drinks Coke and who drinks Pepsi, turn sinister as the guns pile up. Sergeant Bob gives his woman a gun to nestle between her breasts. \u201cI thought he was going to give me a ring,\u201d she says. While Margot and Eli hook up in the Mercury\u2019s back seat, guns start to crowd the abandoned trailer where Pearl does her homework. Guns are the focus of another neighbor, Pastor Rex, who runs a \u201cGive Your Guns to God\u201d campaign that partially supplies a group of traffickers. \u201cDid you know there are two bullets for every person in the world?\u201d Pearl\u2019s boyfriend asks (a statistic confirmed by Oxfam in 2012). Toward the end of the book, Pearl names the models she packs in newspaper, a veritable litany that includes semiautomatics, .223-caliber AR-15 rifles and the Bushmaster XM-15. It sounds like worship. Nikolas Cruz, who killed 17 people in a Florida high school in February, found it easier to buy a semiautomatic than a handgun.", "title": "A Florida Trailer Park Awash in Lethal Weapons", "authors": []}

He believes Bitcoin, the original virtual currency, can remain exempt from securities regulations.\n\nMr. Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industry.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and the agency that Mr. Gensler led from 2009 to 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are in the middle of determining how to categorize and crack down on many of the virtual currencies created in recent years.\n\nMost of the focus has been on smaller currencies that were issued through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, a method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies.\n\nBut Mr. Gensler believes that better-known virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities, given the way they have been created and sold.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201c2018 is going to be a very interesting time,\u201d Mr. Gensler said. \u201cOver 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings, and over 100 exchanges that offer I.C.O.s, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with U.S. securities law.\u201d\n\nThe people behind both Ether and Ripple have argued that their tokens are not securities. But there are signs that the S.E.C. could be receptive to Mr. Gensler\u2019s argument. Regulators have indicated in private meetings with industry participants that they are considering whether Ether should be categorized as a security.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll the outstanding Ether were worth around $65 billion at Sunday\u2019s price, while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around $35 billion.\n\nIf they are deemed to be securities, it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded. That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their prices.\n\nMr. Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nBefore he got into office, some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks. But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisis.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, said the combination of Mr. Gensler\u2019s record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to M.I.T.\n\nMr. Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who don\u2019t have a financial interest in them, though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin software.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that you have a core group of people who aren\u2019t in it for the money, and who care about the proper architecture for the long run,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fall.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is needed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Mr. Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry.\n\nFor now, though, his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulated.\n\nMost industry experts, including Mr. Gensler, assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization, and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers. Some other virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs.\n\nBut Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEther could get off the hook, Mr. Gensler said, because its development has been more decentralized recently, and new Ether tokens are now given out to so-called miners through a network.\n\nAya Miyaguchi, the head of the Ethereum Foundation, said in an email that the foundation \u201cneither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether, and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds (under 1 percent of all Ether) is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participants.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token, known as XRP, to avoid being categorized as a security. The company that oversees Ripple\u2019s development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable, he said.\n\nA spokesman for the company Ripple, Tom Channick, said XRP should not be a security.\n\n\u201cXRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple, and they are not paid dividends,\u201d he said. \u201cXRP exists independent of Ripple, was created before the company and will exist after it.\u201d\n\nMr. Gensler, who has no virtual currency investments, said he was not tied to any coin\u2019s winning the race.

Though Brendan, then 20, held no position with the league, he immediately became something rare: an openly gay man with proximity to the N.H.L.\n\nBurke threw an arm around his son, and the father became a champion of gay rights in sports, marching forward by Brendan\u2019s side until the moment unimaginable grief found him.

Through Hockey Is For Everyone and You Can Play, an N.H.L.-backed initiative founded in 2012 by Burke\u2019s elder son, Patrick, the league has made strides. Burke said Flames players had approached him unsolicited, reporting that if there were ever any gay players on the team, they would be greeted warmly.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf the first openly gay man to play in the N.H.L., whoever he should be and whenever he should arrive, Burke said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to find that the road isn\u2019t as rocky as he thinks it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the five years since Jason Collins became the first openly gay man to play in the N.B.A., and Michael Sam followed as the first openly gay man to be drafted by an N.F.L. team, professional leagues have been trying to ensure sports are a place where all feel welcome.\n\nBut in a culture where anti-gay slurs have for decades been used casually as verbal digs, progress has been rocky. In 2011, Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers was fined $100,000 for muttering an anti-gay slur toward a referee. In 2015, Rajon Rondo of the Sacramento Kings was suspended one game for yelling the same word at the referee Bill Kennedy, who later revealed he was gay. A year later, Andrew Shaw of the Chicago Blackhawks was suspended for a playoff game for using the slur. Baseball players have also been suspended in recent years for using homophobic language.\n\nThe Shaw suspension was a landmark measure by the N.H.L.

They\u2019re jerks in the car. They\u2019re jerks at the store. And they start destroying the house the minute we get home.\u201d So the big, existential culinary decisions in her household aren\u2019t between homemade mayonnaise and store-bought? \u201cNo, for us, the question is, are we going to cook, or are we going to eat takeout every night?\u201d she said.\n\nI don\u2019t have children, but I can relate. My own green goddess recipe is a commitment, and the first ingredient it calls for is lots of time. It starts with pur\u00e9eing herbs into olive oil, then whisking that fragrant oil into a stiff mayonnaise with avocado, garlic and anchovy. Since the mayonnaise is unseasoned, it requires so much tinkering and tasting to get the right balance of salt and acid that by the time the dressing is right, I can\u2019t stomach having more of it on a salad. Between the blender, bowl, ladle and whisk, I\u2019m left with a sink full of dirty dishes and a wall splattered with green herb oil. I\u2019d never think to make it on a weeknight.\n\nIn contrast, Jessica\u2019s version comes together quickly in a food processor. When I texted her with surprise at how simple the recipe is, she modestly responded, \u201cYou learn to do everything twice as fast when you have two kids.\u201d Mayonnaise and full-fat Greek yogurt give the dressing richness and tang, while parsley, tarragon and basil lend the springtime perfume of fine herbs. Two anchovy fillets offer salt and a rumor of umami. The recipe is so mouth-smackingly perfect that it doesn\u2019t require any adjusting.\n\nThe second time I made Jessica\u2019s dressing, I took it to a friend\u2019s house for brunch. In a big bowl, I used my hands to coat romaine, avocado and cucumber with the dressing. The adults could barely stop snacking on the salad before we sat down to eat. But the real triumph was watching a highly opinionated 4-year-old eat an entire plate and then, very politely, ask for seconds.\n\nThe next day, I let Jessica know I was a convert. \u201cSure, you could make the salad with homemade mayo,\u201d she offered, \u201cbut would it be that much more delicious? Probably not. If you\u2019re going to spend your energy somewhere, spend it somewhere that matters.\u201d\n\nJessica concedes that there are times when it really is worth it to whisk oil into an egg yolk, drop by painstaking drop. She even offers a recipe for her own aioli a few pages later, gently guiding the reader through the process. \u201cA dollop of aioli,\u201d she writes, \u201cimproves many things \u2014 fried potatoes, steamed vegetables and canned tuna.\u201d I\u2019d add a summer tomato salad, grilled or chilled shrimp, artichokes cooked any way and leftover roast chicken, straight from the fridge.

Their statement said that, in light of the new policy, they felt a need to \u201cunderscore that transgender troops are as medically fit as their non-transgender peers and that there is no medically valid reason, including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, to exclude them from military service or to limit their access to medically necessary care.\u201d\n\nThe new policy, which panders to right-wing zealots like Vice President Mike Pence and to regressive generals, overturned President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 decision to protect gender identity in the Pentagon\u2019s equal opportunity policy.\n\nMr. Trump issued the new policy after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis advised him there were \u201csubstantial risks\u201d about personnel who seek to change or who question their gender identity, which \u201ccould undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that is not conducive to military effectiveness and lethality.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, believes in banning transgender people or felt hemmed in after Mr. Trump decreed the ban in a series of tweets last July.\n\nA 2016 RAND study had already concluded that letting transgender people serve would have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on Pentagon readiness and health care costs. Now, a new study by the Palm Center, which advocates for transgender rights, offers a point-by-point rebuttal of Mr. Mattis\u2019s comments and the Pentagon report, arguing they mischaracterized research and made other unfounded assertions.\n\nContrary to Pentagon claims, the study says the Pentagon\u2019s own data shows that transgender people are deployable and medically fit and that the new Trump policy would impose double standards on transgender service members by applying medical rules and expectations that don\u2019t apply to others. One compelling statistic: Of the 994 service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2016-2017, 393 were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and only one was unable to complete the deployment because of mental health reasons.", "title": "Opinion | A Growing Problem for the Military Transgender Ban: Facts", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "Whenever President Putin is touted as the world\u2019s most powerful or influential politician, I feel puzzled. The rules that Mr. Putin follows are technical. He is no philosopher of government; he is a skilled practitioner. These rules are simply ad hoc mechanisms for holding onto power in a dangerous environment. And the Kremlin political managers are skillful plumbers who deal with old leaky piping and loathe the idea of replacing it.\n\nDo other nations really have anything to learn from them?\n\nI would argue that perceived similarities between President Trump\u2019s thinking and Mr. Putin\u2019s do not necessarily mean that Mr. Trump has been learning from Russia\u2019s president. When your objective, like Mr. Trump\u2019s, is surviving in power, you arrive, on your own, at pragmatic rules that work for you. The extent to which President Trump values survival is unique among Western leaders. Mr. Putin has been fighting for survival for years, and he has become a grandmaster of that dark art.\n\nBut playing this game has consequences. Just as the Kremlin has ad hoc rules, most Russians have some, too. They \u201cget\u201d what it takes to prosper in their system: Pretend you are loyal, tell the interviewer you approve of the president, mark the right box and there you go. Freedom!\n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound heroic, but heroes are a rare breed. The Russian people and the Russian state cohabitate, each minding its own business.\n\nDisasters and tragedies are occasions when state and people meet. Sparks of conflict start to fly because both sides realize they\u2019ve been fooling each other. The Kremlin and its viceroys have pretended to manage, and the people on the ground have pretended to be loyal. There\u2019s a crisis of loyalty, if you will. It\u2019s not that loyalty is lacking; it\u2019s that there\u2019s too much loyalty, and it\u2019s all fake. And that brings a moment of truth, when everyone realizes that Russians would jump at any opportunity to turn their relationship with the state back on its feet.\n\nBut all of that goes away quickly because it bumps up against precisely what the Kremlin is there for: to close down the pockets of normalcy. Any attempt at holding the president accountable is made so costly for the people, and the propaganda of the opposite view is so relentless, that Russians put up with all of this just to stay out of trouble and have a normal life.\n\nThe principles recounted above are not the sort in which you choose to believe; they must be imposed. And by the time you recognize that a system like this is around you, it is probably too late to resist. You will have to learn the Putin creed or something similar.\n\nSo, really, there is no rush to learn from him.", "title": "Opinion | A Guide to Getting Along in Putin\u2019s Russia", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-14 00:00:00", "text": "So far, officials say, two factors make them wonder whether the facilities were still central to Syria\u2019s program. At this point, there are no known casualties at the sites, which suggests that either no one was there during the evening, or they had been previously abandoned. And there are no reports of chemical agent leakage from the sites, despite attacks by more than 100 sea- and air-launched missiles.\n\nWhether those particular sites were still in use or not, the conflict in Syria has demonstrated a larger truth: While it is easy to blow up Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical facilities, it is also relatively simple for him to reconstitute them elsewhere, or just turn to a commercially available substance like chlorine to make a crude poison that any nation is allowed to possess.\n\nThat may explain why General McKenzie was a little more circumspect than his predecessors in forecasting the long-range effectiveness of the latest strikes.\n\n\u201cI would say there\u2019s still a residual element of the Syrian program that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told reporters at the Pentagon on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI believe that we took the heart of it out with the attacks that we accomplished last night,\u201d he continued. But he added that \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that they are going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future.\u201d Instead, he said, he believed that \u201cthey\u2019ll think long and hard about it.\u201d\n\nHis comment seemed to reflect a central fact: Mr. Assad has learned a lot about how to hide his stockpiles from inspectors. One of the failings of the accord between Russia and the United States that was supposed to rid Syria of chemical arms in 2014 was that it was based on Syria\u2019s \u201cdeclared\u201d stockpiles, a nuance Mr. Kerry took care to note. There was never confidence that the Russians had succeeded in removing as many weapons stores as they claimed, or in destroying production facilities.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the sites struck on Saturday, the Barzeh research and development center, has long been known to American intelligence officials and to international inspectors, according to a senior intelligence official.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdministration officials briefing reporters Saturday afternoon said that equipment at that site and two others \u2014 the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility and a nearby \u201cbunker facility\u201d \u2014 was destroyed, setting back Mr. Assad\u2019s program by months or years. But they were careful not to claim that the facilities were actively in use at the time of the attack.\n\n\u201cIn relation to the Barzeh target, yes, we assessed that there were probably some chemical and nerve agents in that target,\u201d General McKenzie said. Those, however, could have been residual, or long abandoned.\n\nSophisticated facilities are not needed to produce chlorine, the agent that Syrian forces are suspected to have used a week ago to kill dozens of civilians, including children. It is commercially available, used for water systems. And the nerve agent sarin, which the White House has said may also have been used a week ago, can be produced just about anywhere, as a French intelligence report released on Saturday noted.\n\nThe report concludes that \u201cthe Syrian military retains expertise from its traditional chemical weapons agent program to both use sarin and produce and deploy chlorine munitions.\u201d The United States, it noted, \u201calso assesses the regime still has chemicals \u2014 specifically sarin and chlorine \u2014 that it can use in future attacks.\u201d\n\nThat is a stark difference from the declarations made in June 2014, when the joint mission between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons trumpeted that Syria or other parties had destroyed, with the exception of a dozen facilities, all \u201cdeclared production, mixing and filling equipment and munitions, as well as many buildings associated with its declared chemical weapons program.\u201d\n\nChlorine presents a particular challenge for governments and organizations seeking to control chemical weapons. It is both very lethal and very necessary, and legal to possess in all nations, said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Using it the way Mr. Assad\u2019s forces have \u2014 essentially dropping it in concentrated form in a barrel \u2014 can lead to far more casualties.\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous prospect was that someone would use chlorine in the way that the Syrian regime has done and disperse it in a whole community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a dangerous element, and you cannot remove it from any environment in the Middle East,\u201d given its importance in water purification.\n\nAs a result, chemical weapons treaties do not bar its possession. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which went into force in 1997 and which Syria joined, under pressure, in 2013, does bar deliberately using it as a poison gas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNations have been finding loopholes in such international agreements \u2014 or ignoring them entirely \u2014 since the first failed efforts to bar such weaponry more than a century ago. Mr. Assad has clearly calculated that turning a widely available chemical into a weapon to clear out neighborhoods and create terror is a potent option.\n\n\u201cFor me, the big story is chlorine; it\u2019s not sarin,\u201d Mr. Knights said. \u201cThe regime has been good at using a chemical weapon that has enormous availability and is produced in completely legal, dual-use facilities and vital to the running of any country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntent is the problem when you\u2019ve got a regime that loves using this stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cYou either have to deter the regime from using it by imposing significant costs, or you have to get rid of the regime. But there is no way you can get rid of the capability.\u201d\n\nNo international investigative body has yet determined what chemicals were used in the attack last Saturday in Douma, near Damascus. The American intelligence assessments suggest that while chlorine was the primary chemical, \u201csome additional information points to the regime also using\u201d sarin, which is more dangerous and harder to handle.\n\nVideos taken in the aftermath of the attack show large yellow canisters that experts have said appear to be chlorine tanks, of the kind often used for civilian purposes.\n\nSome videos show one canister that appears to have either broken through a wall or flown through a hole in it and landed on a bed without exploding.\n\nAnother video shows a similar canister that appears to have knocked a hole in the concrete roof of an apartment building.\n\nSyrian activists who visited the site, as well as a report by Bellingcat, a group that conducts investigations with open-source data, said that the canister had fallen on the roof of a building where dozens of people had been sheltering on the lower floors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe available evidence suggests that whatever substance was in the canister was released after it landed and wafted down the stairs, killing those on the floors below.\n\nSubsequent videos show dozens of men, women and children lying lifeless on the ground with foam coming from their mouths and nostrils and what appear to be burned corneas. Both symptoms can be caused by chlorine.\n\nIn a series of tweets after studying the attack, Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, said that the canister appeared to have been dropped toward no specific target, and had just happened to land on a densely packed building.\n\nHad the canister fallen elsewhere, Mr. Higgins wrote, \u201cwe\u2019d see a fraction of deaths, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have even heard about it happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really just thanks to the catastrophic success of the chlorine attack that anyone even cared, not anything that Assad could have planned for,\u201d Mr. Higgins wrote.", "title": "A Hard Lesson in Syria: Assad Can Still Gas His Own People", "authors": ["David E.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "This slow, impersonal, courtroom-based approach to end-of-life decision-making is a far cry from the prompt, patient-centered, bedside care that all of us deserve.\n\nThis legalistic approach to end-of-life decision-making also creates unreasonable expectations of legal guardians. Most loved ones have a sense of what the patient they represent would want at the end of life, but they would probably squirm to justify that intuition in a court of law. Yet this is routine for legal guardians of people with intellectual disabilities in my state and others with similar laws. This biases our care toward continuation of what are often uncomfortable, aggressive and potentially unwanted end-of-life treatments.\n\nMy patient\u2019s legal guardian was not a family member, but she had known him for years before this hospitalization. She said my patient\u2019s quality of life came from interacting non-verbally with caregivers, listening to music, and eating favorite foods like applesauce. She described the excited hoots he would make when interacting with a favorite nurse.\n\nThe contrast to what my patient was experiencing in the I.C.U. was stark. He was sedated. His unsmiling mouth drooped open, a breathing tube between his lips. In place of music, there were the beeps and whirs of the machines that kept him alive. He could not eat. Plastic tubes penetrated every orifice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

His muscles grew weaker and stiffer. He developed skin sores and infections. He needed minor surgeries to place the tubes that delivered artificial nutrition and artificial breaths every hour of the day.\n\nSeeing all of this, my patient\u2019s guardian did not think my patient would want to live this way. The I.C.U. can save your life, but it is not where most of us want to die.\n\nIn other states, patients with intellectual disabilities have an equal right, via the advocacy of their legal guardians, to avoid unwanted care. A 2010 New York State law, for instance, lets the legal guardians of people with intellectual disabilities withdraw life-sustaining therapies as long as doing so fits the guardian\u2019s sense of the patient\u2019s wishes.\n\nIn accord, a policy statement from the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities states, \u201cWithdrawing or withholding care may be appropriate in some situations \u2026. Treatment should not be withdrawn or withheld only because a person has a disability.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis reference to substandard medical treatment of people with disabilities is important. In hospitals across the country, people with disabilities have been subject to all manner of substandard care, including inappropriately premature discontinuation of end-of-life care. This has improved over the past few decades, but a new systematic review shows people with intellectual disabilities still have difficulty accessing high quality end-of-life care, including palliative care specialists. That means the medical system routinely shortchanges people with intellectual disabilities at the end of life, and states like mine add legal insult to that medical injury.\n\nMy patient\u2019s caregivers held several multidisciplinary meetings to choose the right way forward. There was consensus that the medical prognosis was dim, and the legal guardian said the patient did not have adequate quality of life. Multiple physicians wrote letters to support a petition to the court to refocus care around comfort and dignity. Ultimately, the legal guardian and the Office of Public Guardian felt they could decline continued intensive care only if it was completely futile, and decided not to submit the petition to the court.\n\nTo date, my patient has spent over 140 days in the hospital with little overall improvement. He has endured multiple medical interventions, and unavoidable complications are mounting. Unless the laws change, I.C.U.s across the nation will continue to do the same thing to other patients just like him.", "title": "A Harder Death for People With Intellectual Disabilities", "authors": ["Tim Lahey"]}

King, Republican of New York.\n\nWhether that is what he wants to do is unknown at the moment.

His run for vice president on the national Republican ticket in 2012 never came up.

He later told CNN that he had no intention of running for the White House.\n\nShould he enter national politics again, Mr. Ryan\u2019s legacy in the House will no doubt be an issue. He was a champion of fiscal responsibility who will be leaving behind huge deficits piling up under full Republican control of Congress and the White House.

But one of his chief goals \u2014 simplification of the tax code by reducing an array of deductions \u2014 was watered down in the final negotiations as Republicans hunted for votes for passage.\n\nThe explosion in red ink has become such a political albatross that House Republicans set a vote for Thursday on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution in an attempt to demonstrate that they are serious about fiscal discipline despite their recent actions. The measure was widely ridiculed in Washington.\n\nMr. Ryan acknowledged his disappointment at failing to get the federal fiscal house in order, but he took some solace in the fact that he had at least \u201cnormalized\u201d the idea of trying to rein in spending on politically charged programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s desire to spend more time with his children is no doubt sincere \u2014 he was a teenager when his own father died \u2014 and he is known for regularly attending their sporting events in Janesville, Wis.\n\nAs for his effect on the midterms, he said he did not believe anyone\u2019s race was \u201cgoing to hinge on whether Paul Ryan\u2019s speaker or not.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame Mr. Trump for driving him out, and instead credited him for helping Republicans enact tax changes.\n\nBut just a few years ago, Mr. Ryan was hailed as the bright future of Republicans.

He had a sense of foreboding, though he could not know that the following week he would be arrested by security forces and spend almost a whole year in that very penitentiary. During those endless days and nights, everything was done to break his will: solitary confinement, pressure to confess by cruel supervisors and the humiliation of being manacled while receiving medical attention.\n\nThe story of how he survived that ordeal with \u201cthe cunning instinct of the hunted,\u201d first published in 1982 under the title \u201cDetained,\u201d has now been revised by the author and reissued as \u201cWrestling With the Devil.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA welcome addition to the vast literature produced by jailed writers across the centuries (Boethius, Cervantes, Gramsci, Soyinka, Solzhenitsyn, Peltier), this book has several traits that make it special. Ngugi does not wish to enthrone his experience as unique. Instead, he sees his detention as a mere link in a chain of previous internments dating back to the British occupation of Kenya and continuing under the corrupt post-independence regime. A third of the book therefore describes, not his own daily ritual of endurance, as most memoirs of this sort do, but a history of repression and resistance in his homeland, strewn with exhortations to liberate Africa from foreign domination. This formulaic repetition of revolutionary rhetoric \u2014 a bit wearisome even to this sympathetic reader \u2014 has, admittedly, an organic function. Ngugi is affording us a glimpse into how a prisoner of conscience, by stubbornly reiterating his convictions, keeps faith with the ideals that those in power want him to betray.\n\nFortunately for his readers, Ngugi possesses an even more powerful weapon for maintaining his sense of self. He was indefinitely detained without a trial because he dared to write a play about the complicity of Kenya\u2019s rulers in the plundering of the country. What incensed the authorities was less the social critique than the fact that the play, rather than being written in the English of Ngugi\u2019s acclaimed subversive novels, \u201cPetals of Blood\u201d and \u201cA Grain of Wheat,\u201d was created in the author\u2019s native Gikuyu language and performed by peasants and workers for large audiences.\n\nPunished for reaching outside the boundaries of elite literature, Ngugi reacted by renewing his love affair with Gikuyu, writing in prison the first novel ever composed in that language of his ancestors, an act of defiance and decolonization that appropriates a Western genre and gives it an indigenous twist \u2014 a feat not without tension and risk. The authors he idolizes \u2014 Dickens, Chekhov, Sartre, Tolstoy, George Eliot, Sylvia Plath, William Blake, Shakespeare \u2014 have never been translated into Gikuyu. There is no model for what he wishes to achieve. Ngugi will explore many years later, in his seminal essay \u201cDecolonizing the Mind,\u201d the complexities of such a creative journey. But in prison, he is intent not on theory but on producing what will eventually be his experimental masterpiece, \u201cDevil on the Cross.\u201d It is a novel that must be scribbled down clandestinely, on toilet paper. His narrative of the devilish temptations he faced and the ruses used to thwart his jailers as he sat writing night after night in his cell shows Ngugi in full command of his craft.\n\nThis thrilling testament to the human spirit had, for me, a fierce resonance. I read Ngugi\u2019s memoir in Chile, not far from where friends and comrades were imprisoned and tortured during the Pinochet dictatorship. I could not help feeling that his luminous words were meant for those victims and many others being persecuted across the world, a way of urging humanity to never surrender to the demons of fear and silence.", "title": "A Kenyan Writer and Dissident on His Year in Prison", "authors": ["Ariel Dorfman", "Ngugi Wa Thiong O"]}

They were treated from 1992 to 2012.\n\nThose who received pumps (785) survived a median of 67 months, compared with 44 months for patients who did not get them (1,583). The result was especially striking, Dr. D\u2019Angelica said, because patients who got pumps were sicker to begin with.\n\nThe report was not based on the strongest type of evidence, which would come from a controlled study with patients picked at random to receive one treatment or another. But the researchers said the evidence was the strongest that could be obtained without a randomized study.\n\nDr. Kemeny began recommending the pump in the 1980s, and Memorial Sloan Kettering has been a leader in its use. Other centers also used it, but many stopped in the mid-to-late 1990s, thinking that improved chemotherapy would make it unnecessary. But there were still patients who needed the pump. Now, just as the device is being phased out, medical interest in it has started to rebound.\n\nDr. Kemeny never gave it up.

They raised E.W., the eldest, and his siblings, Flora and Willie Wade, in Forrest City, Ark., and later in Memphis. Higginbottom\u2019s mother told the children their father had been hanged but didn\u2019t share many details. And she almost never spoke of her dead husband\u2019s character, habits or looks \u2014 the stories of his life. Maybe grief kept her quiet. Or fear. Either way, Higginbottom knew better than to mention his daddy. Sometimes he asked his cousins Dorothy and Olivia about him, but they told him to leave it alone. Don\u2019t mess around in that, they said. You might get hurt.\n\nHigginbottom had occasionally returned to Oxford when he was younger, chaperoned by uncles who wanted to visit relatives or take in a service at the family\u2019s former church. But it had been a long time. He stared at the fields consumed by kudzu, the gravel drives, the hardwoods lush with summer growth, and saw only a foreign country. \u201cI was trying to see something I recognized around here, but I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt don\u2019t look like I ever lived down here.\u201d As they sped closer to Oxford, he kept gazing out the window, scanning the landscape for even a spark of memory.\n\nWhat does it mean to confront the past? This is a question that has dogged Washington and her family their whole lives, but also one that\u2019s increasingly urgent for a country that has yet to achieve the equality many thought would follow the civil rights movement. African-Americans lag behind white Americans in almost every conceivable measure of well-being: educational attainment, homeownership rates, income, health outcomes, life expectancy. Black men are far more likely than their white counterparts to fall into poverty, to be incarcerated, to be shot to death by the police. \u201cBlack and brown people are still presumed dangerous and guilty,\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal-aid organization in Montgomery, Ala., that has led recent efforts to re-examine the lynching era. \u201cThere are these terrible disparities in quality of life for people of color, and you begin asking questions about why these things persist, and I think it inevitably leads to wanting to talk more concretely about history.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s grandfather was one of at least 4,100 African-Americans who were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in 12 states clustered along the curve from Virginia to Texas. Although racially motivated lynchings also took place in other states, they were far more common in the South. Black men accused of violent crimes \u2014 many of whom were very likely innocent \u2014 were frequent targets. But other black men, and women and even children, too, were lynched for insisting on their rights, or for minor violations of the racial caste system, like failing to step off a sidewalk to make way for a white person. On April 26, Stevenson\u2019s organization will open the country\u2019s first memorial to lynching victims, alongside a museum to racial injustice, in Montgomery.\n\nE.J.I.\u2019s National Memorial for Peace and Justice will feature 800 suspended columns \u2014 one for each county where documented lynchings occurred \u2014 engraved with victims\u2019 names. The design is intended to convey scope but also, more ambitiously, to reshape a Southern landscape awash in Confederate symbols by asking each of those 800 counties to claim a duplicate marker and erect the six-foot monolith on its home soil. \u201cIn Berlin, you can\u2019t go anywhere without seeing stones and markers dedicated to the Jewish and Roma residents who were forced from their homes and taken to the concentration camps,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cAnd that iconography creates a consciousness of what happened that I think is necessary for that society to recover. In the American South, we\u2019ve done the opposite. We\u2019ve actually created symbols designed to make us feel great about our history, about the 19th century, about the good old days of the early 20th century.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStevenson has advocated fuller acknowledgment of the impact lynching had on African-Americans, both in terms of the trauma sustained and the concrete ways lynching disadvantaged communities. In some places, lynchings were accompanied by mob destruction of black business districts, adding economic devastation to sorrow. And African-Americans who migrated north or west to escape the threat of violence had to start over. Many left social networks, homes and businesses, making it extraordinarily difficult for families to build intergenerational wealth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nE.J.I.\u2019s point of view stems from earlier scholarship and activism that tried to foster lasting conversations about lynching and puncture popular myths about the practice, like the notions that lynchings were isolated aberrations, pioneer justice or the work of social outsiders like the Ku Klux Klan. The unsettling \u201cWithout Sanctuary\u201d exhibit, for example, made its debut in New York in 2000 and featured graphic photos of burned and mutilated black bodies surrounded by jubilant white crowds, some of which swelled into the thousands. Among the most disturbing images were those of white children in the crowds, some with expressions of smug delight on their faces. \u201cIf you want to talk about what stands in that place of distrust between blacks and whites, that\u2019s part of it \u2014 not that there are just individuals, but hundreds or thousands of white witnesses who might stand beside and fail to stop this,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the author of \u201cOn the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d \u201cThis is powerful, to unpack the complicity of those who remained silent and stood by and watched. That always has to be reckoned with, and we have to deal with that today.\u201d\n\nThe gruesome nature of lynchings, Ifill noted, was the main point; they were meant to haunt and intimidate, and to thus ensure the continuation of white supremacy. Stevenson makes a point of calling them \u201cracial terror lynchings.\u201d The killings rippled beyond individual victims and their families to shroud entire communities in fear and shame. In some places, lynching memories suppressed black voter participation for decades. Even today, Ifill and Stevenson said, memories of racial violence can be so traumatic that survivors, witnesses and inheritors stay locked in silence \u2014 much like Higginbottom\u2019s mother, who took her husband\u2019s memory to her grave. \u201cThere are thousands of African-American families with histories of horrific victimization and racial oppression that have never openly talked because it hasn\u2019t felt safe or healthy to have those conversations,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just finding our voice, many of us, to insist on truth telling. And my view on truth and reconciliation is that it\u2019s sequential. You can\u2019t get to reconciliation until you first get to truth.\u201d\n\nWashington \u2014 and her five siblings \u2014 wanted to get to the truth about their family long before they ever imagined returning to Oxford. When they were kids, their father was too angry to talk about his father at length, and other relatives spoke only hesitantly, if at all, about the killing. So the children spun their own stories, embroidering fragments of truth with scenarios lifted from movies and books. Over the years, the theories hardened into beliefs. Wright felt certain that someone \u2014 maybe her mother? \u2014 had said that white men lynched her grandfather because he protested when they tried to force his wife to work the cotton fields. Her brother, David Higginbottom, worried that his grandfather might have been murdered for having an interracial romance. Washington thought about her grandmother\u2019s light skin and wondered if she had been the object of a dispute. \u201cWe grew up thinking that maybe somebody liked my grandmother and maybe it had something to do with her,\u201d Washington said a few days before returning to Oxford. \u201cMaybe it was her fault \u2014 you know, not her fault. But maybe somebody liked her and tried to get to her, and my grandfather tried to protect her.\u201d\n\nThe trip to Oxford\u2019s Winter Institute, which was housed inside a Brutalist hulk of a building on the University of Mississippi campus, marked the culmination of a monthslong unraveling of their grandfather\u2019s story. Earlier in the year, a Northeastern University law student named Kyleen Burke emailed Washington\u2019s cousin Tyrone Higginbottom, who then put her in touch with the rest of the family. She told them that she had done extensive research on their grandfather\u2019s life and death as part of Northeastern\u2019s Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project, which investigates Jim Crow-era cold cases, and she shared some of what she learned so far. As Washington settled into the Winter Institute\u2019s high-ceilinged meeting room, she \u2014 and her sister, father, brother-in-law and children \u2014 were still processing Burke\u2019s avalanche of new information and wondering what else might be revealed.\n\nA few interested community members, black and white, trickled into the room to listen. Tyrone, a son of E.W.\u2019s brother, Willie Wade, who died in 2005, also joined them. Framed photographs of the civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer and the Memphis sanitation workers\u2019 strike hung on the walls, and the leaves of an enormous magnolia tree could be seen fluttering through a window. A tiny woman in her 40s introduced herself as April Grayson, the Winter Institute\u2019s community-building coordinator. Grayson, who is white, grew up in Rolling Fork, Miss., and has done reconciliation work in some of the state\u2019s most divided places, including Neshoba County, where she helped grass-roots activists who pushed to reopen the cases of the Freedom Summer volunteers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who were abducted and murdered in 1964. In 2005, a ringleader and former Klansman who had escaped justice, Edgar Ray Killen, was finally convicted and sentenced to 60 years for the crimes. Grayson read a poem by the Senegalese poet Birago Diop, \u201cThose Who Are Dead Are Never Gone,\u201d and then she invited the family members to introduce themselves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be here, and so excited about learning information, having never met my grandfather,\u201d Wright began. Wright, who is 55, has a beautiful singing voice and an outgoing nature despite the grief she has experienced. Her first husband and her eldest son died young; the son was shot and killed before he turned 30. Sometimes she thinks about her grandfather and wonders if a curse hovers over the family\u2019s men. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to get some information so I can talk to my grandkids, because I have seven,\u201d she said.\n\nBurke was there, too, in the form of a disembodied voice emanating from a phone speaker. Grayson asked her to provide an overview of the lynching, and everyone turned to face a beige landline propped on a chair. Irven Wright aimed his cellphone camera at the room, so he could stream video for family members who couldn\u2019t be there. From his home in Killeen, Tex., David, a 56-year-old Army and Marine Corps veteran, watched and listened. He scrutinized his father, a man who dropped out of school in seventh grade and picked cotton so his mother and siblings could eat, who fought in the Korean War and who for decades worked backbreaking jobs to support Morline Lowe, the Arkansas beauty he married in 1955, and their children. The older man had removed his newsboy-style cap and sat apart from his daughters and grandchildren. \u201cI try to put myself in his shoes,\u201d David said. \u201cI try to be him. I thought, What would my heart feel right now?\u201d As Burke began to speak, David\u2019s father sat bolt upright in his chair, as if braced for a blow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHigginbottom\u2019s father, Elwood Higginbotham, was around 28 in 1935, working as a sharecropper in the Woodson Ridge area northeast of Oxford\u2019s city limits. (It\u2019s unclear how father and son came to spell their surnames differently, but the family believes Higginbotham\u2019s widow may have changed the spelling to cover their tracks after fleeing.) Higginbotham shared a three-bedroom house with his 22-year-old wife, Melissa, and their three children. The youngest, Willie Wade, was still a baby.\n\nIn the 1930s, Oxford and the surrounding areas of Lafayette County remained, in many ways, hardly different from the time of Reconstruction. Cotton reigned as the dominant crop. The county\u2019s population was around 20,000. But change was afoot. Main streets gleamed with pavement rather than dirt. Men found work, even during the Great Depression, building a government-funded dormitory at the University of Mississippi campus, which remained segregated until James Meredith began attending in 1962 amid notoriously violent protests. The town\u2019s most famous literary son, William Faulkner, had already written \u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d and he lived a short walk from the busy town square. Nearby, African-Americans nurtured a middle class in a vibrant Freedmen Town that offered taxis, grocery stores and a Rosenwald School; one former resident described the neighborhood as \u201ca black man\u2019s city in a white man\u2019s town.\u201d\n\nBut Oxford was still a white man\u2019s town, as Higginbotham would discover. Archival documents offer differing accounts of the killing, as is the case with many lynchings. Often newspapers document that a lynching occurred but otherwise prove unreliable. Reporters frequently omitted key facts or filed sensationalized tales of black criminality. Some explicitly sanctioned lynching, even going so far as to announce killings in advance. The Oxford Eagle delivered lackluster coverage of Higginbotham\u2019s death. As recorded in the papers of the civil rights worker Jessie Daniel Ames, an editor at The Eagle later explained to an anti-lynching investigator that \u201che had to live in Oxford and that he wanted to get along with the people there, and that the race situation made it practically impossible to carry the facts about the killing.\u201d\n\nThose facts began on the night of May 21, 1935, months before Higginbotham was killed, according to an investigation by the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, an anti-lynching organization founded in Atlanta in 1919. Higginbotham and his wife, the commission reported, were in their bedroom that spring evening when a white farmer and neighbor named Glen Roberts arrived. He had at least one other man, his brother, in tow, and according to other records, he was armed. The sharecropper and Roberts had quarreled earlier; Higginbotham had objected to Roberts\u2019s running cattle over his rented field. Now Roberts wanted to whip him for it. When Higginbotham refused to open the door, Roberts broke down an exterior shed room with an ax. Then he chopped his way into the hallway. Higginbotham, the investigators wrote, warned Roberts to stop. Roberts crashed into the bedroom next, at which point Higginbotham shot and killed him.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe gravity of that moment must have registered with Higginbotham immediately. Roberts was a prominent member of the Oxford community: He enjoyed a reputation as a crack fox hunter, he played fiddle at local celebrations and he was white. Higginbotham fled, and the sheriff rallied hundreds of men to pursue him. They trailed bloodhounds across forests and fields, arrested another black man on suspicion of helping Higginbotham escape and severely beat one of Higginbotham\u2019s sisters. Higginbotham evaded them for two nights before the searchers found him submerged in a creek across the county line.\n\nThe search parties might have lynched Higginbotham right then and there, but the Pontotoc County sheriff sent him to Jackson, Miss., 150 miles away, for safekeeping. A district attorney and the county attorney, who was Roberts\u2019s nephew, arrived at the Jackson jail the next day. They left, boasting of having obtained a written murder confession from Higginbotham despite the fact that, according to census records, he could neither read nor write. \u201cWe have a clear-cut case of coldblooded murder against the Negro,\u201d the district attorney told a reporter. \u201cThe Negro is a vindictive type.\u201d They sought the death penalty.\n\nAlthough he had supposedly confessed, Higginbotham pleaded not guilty when he returned to Oxford three months later for trial on Sept. 17. Melissa testified, an act that would have exposed her to possible retribution and that undoubtedly influenced her decision to leave. The hearing lasted a mere afternoon, but records suggest that some jurors doubted the prosecution\u2019s story. The judge issued careful instructions to the jury, advising them that if they believed that Roberts had entered the home in \u201ca rude, an angry manner, and then and there held a pistol pointing toward the defendant,\u201d that they should find Higginbotham not guilty. Hours later, the jury had yet to reach a verdict, and two jurors were rumored to be holding out for acquittal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhat might have become a victory for Higginbotham and for the rule of law instead devolved into an extrajudicial killing. Not far from the white courthouse at the center of Oxford\u2019s square, a mob formed early in the evening outside the jail. Estimates put the crowd at as many as 150 men. Anyone walking to or from the heart of town would have witnessed the lynching party. They would have seen the killers enter the jail, where, through force or persuasion, they bypassed three sheriff\u2019s deputies and the jailer before pulling Higginbotham from his cell. They would have seen the men force Higginbotham into a car and begin driving up North Lamar Boulevard. The caravan swept by the grand homes of Oxford\u2019s wealthy, then past the edge of town and the lonely Three-Way intersection, before stopping in the woods off old Russell Road. Higginbotham, one newspaper reported, stayed quiet during the ride. The men took the sharecropper out of the car, hanged him from a tree and shot him.\n\nAs Burke summarized Higginbotham\u2019s story \u2014 his fateful encounter with Roberts, the \u201cridiculously quick trial\u201d and the lynching itself \u2014 his elderly son remained dry-eyed. His mother never told him about his father\u2019s desperate escape or about the trial. Higginbottom\u2019s stoicism didn\u2019t surprise his son David, and it didn\u2019t fool him either. \u201cHe taught us that men don\u2019t cry,\u201d David said. \u201cBut I can tell when he\u2019s emotional.\u201d He saw pain registering on his father\u2019s face. \u201cIt would look like he kind of just left the room,\u201d David said. \u201cHe looked like he sort of just left the room, and then he\u2019d come back in.\u201d Wright didn\u2019t weep, either. She was still trying to grasp the meaning of everything she was learning. \u201cI may have been in a little bit of shock,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, really? This is what really happened?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWashington, for her part, had already read Burke\u2019s written report and was more familiar with the story than her siblings. But there was one revelation she never tired of hearing about: that before his death, her grandfather might have been a labor activist. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Burke said, \u201cvery possible, that Elwood Higginbotham was actually involved in union organizing within a Communist labor group, trying to build power among the local sharecroppers, particularly the black sharecroppers in the area.\u201d Lynchings to eliminate African-Americans who advocated political, social and economic reforms peaked in the early 20th century, and a union affiliation provided an additional motive for Higginbotham\u2019s lynching \u2014 perhaps he had been targeted before the argument with Roberts. But Washington cared more about what a labor role suggested about her granddaddy\u2019s character than what it said about his killers. The image of her grandfather as a labor organizer, a man fighting for his people, made her think of Cesar Chavez. \u201cHere he was, only 20-something years old,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be that brave and young in the South? Brave.\u201d\n\nBurke\u2019s research brought David Higginbottom great relief. His grandfather, it turned out, hadn\u2019t cheated on their grandmother, as in the tale his young mind had invented. \u201cYou sort of feel a little proud, in a crazy sort of sense,\u201d he said. \u201cProud that he\u2019s not the guy that you perceived that he had been.\u201d The chronology, horrible as it was, also helped David better understand his own father. E.W. Higginbottom\u2019s hatred of Mississippi was family legend, and that antipathy made sense now that the family was talking more openly about the killing. So did other things. As an adolescent, David spent what felt like every waking moment at his father\u2019s side, traversing Memphis in a red 1964 Malibu, going from one lawn-mowing job to the next. He hated it; he felt smothered. But the more he thought about his grandfather\u2019s death, the more he saw his father\u2019s behaviors \u2014 the angry flashes and the hovering \u2014 as fear for a black son in a hostile world: \u201cHis thoughts were, If I can keep you around me working, I don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nWright asked Burke about her family tree. \u201cKyleen, you said his family was big? How many?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m wondering how many siblings my grandfather had.\u201d Burke read nine names: Dela, Hosey, Rella, Jumilla, Walter, Bee, Hulette, Queen and Evelena. She also knew the name of Wright\u2019s great-grandparents: Robert and Katie.\n\nConversation flowed toward the future. Lafayette County has two Confederate soldier statues, erected in 1906 and 1907, standing in prominent locations. One faces south behind the courthouse. The other statue \u2014 whose creators conceived it as a monument to \u201cheroes not forgotten\u201d \u2014 looms above a grassy circle on the University of Mississippi campus. It\u2019s now accompanied by a \u201ccontextualization plaque\u201d installed in 2016 at the insistence of student activists and faculty, who observed that the statue\u2019s creators wanted not merely to remember the dead but to extol white Southern nationalism and reframe the Civil War as a defense of states\u2019 rights. Not long before the Higginbottoms\u2019 visit, the Lafayette County board of supervisors heard public comments about the Confederate statue on the square, some of which called for removal. \u201cThere is a growing movement of people in the state who seem very committed to bringing this up,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAs we\u2019re in conversation about Civil War memorials, Confederate memorials, how do we broaden that discussion to memorializing people like Elwood Higginbotham?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no marker to him or to the six other men who were lynched in the county, one of whom remains unidentified. John Ashworth, the project manager for the Lynching Sites Project of Memphis, which is trying to partner with E.J.I. to erect markers to 37 lynching victims in Shelby County, said that remembering men like Higginbotham is delicate work. He has researched cases in which family members had no idea their relative was lynched or didn\u2019t wish to revisit the traumatic story, and he has seen others in which the killing grounds have been obliterated by parking lots or office buildings. But for descendants who can and do participate in memorialization efforts, he said, the process can be healing. \u201cIt is a validation of their humanity,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cAt least somebody cares about what happened.\u201d\n\nWashington was thinking about hearing those family names \u2014 Robert and Katie \u2014 for the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s my great-grandparents,\u201d Washington said. She and her family followed Grayson downstairs to a rear parking lot and climbed into a rented blue van. Another cousin, a brother of Tyrone\u2019s, had arrived late, which brought the total of Elwood Higginbotham\u2019s gathered children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to eight. They represented just a fraction of Higginbotham\u2019s direct descendants, and in the months to come, Washington and Wright would describe for many of the others \u2014 their four siblings who couldn\u2019t attend that day, as well as children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews and cousins \u2014 the places they were about to see.\n\nThe inhumanity of lynching is hard enough to fathom, but the culture of impunity that allowed the killings to continue for so long is perhaps even more mind-boggling. Seventeen years before Higginbotham died, for example, a lynching party dragged another black man, Nelse Patton, from the Oxford jail. Afterward, a former Mississippi representative and senator, William Van Amberg Sullivan, boasted about his involvement to The New York Times: \u201cI directed every movement of the mob, and I did everything I could to see that he was lynched. ...

They had a son three years later, but he waited until 2016 to marry Ms. de Oliveira, a Massachusetts native, partly because he did not want her family to think he was angling for a green card.\n\n[Would you pass the green card marriage interview? Take the test.]\n\nAfter the wedding, all the things they could not do while he lacked legal status became obvious: Not being able to go on their honeymoon, because he could not fly. Not being able to get a joint credit card. Not being able to get car insurance.\n\n\u201cHe got caught because he was trying to do the right thing,\u201d Ms. de Oliveira said of her husband\u2019s arrest on Jan. 9. \u201cIt was like a setup.\u201d\n\nIt took a month for her husband to be released. Because she did not know what else to say when their son asked, Ms. de Oliveira told him that his father was working out of town.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike many of the immigrants detained this way, Mr. de Oliveira, a house painter, had no criminal history. To the Trump administration, the other thing they had in common was more germane: a legal but, until now, unenforced obligation to leave the country that had stuck to them for years, even as they pieced together lives and families in the United States.\n\nIn the later years of the Obama administration, the government mostly left people without criminal records alone, focusing instead on immigrants who had only recently arrived or had been convicted of serious crimes.\n\nBut the Trump administration emphasizes that everyone living here illegally is fair game for deportation, a policy that has bumped up immigration arrests by more than 40 percent since the beginning of 2017. Those who were ordered out of the country years ago are especially easy marks for an agency with limited resources for enforcement \u2014 especially if they walk straight into an immigration office.\n\nICE agents who once allowed many unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country as long as they checked in regularly have, over the past year, begun arresting many of those same immigrants at their once-routine ICE appointments. Unlike people who have had no prior contact with the immigration system, those who have already received orders of deportation have few, if any, protections against swift deportation.\n\nMost who have been arrested under the Trump administration\u2019s policies had scant prospects of ever achieving legal status, whether through marriage to a citizen or another route.\n\nPeople like Mr. de Oliveira, on the other hand, were well on their way.\n\nGetting a green card through spouses and relatives had become far easier in recent years for those who were living in the country illegally. Until 2013, undocumented applicants had to leave the country and wait out the application process from abroad, in some cases for as long as a decade, before returning with green cards.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Hurdles remained: Applicants still had to undergo vetting and security checks, for example, and prove that being deported would cause an American citizen \u2014 a spouse, for example \u2014 significant hardship. But once an immigration officer certified that their marriages were real, those with old deportation orders could ask an immigration judge to lift them so they could move on with their applications.\n\nNow, however, it is risky simply to show up for an interview.\n\n\u201cFor many individuals, it\u2019s sort of this Sophie\u2019s choice of remaining in the shadows, without formal immigration status,\u201d or hazarding arrest, said Genia Blaser, a staff attorney at the Immigrant Defense Project, a New York-based group that has been fielding calls from immigrants concerned about the new policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne such case made national headlines in the fall, when a Mexican man from the Denver area who had tried to obtain a green card through his daughter, a senior at Yale, was arrested at his residency interview. Despite a national campaign to get him released, the man, Melecio Andazola Morales, was deported in December.\n\nOn Feb. 8, immigration agents in San Francisco went a step further, arresting a Sudanese man at his interview for asylum, where he was supposed to be given a chance to explain why he feared returning to his home country. He had overstayed his visa, according to his lawyer, but had no criminal history or deportation order.\n\nImmigration lawyers in New England, in particular, say there has been an unmistakable swell in the number of clients arrested at marriage interviews over the past few months. In the past, they said, U.S.C.I.S. officers had routinely alerted their counterparts at ICE to marriage applicants with old deportation orders, but only since President Trump took office had immigration agents begun to arrest those people at interviews. (A few such cases had occurred under the Bush administration as well, they said.)\n\nSeveral lawyers said that they could no longer in good conscience encourage their clients to go to their marriage interviews, even if staying away would mean throttling a process that had already swallowed up months, if not years, and perhaps thousands of dollars in legal and application fees.\n\n\u201cSo you end up with a situation where, all right, you don\u2019t go to the interview, you don\u2019t get the petition approved, so there\u2019s no way forward,\u201d said Mr. Joyce, who said at least five clients of his firm had been arrested in the middle of applying for a marriage-based green card over the last year, including two who were later deported.\n\nAn ICE spokesman, John Mohan, said that ICE has always worked with other government agencies to gather information for enforcement purposes.\n\n\u201cICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cAny individual determined to be in violation of U.S. immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention and removal from the United States.\u201d\n\nSome remain undeterred. Leandro Arriaga, 43, had been warned by his lawyer that he might be detained at his marriage interview because he had been ordered deported years ago. But he decided to go anyway, determined to get legal papers. Without them, \u201cYou can\u2019t do nothing, you can\u2019t go to college, you can\u2019t do things in your own name,\u201d Mr. Arriaga said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be illegal anymore. I\u2019ve got to do something.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Arriaga had arrived illegally from the Dominican Republic in 2001, settling in the Boston area. He married a citizen, had three children, divorced, married another citizen and had another child, building a good business buying and fixing up old properties along the way.\n\nAfter talking it over with his wife, Katherine, he decided to take a chance on the marriage interview, which was scheduled for March 2017 at the immigration office in Lawrence, Mass. An immigration officer certified his marriage, clearing him to move to the next step toward legalization. But before he could leave the office, he was detained, along with four other marriage applicants who were interviewing that morning, at least two of whom also had their petitions approved that morning.\n\nIt took until the end of May for him to get out of detention \u2014 more than two months of legal motions, court hearings and negotiations. The government ultimately released him with an ankle monitor, leaving Mr. Arriaga free to continue pursuing his application for a green card.\n\nNearly a year later, though he was still chasing paperwork, he did not regret having walked into the immigration office. \u201cI really think that I did the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nMany people, though, are heeding their lawyers\u2019 advice and postponing any application for legalization \u2014 even those who are likely to be deemed eligible. The risks are too great.\n\nNatalia and Junior Roveda, who have been together seven years, managed to make it through their marriage interview last year in Massachusetts without incident. Mr. Roveda had come to the United States illegally from Brazil in 2005 and evaded a subsequent deportation order.

In November, he was deported to Brazil, where he is now living with his parents.\n\nSince then, his marble and granite business has gone dormant. Ms. Roveda, 25, gave up their apartment, sold the furniture and started working 20 extra hours a week at her job as an aesthetician and makeup artist to help support him in Brazil. When she can, she makes the long journey to visit him.\n\nStill, Mr. Roveda is pursuing his green card from abroad. Their lawyers have told them it could take up to a year, and Mr. Roveda fears being stuck there, away from his wife and his faltering business, for much longer.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair,\u201d he said. \u201cI was already approved and everything.\u201d", "title": "A Marriage Used to Prevent Deportation.

We embrace those we love more ferociously knowing we\u2019re not in control of their fates, or ours \u2014 or we don\u2019t.\n\nThe Northern Irish novelist Maggie O\u2019Farrell is consumed with this shadow life in her transfixing \u201cI Am I Am I Am,\u201d a memoir that trains its fierce intelligence on her 17 near-death experiences. O\u2019Farrell is acutely aware that her inner and outer worlds have been shaped at least as powerfully by what didn\u2019t happen as what did. In chapters with titles like \u201cNeck,\u201d \u201cLungs,\u201d \u201cCranium\u201d and \u201cBloodstream,\u201d inscripted above intricate black-and-white drawings of the body part in question, Farrell cuts through swaths of her life, using this anatomical structure to great effect as she builds tension and portent.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt age 18, she encounters a stranger on a deserted country path and senses \u201cthe urge for violence radiating off the man, like heat off a stone.\u201d She evades him thanks to her preternatural instinct for danger, but her police report carries little weight. Soon thereafter he murders a different young woman. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that I think about her, if not every day then most days,\u201d writes the adult O\u2019Farrell, the would-be victim who has survived to tell the tale. \u201cI am aware of her life, which was cut off, curtailed, snipped short, whereas mine, for whatever reason, was allowed to run on.\u201d\n\nThis awareness \u2014 of time, luck, fate and \u201cthe feeling of having pulled my head, one more time, out of the noose\u201d \u2014 drives O\u2019Farrell\u2019s story. She reminds us that we all live a hairbreadth from death. At times she shifts skillfully from first- to second-person narration as if to implore the reader to understand that there is no protection, nor order, nor safety. Not for her, not for us. In brief chapters that can stand alone but create a resounding effect when read together, she recounts a near drowning, a violent mugging, a terrifying childbirth, a plunging jetliner. The midlife writer also describes her youthful risk-taking: Her own mother tells her, these days, that she was \u201ca nightmare to rear.\u201d\n\nThis maternal admonition gains a piercing resonance as the wild child becomes a mother herself, and \u201cI Am I Am I Am\u201d is at its strongest when she describes the intensity of her love and sense of responsibility for her own three children, and her fear of unwittingly putting them in harm\u2019s way. Her daughter is born with an immune-system disorder and an array of terrifying allergies. Anaphylaxis, O\u2019Farrell tells us, means \u201cwithout protection.\u201d The little girl who once sought danger has grown into a parent who lives \u201cin a state of high alert.\u201d\n\nIf I have a quibble with this book, it\u2019s that there are a few spots where O\u2019Farrell\u2019s wise and lyrical voice veers toward the didactic, including footnotes and journalistic asides that distract from the deep emotional resonance. In the end, this memoir is a mystical howl, a thrumming, piercing reminder of how very closely we all exist alongside what could have happened, but didn\u2019t.", "title": "A Memoir of Near-Death Experiences", "authors": ["Dani Shapiro", "Maggie O Farrell"]}

But not much more, at least for the moment.\n\nR\u00e1ul Castro, who handpicked this loyal apparatchik as his successor, remains at the helm of the Communist Party and the armed forces; his son runs the intelligence services; his ex-son-in-law runs the military\u2019s vast business interests.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "With public housing racially isolated, other policies \u2014 some misguided but well intentioned, others indefensible \u2014 exacerbated the dysfunction. Austen notes that long waiting lists for relatively few units left poor applicants without other options for safe lodging. Compassionate officials addressed the predicament by lowering the income cutoff to qualify for public housing. The Chicago Housing Authority then made space for the poor by evicting working-class families for whom the projects were initially designed. The authority\u2019s executive director told them, \u201cBe proud to move out, so that a lower-income family can have the advantage that you have had.\u201d Public housing\u2019s opponents also demanded the evictions, insisting that those able to afford private accommodations should be barred from public support.\n\nAs Austen observes, the policy created a disincentive to marry, because a husband\u2019s wages might render a family ineligible to remain in its home. The result was the segregation of projects by race and by income, concentrating fatherless young men who not only had little access to legitimate employment but lacked working-class role models who knew how to search for it. In the early 1950s, the median income of Chicago\u2019s public housing residents was nearly two-thirds of the citywide average. By 1970, it was barely one-third.\n\nInitially, Cabrini-Green hired residents as maintenance workers. But perversely, when income cutoffs were lowered, holding such jobs made tenants ineligible to remain. With residents themselves no longer responsible for maintenance, projects deteriorated. And with projects now filled with the politically powerless, and with revenue from rent payments falling, government slashed maintenance budgets and turned high rises into slums. In 1977, Cabrini-Green had 19 maintenance workers; two years later, there were six. Nearly half its units were unoccupied because of insufficient staff. Yet for most who remained in the projects, conditions were still superior to those in the overcrowded dwellings from which they had come.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

The efforts of public officials to provide job training and transportation that might have mitigated their plights were minimal and episodic.\n\nAusten supplements his account of these policy failures with interviews with former Cabrini-Green residents. They are mostly community leaders, but their stories can\u2019t skirt the drug dealing, gang wars and homicides that dominated Cabrini-Green\u2019s public image. The police response ranged from rare attempts at community monitoring (difficult, at best, when officers had to roam 19 stories) to unprovoked brutality and even torture \u2014 a reflection of law enforcement\u2019s general contempt for the civil rights of law-abiding residents, as well as a fundamental lack of concern for their safety. Chicago\u2019s police superintendent acknowledged that his officers walked a \u201cvery fine line between maintaining order and becoming oppressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh-Risers\u201d concludes by recounting the resolve of Chicago elites, in the last decade or so, to reclaim the Cabrini-Green property, so close to downtown, for condo owners and their upscale services. Gentrification was only slightly hindered by the residents\u2019 reluctance to vacate their apartments, out of the well-founded fear that the alternatives might be no better. The project\u2019s reputation as a violent wasteland made this resistance easy for civic leaders to overcome.\n\nThe last of Cabrini-Green\u2019s 15 towers was demolished in 2011. In their place, Chicago subsidized middle-class residences, with a promise that 40 percent of units would be reserved as public housing for the project\u2019s former occupants. But that pledge was abandoned, as was one to relocate tenants to decent housing elsewhere. Most of the African-Americans who called Cabrini-Green home are now in less adequate (and frequently just as dangerous) homes in new, still segregated neighborhoods.\n\nThe alternatives Paul Douglas faced \u2014 either segregated housing or none at all \u2014 were not the only possibilities. We as a society could have dispersed low-income families across less dense public projects throughout metropolitan areas. We could have preserved diversity of income and race; many working-class white families, especially returning war veterans, needed apartments in the 1950s and would have preferred heterogenous housing developments to living with their in-laws. Many employed white veterans did initially live in public housing, only to abandon it for single-family homes in racially restricted suburbs, thanks to attractive federal mortgage terms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an otherwise nuanced book, Austen labels the social workers and officials who vowed to clear slums and house the poor as \u201cdo-gooders.\u201d Implicit in his scorn is a hindsight appreciation that, for the poor to thrive, their communities must include working- and even middle-class families. The urbanist Jane Jacobs knew as much, but her \u201cThe Death and Life of Great American Cities\u201d was published in 1961, after evictions of working-class public housing residents were already well underway. Until the sociologist William Julius Wilson published \u201cThe Truly Disadvantaged,\u201d in 1987, few comprehended the terrible consequences of cleansing urban neighborhoods of the stably employed. In 2018, Ben Austen has illustrated these repercussions; we can now better consider remedies by contemplating the lessons \u201cHigh-Risers\u201d offers.", "title": "A New Look at the New Deal\u2019s Legacy of Public Housing", "authors": ["Richard Rothstein", "Ben Austen"]}

It was square, about the size of a marker for a board game, and it was, all at once, chewy, buttery, sweet, creamy, a tad chunky, nuttish and precisely balanced. It straddled the territory between baklava and mille-feuille, and it spoke of place, although I couldn\u2019t be certain where.

But the filling seemed French, as did the deep flavor of butter. The sweet was neither fully French nor Middle Eastern, neither familiar nor completely new, and it captured my imagination.\n\nWhen I met Myriam Sabet, Maison Aleph\u2019s founder and owner, I learned how closely the traditions of East and West that shape her desserts mirror her own history. Now 41, she was born in Aleppo, Syria, went to college and graduate school in Canada and moved to France almost two decades ago, when, she says, she decided, \u201cI was mature enough for Paris.\u201d In 2014, Sabet, who worked in finance, turned her life upside down to learn about pastry. She studied with an elderly Syrian baker in Montreal, was certified in French pastry at a Paris school and, last July, opened Maison Aleph, a small shop that attracts dessert lovers from around the world. The day I was there with her, I heard French and English and Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Spanish and snippets of tongues I couldn\u2019t place at all. Once having hoped for a career in foreign affairs, Sabet looked around the room, laughed and exclaimed, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing now.\u201d\n\nSabet makes about a half-dozen variations of the 1001 Feuilles, each with layers of phyllo sandwiching a nut mixture in the style of baklava. One has hazelnuts from the Piedmont, one almonds from Valencia, another pistachios from Iran. The feuilles that called to me was made with sesame and halvah. As it was for Sabet, halvah was a sweet from my childhood. In Brooklyn, where I grew up, we would get it sliced to order from rounds about the size of snare drums. I knew the rich, pressed sesame-seed confection solely as a candy, but the Maison Aleph recipe for the squares\u2019 filling used it as an ingredient to be smoothed, baked and transformed by heat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was only when I returned home and made the dessert myself that I grasped how complex it truly was, if not in preparation, then in conception: It seamlessly fused two disparate heritages. The filling blends the halvah with tahini, toasted sesame seeds, butter, eggs, sugar and cornstarch, and traces the contours of a classic cr\u00e8me d\u2019amande, the mixture a French p\u00e2tissier would use to fill a traditional fruit tart or a galette des rois.", "title": "A New Pastry Layers Tastes of France and Syria", "authors": ["Dorie Greenspan", "On Dessert"]}

The wine director, Jorge Riera, has put together a list that is entirely, uncompromisingly, focused on natural wines, a controversial genre in which the grapes are farmed organically at the least, and the wine produced with minimal artifice or manipulation.\n\nMany of the 300 bottles or so on the list may indeed be distinctive and excellent, but they are also relentlessly obscure, with characteristics that some people may find surprising, and occasionally even appalling.\n\nRather than lard the list with expensive wines, as so many high-end restaurants do, Frenchette has devoted much of its lineup to the extremely reasonable $50- to $85-a-bottle range. That is still a lot to pay for wine, perhaps, but well below the Manhattan destination-restaurant norm, in which the wine list is often used as a cash cow to subsidize other parts of the operation.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a challenging list that may annoy some people who want recognizable names, yet is also brilliant. Mr. Riera, the wine director who came to Frenchette from Contra and Wildair, has built a list full of wonderful discoveries, great values and the sort of direct, unmediated experiences that characterize natural wines at their best. Almost all the wines are low in alcohol as well, 13 percent or less, and they go very well with the cuisine.\n\nBut Mr. Riera will have a lot of explaining to do, introducing producers and regions that will largely be unknown to people, no matter how well versed they may be in Burgundy, Barolo or Napa Valley.", "title": "A New Restaurant, Frenchette, Stands Up for Natural Wines", "authors": []}

In the last few years, Dr. Hormiga\u2019s lab and others have built detailed family trees by sequencing small sections of spiders\u2019 DNA. In these trees, spiders that have similar genetic markers are deemed more closely related to one another than to spiders whose markers are different. In order to have more points of comparison, the team behind the new paper used a more recently developed approach to compare approximately 2,500 genes.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe resulting spider tree shows a massive network of species whose ancestors began to branch away from each other hundreds of millions of years ago. Over here are the wolf spiders; over there the builders of underground funnel webs, as well as the orb weavers and black widows. Because the researchers could draw on so many more genes and species than in previous studies, they are able to state the relationships among spiders with greater confidence than in the past, Dr. Hormiga said.\n\nTo use the tree to study the evolution of webs built to catch prey, the researchers assigned each species a status: This one made an orb web to hunt, that one made a horizontal web, this one didn\u2019t build a web at all, and so on. Then they asked what the most logical way for those traits to have arisen, looking for the most likely route from ancestors with various different webs to those that spiders build today.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Hormiga and colleagues say based on this analysis that the ability to make orb webs must have arisen multiple times. On the tree, spiders that make sticky orb webs are all closely related, but the makers of non-sticky orb webs have an ancestor that didn\u2019t use a web for hunting at all. Dr. Hormiga and colleagues write that the hypothesis that the orb web evolved once and was simply passed down \u201ccrumbles\u201d under this evidence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt puts it on very solid ground that the orb web evolved more than once,\u201d Dr. Hormiga said.\n\nNot everyone agrees. Jason Bond, a professor at Auburn University who, with collaborators, has also published genealogies for spiders in recent years, says the tree itself is an admirable, solid piece of work, and rises above earlier efforts.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut he expressed doubts about the researchers\u2019 conclusions. Dr. Bond said that because of the way the researchers categorized the data on web architecture, their analysis creates, among other things, the impression that the use of webs for hunting evolved independently more than 10 times among spiders. He said that seemed implausible, given the complexity of this particular way of spinning a web.\n\n\u201cI would say these authors have climbed pretty far out on to a limb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if it holds.\u201d", "title": "A New Spider Family Tree Tries to Untangle the Evolution of Webs", "authors": ["Veronique Greenwood"]}

The early English realists presented their books not as fictional prose narratives but as journals, collections of letters and other found documents. Some authors have used this pretense ironically, to emphasize the fictional nature of the proceedings (see \u201cLolita,\u201d a prison cell confession complete with diagnostic foreword and names changed to protect the innocent), while others have borrowed nonfiction forms to give otherwise improbable events the urgency of fact (see \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d an earnest memoir of childhood during the Lindbergh administration).\n\n\n\nJonathan Miles\u2019s much-celebrated first novel, \u201cDear American Airlines,\u201d took the shape of a 200-page letter to the titular carrier, composed during an extended delay at O\u2019Hare. After a more formally conventional second novel, Miles has returned to the imitation game with \u201cAnatomy of a Miracle.\u201d A tagline on the cover allows that the book is, indeed, a novel, but everything that follows is designed to mimic a work of New Journalism\u2019s narrative reportage, beginning with a pitch-perfect evocation of the wordy expository subtitle such books carry, continuing through a \u201cnote on methodology\u201d assuring readers that \u201cthe scenes and dialogue contained herein were reconstructed from the recollections of participants,\u201d and concluding with the obligatory acknowledgments page, where the author thanks the novel\u2019s characters. Miles\u2019s commitment to this conceit is admirable, but his ultimate intentions are somewhat unclear. Where \u201cDear American Airlines\u201d fell squarely in the winking, Nabokovian mode, \u201cAnatomy of a Miracle\u201d more or less asks to be read straight \u2014 a striking demand given that the story it recounts is quite literally incredible.\n\nThe miracle of the title occurs in the book\u2019s opening pages, when Cameron Harris, an Army veteran paralyzed from the waist down, stands up from his wheelchair outside the Biz-E-Bee convenience store in Biloxi, Miss. Miles traces the ramifications of this act for Cameron and a host of other characters in a documentary style that goes well beyond the occasional parenthetical admission that one fact or another \u201cremains a contested point.\u201d The conceits of creative nonfiction seep into nearly every sentence. We are dutifully told that the word \u201cmiracle\u201d has its origins in the Latin noun miraculum, an object of wonder, and that C. S. Lewis defined one as \u201can interference with Nature by supernatural power.\u201d Cameron\u2019s hometown is introduced with a potted history that includes a quote from the very real memoir of a local reporter, and we learn that Gallup has judged Mississippi to be \u201cthe most religious state\u201d in the Union. The skepticism of a rationalist Veterans Affairs doctor is contextualized with a poll, \u201ccommissioned by the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City,\u201d indicating that \u201croughly three quarters of doctors believe in miracles.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause the genre that Miles is aping applies fiction\u2019s methods to real-life stories, \u201cAnatomy of a Miracle\u201d offers the Victor-Victoria frisson of watching a novel impersonate a work of journalism impersonating a novel. It\u2019s a difficult balancing act that Miles for the most part pulls off, and his book is best appreciated as a highly entertaining literary performance. Of course, such faithful reproduction has inherent risks, which he doesn\u2019t entirely escape. \u201cSaturated with unrelentingly grim headlines,\u201d goes one typical sentence, \u201cthe summer of 2014 was proving \u2018an anxious and depressing muddle,\u2019 as The New Yorker\u2019s George Packer characterized it.\u201d A reader can admire the realism here \u2014 this is, indeed, just the sort of shoddy scaffolding that too often fills out such books \u2014 without wanting much more of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLuckily, Miles\u2019s writing has many compensatory virtues. One of them is broad humor. (After the Biz-E-Bee attempts to cash in on Cameron\u2019s recovery, a Yelp reviewer describes it as \u201ca Cracker Barrel at Lourdes.\u201d) Another is compassion. Miles specializes in giving fully rounded humanity to characters who might elsewhere be treated as stock figures \u2014 the pious nonagenarian who lives across the street, the sports-car-driving Vatican operator charged with verifying the miracle, the cynical reality television producer looking to get rich off it. Far and away the most compelling of these characters is Cameron Harris himself. As a young boy, he is drawn to acting and making camcorder movies, but he winds up on the high school football team after one of his mother\u2019s boyfriends worries about his \u201cmanliness.\u201d He excels at the sport and is on his way to a college scholarship when his mother dies and he abruptly quits the team.

I had been single for a very long time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom their first meeting and onward, it was just a matter of keeping an East Coast-West Coast relationship developing. Generally, it was done through photo assignments \u2014 the more exotic, the better. Ms. Levitt got plenty of work in Los Angeles to make frequent visits and stays with Mr. Eelman at his home in Echo Park. Traveling together as a couple didn\u2019t happen often, though.\n\nThat\u2019s when the actor Neil Patrick Harris helped give the couple the nudge they needed. Mr. Harris had met and bonded with Ms. Levitt on a 2008 photo shoot in Alaska. He asked her if she wouldn\u2019t mind \u201cdropping down four pegs\u201d to photograph his 2014 wedding to his longtime partner, David Burtka, at a rented castle in Perugia, Italy. Ms. Levitt quickly agreed.\n\nMr. Burtka and Mr. Harris couldn\u2019t help but chuckle about a weekend that was meant to seal their own bond and wound up sealing another in the process. As they remember it, at first Ms. Levitt had said she was bringing a particular assistant, but not Mr. Eelman.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAnd then she said, \u2018I think I\u2019m bringing a different assistant, and I\u2019m not sure cause it\u2019s a guy that I kind of like, and I don\u2019t know \u2026 We\u2019re gonna be in the same room,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harris recalled.\n\n\u201cAnd we were wondering,\u201d Mr. Burtka said, \u201c\u2018Should we get another room?\u2019 She goes, \u2018Nah, it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a grown-up. You know, we\u2019ll make it happen.\u2019 And when I checked her into the room, I came into the room, I said, \u2018Is this O.K.? There\u2019s only one bed,\u2019 and she goes, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, I got it covered.\u201d\n\nAs Ms. Levitt said, looking back, \u201cI took a risk.\u201d\n\nShe marvels about how incredible the weekend was. \u201cThis sort of high level of romance. Like pasta, wine and Champagne and vistas and views. Harry thinks that I don\u2019t like vistas, but it was amazing, stereotypical-like, textbook.\u201d\n\nShe paused, \u201cWhat does it mean to be on a romantic holiday?\u201d She had found her answer. And for Mr. Burtka and Mr. Harris, it meant the obvious.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI really think that our wedding was the time that they fell in love,\u201d Mr. Burtka said.\n\nRomance blossomed into love. Trips to Los Angeles became increasingly longer stays, and, after a steady stream of photo assignments and more exotic trips, he decided it was time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn a trip to Provence, France, in summer 2017, outside their villa and taking in another lovely vista, Mr. Eelman knelt down and proposed. She said yes, and they both cried.\n\n\u201cI was so elated,\u201d Mr. Eelman said.\n\nFor Ms. Levitt, New Orleans was an ideal location between their two home bases for a wedding. She had fallen hard for the city over the years, sparked in part from friendships she had forged during a 2008 assignment on the bounce music scene in New Orleans.\n\nVery quickly, she turned Mr. Eelman into a fan of the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a little lawless, a little fun,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can just have a good time and the people are great, and the food\u2019s amazing, and it doesn\u2019t feel like anywhere else in America.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe couple turned their days leading up to the March 17 ceremony as a kind of mini-vacation for their wedding party: traditional jazz at Preservation Hall, drinks at Vaughan\u2019s Lounge, fried chicken at Willie Mae\u2019s, Israeli food at Shaya, sandwiches at Turkey and the Wolf, Creole food at Neyow\u2019s Creole Caf\u00e9, wine at Bacchanal, lunch at Commander\u2019s Palace, a swamp tour, a cemetery tour \u2014 as with all things Danielle Levitt, it became a blur. (The day after the wedding, there was a drag brunch at the Country Club.)\n\nAndy Harman, a New York artist and set designer, who became a Universal Life minister, showed up in a specially designed robe for the ceremony.\n\nMs. Levitt, who wore a silver lam\u00e9 jersey gown designed by Rick Owens, sashayed down the aisle escorted by her mother, Marie-France Salaun, and her brother, Alain Levitt; her two nieces, Ludivine and Rima, tagged along as flower girls. As a gospel choir sang \u201cSea of Love,\u201d Ms. Levitt did stutter steps to and fro, as the guests hooted their approval.\n\nAs they exchanged their vows, the couple fought back their tears.\n\n\u201cYou broke down every wall I put up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re my champion.

But perhaps we should have anticipated the confusion.\n\nMany people are familiar with the use of this expression in the sense of getting \u201cwhat you had coming to you,\u201d usually meaning punishment.

It has nothing to do with whether he got ice cream or cake. (\u201cDessert\u201d comes from the same Latin root, but via an Old French word meaning \u201cto clear the table.\u201d)\n\nThe confusion is compounded, of course, by the other word spelled \u201cdesert,\u201d pronounced with the stress on the first syllable \u2014 the one that means a dry, barren region.\n\nBy midday Friday we had received emails from nearly 100 readers pointing out what they assumed was an error.

Part of the scarcity model I grew up with taught me to believe I only got one shot. There are many ways to educate yourself.\n\nQ. You grew up with a single mother, sometimes struggling with homelessness, and you ultimately received scholarships to boarding school and Sarah Lawrence. What were the most difficult aspects of crossing over, from one world into another?\n\nA. It was shocking to me, in a wonderful way, when I got to Sarah Lawrence, to be in a place where people did not need to lock their doors. And not just because they weren\u2019t afraid of people stealing, but because they weren\u2019t afraid of who might come into their room at night. Suddenly I found myself in this foreign land of unfathomable safety, and plentiful resources. I had no bearings or examples of how to operate within it. Suddenly my day was supposed to be about getting to class, deciding what to wear, and doing homework, as opposed to worrying about how to get warm, where to find food later, or how to avoid someone threatening me or my mother with violence. And my language, my mode of being, was very foreign to the other students I met, who could not believe my utter fascination with the salad bar at lunch. Ultimately I made incredible friends and that institution changed my life, but it was a jagged beginning. I experienced panic attacks and PTSD. I felt ugly and isolated, because I did not know the culture of this place of luxury, or how to blend in within it.

I have seen and experienced the tokenism and exploitation of minorities in the admissions process in many parts of our country.

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "ALT-RIGHT\n\nFrom 4chan to the White House\n\nBy Mike Wendling\n\n294 pp. Pluto Press. Paper, $18.\n\nAs Donald Trump went from reality television star to United States president, an obscure, fervently Trump-backing right-wing movement calling itself the \u201calt-right\u201d gained wide attention. That raised a question: How should journalists, politicians or even ordinary citizens think about this group?\n\nIn his book \u201cAlt Right: From 4chan to the White House,\u201d the BBC journalist Mike Wendling demonstrates that good old reporting is the answer. By paying close, critical attention to the alt-right \u2014 most important, doing so long enough to see through its fog of lies, misdirection and trolling \u2014 he has developed a well-rounded understanding of the movement, and created an important guide to one of the most disturbing political developments of our time.\n\nPhoto\n\nEach chapter in his short book takes on one aspect of the alt-right. Wendling writes about the \u201cIntellectuals\u201d (like the democracy-hating Curtis Yarvin), the \u201cRacialists\u201d (peddlers of racist pseudoscience), the \u201cChanners\u201d (4chan forum posters) and the \u201cMeninists\u201d (male anti-feminist activists). He discusses the movement\u2019s abuses of language and its obsession with the media. Finally, he describes the neo-Nazis and other violent white supremacists who have come more to the front since the election of Trump. What united all these groups was a (sometimes irony-cloaked) attachment to hard-right politics, especially on race and gender, together with a seething hatred of liberals, leftists and above all \u201csocial justice warriors,\u201d those campus leftists supposedly obsessed with political correctness, safe spaces and trigger warnings. The fact that the basic agenda of the alt-right is making America a safe space for white men and that its major political activity is whining on the internet when someone disrespects its cultural totems are only two signs of many of how this crowd projects its own insecurities onto others.\n\nAlthough Trump\u2019s victory was a tremendous boost for the alt-right, Wendling argues convincingly that it is already cracking up under the weight of its own contradictions. Winning the presidency sapped much of the strength of a movement that defines itself almost exclusively through what it hates. Wendling shrewdly notes that despite its edgy, countercultural pretensions, the alt-right is almost entirely \u201cculturally sterile.\u201d Endless piles of ephemeral internet memes aside, it has produced little or no music, literature, film or poetry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But after the election the extreme elements of the movement stepped up their abuse and terrorism, as seen in Charlottesville, Va., and elsewhere. Later Buzzfeed uncovered documents showing Yiannopoulos himself had been working hand in glove with outright white supremacists to promote their views under his moderate facade.\n\nBut the dishonest void at the heart of the alt-right meant it could not unite around any realistic policies, which has severely hampered it politically. The most significant representative of the movement within the Trump administration, the former Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, was easily outmaneuvered by traditional Republicans and pushed out of the administration. Now Trump\u2019s cabinet is heavily skewed toward wealthy financiers, and the only major legislation the Republican government has managed to pass is a huge tax cut tilted toward the rich. \u201cThe entire right has been duped,\u201d Wendling finds one 4chan poster concluding.\n\nHowever, Wendling is perhaps a little too sanguine about the alt-right\u2019s future prospects.

While swearing is discouraged, it usually generates only a technical foul if it crosses the line into abusive behavior. Now, with players blowing off steam in more than a dozen languages, how can referees reasonably determine whether to penalize them?\n\nJoe Forte, a former N.B.A. referee who also officiated at international tournaments, recalled his occasional struggles.\n\n\u201cYou could kind of sense that they were using some kind of profanity,\u201d Forte said. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know for sure, so there was nothing you could do about it.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that many players who come to the N.B.A. from abroad are fluent in multiple languages, including English. Serge Ibaka, a Congolese-born power forward who plays for the Toronto Raptors, recently had a news conference where he answered consecutive questions in English, French and Spanish.\n\nMarcin Gortat, a forward from Poland who plays for the Washington Wizards, said that if he were to curse at an official \u2014 and he does not condone the practice \u2014 he would do it in English, almost as a matter of courtesy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how tough you are, that you\u2019ve got to curse the referee in a different language? Just tell him in English,\u201d said Gortat, who once argued that the league should allow hockey-style fistfights among players. \u201cBe a man about it. Get mad, tell him what you think and pay for it. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSaric, a second-year forward, joined the 76ers after several seasons in Europe, where many of the referees are multilingual. Saric had a hard time getting away with anything. He recalled how he once screamed at himself in Croatian \u2014 \u201cI said something about how I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he said \u2014 and got called for a technical foul by a referee who was from Turkey.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t say it to you!\u2019\u201d Saric said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nWith the 76ers this season, Saric was called for five technical fouls \u2014 a sign, perhaps, of N.B.A. referees\u2019 increased familiarity with naughty words in languages other than English. Saric could not say for certain whether that was the case. When he gets mad, he usually expresses himself in a mix of Croatian and English.

Some priests and nuns at the Catholic schools were involved in the most depraved abuses, including at an Ontario school where students were shocked on a homemade electric chair.\n\nSince the release of the letter from the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops saying the pope would not apologize now, Canada\u2019s bishops have offered little clarity about why. Several Catholic lay people in Canada, including some who have worked within the church, say they believe the pontiff is following the advice of the Canadian bishops, who generally oppose the idea.\n\nSome bishops in western Canada and the north \u2014 where most of the schools were \u2014 do support an apology. When the letter was released, Bishop Mark Hagemoen in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, noted the disappointment of the Indigenous community in a statement, adding, \u201cI too regret that Pope Francis is not coming at this time.\u201d The presumption is that an apology would be made during a visit.\n\nOther bishops, in east Canada, say they believe that the church has already apologized and that in any event the pope\u2019s actions shouldn\u2019t be dictated by a government commission. They also are concerned about the cost of any papal visit because local dioceses would bear the expenses.\n\nIn recent years, papal infallibility, a concept officially codified by Pius IX nearly 150 years ago, seems to have been supplanted by papal apology.\n\nSeven years before the death of John Paul II, in 2005, an Italian journalist, Luigi Accattoli, counted the pope as making at least 94 apologies. And that was before some of his big ones, like his \u201cDay of Pardon\u201d apology for the church\u2019s sins against Jews, heretics, Gypsies, native peoples and women.\n\nPope Benedict XVI continued the trend, though the theologian argued that apologies were for the actions of individual Christians. His milestone apology went to clerical sexual abuse victims in Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrancis also has said sorry time and again \u2014 but never more forcefully and poignantly than he did this month in a letter to Chilean bishops that came after his own missteps on the sexual abuse issue that threatened to stain his papacy.\n\nHe first dismissed as \u201cslander\u201d accusations that a Chilean bishop had covered up abuse. The resulting outrage, the harshest he had faced in his papacy, led him to send his top investigator to Chile. The result was a remarkable apology.\n\n\u201cI recognize and I want you to communicate this accurately, that I have made serious errors of judgment and perception of the situation, especially due to lack of truthful and balanced information,\u201d Francis wrote.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo now would seem a particularly good time to ask for an apology. And if Canada\u2019s bishops supported it, it is hard to see that the pope would refuse because a hallmark of the Francis papacy is to decentralize authority to the bishops conferences around the world.\n\nJoe Gunn, who spent a decade at the bishops\u2019 conference in Canada helping to develop policies related to Indigenous people, said bishops in Ontario and Quebec whose diocese had little or no direct involvement in the notorious schools, likely blocked efforts to recommend a visit and an apology.\n\nFinancial concerns most likely factored in, if a papal visit were part of the apology, Mr. Gunn and others suggested. A 2002 visit to Canada by Pope John Paul II left the Canadian bishops\u2019 conference 36 million Canadian dollars in debt. The shortfall was covered by the country\u2019s dioceses, financially straining some.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They don\u2019t use the same kind of language.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the public backlash in Canada has grown over the lack of an apology, the bishops have also adopted the position that there have, in fact, already been papal apologies for residential schools.\n\nIn particular, they cite a private meeting in 2009 between Pope Benedict and Indigenous leaders, including Phil Fontaine, then the leader of the Assembly of First Nations, the country\u2019s largest aboriginal group. At that time, the pope expressed his \u201csorrow\u201d about the schools.\n\nFew people other than the bishops, however, equate the pope\u2019s words at that meeting with an apology \u2014 including Mr. Fontaine.\n\n\u201cIt was right for the moment,\u201d Mr. Fontaine said this past week about Pope Benedict\u2019s expression of sorrow. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot we didn\u2019t know about in 2009: We didn\u2019t know the number of deaths, the numbers of those abused. So much has been exposed through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it\u2019s really so different now.\u201d\n\nFather Tom Rosica, the chief executive of Salt and Light Media, a Catholic television service based in Toronto, is among those in the church bristling at the idea of Canada\u2019s Parliament, or any government, issuing demands of the pope.\n\n\u201cGovernments never dictate to the pope what the pope should say and when he should say it,\u201d said Father Rosica, who has worked in the Vatican\u2019s media office.\n\nBut Mr. Angus, the lawmaker who introduced the motion, which is likely to be debated late this week, said that because the church ran the schools on behalf of the government using government money, the measure does not inappropriately cross any lines between politics and religion.\n\nWhile Canada has no constitutional separation between church and state, it is unusual for Parliament in modern times to make a request of any church.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring a recent news conference, Archbishop Richard Gagnon of Winnipeg, Manitoba, endorsed the pope\u2019s decision not to offer an apology now.\n\nBut Archbishop Gagnon and Bishop Lionel Gendron, the president of the bishops\u2019 conference, repeatedly avoided answering direct questions about advice they had given the pope, and they did not offer much guidance about when they thought a visit and apology might be appropriate.\n\n\u201cIf you place Pope Francis among Indigenous people and he hears these horrible stories, what do you think he\u2019s going to say?\u201d Archbishop Gagnon told reporters.", "title": "A Pope Given to Apologies Has Nothing for Indigenous Canada", "authors": ["Ian Austen", "Jason Horowitz"]}

But in gorging heedlessly on the glucose bounty, each bacterium had secreted a steady flow of acidic waste into the culture medium, until the ambient pH level had plunged lethally low.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strong pH change,\u201d Dr. Gore said. \u201cThe cells don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re doing in time to stop doing it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor was Paenibacillus the only microbe found capable of committing eco-suicide. Testing a series of bacterial strains isolated from soil, the researchers found that about a quarter of them, if given the chance, would alter the acidity of their surroundings to the point of mass extinction.\n\nIn each case, the researchers showed they could block the die-offs by either adding a buffer to the medium to sop up the acid or by slowing the reckless pace of microbial growth through modest applications of antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important discovery,\u201d said Jo Handelsman, who studies microbial diversity at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she directs the Wisconsin Institute of Discovery. \u201cI didn\u2019t think bacteria were so self-destructive, but this is a very simple phenomenon. The pH changes, and the bugs all die. How did we miss it all these years?\u201d\n\nBy the standard dogma, she said, inhibitory processes would intervene before an entire bacterial population is wiped out, with at least a scattering of microbes going quiescent, forming spores or otherwise waiting out the catastrophe until prevailing conditions improved.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They looked at individual isolates of bacteria, monocultures pampered with an assured source of glucose and freed of the need to contend with other microbes.\n\nIn the real world of, say, a forest floor, \u201csoil is a tremendously complex environment, with high bacterial densities and diversity and competing interests at play,\u201d he said. Some bacteria are acidifying their neighborhood, while others turn it alkaline and still others expel politely neutral waste. That diversity, Dr. Gore suggested, likely keeps microbial populations from annihilating themselves under ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe paper nonetheless illustrates the perpetual struggle found at every stratum of the natural world and its human hyperprojection: between cooperation and selfishness, the tribe and the individual \u2014 between the creation of a public good, like a siderophore agent for scavenging iron, and a public hazard, like acid waste.\n\nNature is at best a fickle conservationist, and many animals can prove quite destructive to their surroundings. Flocks of parrots can strip stands of fruiting trees of all their seeds, risking the long-term viability of the very food source on which the birds depend.

I could imagine the officer\u2019s statement after shooting or assaulting me: \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d I opted to very slowly pull out my hands and let them swing by my sides. Gloveless, they hurt from the cold.When I finally turned the next corner, the cops slowed and glanced my way but kept walking. I sighed in relief.\n\nMy fear was not irrational. Although a federal court ruled the New York Police Department\u2019s stop-and-frisk practice unconstitutional in 2013, over 80 percent of people stopped by the police are black or Latino, while members of these groups make up less than 60 percent of the city\u2019s population. The department has received more than 1,500 complaints of racial profiling since 2015.\n\nMy fear was also related to a problem much bigger than what happened at Starbucks \u2014 a problem the anti-racial bias training the company has scheduled for its employees can\u2019t even begin to address. The police in this country have long been empowered to respond to white anxiety about the very presence of black people. The 1863 \u201cOrdinance to establish patrols for the police of slaves in the Parish of St. Landry\u201d is an early example. \u201cEvery free white male person, having attained the age of 16 years and not above the age of 60 years, who shall reside in the State of Louisiana and Parish of St. Landry, shall be bound to do patrol duty within the limits of the patrol district in which he resides,\u201d it read. This piece of legislation allowed white men to directly police black people.\n\nWhen emancipation finally came, so did the Black Codes and Jim Crow. As Carol Anderson wrote in \u201cWhite Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide,\u201d the Black Codes created a world in which, for African-Americans, \u201cself-sufficiency itself was illegal, as blacks couldn\u2019t hold any employment besides laborer or domestic,\u201d and they were \u201cbanned from hunting and fishing and thus denied the means even to stave off hunger.\u201d At the same time, \u201cIf African-Americans refused or could show no proof of gainful employment, they would be charged with vagrancy and put on the auction block, with their labor sold to the highest bidder.\u201d If the police didn\u2019t see the \u201ccrime\u201d \u2014 working, not working, fishing, hunting \u2014 firsthand, all it took to derail a black person\u2019s day (and in some cases, life) was a white person making a report, and this happened often.\n\nMy great-great-grandfather Thomas was policed for helping a friend in the early 20th century. As family lore goes, when he was a sharecropper in Georgia, black farmers needed a pass to leave their plot of land. Thomas lent his pass to a friend to go visit a woman, but when a white person demanded to see it and the name didn\u2019t match, all hell broke loose. The patrol came to beat Thomas, but he shot back at them.

Considering how often progressives are portrayed as joyless scolds, this is a message that needs to get out more. There\u2019s a lot of satisfaction in activism, even if you don\u2019t win every battle.\n\nThose battles are something I wish Richards had gone into more deeply. Although she opens with her appearance before the congressional committee investigating Planned Parenthood for profiting from fetal remains \u2014 the same committee that investigated Hillary Clinton over Benghazi, with as little to show for it \u2014 her take is basically upbeat.

She doesn\u2019t spend much time analyzing the current state of reproductive rights in this country, the number of abortion clinics closing or the continuing threat to defund Planned Parenthood and cancel Obamacare\u2019s expansive birth control benefit (which has no co-pay requirement), to say nothing of the hundreds of state restrictions on abortion passed in the last few years.\n\nRichards is absolutely right that Planned Parenthood is popular \u2014 one in five American women has visited one of its clinics. Almost all women have used birth control at some point, and one in four will have had at least one abortion by age 45.

As a congressman, Mike Pence wanted to shut down the federal government in order to defund Planned Parenthood; today he\u2019s the vice president. She describes as a big win the storm of outrage that resulted when the breast-cancer charity Komen Foundation decided to drop Planned Parenthood from its list of recipients (it had to backtrack within days). But she doesn\u2019t say that the woman behind Komen\u2019s ill-fated plan, Karen Handler, defeated Jon Ossoff in a much-publicized Georgia congressional race. Nor does she mention the 2015 murder of three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic by a deranged abortion opponent.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019m wondering whether my own daughters will have fewer rights than I\u2019ve had,\u201d Richards writes. She\u2019s hardly the only one to have that fear: After the election, Planned Parenthood experienced a 900 percent increase in requests for IUDs from women looking for birth control that would outlast the Trump administration. It is not going to be easy to undo the damage that every day seems to bring to women\u2019s rights, status, opportunities and well-being, but if you\u2019re looking for books to fill you with energy for the long haul that lies before us, this one is a great place to start.

Over the next five years, Mr. Ballen photographed everywhere from Cairo to Cape Town in the tradition of the street photographers he grew up admiring. His photographs of boys he encountered along the way became the subject of his first book, \u201cBoyhood,\u201d published in 1979.\n\nThose photos are recognizably Ballen photographs, but the hallmarks of his aesthetic \u2014 the windowless rooms, the absurdist juxtapositions, the recurring cast of otherworldly characters \u2014 didn\u2019t truly emerge in his work until the early 1980s, when he moved to South Africa to pursue a career in mineral exploration. As he traveled the countryside for his geological work, he became drawn to the country\u2019s remote dorps, or small towns, and the marginalized white people who lived there.\n\nOne day, he finally gathered the courage to knock on the door of a home in Hopetown and ask to photograph inside. Stepping through that threshold, he said, was a \u201ctipping point\u201d in his career, the beginning not only of his documentation of outsiders, but of his attempts at probing his own psyche through his photography.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my photography has been about all these years: defining Roger, and Roger\u2019s relationship to the world, and the world\u2019s relationship to Roger, and Roger\u2019s relationship to deeper philosophical issues of the human condition,\u201d he said.", "title": "A Puzzle With No Solution: Roger Ballen\u2019s Quest for Meaning Through Photography", "authors": []}

I\u2019m barely caffeinated at this point.\n\nHe does so by offering us a theme list of three well-known men whose names are \u2014 wait for it \u2014 islands. The author BRET EASTON ELLIS represents Ellis Island, the actor CUBA GOODING JR. represents the island of Cuba, and the actor IDRIS ELBA represents ELBA (best known in crosswords for being the island where Napoleon was exiled).\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nThe idea for this puzzle came while solving Andrew Ries\u2019s \u201cStagger Sessions,\u201d a 20-crossword EP. In one puzzle, ELBA is clued like so: \u201cIdris who\u2019s a counterargument to John Donne\u2019s \u2018No man is an island\u2019 bit\u201d I immediately noticed that NO MAN IS AN ISLAND is 15 letters, and thought if I could come up with some other men whose names were islands, I might have a theme. All I found were CUBA GOODING JR., BRET EASTON ELLIS, DOCK ELLIS (an All-Star pitcher who supposedly threw a no-hitter while on LSD), and the fashion designer PERRY ELLIS. The ELLIS names didn\u2019t work with the other theme lengths of 9, 13, and 15, so I thought this theme wouldn\u2019t work. But then I realized I could make it a left-right symmetric puzzle, and the grid worked nicely with just 72 words. I contacted Andrew Ries to make sure he was O.K. with me adapting his clue into an entire puzzle. He said that he had the same idea seven years ago, and had CECIL RHODES and JOHN IRELAND on his list, but not CUBA GOODING JR. He said JOHN IRELAND had the problem of repeating LAND with NO MAN IS AN ISLAND, and back then IDRIS ELBA was not nearly as famous as he is now, so he scrapped the idea and ended up incorporating it into the ELBA clue. He gave me the go-ahead for my theme, and here we are.\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nAlmost finished solving but just need a bit more help?

But I would like to build in other cities, like out West, which I know very well because I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life there.\u201d\n\nThe often press-shy father and son made themselves available last month after they launched condo sales at 685 First, which is supposed to open by the end of the year. They were joined at the interview by the architect Richard Meier, whose firm designed the building and portions of a long-delayed mixed-use project planned for a three-block parcel across the street.\n\nThe interview took place a few days before Mr. Meier, 84, announced he would temporarily step down from his firm after reports that he had sexually harassed female employees over a 30-year period. Since then, the architect\u2019s name has been completely erased from 685 First\u2019s website, though Mr. Meier\u2019s own firm still features the project.\n\n\u201cDisappointment and anger were my reactions,\u201d upon learning of the harassment accusations against Mr. Meier, Mr. Soloviev said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming.

On a site that spans the entire block from East 39th to East 40th Streets, it has a reflective black-glass facade, like most of his apartment towers, including 265 East 66th Street, a rental at Second Avenue, and One East River Place, on East 72nd by the F.D.R. Drive.\n\nIt even resembles Solow\u2019s 9 West 57th Street, the sloping office tower that once commanded some of the highest office rents in the city, though much of it is currently vacant.\n\nMr. Meier, who is known for almost always designing white buildings, rolled his eyes when asked why he hadn\u2019t deployed his signature look. \u201cI have to be honest with you,\u201d he said, before looking in the direction of his client.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI just feel from the outside it is very strong, almost like marble, but from the inside you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s black, because it\u2019s perfectly translucent,\u201d Mr. Solow said of his favorite building color.\n\nIf Mr. Solow, who lives nearby at 860/870 United Nations Plaza, is remembered for any buildings, he said he hopes they will be 9 West 57th and 685 First. And the deep-pocketed developer, who in 2017 was ranked 140 on the \u201cForbes 400\u201d list of the richest Americans, with $4.7 billion, seems intent on shaping his legacy carefully.\n\nIn February, he traveled to a quarry in Italy, accompanied by Mr. Soloviev, to personally choose travertine panels for the walls of 685 First\u2019s soaring 30-feet-tall lobby. Workers at the site said Mr. Solow calls every day to check on his tower\u2019s progress.\n\nThe tower, whose one-bedroom condos start at $1.5 million, will also showcase art from Mr. Solow\u2019s extensive collection. A large three-painting creation from Joan Mir\u00f3, made up of green, orange, and red panels, will likely be relocated to the lobby of 685 from its current home at 9 West 57th, Mr. Solow said.\n\nHe had also planned to bring an outpost of Brasserie 8\u00bd, the restaurant that sits at the base of a circular staircase at 9 West 57th, to the new building. But Mr. Soloviev has rejected that idea, saying the neighborhood around 685 First, a mix of United Nations missions, older apartment buildings and tunnel ramps, is not quite ready for a business-lunch spot just yet. \u201cI would have to strongly advise against it,\u201d Mr. Soloviev said. \u201cI say no to everybody. I do things my way, and sometimes it\u2019s not that popular.\u201d\n\nMr. Soloviev has asserted himself in other ways. Despite his father\u2019s long-held belief that balconies clutter facades, Mr. Soloviev pressed for them and about a fifth of the units will have them. \u201cHe won,\u201d Mr. Solow said.\n\nThe presence of condos at 685 First also differentiates the building. Mr. Solow, who has almost exclusively built rentals, beginning in Far Rockaway, Queens in the 1950s, said the expiration of the state\u2019s lucrative 421a property-tax abatement in 2016 has made rental development all but impossible. So, 685 First, which broke ground in 2017, had to incorporate condos, which typically allow developers to recoup their investment more quickly.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeveral projects going forward will be condos, including a skinny 16-unit condo that\u2019s under construction at 7 West 57th Street, as well as a hotel-condo across the street from it, though that project has been delayed by ongoing litigation involving a retail tenant in a building marked for demolition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Soloviev said that the three residential buildings planned for the vacant site across from 685 First would also be condos, not rentals as originally conceived. The site\u2019s master plan, created in part by Mr. Meier and approved a decade ago, also calls for a fourth building, an office tower, that will house biotech companies.\n\nThe last recession is one reason the mixed-use project has taken so long. In 2010, the firm decided to sell a nearby parcel at East 35th Street to the city for about $33 million for a new public school. Another parcel at East 35th was sold to JDS Development Group in 2013 for $127 million, and the two rental towers known as American Copper Buildings stand there today.\n\n\u201cI hate the price we got\u201d for the Copper site, Mr. Soloviev said. \u201cBut those were some trying times.\u201d Around that time, he added, his father took a six-month leave of absence from the firm for medical reasons, leaving Mr. Soloviev at the helm.\n\nThat six-month run was not the son\u2019s first taste of the family business. When he was a teenager, he parked cars at 9 West 57th. Much later, he worked on layouts and finishes at Two Sutton Place, a 209-unit rental high-rise by the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge that opened in 2014. He also takes credit for helping boost the occupancy rate at 9 West 57th from \u201cbelow 50 percent\u201d several years ago to 70 percent today.\n\nFor years, though, Mr. Soloviev was largely based out west, where his family owns close to a half million acres of land. About 145,000 acres planted with wheat, sorghum, corn and sunflowers are in Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico. Another 300,000 acres are grassland in New Mexico used for cattle.\n\nA decade ago, Mr. Soloviev spent about half the year, on and off, in those rural locations. Now, he heads west only a few days a month, he said, instead living mostly in East Hampton, in a house he shares with five of his children. Having dinner with them every night, he added, often requires a helicopter trip home.\n\nAll told, Mr. Soloviev has 15 children, 11 of whom were from his marriage to his ex-wife, who lives in upstate New York with their other children. Mr. Soloviev\u2019s other four children \u2014 from relationships with two women \u2014 live with their mothers in Sacramento, he said.\n\nMr. Soloviev, who drives a Dodge Ram truck in contrast with his father, who used to own a collection of Rolls-Royces and now typically rides in a chauffeured car, said he is in no rush to be the only one in charge of the family real estate company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking over the business. I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now I work with my father. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever worked as well together as we are right now.\u201d", "title": "A Real Estate Dynasty Passes the Torch", "authors": ["C. J. Hughes"]}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "Then there\u2019s the question of what the E.R.A. would do. Even the most die-hard proponents of the amendment acknowledge that it\u2019s unlikely to radically advance women\u2019s rights, at least in the short term. That\u2019s because, for decades, many courts have applied the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to sex discrimination, creating a body of case law that\u2019s functioned as a sort of de facto E.R.A. As to whether the amendment could actually undo some programs that are beneficial to women, like sex-based affirmative action efforts, legal experts point to the fact that though the Constitution already protects the rights of people regardless of race, race-based affirmative action continues to exist. They also point to parts of the country that have state-level E.R.A.s and have not had such outcomes.\n\nThe fight against the E.R.A. is being led by groups on the religious right like the Illinois Family Institute, using arguments that are the ideological heirs of those so vociferously expressed by Phyllis Schlafly, whose group Stop E.R.A. \u2014 the first word standing for \u201cStop Taking Our Privileges\u201d \u2014 which became the Eagle Forum, prevented the E.R.A.\u2019s ratification at the time.\n\nThose arguments include fearmongering about how coed locker rooms could become standard and alimony for women outlawed \u2014 arguments that are hard to take seriously but that nonetheless helped Mrs. Schlafly to very effectively convince Americans, including many women, that the E.R.A. was bad news. (Mrs. Schlafly, who died in 2016, would no doubt be appalled that her home state, Illinois, could now play such a pivotal role in ratification.)\n\nAnother conservative talking point is that the E.R.A. would lead to abortion restrictions being struck down. That outcome is not at all certain, but it would help many women. (For obvious reasons, the anti-E.R.A. crowd already had to slink away from an argument that the amendment would lead to legalizing same-sex marriage.)\n\nLooking at everything the E.R.A. would not do raises the question of why it\u2019s still needed. Here\u2019s why it is: The court decisions that make up the \u201cde facto E.R.A.\u201d can be undone in a way a constitutional amendment cannot. The E.R.A. would add an extra layer of legal protection for women \u2014 and men \u2014 against discrimination. This could become especially important if Mr. Trump gets to pick additional conservative Supreme Court justices.\n\nThere\u2019s also a symbolic and emotional element to this fight that\u2019s not to be discounted. Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 who, before becoming a Supreme Court justice, fought many legal battles over gender discrimination and is a longtime supporter of the E.R.A. \u2014 summed up this argument in 2014.\n\n\u201cI would like my granddaughters, when they pick up the Constitution, to see that notion \u2014 that women and men are persons of equal stature,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like them to see that is a basic principle of our society.\u201d\n\nEnshrining women\u2019s rights in the Constitution matters. Doing so now, during this presidency, would be particularly fitting.", "title": "Opinion | A Rebuke to Trump, a Century in the Making", "authors": []}

Just as important, her experience makes her a convincing travel guide into the history, creation and future of psychotropics. She is, understandably, not an uncritical cheerleader. But she resists the facile role of hard-charging prosecutor. And no wonder, really, given that the drugs have allowed her to have two children, write nine books, marry (and divorce) and hold dear friendships.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo, when she takes us back to the 1950s and the story of Thorazine, she doesn\u2019t just give us a \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d bag of horrors, but also a glimpse into doctors\u2019 excitement when the drug quelled patients\u2019 delusions and hallucinations and the once-comatose resumed living. A former barber, who had been in a haze for years and for whom all previous treatments failed, returned to shaving (his first customer: the doctor who gave him Thorazine). A juggler asked for billiard balls and began juggling again. And people on one psychiatric ward picked up musical instruments, used drills and saws, held conversations that had been unthinkable shortly before.\n\nIn what becomes a through-line in the book, no one fully understood how the drug worked (nor do we know what happened to the juggler or barber once they left the asylum). It was simply enough that it seemed to be working. And yet, in high doses and over the long term, patients often experienced tardive dyskinesia, which includes tongue thrusting, lip smacking, restlessness, involuntary movements of arms and legs, which become twisted like pretzels. When Slater wonders aloud to a psychiatrist why the new class of antipsychotics is really so much better than the old ones, he says: \u201cYou have to pick your poisons. Which would you rather be in two years \u2014 a circus freak or a diabetic?\u201d\n\nShe takes us on similar journeys into lithium and MAO inhibitors, each bringing hope and problems. And then, in the late 1980s there\u2019s the arrival of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, known as SSRIs, and their promise to be different from the antidepressants of the past. The standard explanation is that Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft and other SSRIs boost serotonin levels. But studies have never proved that depressed people suffer from low serotonin (some do, some have normal levels and others have high levels). And SSRIs often fare no better than placebos for mild to moderate depression. Still, doctors tend to talk about depression as if the science is settled, often telling patients: If you\u2019re diabetic you take insulin; if you\u2019re depressed you take a pill. The analogy, of course, doesn\u2019t hold. There is no blood test, no X-ray, no urinalysis that pinpoints depression. It is a field, Slater writes, \u201cstill stuttering, with at best a slippery grasp on the science behind its pills and potions, a legion of medical men and women who can help you in one way but hurt you in another.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Unfortunately, by this point she\u2019s taken us through so much material and still has so far to go \u2014 including brain stimulation and memory drugs \u2014 that the journey begins to feel too wide-ranging and, occasionally, too thin on details about what we\u2019re passing along the way.\n\nStill, several of the up-and-coming treatments \u2014 many of them not new at all \u2014 shift our focus from unmediated pill popping. Among them are placebos, which don\u2019t work for all patients and have no effect on those with Alzheimer\u2019s. But, as Slater rightly notes, numerous studies show their amazing potency, which remains too untapped by a psychiatry field still enthralled with drugs.\n\nLike placebos, hallucinogens also aren\u2019t new, of course, but researchers are repurposing them in promising ways. Studies show that psilocybin, the active ingredient in so-called magic mushrooms, curbs smoking addiction, as well as relieves anxiety and depression for people with end-stage cancer. And in clinical trials, psychotherapy combined with MDMA (the chemical more commonly known as ecstasy) offers significant relief for PTSD sufferers. The drug, which creates feelings of empathy and euphoria, allows traumatized victims to recall their terrors in a calm state of mind and establish deep trust with their therapists \u2014 ingredients that pave the way for psychological change.\n\nOne of the keys for MDMA, psilocybin and some placebo therapies is the connection between patient and provider. And connection is exactly what vanishes during Slater\u2019s own depressive states. Her primary feeling, she writes, is \u201cthe loss of love \u2014 my people falling away \u2014 and the loss of language, my words dwindling so low that my thought seems to move without rhythm or reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Slater goes searching for relief among these new treatments. She tracks down a therapist who uses MDMA in her practice. And in the cozy office painted in calming colors, Slater tells the therapist her history and lists her prescriptions. MDMA won\u2019t work for Slater, the therapist tells her; her current medications would block the drug\u2019s effects. Slater knows from past experiences that she can\u2019t risk weaning herself from the prescriptions that keep her stable.

It is too often clear that the joke is on us \u2014 and even more so on our older relatives. Apu was the only major South Asian character on prime-time TV for many years, helping to define how millions of Americans think Indians, Pakistanis and other people from the subcontinent talk and live.\n\nAs with all caricatures, there is some truth to Apu. Many South Asian immigrants, especially those who came in earlier decades, do work behind the counters of 7-Elevens and other such stores, often because it is the only work they can get. Many of them are parsimonious because they are sending money home or saving up to send their kids to college. They don\u2019t always understand American slang and norms, and so can come across as bumbling. They cling to customs and religions that they brought with them from the old country because those are their connection to home.\n\nBut many aspects of the character reveal Apu to be the brown equivalent of blackface minstrel performances. He comes across as a caricature designed to mock a minority for the entertainment of the majority. \u201cOften, racism is dismissed under the guise of humor,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, a professor at the University of Virginia and author of \u201cIndian Accents: Brown Voice and Racial Performance in American Television and Film.\u201d \u201cThere is always an undercurrent of truth to it and there is also an undercurrent of censure and satire.\u201d\n\nBrownface \u2014 or brown-voice, in the case of Mr. Azaria and Apu \u2014 does not have as long a history as blackface, but there are plenty of examples of it. Mr. Azaria has said he was inspired by a performance Peter Sellers gave in a 1968 comedic movie, \u201cThe Party.\u201d His face darkened with makeup, Mr. Sellers plays an Indian actor who is invited to a Hollywood bash, which he proceeds to wreck. Earlier, Mr. Sellers had a cameo as a clueless Indian doctor in the 1962 movie \u201cThe Road to Hong Kong.\u201d In the 1988 movie \u201cShort Circuit 2,\u201d Fisher Stevens, who is white, plays an Indian scientist with brown makeup and a fake accent.

In both cases they must prove the same well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\n\nPeople who apply and are selected overseas eventually enter the United States as refugees.\n\nMany of them, hundreds of thousands, remain parked in camps as the refugee application process unfolds, typically over several years. That process involves several interviews with United Nations and American officials. The United States also conducts several layers of security screening.\n\nPeople already on United States soil apply for asylum.\n\nAlexander Godunov, a principal dancer with the renowned Bolshoi Ballet, was granted asylum in the United States in 1979. He was the first of several dancers to defect from the Bolshoi during that year\u2019s tour in the United States. He requested asylum in New York City and received it immediately. Ms. Navratilova received asylum in October 1975, a month after filing for it.\n\nDuring the 1980s, civil war in El Salvador displaced several hundred thousand people. Tens of thousands flocked to the United States and applied for political asylum.\n\nNowadays, the process of applying for asylum often takes years to complete, from start to finish. It involves interviews with United States immigration officials and often with immigration judges.\n\nWhether people entered the country legally or not, they are eligible to apply for asylum.\n\nThe surge\n\nThe world is suffering the worst refugee crisis since World War II. There are now a staggering number of refugees, asylum-seekers and displaced people \u2014 about 50 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViolence around the globe is pushing desperate people to seek safety across international borders. People from the Middle East and Africa are taking rickety boats and making treacherous treks to reach Europe. They are less likely to show up at the southwest border of the United States than people from Latin America who are, relatively speaking, nearby and can come over land.\n\nIn recent years, violence in Central America \u2014 it has some of the highest murder rates in the world \u2014 has prompted tens of thousands of people since 2014 to make the perilous journey to the United States.\n\nThe migrants either turn themselves in at the border to American authorities or sneak into the country illegally. Regardless, they then declare that they are seeking asylum.\n\nBefore 2011, only 1 percent of all arriving foreigners requested asylum. Today, one out of 10 apply, according to government officials.\n\nThe caravan\n\nJeff Sessions, the United States Attorney General, called the caravan now awaiting processing at the San Ysidro port of entry a \u201cdeliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no right to demand entry without justification,\u201d he said, adding that he would deploy prosecutors to handle cases.\n\nIndeed, there are signs that the administration is seeking to disqualify certain applicants, such as victims of domestic violence, who have sometimes won asylum. Recently, Mr. Sessions suggested they should not be eligible.\n\nYet the law does require authorities to accept and consider their petitions.\n\nOnce they are processed at the port of entry, they are likely to be transferred to a detention facility where they must pass the first step in the asylum process, a \u201ccredible-fear\u201d interview with an officer of the United States Immigration and Citizenship Services.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe number of credible-fear interviews conducted by the federal agency has soared from 5,000 in 2007 to 80,000 last year.\n\nMore than three quarters of those interviewed pass that screening and are referred to an immigration judge for hearings that may span months or longer. (Those who fail the interview can be deported immediately.)\n\nAsylum applicants awaiting a hearing before a judge either remain in detention or are released wearing a tracking device, such as an ankle monitor, with a date to appear in court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once 180 days have passed after filing of their application, they are eligible to work in the United States. Their children attend public schools.\n\nBecause some migrants in the past have skipped their court hearings, Mr. Trump has criticized the practice of releasing migrants, describing it as \u201ccatch and release.\u201d In recent months, his administration has ordered border officers to, when possible, keep these migrants in detention, rather than release them.\n\n\u201cWhile these asylum seekers are, on paper, eligible for consideration for release on parole, in reality ICE holds them in detention for long periods of time,\u201d said Eleanor Acer, director of refugee protection for Human Rights First.\n\nUnited States officials say the administration is trying to figure out how to deal with the surge in asylum applications in a manner that is consistent with its international obligations.\n\nPart of the problem is that immigration courts are clogged, and not just with asylum cases.\n\nAt of the end of March, there were 692,298 cases in the backlog, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which tracks the trends. The average wait time for current pending cases was 718 days, or nearly two years.\n\nAre their claims legitimate?\n\nCentral Americans who apply for asylum often have been threatened with death or suffered attacks at the hands of gangs. Often mothers flee to protect their children from recruitment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have seen firsthand the extraordinarily violent conditions in the Northern Triangle of Central America that forces families and children to flee their homes in search of urgently needed safety in the U.S.,\u201d said Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of United States programs at the International Rescue Committee.\n\n\u201cThose who qualify and are fleeing violence, who have no other route to protection, should be granted safety and asylum,\u201d she said.\n\nImmigrant advocates say their circumstances are akin to those faced by people escaping war in Syria or Somalia. However, it is more difficult for Central Americans to win their cases.\n\n\u201cA huge percentage of these people get deported,\u201d said Marty Rosenbluth, an immigration attorney. \u201cIt\u2019s a really difficult struggle to win asylum.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenbluth said that all of his asylum cases based on gang violence have failed because his clients could not establish that they fit into a social group suffering particular persecution to qualify.\n\nIn some cases, judges have found that applicants fabricated or exaggerated their claims, though that is not usually the case.\n\nImmigration court records show that more asylum cases were denied over the previous five years than have been granted. In fiscal year 2016, 62 percent of asylum cases were denied, compared with 44.5 percent five years earlier. Among Mexicans and Central Americans, the approval rate is substantially lower.\n\nAre some people just looking for a better life?\n\nSimply wanting a better life does not meet the international criteria to qualify for asylum. But there are people who apply anyway because it gives them some benefits, albeit temporarily, even if they ultimately lose their case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince the election of Mr. Trump, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for many years and fear deportation have been applying for asylum, knowing that they are unlikely to win, but hoping to remain in the country legally for a time.\n\nWhile their application crawls through the courts, they can obtain work permits and driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nThe administration, which has taken a hard-line on immigration, has said that it is seeking to expedite asylum cases and crack down on abuse.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant increase in terms of individuals seeking asylum,\u201d said Jennifer Higgins, an associate director at United States Immigration and Citizenship Services who handles refugee and asylum issues. \u201cOur goal is to make sure we have a fair and efficient asylum system. Right now we have individuals exploiting it. That means legitimate applicants will suffer.\u201d\n\nThe government has also said that it will prosecute those who break immigration law.\n\nIn the case of the caravan, critics say that it would be a violation of international law to conduct speedy hearings for the caravan members at the expense of a full hearing of their claims.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has made clear that asylum seekers associated with the caravan will be subjected to detention, criminal prosecutions, and rushed proceedings, in essence punishing them for seeking refugee protection,\u201d said Ms. Acer.\n\nBut Ms. Higgins said officials are assigning staff and officers to help house and process all those admitted for hearings, wherever they end up.", "title": "A Refugee Caravan is Hoping for Asylum in the U.S. How Are These Cases Decided?", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan"]}

Populism is a form of identity politics because it\u2019s based on in-group/out-group distinctions. It says anybody who doesn\u2019t think or look like us is not a true American.\n\nThis tribal mentality is tearing the civic fabric and creates a war of what Goldberg thinks of as \u201cecstatic schadenfreude\u201d \u2014 the exaltation people feel when tribal foes are brought down.\n\nI love the way Goldberg provocatively tells his story, but I partially disagree with it. The central tension in his book is between Locke, who emerges as a rational, calm, pipe-smoking economist, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who emerges as a wild-haired, passionately resentful rock star. The liberal order emerges from the individualism of Locke and is threatened by group consciousness and romantic resentments of Rousseau.\n\nBut America is both rational and romantic, both Locke and Rousseau. We have a rationalist constitution, but we have a shared national faith and are an emotional community, rooted in our land, inspired by our history, warmed by the hope of our common future.\n\nThe core problem today is not tribalism. It\u2019s excessive individualism, which has eaten away at our uniting faith and damaged our relationships with one another. Excessive individualism has left us distrustful and alone \u2014 naked Lockeans. When people are naked and alone they revert to tribe. Tribalism is the end product of excessive individualism.\n\nGoldberg is suspicious of nationalism and has a tendency to think that any effort to build a national community puts you on the express lanes on the road to serfdom.\n\nHis conservatism is missing the bonding sentiments of Edmund Burke, and the idea that the little platoon of the family is nestled in the emotional platoon of the neighborhood and the emotional platoon of the nation. Tribalism is not the only way to form a group; there\u2019s also the redeeming and forgiving love of community, and a shared national faith. Goldberg misses the way Hamilton, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt built a national community that didn\u2019t crush local communities but rather reinforced them.\n\nGoldberg is right to fight tribalism on the left and the right. But you can\u2019t reweave a fragmented nation by appealing just to Lockean individualism. Gratitude is too weak a glue to hold a diverse nation together. Renewal will come through the communitarians on the right and the left, who seek ways to improve relationships on a household, local and national level.", "title": "Opinion | A Renaissance on the Right", "authors": []}

Officials have been vague on the precise cost of the deployment, but the resources before me were stunning: pricey Bushnell binoculars, hotel rooms, rental vehicles. Texas has had troops on the border since 2014 as part of a state mobilization, and the cost was roughly $1 million a month. This new, federally financed deployment will run far higher.\n\nIt all started last Saturday, when Marc Lacey, The Times\u2019s National editor, asked me to request an embed with the troops on the border in Texas. On Monday, the Guard sent me an email back stating that I had been selected, along with the Times photographer Lynsey Addario. We would have five hours, starting at noon Tuesday, the first of several media embeds of Texas ground forces planned during Mr. Trump\u2019s deployment.\n\nBut first, I had to sign my life away. The Guard gave us a five-page form. By signing it, I acknowledged that I had been advised by the Guard that, \u201cin pursuing the successful accomplishment of its mission,\u201d the state\u2019s military forces could not \u201cguarantee my personal safety or the safety of my equipment.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday at noon, Weslaco was hit with a lightning storm. Part of the armory where we and a few other media outlets gathered had no power. Soldiers were walking around dark halls using the lights from their phones. Our departure at noon was pushed to 1:45 p.m.\n\nBefore we got on the highway, we were told we could not reveal our locations, other than to say we were in Starr County. And we could not photograph the full faces of the troops \u2014 to protect their identity and safety. Military leaders worried that smugglers would target them for speaking out.\n\nOn the one hand, there was an element of organizational paranoia at play. But the border \u2014 not the towns and cities where people live, but the physical line on the Rio Grande \u2014 can be a dangerous place. In 2011, drug smugglers trying to protect a raft loaded with marijuana threw rocks and fired up to six gunshots at officers on the border near the places where we traveled (the agents answered those six gunshots with a barrage of about 300).\n\nI thought about that incident as I stood next to a soldier overlooking the river.\n\nHe said nothing to me as he stared through binoculars. He was in his 20s. He wore a wedding ring. He was Latino. I would guess he lived not too far away from where he stood at that moment. This young man was a visual representative of America and vulnerable to those six gunshots in a way that I was not. So much of this debate has been filled with generalities that I appreciated the chance to put a specific human face on the issue. When I think about it now, I picture that silent, focused young man, his M-4 rifle and his silver wedding band.\n\nThere was a moment at the first observation post when Ms. Addario \u2014 who has risked her life covering war zones around the world and was captured and held in Libya for six days in 2011 \u2014 wanted to stand on a Humvee to get a better shot. She was told not to. It was too risky. At the second observation post, Ms. Addario persisted, and ended up climbing a Humvee.

He landed in a homeless shelter for boys.\n\nIn 2015, when Romain was 20, he applied for special immigrant status with the help of Ms. McBride at Atlas: DIY. A family court in Brooklyn found that he fit the criteria that year, but upon further review, the federal immigration agency caught a discrepancy they believed was fraud. Romain\u2019s uncle had filled out his student visa application incorrectly, saying the young man\u2019s parents were alive, so the application was initially denied.\n\nThat complicated the appeal process, but Ms. McBride and Romain persisted, finding sufficient evidence of his parents\u2019 death, which the government eventually believed.

My dad, who had never seen me during an episode, looked at me as though I were a wounded animal he had no way of saving.\n\nFrom the time I started running competitively in middle school, my dad had been the one to forecast race day weather, calculate my workout splits, and map out courses so he could cheer for me as many times as possible. Long-distance running was our love language. What would we talk about if not about mileage and routes and new success? Would he still love me the same?\n\nFor the remainder of spring, when my coach ordered me to practice, I slogged through laps on the track until the rust-orange lanes dissipated into a blurry haze. To run again would mean the neurological episodes had been a fluke, some kind of spell I could break. Again and again, I collapsed onto the interior of the field. Eventually, my symptoms pervasive, I made a difficult decision to quit the team, leaving behind a dream and an identity that I had cultivated since I was a young girl.\n\nOn the walk to my apartment from the track, I called home. \u201cI quit, Dad,\u201d I said. I held my breath. I hadn\u2019t ever quit a race, not for sickness, not for shin splints, and not for an overgrowth of bone that burst through my big toe during my junior year of high school, for which I held off surgery until after the State Meet.\n\nHe was silent on the other side of the line for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m glad, bug.

He sits with me in waiting rooms before big appointments, and once composed math problems for me during a hospital stay as if prescribing a set of intervals.\n\nDespite staying twice in the testing ward of the hospital for three days of continuous monitoring, and despite visiting neurologists and other specialists for years, I still remain without a clear diagnosis.

Cups, including three in four years from 2011 to 2014, when they were led by high-profile, and highly paid, signings like David Beckham, Robbie Keane and Landon Donovan. That star-centered system has been the Galaxy\u2019s calling card and winning business model, and after missing the postseason in 2017, the team has doubled down on it, signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a swaggering Swedish striker with the crowd-pleasing habits of scoring stunning goals and talking about himself in the third person.\n\nTo Major League Soccer\u2019s delight, Ibrahimovic\u2019s debut \u2014 in Los Angeles against L.A.F.C. last month \u2014 ended with his scoring two goals in a 4-3 thriller, delivering some welcome buzz for the league in a rivalry that had been preemptively called El Tr\u00e1fico.\n\nYet if the Galaxy\u2019s model is the exemplar of M.L.S. 2.0 \u2014 imported headliners, a suburban soccer-specific stadium and success \u2014 then L.A.F.C. is already showing what its next generation of fan engagement, stadiums and media relationships might look like.\n\nBecause beneath the gleam and glimmer of L.A.F.C.\u2019s new home \u2014 the pristine field, the silver roof that shades row after row of gray seats and the theatrical nature of seemingly everything the club does online \u2014 is something more fundamental: a well-run team and a well-executed plan.\n\nL.A.F.C., after all, was born from the ashes of Chivas USA, an earlier Los Angeles M.L.S. club with a manufactured Mexican identity that folded in 2014 after years of lackluster play, dwindling attendance and lost opportunity.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cChivas was effectively a failed expansion in L.A.,\u201d said Larry Berg, L.A.F.C.\u2019s lead managing owner. More than anything else, Berg said, that experiment provided a blueprint for what not to do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, from the awarding of the expansion team in 2014 until its on-field league debut in March, L.A.F.C. undertook an expansive branding effort to try to position itself as belonging to the city of Los Angeles specifically, and to Angelenos generally. Street by street, block by block, one by one is a mantra repeated endlessly by those around the team and on its social media accounts, and the methodical approach has proved even more successful than the founders had hoped.\n\nBefore the team ever kicked a ball, L.A.F.C. had sold 17,500 season tickets, and club officials project that Banc of California Stadium \u2014 in the heart of south Los Angeles, adjacent to the famed Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, home to Southern California football and two Summer Olympics \u2014 will be sold out for every match this season.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Opening the season on the road as finishing touches were put on its new home, L.A.F.C. has won four of its first six games, scoring goals by the bucketful but conceding almost as many, as the humbling 4-3 loss to the Galaxy and a 5-0 thrashing in Atlanta a week later illustrated.\n\nStill, eschewing the outdated stereotype of M.L.S. as a retirement league for well-known Europeans, Coach Bob Bradley and General Manager John Thorrington have built a fan-friendly and surprisingly formidable (at least up front) team. Carlos Vela, a 29-year-old Mexican forward, arrived with extensive experience in the Premier League and Spain\u2019s La Liga, and Diego Rossi, a 20-year-old from Uruguay, quickly opened eyes inside the league and out.\n\nFans who want to watch them but can\u2019t get into the stadium will not find English-language L.A.F.C. matches on a free over-the-air channel or a regional sports network, but somewhere more novel: YouTube\u2019s streaming cable replacement, YouTube TV.

That was the original conceit behind the failed Chivas USA experiment \u2014 to create a team with a Mexican identity to attract Mexican fans \u2014 but the target audience dismissed it, and Galaxy fans already had a team.\n\nBanc of California Stadium is the latest attempt to draw those fans in for another look, to try to win them over with a Mexican striker, an attack that has produced a few memorable goals and some stardust in the owners\u2019 box. The timing of the team\u2019s debut hasn\u2019t hurt, either: The Galaxy finished last in the league standings last season, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008.\n\nAt a ribbon cutting for the stadium last week, the team\u2019s sky-high expectations were on display when Johnson got his turn at the microphone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJust like we were able to turn the Lakers around into a championship team,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do the same thing with this great soccer team, L.A.F.C.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "D.B.: How did the process help you to think differently about global warming?\n\nP.H.: We constantly hear that global warming is an energy problem, that the solutions are solar, wind and electric vehicles. For the individual, that message sounds like I hope \u201cthey\u201d do it. There\u2019s a belief that there\u2019re only a few things individuals can do beyond recycling, riding a bike and eating less meat. In fact, there\u2019s an extraordinary diversity of solutions to global warming that are at hand, being implemented and scaling. I don\u2019t think people, politicians and businesspeople know that. Clean energy is the crucial solution to be sure, but there\u2019s much more we can do.\n\nD.B.: Like what?\n\nP.H.: Two of the top four solutions individuals can practice every day. No. 3 is reduced food waste, which particularly applies to America, where we waste 133 billion pounds of food a year \u2014 close to a third of the food supply. That is a conservative estimate. In our model we didn\u2019t include the methane emissions caused by landfilling our food because we couldn\u2019t get the data \u2014 and methane is 28 to 36 times more powerful in global warming potential than carbon dioxide.\n\nThe No. 4 solution is a plant-rich diet. This means reducing overconsumption of protein to a healthy level \u2014 about 50 to 55 grams a day instead of 90 to 100 or more, and shifting a proportion of that reduced intake to plant proteins. It doesn\u2019t mean being a vegan or vegetarian; it means more plants. You choose which diet you want. Levels of protein that are medically healthier for you are healthier for the planet and atmosphere, too.\n\nD.B.: Can you talk about the No. 1 solution? I was surprised to see that it was \u201c\u2018refrigerant management.\u201d\n\nP.H.: We were, too. The hydrochlorofluorocarbon gases (HFCs) used in refrigerants that replaced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were destroying the ozone layer, are anywhere from 146 to 12,500 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in their global warming potential. Poorly maintained air-conditioners and refrigerators leak HFCs. When air-conditioners and refrigerators are disposed of or recycled, the refrigerants can escape into the air. We do a pretty good job preventing this in the United States, and the European Union does even better, but in Asia and Africa, HFCs are allowed to escape and have a huge impact.\n\nD.B.: What else caught you by surprise?\n\nP.H.: Over all, we were surprised that the largest sector was food. Agriculture, food waste and diet, food production and distribution of food, holistic grazing. We didn\u2019t see that coming. It\u2019s larger than the electrical generation sector.\n\nAnd the overall ranking of the solutions shocked us. If you had asked every person at COP21 in Paris (us included) to name the top 10 solutions in any order, I don\u2019t believe anyone would have gotten it even close. That is still true. After 50 years of global warming being in the public sphere, we didn\u2019t know the top solutions to reversing it. And there\u2019s a reason: We never measured and modeled the top solutions. Instead, sincere, well-meaning people profess their beliefs. You have a prominent scientist asserting that if we don\u2019t go all in with nuclear power, we\u2019re toast. Vastly untrue. You have journalists assuring us that if we go 100 percent solar, we\u2019ll stabilize emissions. That\u2019s a scientific howler, too.

How many countries in the world can do that?\u201d\n\nBut if Ms. Park\u2019s dramatic ouster reflected a vibrant democracy at work, the scandal also unveiled a deeply flawed political system.\n\nFor decades, the government has nurtured the chaebol with favors like tax benefits and a buy-Korea policy. In return, past presidents often treated them like personal ATMs, critics say. If they did not oblige, they say, the businesses feared that the government would retaliate through the tax authorities, government regulators and prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe donations to Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations, nominally set up to promote sports and culture, seemed yet another example of this phenomenon. The Seoul district court that convicted Ms. Park ruled that she had coerced chaebol into donating to the foundations. The sums were determined according to the companies\u2019 size, according to the ruling, with Samsung contributing the most: $19 million.\n\nMs. Park also solicited $6.5 million in bribes from the hotel chain and shopping mall giant Lotte, the court found. In return, Lotte\u2019s chairman, Shin Dong-bin, wanted government help in regaining a license to run lucrative duty-free shops, the court said. In February, Mr. Shin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on bribery charges.\n\n\u201cThe ruling on Park Geun-hye confirms a pattern we have seen repeatedly: The politician seeks financial gains through blackmailing chaebol, and chaebol oblige so they can win government favors to solve their own problems,\u201d said Chung Sun-sup, editor of a website that monitors the conglomerates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnother pattern also held true: As in past corruption scandals, few corporate chiefs implicated in Ms. Park\u2019s and Ms. Choi\u2019s dealings seem likely to spend much time behind bars.\n\nSamsung\u2019s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation scion of the conglomerate\u2019s founding family, is the latest case in point, critics say.\n\nIn August, Mr. Lee was sentenced to five years in prison for giving $6.7 million in bribes to Ms. Choi and Ms. Park, with a court finding that he had embezzled the sum from Samsung\u2019s coffers. Under South Korean law, a businessman convicted of embezzling more than $4.7 million must be sentenced to at least five years in prison. What is more, that term \u2014 like any prison term of more than three years \u2014 cannot be suspended by a judge.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Lee went free in February. An appeals court ruled that the amount of bribes he had offered to Ms. Park totaled $3.3 million \u2014 less than half the sum originally alleged, and below the $4.7 million threshold requiring a five-year sentence. The court reduced Mr. Lee\u2019s sentence to two and a half years in prison, and suspended it.\n\nPhoto\n\n(The district court that sentenced Ms. Park disagreed with the appeals court, ruling that Mr. Lee had, indeed, offered $6.7 million in bribes \u2014 a finding that could put him in new jeopardy as the Supreme Court considers his case. Mr. Lee denies having committed bribery, maintaining that he never sought favors from Ms. Park in return for the money he said Samsung was forced to donate.)\n\nKim Jin-baek, a professor at Chung-Ang University, a business school in Seoul, said the power of Samsung and other chaebol is so pervasive that some government officials will do them favors without a direct quid pro quo arrangement, believing that \u201cSamsung won\u2019t forget and one day will reward them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Kim said the corruption between chaebol and the government would not end as long as chaebol\u2019s founding families continued to exert far more influence over their empires than their shares warrant.\n\nA typical chaebol family owns just a small percentage of the conglomerate\u2019s shares but rules it like a fief through a maze of cross-share holdings, installing executives who Professor Kim said work for the family, \u201cnot for the interest of shareholders in general.\u201d\n\nMost chaebol scandals have originated in the families\u2019 dubious attempts to ensure that the next generation inherits control, such as arranging for scions to buy shares of unlisted subsidiaries at reduced prices.\n\nSuch shady practices make the chaebol easy prey for officials seeking bribes, analysts said.\n\nTime and again, judges overseeing corruption trials have treated chaebol more as victims than as willing accomplices.\n\nOn Friday, the Seoul court did not accept prosecutors\u2019 argument that Mr. Lee had provided or promised as much as $40 million in bribes to Ms. Park in exchange for government support for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries. That merger strengthened Mr. Lee\u2019s grip on Samsung Electronics, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones and the conglomerate\u2019s crown jewel.\n\nWith the economy heavily dependent on chaebol \u2014 Samsung alone generates revenues equivalent to one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s gross national product \u2014 some South Koreans are wary of disrupting them too much. They credit the controlling families with making daring investment decisions that were possible only because of their unchallenged management control. That strategy has helped Samsung edge out rivals, analysts say.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in, who succeeded Ms. Park in May, is pushing for bills that would strengthen the rights of minority shareholders at chaebol and make it harder for their chairmen to enrich their children through dubious business deals. But his party lacks a majority in Parliament, where a pro-business lobby is strong, and the diplomacy surrounding North Korea has been a higher priority for the president.\n\n\u201cThe real, hidden power in our country remains chaebol,\u201d said Mr. Ahn.", "title": "A South Korean President Is Jailed for Graft, but Few Expect Major Change", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun"]}

But what whitlow grass lacks in size, it makes up for in sheer abundance. There are often hundreds if not thousands of blooming plants in just a few square feet of turf, but most people never notice them. In fact, it is easy to miss this tiny plant\u2019s entire blooming season; by the time most people even consider looking for local spring wildflowers, whitlow grass has come and gone.\n\nWhitlow grass blooms in the poorest of soils \u2014 look for it where cultivated plants have had trouble establishing. In fact, failed lawns are often an excellent place to start searching. The plant (it\u2019s not actually a true grass) seems to prefer soils which have been amended in the past, but which remain moderately moist. Whitlow grass is also almost always found in full sun, which is a little surprising considering its minute size. Locations such as the islands in shopping mall parking lots, the shoulders of highway entrance ramps and the worn areas of schoolyards provide near perfect conditions. Though these areas are frequently mowed, the plants thrive below the blades. Whitlow grass often matures at under two inches tall, and lawn mowers simply eliminate the competition.\n\nLike all of its mustard-family relatives, the flowers of Draba verna (also Erophila verna) have four petals. In Whitlow grass, a notch in the center of each one is often so deep, a quick look gives the impression of a flower with 8 petals. With flowers that measure a fraction of an inch wide this mistake is understandable, but leads to misidentification.\n\nEven during a spring as cold as this one, whitlow grass wastes no time flowering. The process culminates just days after soil temperatures consistently rise above freezing. Whitlow grass\u2019s mass flowering gives the impression of frost over a swath of low growing plants, or sometimes as a peculiar thin layer of fog at ground level. The flowers and minute leaves of this species are best appreciated while lying on your belly.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "Today, Mr. Moore and K2 Intelligence are the ones under scrutiny. After activists learned of his ties, they filed a lawsuit in London against him and the firm\u2019s British affiliate, charging that their personal information had been illegally taken during the operation. Mr. Moore has been pilloried in press accounts of the episode as a duplicitous spy for hire. Public health advocates who embraced him as an ally feel betrayed.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe said I had given him a purpose in his life,\u201d said one of the activists, Laurie Kazan-Allen. \u201cI bought it all. I bought the store.\u201d\n\nThe corporate intelligence business has boomed into a billion-dollar industry that provides companies, lawyers and Wall Street firms with due diligence inquiries, \u201cstrategic\u201d information and investigations into potential business partners as well as adversaries. K2 Intelligence, started in 2009 by Jules Kroll, a man regarded as the father of corporate intelligence, and one of his sons, Jeremy, is one of the industry\u2019s best-known companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut of late, attention has focused on the unsavory tactics some firms use to gather information. Last year, it emerged that the producer Harvey Weinstein had hired four investigative firms, including K2 Intelligence, to dig up information about women who accused him of sexual misconduct. One of those companies, Black Cube, had an operative pose as a women\u2019s rights advocate to try to win the confidence of one of his accusers.\n\nMr. Moore, who has denied any wrongdoing, insisted in recent interviews and in court papers that he had become a double agent not long after getting his assignment from K2 Intelligence and had secretly worked to help anti-asbestos advocates. His self-appointed mission: to expose the person he believed was behind the firm\u2019s operation, a Kazakh oligarch with interests in asbestos mines in Kazakhstan and Russia.\n\n\u201cI took huge personal risks and put my security and my family\u2019s security on the line,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who has cropped hair and a long, narrow face. \u201cI was utterly motivated by what I saw.\u201d\n\nThe asbestos case poses a potential minefield for K2 Intelligence. Several private investigators said they would not have an operative assume a fake identity or work for an industry selling a product as dangerous as asbestos. Such ethical issues aside, having an operative publicly go rogue is not the best advertisement for an investigative firm.\n\nIn its filings in the London lawsuit, K2 Intelligence has also denied any wrongdoing and maintains that its asbestos-related investigation was legitimate and used reasonable measures.\n\n\u201cThe matters and methods of investigative work undertaken by K2 Intelligence employees are assessed and evaluated regionally as appropriate,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt is our practice to maintain the highest ethical standards at all times and to comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\u201d\n\nCiting the active litigation, K2 Intelligence declined to make executives available for interviews, and the company did not respond to written questions from The New York Times. A lawyer for the firm urged Mr. Moore not to speak with a Times reporter, an email shows.\n\n\u201cIt would be in all our interests for you not to engage,\u201d the lawyer, Dan Morrison, wrote in an email. \u201cThat is the approach that K2 will take and I hope you will agree that this is the correct approach.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaking \u2018Mischief\u2019\n\nMr. Moore\u2019s curious life as a corporate operative started unexpectedly on a British beach in 2007 when he bumped into an old television acquaintance. The friend had since gone to work for Kroll Inc., a major corporate intelligence firm, and offered to make an introduction for him.\n\nTwo years earlier, Mr. Moore had lost his job as head of television comedy at a production company. After a career of orchestrating pranks, he had hit a creative wall. \u201cI thought I had lost my way,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Moore eventually decided that being a private investigator would pay more than gardening. And over the next few years, he got sporadic assignments on due diligence and fraud investigations from Kroll, started in 1972 by the senior Mr. Kroll, who later sold it.\n\nOn some cases, Mr. Moore, who had dabbled in journalism before his comedy career, posed as a reporter. He also once disguised himself as a deliveryman with a large floral bouquet to get into a mansion owned by a Russian oligarch. Mr. Moore, who was eager to get back into television, saw cases as possible fodder for documentaries.\n\n\u201cI found the work fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed the mischief.\u201d\n\nIn late 2011, he also started working as a contractor for K2 Intelligence. And after a few small jobs, the firm\u2019s top executive here, Matteo Bigazzi, offered him the biggest and best-paying assignment of his career as an operative.\n\nAccording to Mr. Moore, Mr. Bigazzi told him that a new client, described to him as a \u201cU.S. investor,\u201d wanted to know if American plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers handling asbestos cases were financing efforts by activists to ban the material. One of those lawyers was Ms. Kazan-Allen\u2019s brother, Steven Kazan.\n\nThe firm\u2019s client, Mr. Bigazzi said, suspected that American lawyers like Mr. Kazan were trying to drum up lawsuits by foreign workers. And he added that producers of the material believed that the type of asbestos still widely used in some developing countries \u2014 chrysotile, or so-called white asbestos \u2014 did not cause mesothelioma, a fatal lung cancer tied to the material, if properly handled.\n\n\u201cHe told me chrysotile was safe,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cSo if the law firms were doing this, I felt that it was a legitimate investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe initial targets of the inquiry, which was code-named Project Spring, were Ms. Kazan-Allen and an international coalition of activists she founded, the International Ban Asbestos Secretariat. And court papers show that Mr. Moore seized on the assignment with unbridled enthusiasm.\n\nIn one memo, he told Mr. Bigazzi that the best way to infiltrate the group without arousing suspicions would be to present himself as a documentary filmmaker eager to develop a series of films about dangerous industries, not just asbestos.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of going into this world with a bigger agenda than simply asbestos is that it might make my entry seem less deliberate,\u201d he wrote. He added that he planned to win Ms. Kazan-Allen\u2019s confidence by engaging her in \u201cthe most genuine and heartfelt way possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018Completely Believable\u2019\n\nWhen Ms. Kazan-Allen met Mr. Moore, she found him, as most people do, bright, charming and energetic. She also glimpsed in him a future leader of efforts to expand national bans on asbestos use, particularly in developing areas such as Southeast Asia.\n\n\u201cHe was very polite, incredibly engaging and completely believable,\u201d Ms. Kazan-Allen, 70, said.\n\nMr. Moore had planned their encounter to mask his motives, according to court papers. He first befriended one of her associates, who introduced him to Ms. Kazan-Allen. Soon, he was sending her fawning notes thanking her for recommending books about the asbestos industry, the court papers show. He also mentioned that his sister was a top executive at the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\u201cOnce I\u2019m completely up to speed I would very much like to start meeting other experts and campaigners,\u201d he wrote Ms. Kazan-Allen in mid-2012.\n\nMr. Moore also asked her to arrange for him to attend an asbestos conference in Brussels. She agreed to do it, unaware that his real reason for going was to see if American lawyers like her brother were funding it, filings indicate.\n\nWhen Mr. Moore reported back to Mr. Bigazzi, his supervisor at K2 Intelligence, that he had not seen financial involvement by American lawyers, he said, he was told that the client next wanted him to go to Thailand, where activists were pushing for an asbestos ban. It was around then, Mr. Moore said, that he began to question what he was doing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moore said he learned that independent groups viewed chrysotile as being as deadly as other varieties of asbestos. He also believed that activists were right to want it banned and started to wonder whether K2 Intelligence\u2019s client was someone other than the \u201cU.S. investor\u201d that had been mentioned to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the work of an arch mastermind who is unreasonably using disingenuous statistics,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Bigazzi in late 2012, court papers show. \u201cI see the work of campaigners who have a good argument on their side.\u201d\n\nMr. Moore acknowledges that he could have simply walked away. Instead, he decided to discuss his situation with fellow Buddhists. He said he had told them that if he quit, K2 Intelligence would simply replace him. But if he stayed he might be able to do something positive by exposing the asbestos industry.\n\n\u201cI was told that I could absolutely do this from a Buddhist perspective providing I didn\u2019t cause harm to anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nActivists suing Mr. Moore say they believe he had a more prosaic motive \u2014 money. Court papers indicate that K2 Intelligence paid him about $100,000 annually, far more than he had made since losing his television job. Whatever the case, Mr. Moore said he soon began to deceive K2 Intelligence and its client.\n\nAlthough he continued to secretly record activists, Mr. Moore insists that the reports he sent back to K2 Intelligence were filled with worthless information. And when Mr. Bigazzi assigned him to monitor the World Health Organization, he persuaded officials there to underwrite a short film he produced, \u201cVictims of Chrysotile Asbestos.\u201d It showed a worker in India stricken with lung cancer.\n\nAnti-asbestos advocates believe Mr. Moore made the film to enhance his cover story as a journalist. But its director, Greg Atkins, said that was not the case. \u201cHe used to laugh about the concept of the industry paying him to screw the industry,\u201d Mr. Atkins said.\n\nIn court filings, K2 Intelligence said its executive, Mr. Bigazzi, had become aware of the film only after Mr. Moore billed the firm for time he had spent working on it. And Mr. Bigazzi apparently was not amused by how asbestos was depicted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moore said that when he showed the K2 Intelligence official the film, he was told halfway through to turn it off. \u201cHe said he had seen enough,\u201d Mr. Moore recalled.\n\nA Dangerous Ride\n\nInvestigative firms usually keep client names secret. But Mr. Moore said he was told during a chance conversation in late 2013 that the client in the asbestos case was a little-known investment firm in Singapore, the Kusto Group.\n\nUnsure whether it was true, Mr. Moore tried to ferret out more information. He said he had found nothing at first on Kusto\u2019s website to connect the firm or its founder and chairman, a Kazakh businessman named Yerkin Tatishev, to asbestos. Rather, Mr. Moore said, he stumbled over a link in 2014 when K2 Intelligence assigned him to go back to Thailand.\n\nHe kept striking out initially when he asked officials of roofing tile companies there if they had heard of Kusto. Then he showed one local official photographs of executives from Kusto\u2019s affiliate in Vietnam.\n\nMr. Moore said the official had recognized two of the executives from their work with a previous company and told him that \u201cthose are the guys who sold us asbestos from the oligarch.\u201d The same official added that Mr. Tatishev had once visited a roofing tile company in Thailand to urge it to keep using asbestos, according to Mr. Moore.\n\nThose leads weren\u2019t conclusive. But Mr. Moore says he began to focus his efforts on understanding what part, if any, Kusto or Mr. Tatishev was playing in the asbestos industry. In one 2015 email, for instance, he suggested to an anti-asbestos activist that they start looking into Kusto and the role of Russian asbestos producers in blocking bans in Southeast Asia. And he contacted journalists and filmmakers about making a documentary with him about the asbestos trade.\n\nHe also met at a London restaurant with a director, Dan Reed, to discuss a film project based on his experience as a corporate operative. Mr. Moore envisioned the film as having a climactic scene in which he would out himself as a whistle-blower at an asbestos conference.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a part of this,\u2019 and thought there was an opportunity to expose it,\u201d Mr. Reed said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moore said he started secretly recording his meetings with Mr. Bigazzi of K2 Intelligence. While in Vietnam for the firm, he also gave a speech to reporters titled \u201cThe Duty of Journalists to Protect the Public Health,\u201d in which he urged them to investigate the role of Kazakhstan and Russia in asbestos use. One slide he showed had a photograph of Mr. Tatishev and bags of asbestos.\n\nMr. Moore said he had received an irate phone call afterward from Mr. Bigazzi, who had somehow learned about the talk. But Mr. Moore said he had defused the situation by telling Mr. Bigazzi that he had repeated the contentions of anti-asbestos advocates only to maintain his cover as a journalist.\n\nThe strain of his life appeared to be taking a toll on Mr. Moore, friends of his said. Bill Lawrence, an occupational safety expert who was helping him analyze asbestos export data, said that he called Mr. Moore at home. During the conversation, Mr. Lawrence overheard Mr. Moore\u2019s companion express fear about their safety.\n\n\u201cThis is getting too dangerous, Rob,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said he had heard the woman say.\n\nLegal Repercussions\n\nMr. Moore\u2019s life as an operative soon unraveled. In late 2015, Mr. Moore said, K2 Intelligence offered him another assignment, this time to get close to leaders of a major anticorruption group, Global Witness.\n\nGlobal Witness was then working with the authorities in several countries investigating two major oil producers for suspected bribery. Mr. Moore said K2 Intelligence had wanted to find out on behalf of one of the companies what the group knew about those inquiries. But he took another approach.\n\nIn June 2016, he met with a co-founder of Global Witness, Simon Taylor, in a setting worthy of an espionage novel \u2014 a restaurant inside London\u2019s bustling St. Pancras train station. Soon, Mr. Moore placed a book, \u201cAgent Zigzag,\u201d on the table between them. The book chronicles the real-life adventures of a famous British double agent against the Nazis.\n\nMr. Taylor recalled Mr. Moore saying words to the effect of: \u201cIf you know this story, this is what I want to do for you.\u201d Mr. Moore proposed playing the part of a double agent, sharing that K2 Intelligence had also paid him to spy on anti-asbestos advocates, Mr. Taylor said.\n\nGlobal Witness considered Mr. Moore\u2019s proposal but decided it could not trust him, Mr. Taylor said. The group also urged him to alert activists such Ms. Kazan-Allen about his work. When Mr. Moore balked, Global Witness contacted a law firm. That firm then sued K2 Intelligence, Mr. Moore and Mr. Bigazzi in 2016 on behalf of several activists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moore said he felt that Global Witness had betrayed him and insists that he was close to telling activists the truth. But Mr. Taylor said it was not Mr. Moore\u2019s role to set the timetable, adding that his reports to the intelligence firm\u2019s client might have jeopardized the safety of activists.\n\n\u201cHe is not in a position to play God,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.\n\nMr. Moore has struggled since the lawsuit. He said he had spent his life savings, over $375,000, on legal fees and was now represented by pro bono attorneys.\n\nMr. Moore said he understood why advocates like Ms. Kazan-Allen felt betrayed. He believes that they will come to see him differently if he has a chance to tell his story in court.\n\nIn its filings in London, K2 Intelligence said it had undertaken the asbestos inquiry on behalf of a trade group called the Chrysotile Cement Industry of Kazakhstan.\n\nA spokesman for the Kusto Group, Michael Farrant, said the firm had never had any asbestos-related holdings. However, Kusto\u2019s website notes that Mr. Tatishev, before starting Kusto, was a major player in the asbestos industry who revived the fortunes of two large asbestos mines, one in Kazakhstan and the other in Russia.\n\nThe Kazakh mine, Kostanai Minerals, is a member of the Chrysotile Cement Industry of Kazakhstan. \u201cThe town and its operations were on the brink of bankruptcy,\u201d Kusto\u2019s website states. \u201cSomething profound had to change.\u201d\n\nMr. Tatishev declined through Mr. Farrant to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions about his current interests in any entities involved with asbestos.\n\nEfforts to settle the lawsuit are underway, though Mr. Moore said he had resisted doing so. Some activists have rejected his tale of intrigue as a product of his imagination. \u201cHow can you believe that anything he says is true?\u201d Ms. Kazan-Allen said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers, while finding Mr. Moore\u2019s tactics unacceptable, believe his intentions were genuine. \u201cEvery part of my bones tells me there is truth in what he is saying,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence, the occupational safety expert.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Moore said, he has gone back to developing prank comedy shows, though he is not sure what the future holds.\n\n\u201cDo I strike you as someone who knows how to plan?\u201d he asked.", "title": "A Spy\u2019s Tale: The TV Prankster Who Says He Became a Double Agent", "authors": ["Barry Meier"]}

In her review, Manohla Dargis writes that \u201cthe absence of Arab voices beyond those of the terrorists further flattens a movie that never fully takes satisfying shape.\u201d\n\nBut fear not! There are plenty of films made by Lebanese filmmakers that counter such reductive visions. Many local favorites \u2014 like \u201cWest Beirut,\u201d \u201cZozo\u201d and \u201cLittle Wars\u201d \u2014 haven\u2019t reached the streaming world yet, but the streaming platform M Media has been building a library of Arab films old and new.

Named after a wax-like concoction widely used across the Middle East for hair removal, the film stars Labaki as one of five women who work at and frequent a beauty salon in Beirut. Each woman\u2019s woes touch on issues that aren\u2019t often talked about in the more traditional parts of the Arab world \u2014 like infidelity, homosexuality and mental health.\n\nThe film takes place in a world devoid of war and its tensions, instead taking an emotion-driven look at everyday lives. This seemed to be a welcome change for audiences. In 2007, \u201cCaramel\u201d topped the box office charts in Lebanon and became the first Lebanese film to open theatrically in the United States.\n\n0\n\nIf You Like Tales of Morality\n\nEmmanuel Khairallah in \u201cGhadi.\u201d Fortissimo Films\n\n\u2018Ghadi\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime, iTunes, M Media\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nLike \u201cCaramel,\u201d this heart-warming dramedy from 2013 makes no mention of Lebanon\u2019s contemporary politics. Instead, the film is a social satire told through the eyes of Leba, a music instructor from a provincial Christian village where gossip thrives and privacy is a foreign concept. Leba\u2019s young son, Ghadi, has Down syndrome and spends much of his time trying to mimic his father\u2019s singing, provoking the ire of the intolerant townsfolk.\n\nWhile open public discussions around disabilities and mental health are finally cropping up in Lebanon, the subject has long been taboo. This lighthearted feature gently denounces bigotry with humor and its spot-on portrayal of Lebanese village life.\n\nIf You Like Quirky Dramedies\n\nA scene from \"Where Do We Go Now?

Its shortcomings end there, however. Led by Labaki, who also plays the young widow Amale, a group of Muslim and Christian women in an isolated Lebanese village scheme to keep their belligerent men from starting a sectarian war.\n\nUnlike the women in the ancient Greek play \u201cLysistrata,\u201d who end war by withholding sex, the women in this film exploit carnal desire. The film made waves in Lebanon for its unorthodox approach to a grave concept.

Not so with this heart-wrenching road movie. Shot during the 2006 conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah, \u201cUnder the Bombs\u201d is a docu-fiction drama with some very real elements. The bombs exploding in the distance are not fabricated, and the cast consists mostly of nonprofessional actors who are merely reenacting their experiences. This is by no means a polished production, but it stands out because of its visceral tragedy and moving performances, which capture the realities of war the way few films have.\n\nIf You\u2019re a Theater Buff\n\nA scene from \u201cWhat About Tomorrow?\u201d M Media\n\n\u2018What About Tomorrow?\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: M Media\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe play \u201cWhat About Tomorrow?\u201d had an 8-month run in Beirut in 1978. Directed by the composer and playwright Ziad Rahbani, who also stars, it has been an important cultural reference point in Lebanon ever since. At once a searing and sardonic look at the demands of city living, the production follows Zakaria and his wife Thuraya, who run a bar in the trendy Hamra neighborhood of Beirut. In an effort to keep themselves afloat, Zakaria reluctantly allows Thuraya to work as a prostitute.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the play was accessible only in audio format for most people. But over the course of three years, M Media cleaned and pieced together the 8-millimeter footage used for this restoration, which was was originally recorded to help the actors improve their performances (and thus never intended for a theatrical release). Fans rejoiced at the result: The film shattered box-office records in Lebanon when it opened in 2016.\n\nIf You Like Dark Comedies\n\nAlain Saadeh in \u201cVery Big Shot.\u201d Kabreet Productions\n\n\u2018Very Big Shot\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix, Google Play, YouTube\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cVery Big Shot\u201d starts out as an action thriller about three brothers who are trying to close up shop on their drug-dealing operation and go straight. But when a mishap during their last deal leaves them with a truck full of amphetamines, the film takes a sharp, comedic turn into social commentary.\n\n0\n\nIn a plan to smuggle the drugs to Iraq, the three brothers take control of a film project by one of their indebted cocaine buyers, and the production eventually draws intense media coverage. The absurdity of the plot is a nod to the widespread corruption in Lebanon (a recent study found that Lebanon was the most corrupt country in the Arab world), and a tendency for public opinion to be easily swayed by theatrics. Some moments of \u201cVery Big Shot\u201d are stronger than others, but this bold comedy is a refreshing change from the depictions of love and war you\u2019ll typically find in Lebanese cinema.\n\nIf You Like Forbidden Love Stories\n\nFlavia Bechara in \u201cThe Kite.\u201d Ognon Pictures, via Everett Collection\n\n\u2018The Kite\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime, Fandor\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nDirector Randa Chahal Sabbag has described this family drama as a fairy tale and a fable. Call it what you will, but one thing is for sure: It\u2019s a conversation starter. In it, a teenager named Lamia lives in a Lebanese village near the Israeli border that was split when Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. Her conservative family arranges for her to marry her cousin on the Israeli side, a plan Lamia could not be less enthusiastic about. On her wedding day, she crosses the border and catches the eye of a young Israeli-Arab soldier, Youssef. Intrigued by his watchful gaze, Lamia rejects her marriage and pursues the forbidden fruit.\n\nThe complexities of Israeli-Arab affairs give \u201cThe Kite\u201d a specific political context, but its basic premise of teenage rebellion is universal. And the comical scenes of covered women on both sides of the border discussing private matters (such as Lamia\u2019s puberty) over a megaphone relieve the drama of its sorrow.\n\nIf You Like Thrillers With a Romantic Edge\n\nDarine Hamze in \u201cBeirut Hotel.\u201d M Media\n\n\u2018Beirut Hotel\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: M Media\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn a security-obsessed country like Lebanon, plagued by conspiracies and proxy wars, you never know what kind of sticky situation you might fall into.

But the three do share one trait: They are all unpopular at home despite the good economic times.\n\nThis is new. For most of the postwar era, voters in the big democracies rewarded leaders for strong economies and punished them for policies that hurt growth. Now the link between good politics and good economics seems to have broken.\n\nLast year, the global economy was finally accelerating out of the long torpor that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Unemployment hit lows not seen in decades, and inflation all but disappeared. Yet by January, my index of approval ratings for leaders in 20 major democracies showed their average rating hitting a new low of just 35 percent, down from a peak of more than 50 percent a decade ago.\n\nPresident Trump is Exhibit A of this fraying connection between politics and economics. Surveys of consumer confidence show that Americans haven\u2019t felt this good about the economy since at least the height of the dot-com boom in 2000. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings have hovered around record lows for this point in any president\u2019s first term.

You\u2019re getting out all the water you can and caramelizing all the sugars. Add a scoop of ice cream, and it\u2019s a great experience.\u201d\n\nFor Blue Hill\u2019s squash dessert, the honeynut squash \u2014 a smaller, sweeter relative of butternut squash \u2014 was roasted for several hours, scooped out and dried further on the stove top. \u201cEvery bite you are taking is squash times 800 percent,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cIf it was picked at the right moment, it bombs with sweetness. That\u2019s true of parsnips, celery roots and beets as well.\u201d\n\nAlthough we tend to think of vegetables as a savory food, every vegetable has a natural range of sugar that can vary based on the soil and growing conditions, how recently it was picked and whether it was in the ground during a freeze.\n\nA food\u2019s sugar content is measured on a Brix scale (named after Adolf Brix, the German chemist who first measured sugar in plant juice) \u2014 the higher the number, the sweeter the food.\n\nFor instance, sweet corn can average about 10 on the Brix scale, but can go as high as 24, putting it in the same range as grapes, oranges, papayas and pineapples. Carrots can range from 4 to 18 \u2014 similar to kumquats, mangoes and raspberries. Bananas and melons can measure around 12 to 14 on the Brix scale, along with tomatoes, sweet potatoes, English peas, beets, broccoli, celery and cucumbers.\n\nBrix scores are affected by soil conditions, weather, harvesting and storage conditions. Most experts agree that fresh vegetables sold at farmers\u2019 markets are likely to have higher Brix scores than those bought at grocery stores. The website High Brix Gardens found that green beans picked from a home garden scored a sweet 6.2 on the Brix scale, compared to 4.2 for beans bought at a grocery store. In a 2011 Ohio State study, cucumbers collected from four Ohio farms had vastly different Brix readings, ranging from 2.2 to 5.4, showing how different growing methods and soil conditions can affect sugar content even in the same region.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring cold weather, root vegetables like carrots and parsnips convert starch to sugar to prevent freezing, resulting in a sweeter taste. As a result, a carrot or parsnip picked after a freeze will have a higher sugar content than those harvested before the freeze.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an experiment at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., the farm harvested different sections of a carrot plot each week. Some of the carrots went through three freezes. The sugar content jumped from 3 or 4 Brix in the early batches to 7 in the later-harvested carrots. The restaurant created a \u201chigh-Brix\u201d carrot sorbet served with parsnip cake or purple sweet potato sorbet.\n\nSome home gardeners have taken to measuring Brix levels \u2014 in addition to sweetness, a high Brix reading is also believed to be associated with higher mineral density and pest resistance. A device called a refractometer, sold on Amazon for $20 to $30, can measure Brix levels from a drop of juice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Rhubarb, for instance, is a vegetable traditionally used in desserts, even though it can be bitter. By comparison, tomatoes (technically a fruit) and celery aren\u2019t \u201cdessert\u201d foods, but they can actually be sweeter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a huge fan of rhubarb, but I\u2019ve reached for celery over and over again,\u201d Mr. Stupak said. \u201cI think it has brilliant effects in the dessert world.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt Empell\u00f3n in Midtown Manhattan, diners have been served corn ice cream tacos (a more sophisticated version of the ice cream truck Choco Taco) and banana ice cream topped with a tuile ribbon of roasted parsnip. One of the signature dishes at Empell\u00f3n is made with avocado, a savory fruit rarely used in dessert. Mr. Stupak\u2019s creation is essentially a parfait glac\u00e9, a French iced dessert typically made with egg yolks, sugar, heavy cream and flavoring, but in the Empell\u00f3n version, avocado pur\u00e9e replaces the cream, and the final dessert is shaped to look like exactly a real avocado, including the dark skin.\n\n\u201cI love tasting avocado in the sweet context,\u201d Mr. Stupak said. \u201cIf you really eat an avocado and close your eyes and taste it, the flavors are subtly nutty and almost anise-like or fennel-like.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Stupak noted that carrot cake, while popular, doesn\u2019t really taste like carrots. \u201cSomething like a carrot sorbet or carrot ice cream gets much closer to transmitting the flavor,\u201d he said.

He turned a separate barnlike structure where hay was once stored into a warm, wood-filled salon decorated with art, vintage furniture and a zigzag sofa he designed.\n\nWas it daunting to renovate and furnish what amounts to a castle?\n\nI think it was the most crazy thing I have ever done. If you think too much about possessing this kind of property, you don\u2019t, because there is too much work, too much everything. But for me, life is short, and you need to do some crazy things.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe salon is fairly spare, with carefully chosen objects. What\u2019s your criteria?\n\nIn every client project, and for myself, I try to make a story around the room. Here, I don\u2019t want to use any shiny fabric, bronze and so on, because it was a farm.

We didn\u2019t know how to parent teenagers then, but it worked.\u201d\n\nThe custom of players\u2019 living with local families means the deaths double the number of parents affected. In a new subdivision behind Humboldt\u2019s hospital, Devin and Rene Cannon were hosts to two players killed in the crash: Logan Hunter, 18, and Adam Herold, whose 17th birthday would have been on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t built to not get attached,\u201d Ms. Cannon told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cWe take every single boy that\u2019s ever come into our house right into our hearts and into our family.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThey\u2019re children of our heart from the moment they walk in our door.

Solar panels and washing machines were his first targets. Then came steel and aluminum.\n\nTariffs may or may not help the targeted industries, which in these cases are not significant segments of the economy, anyway, and the taxes are almost universally viewed as harmful to consumers, who have to pay more for the affected goods. And then there\u2019s the impact of tariffs imposed by foreign governments in retaliation, which came swiftly from China, the main target of the trade war that Mr. Trump has threatened to wage.\n\nThe potential impact of the back-and-forth trade moves, and the ones that yet may come, helped send stocks on one of the swiftest plunges on record starting in late January \u2014 11.8 percent in less than 10 trading days for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\n\nThat was followed by a rally that recouped most of the loss, and then another decline that took the index close to a fresh low, leaving it down 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, the first quarterly decline since 2015. The early days of April have been rocky as well.\n\nIf a trade war really has begun, some household names in corporate America could become casualties, Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, warned.\n\n\u201cThere are already a lot of U.S. companies doing really well in China,\u201d he said. \u201cG.M. sells more cars in China than in the U.S., Boeing sells more planes in China than in any other market, and Apple derives 20 percent of its revenues in China. Those are big listed names.\u201d\n\nThe impact would go beyond sales in China, he added.

That\u2019s why he expects the president\u2019s protectionist tendencies to be reined in.\n\n\u201cThe odds of a full-blown trade war are extremely low,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. Not only is the Chinese leadership eager to avoid one, but \u201cTrump must be coming under a lot of pressure not to do this for the damage it will do to the U.S. equity market.\u201d\n\nTobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, also foresees limited damage to the economy and stocks from an unraveling in trade relations. He pointed to the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs offered to big trading partners like Canada and Mexico, and he expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions merely reflected his penchant for eccentric deal making.\n\n\u201cTrump has a unique negotiating style,\u201d Mr. Levkovich said. But \u201cif he takes it further, it could be a problem and hurt growth in a more meaningful way.\u201d As for the impact of the president\u2019s tactics on investments, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nMr. Yardeni said he thought a trade war could be forestalled, although the mere prospect of one could depress the stock market.

If inflation is up, then you need significantly tight monetary policy. That\u2019s bad for bonds and also stocks.\u201d\n\nMr. Inker is concerned about a trade war, like many other investors, but he emphasizes the risk of higher prices on goods \u2014 inflation \u2014 that it might cause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe nightmare scenario is a general rise of economic nationalism and the mercantilist view that trade has winners and losers,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you get a retreat from globalization, which has helped the economy grow without experiencing significant inflation.\u201d\n\nWhen stocks fall, so usually do yields on high-quality bonds, sending prices higher in a so-called flight to safety. But one ominous development during the first leg of the decline in stocks, from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, was that the yield on 10-year Treasury securities rose to 2.85 percent from 2.66 percent. Yields were steady during the second wave of selling in stocks, but they rose overall during the first quarter, to 2.74 percent from 2.4 percent.\n\nThat means that bond prices, as well as stock prices, fell.\n\nTerri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, warned in a note to clients that the traditional balanced portfolio, split 60/40 between stocks and bonds, might not provide the protection through diversification that it used to if the bond bull market that began in the early 1980s is over, as she believes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTightening Fed policy, inflation, rapidly growing deficits and their impact on rates can sometimes move bond prices violently,\u201d Ms. Spath wrote. \u201cJuly 2016 marked the lowest level in rates I will likely see in my lifetime,\u201d with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching 1.33 percent. \u201cIf interest rates continue the climb up from that level, traditional bonds and the 60/40 will continue to die, as foreshadowed during the first correction of 2018.\u201d\n\nMs. Spath is not alone in disdaining bonds. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers, released in late March, showed bonds to be the second-least-favorite of 22 asset classes \u2014 behind only British stocks \u2014 relative to how managers have rated them throughout the survey\u2019s 17-year history.\n\nBond funds and domestic and international stock funds all fell in the first quarter, though not by that much. The average taxable bond fund declined 0.5 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by portfolios specializing in longer-term issues.\n\nThe average domestic stock fund fell 0.4 percent, with consumer defensive and natural resources groups faring worse than most and technology being one of the few clear winners, up 6 percent. International funds declined 0.3 percent, although specialists in China and Latin America recorded gains.\n\nWith interest rates rising, stock market valuations still high and protectionist impulses threatening to ignite a full-blown trade war, advisers encourage investors to indulge protectionist impulses of a different sort when it comes to their portfolios. They recommend keeping less money in stocks or being more selective about the ones investors own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off investing pretty much anywhere other than the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Inker said about stocks, although he prefers Treasury bonds to foreign bonds.\n\nThe only type of investment he recommends outright, rather than in comparison to others that he deems even worse, is \u201cthe cheap half of emerging\u201d markets, in particular technology stocks in places like Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia.\n\n\u201cOther than emerging market value, we don\u2019t see assets that deserve to go up a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nCiti\u2019s analysts prefer emerging markets and Europe, where stocks are cheaper and central banks are doing more to prop up the markets. Mr. Levkovich counters that stocks are cheaper abroad for good reasons: American businesses have higher returns on equity, and American benchmark stock indexes are heavier in technology and lighter in the financial industry.\n\nMr. Levkovich recommended that investors prune their portfolios to enhance return prospects. In particular, he would be cautious on tech and usually defensive areas like utilities, consumer staples and telecoms, and emphasize traditional industrial companies and the materials industry, including chemical producers.\n\nMr. Yardeni remains optimistic about stocks, but he\u2019s in no hurry to buy.\n\n\u201cYou have to recognize that if you\u2019re thinking of buying stocks, you\u2019re not exactly getting in early,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have a shakeout here until we get clarity on protectionism.\u201d\n\nHis advice is to be patient in the likelihood that stocks can be bought at lower prices. When the time feels right, he said, he would look at exporters and other companies that would be on the front lines in a trade war, which he expects to be averted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to find some good opportunities in blue-chip stocks with exposure to tariff issues,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. But for now, he cautioned, risks in the market have risen.\n\n\u201cThis probably will turn out to be a panic attack, like before,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has the potential to be a more serious correction than we\u2019ve had in some time.\u201d", "title": "A Trade War Could Leave Investors With Few Places to Hide", "authors": ["Conrad De Aenlle"]}

China\u2019s airlines will remain reliant on a steady supply of Boeing\u2019s aircraft for a long time. The facilities in China that make G.M. and Apple products are big employers. And since the proposed tariffs most likely won\u2019t be in effect by the time first-quarter earnings are announced, companies will probably be able to get away with some generalities.\n\nStill, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.\n\nBoeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\n\n\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201d\n\nWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nFed and trade shake markets.\n\nFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.\n\nAny indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.\n\nNow the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.\n\nA one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.\n\nMarkets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.\n\nComments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.\n\nPhoto\n\nInvestors should get ready to feel \u2018a little pain.\u2019\n\nPresident Trump, in a radio interview that was taped on Thursday and aired on Friday, acknowledged his approach to China could cause \u201ca little pain\u201d to financial markets but that it would be worth it in the long run.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\n\n\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d \u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201d\n\nThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.\n\nSome context here: The price of aluminum per pound has been falling since February, a decline that started before the tariffs were imposed. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt Canada, which supplied more than half of America\u2019s aluminum imports in 2016, has also helped to soften the blow from tariffs, companies say.\n\n\u2018China is prepared\u2019 to duel on tariffs\n\nIn response to a potential new set of U.S. tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, Beijing said in a briefing on Friday that it would \u201cimmediately fight back with a major response.\u201d\n\nMore from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\n\n\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201d\n\nThe briefing \u2014 amid a Chinese holiday \u2014 signals the latest instance of saber-rattling between the U.S. and China on trade. But was Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday just a bluff? Even his advisers aren\u2019t sure.\n\nThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:\n\nBut China has reasons to think it could win a trade war. (Worth noting: U.S. tariffs wouldn\u2019t bite until after a two-month comment period.)\n\nMore companies, like Cargill, are getting jumpy. Some fear the tensions could kill Qualcomm\u2019s bid for NXP Semiconductor. Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s international business, is worried, too: He said the hostilities could be \u201cthe greatest danger to the world economy,\u201d but aren\u2019t at a war level yet. The Economist says that the president\u2019s comments \u201cdo not suggest he is ready to sue for peace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, the White House hopes to announce a preliminary Nafta deal this month after revising some of its more aggressive demands.\n\nReaction of the day, from Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska:\n\nIs the inflation scare over?\n\nEarlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.\n\nBut as they gauge wage pressures, analysts also pay close attention to the forces that indirectly affect wages. One of those is, of course, the number of additional jobs the economy is creating. March\u2019s gain of 103,000 jobs was below economists\u2019 forecasts and about half the monthly average this year. That weakness will no doubt reduce inflation fears still further.\n\nThe March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\n\n\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nHiring slowed in March\n\nThe United States added jobs for its 90th straight month in March, an unprecedented run of growth for the economy, but at a much slower pace than in March.\n\nThe headline numbers\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 thousand +300 200 100 0 Monthly change in jobs +103,000\n\nMarch 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 thousand +300 200 100 0 +103,000\n\nMarch Monthly change in jobs\n\n\u2022 103,000 jobs were added last month. Wall Street economists had expected an increase of about 185,000, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent for the sixth straight month.\n\n% +4 2 0 +2.7% \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 Year-over-year wage growth % +4 2 0 +2.7% \u201908 \u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Year-over-year wage growth\n\n\u2022 Average earnings rose by 8 cents an hour and are up 2.7 percent over the past year.\n\n% 10 5 0 4.1% \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 Unemployment rate % 10 5 0 4.1% \u201907 \u201908 \u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Unemployment Rate\n\n\u2022 Estimates of February\u2019s job growth were revised upward, but January\u2019s figure was revised sharply downward. The net result was a loss of 50,000 jobs relative to prior estimates.\n\nThe takeaways\n\n\u2022 Wage growth remains weaker than most economists would expect when unemployment is so low.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The manufacturing sector has posted solid job gains over the past year, and that growth continued in March, when American factories added 22,000 jobs. But mounting trade tensions with China could threaten the sector\u2019s rebound in the months ahead.\n\n\u2022 Perhaps the biggest surprise in the blockbuster February report was the surge of workers into the labor force. That flood of new workers partly reversed in March, when the labor force shrank by 158,000 people.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhere to begin with the FT\u2019s lunch with the Mooch?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to quote from Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s meal with Edward Luce of the FT \u2014 held at the Hunt and Fish Club, the Midtown Manhattan restaurant that the onetime investor owns, naturally. So we\u2019ll have to limit ourselves to just a few selections:\n\n\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives. You only use these in New York. In Washington you use a shiv, or mechanisms in the press, back-stabbing, subterfuge, opposition research . . . Not in New York. We come at you right from the front.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy parents thought it was Hartford law school, Connecticut \u2014 not Harvard,\u201d he says. \u201cTrue story.

When I told them I was going to Goldman Sachs they didn\u2019t know what that was, either. \u2022 \u201cWall Street is a circulatory system for American capitalism.

All those companies were also sanctioned for being controlled or owned directly or indirectly by Mr. Deripaska.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Treasury Department said about the move against the businessman:\n\nOleg Deripaska is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13661 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport, and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat does Jamie Dimon\u2019s annual letter say about his politics?\n\nAndrew\u2019s take: A favorite Wall Street parlor game is whether the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. would run for president in 2020. Mr. Dimon\u2019s latest annual letter increased that chatter, touching on immigration and political polarization. He praised some of President Trump\u2019s policies (on tougher trade negotiations, on taxes). But his stances on deregulation and on social issues likely mean that he would have to run as an independent \u2014 and history hasn\u2019t been kind to third-party candidates.\n\nPeter Eavis adds: The JPMorgan chief also homed in on regulations of bank liquidity, or access to cash and equivalents. He contended that liquidity requirements are higher now \u2014 which he favors \u2014 but are also more rigid and could impinge on lending. But the argument is flawed, in part because banks that have less liquidity aren\u2019t in a position to lend.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlackRock acts on guns\n\nThe investment behemoth\u2019s plan to offer new funds that exclude gun makers or sellers is the latest prominent step by a financial firm to offer some support to gun control.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "Once established as a global reserve currency, the dollar has been kept strong by sustained demand for it, and a strong dollar makes American exports expensive to the rest of the world. American exports decline, imports increase, and a result is the trade deficit. Testifying before Congress in 1960, the economist Robert Triffin observed that the dollar\u2019s global reserve status depends on the willingness of the United States to run trade deficits. This relationship, known as Triffin\u2019s Dilemma, doesn\u2019t always hold true (other countries have had reserve currencies and a trade surplus), but the American trade deficit with China, $375.2 billion last year, offers perhaps the best example of how a strong currency and trade deficits are connected.\n\nStill, there are enormous benefits to being able to print paper money and have the world treat it as if it were gold. Other countries need American dollars, and they are willing to pay a premium to hold them. Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, finance minister of France from 1962 to 1966, called this an \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d Once they have amassed those all-important dollars, countries use them to buy United States Treasury bonds. (China alone held $1.2 trillion dollars of United States government debt at the end of 2017.) This enormous global demand for American debt means that the United States can borrow at relatively low interest rates, financing its budget deficits away.\n\nThe \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d extends to ordinary Americans, who have access to a vast supply of credit and can borrow to buy homes and cars at lower interest rates.\n\nAs the trade war rhetoric escalates, some raise the fear that China could sell off its dollar-denominated assets, which could trigger a rise in interest rates, inflation and possibly devaluation of the dollar. Even the threat of a sudden sell-off can stir up trouble in global currency markets. China could also diversify its cash reserves away from the dollar and acquire yen, euro or sterling instruments, or commodities such as gold. Indeed, China has already been accumulating gold, ranking as one of the world\u2019s largest importers of it.\n\nChina and the United States are too closely economically intertwined via the dollar to make that a credible fear. United States treasuries are still the world\u2019s safe haven of choice. And selling off American debt would cause the yuan to appreciate, which would put China\u2019s exports at a disadvantage.\n\nStill, China is clearly taking steps to ensure a larger role for its currency. In 2015, the yuan was designated by the International Monetary Fund as one of five elite currencies in the world, along with the dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. China is putting in place a pilot program with Russia and Angola, in which it can buy oil with yuan instead of with dollars. As the biggest importer of crude oil in the world, China believes it has the purchasing power to push for settlement in yuan. Even Saudi Arabia, a stalwart American ally, is under increasing pressure to accept yuan for its oil trade. If the yuan does become a global reserve currency, China, too, could see its influence and economic power expand even further.", "title": "Opinion | A Trade War the U.S. Is Actually Winning, for Now", "authors": []}

She spoke to the newspaper vendor, then made her way along the street to a building, where she took an envelope with two keys from her bag ...

I wanted to move my characters through time to explore that experience, all underpinned by a mystery, that archetypal journey through chaos to resolution.\u201d\n\nWinspear doesn\u2019t outline before she writes.

That was a hugely important insight, one that Uwe delved into in a series of path-breaking papers. To give you a sense of the kinds of things he explored, another of his major papers was titled \u201cThe pricing of US hospital services: chaos behind a veil of secrecy.\u201d\n\nYou might think that everyone would be eager to get health care facts right; that is, you might think that if you\u2019ve been living in a cave for, I don\u2019t know, the past 35 years or so. The reality is that policy debates over health care are, if anything, even uglier than average for U.S. economic debate, which is really saying something; the reason, I think, is because the facts \u2013 the kind of facts Uwe dedicated his working life to discovering \u2013 are so inconsistent with many forms of political orthodoxy.\n\nSo it would have been understandable and forgivable if Uwe had become a pugnacious, somewhat angry warrior. The miraculous thing is that he didn\u2019t. In the battlefield of ideas and ideology that is health economics, Uwe was always a calm voice of reason, telling people things they didn\u2019t want to hear but without a trace of personal rancor. I\u2019ve run into people who vigorously disagreed with Uwe \u2013 vigorously and, invariably, wrongly. But I\u2019ve never run into anyone who disliked him.\n\nAnd while keeping an even keel amid intellectual storms, he managed at the same time to be something you might guess from his paper titles: consistently, uproariously funny. Every talk I ever heard him give was simultaneously serious in purpose and a barrel of laughs; everyone I know who ever heard him talk says the same thing.\n\nThat was Uwe Reinhardt the economist. Let me just finish up with a few words about Uwe Reinhardt the man.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a big announcement this week: The E.P.A. will reconsider, and most likely roll back, Obama-era automobile standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency. The decision goes beyond what even the automakers had asked for, and sets up a showdown with California over air pollution rules.\n\nBut headlines in recent days have focused on Mr. Pruitt himself as he faces a growing list of potential ethics scandals. It can be hard to follow every development, so let us catch you up on some of the biggest ones dogging Mr. Pruitt this week.\n\nTravel: Mr. Pruitt is still under fire for extensive first-class and business-class travel. Records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project and reviewed by The New York Times showed that two weeks of travel in June for the administrator and his aides cost taxpayers more than $120,000. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is reviewing Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel, as is the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general. On Tuesday Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote to Mr. Pruitt asking him to explain a $40,000 five-day trip to Morocco with staff in December. Mr. Whitehouse cited the administrator\u2019s calendar for the trip, which showed one full workday and two other days with one hourlong meeting each. The E.P.A. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRaises: Amid all the scrutiny of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel and personal finances, other issues are brewing inside the agency. The Atlantic broke a story Tuesday showing that the administrator bypassed the usual White House procedures to give political appointees substantial raises.

The alleged culprit? Jesse Delbert Daniels, an impoverished, mentally impaired 19-year-old with a fifth-grade education. Daniels was also white. Oldham explained that the house was so dark at the time of the rape that Knowles had misidentified her assailant\u2019s skin color.\n\nPhoto\n\nWas this a case in which justice was actually served? Or was something more confounding \u2014 and insidious \u2014 at work? McCall had held two black men in custody for several days; Knowles stated that a black man attacked her, and now McCall, who once declared that black men had a \u201cbarbarous animal instinct\u201d that \u201ca white man don\u2019t have,\u201d was suddenly saying a white man did it.\n\nAs a local journalist named Mabel Norris Reese put it at the time, this was a puzzling turn from an office \u201cthat gloats over the \u2018crime record\u2019 of Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf McCall is the villain of King\u2019s book, Reese is clearly the hero, doggedly trying to find out what happened to Blanche Knowles while teaming up with Daniels\u2019s mother, Pearl, to advocate on his behalf. At a hearing that lasted barely five minutes, Truman G. Futch \u2014 the same judge from the Groveland case \u2014 deemed Daniels \u201cinsane and incompetent,\u201d and had him committed to the Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee without a trial. Daniels, who still slept with a teddy bear, would spend the next 14 years there, confined to the criminal ward.\n\nReese got ensnared in a tangled web of promising leads and dead ends \u2014 as does King\u2019s book, which can get bogged down in the morass of Lake County\u2019s unrelenting racism and squalid corruption.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

McCall insisted on inspecting the children himself, pointing to the 13-year-old daughter and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like the shape of that one\u2019s nose.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that King\u2019s digressions are uninteresting, or even irrelevant. It\u2019s just that combined with the baroque twists of the Daniels case, the book begins to get unwieldy. King, an amateur historian, has an appreciation for the startling detail and the circuitous connection. He\u2019s clearly done his research, unearthing transcripts and talking to survivors.\n\nBut where \u201cDevil in the Grove\u201d pitted McCall\u2019s viciousness against the rich and complicated character of Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who defended the Groveland Four, \u201cBeneath a Ruthless Sun\u201d tracks the noble efforts of Reese, who is mainly presented here through her earnest editorials. No doubt Reese was not as one-dimensional as the upstanding figure in this book (in the Groveland case, King mentions, she had initially called for the execution of the defendants). But without a more riveting linchpin to anchor the narrative, \u201cBeneath a Ruthless Sun\u201d grows as sprawling as the conspiracy it depicts.\n\nWhich ultimately might illustrate King\u2019s point. The plot against Daniels seems baffling, verging on nonsensical \u2014 until you begin to see the community the way King does: so deformed by racial animus and misogyny that the white establishment of Lake County deemed it less of an \u201cindignity\u201d for Knowles to have been raped by a white man than a black man.\n\nTo disclose too many details would be to spoil the book, since much of its momentum relies on the true crime at the center of it, and the mystery of how the many bewildering bits of information might all fit together. The racism and corruption King depicts were so embedded in Lake County that they perverted even perversions of justice; the argument is timely and important, even if one sometimes wishes it were more clearly made.", "title": "A True-Crime Mystery From the 1950s, Fueled by Racism and Corruption", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}

As Kit discovers the truth about him, his manipulative manner has a ring of authenticity, particularly when it emerges that his first wife was still alive when he and Kit married, and he has a son he has never told her about. After his first wife dies in Baghdad, he asks Kit to help raise the boy. \u201cIf you are the woman I love,\u201d he tells her, \u201cyou will forgive me.\u201d We are never sure whether Ahmed is simply a liar and adulterer or a man whose political leanings are taking him \u2014 and, by extension, Kit \u2014 down a very dangerous path.\n\nImage\n\nThe political mysteries in Steavenson\u2019s novel could be gripping, but the form-versus-content battle rages throughout. Given the circumstances, it\u2019s easy to accept, for example, that we can never fully understand what Ahmed is up to or why. But our emotional engagement is diminished when potentially dramatic events lead nowhere. In Part 1, Kit negotiates a dangerous journey out of Baghdad to investigate attacks on American soldiers in a town called Samarra. At one point, she and her photographer, Zorro, are locked in a room by the fighter they\u2019ve been interviewing. Have they been abducted? Is an attack in progress? The possibilities are terrifying. But there\u2019s no time for much tension to develop: Within just a few lines, they\u2019re released unharmed. Further on, there is a visit to a remote Syrian monastery and a taut, evocative scene in which mysterious, threatening men come in search of Ahmed. Instead of shooting or kidnapping him, however, it turns out that they, like all the main characters, want to have an intense discussion about the Middle East and its problems.\n\nSo many scenes involve the characters talking about politics or art that I wondered if Steavenson, who now lives in Paris, reads a lot of French fiction, where it\u2019s considered perfectly acceptable to halt the action for page after page so the characters can drink, eat and philosophize. It\u2019s a device that\u2019s likely to make your average English-language reader impatient.\n\nIn Part 3, the novel moves to Paris. Kit and Ahmed separate, and when he returns to Baghdad she takes sole custody of her stepson, Little Ahmed, becoming the blond stepmother of an Iraqi Muslim in a country increasingly suspicious of young men who fit that description. She befriends a woman called Rousse, who works at Charlie Hebdo and is among the victims of the killings there in January 2015 \u2014 although in real life the only woman murdered at the magazine\u2019s office was the columnist Elsa Cayat. The insertion of one of the fictional characters in \u201cParis Metro\u201d into a very real massacre is a tricky balancing act that Steavenson pulls off with sensitivity, but it raises yet again the question of why she has chosen to relate these events in the form of a novel.\n\nIn these middle sections, the stop-start nature of the narrative becomes particularly frustrating. Steavenson has such an abundance of material that it\u2019s never clear what story she\u2019s telling. Is this the tale of a cross-cultural marriage and adoption gone wrong or a political thriller? Is it about the loss of a friend in a terrorist attack or a search for cultural identity?

Andreas Bjelland, a Danish international now with Brentford in England, was the first; three others have followed.\n\nThey are, as Byder said, a \u201cteam behind the team,\u201d their experience in a whole swath of industries, all of which he believes can help develop the club in some way. \u201cWe reflect different resources,\u201d he said. Sponsors are returning, too, eager to be involved.\n\nThe club\u2019s accounts, quickly emptied to pay the players\u2019 overdue wages and the team\u2019s outstanding bills, have been filled again.

Back then, there were lots of families who were linked to the oil business, and many of them were, well, more colorful. The Bushes were just another pair of Yankee immigrants without much flash, which in those days was the behavior of choice.\n\nThen George got into politics, running for president of the Harris County Republican Party in \u201962.

Each event is meant to speak to the theme of European cultural heritage in some form or other, according to the European Commission. To that end, many of the activities aim to be both fun and enriching, and appear to be marketed to Europeans rather than to tourists \u2014 all the better for travelers seeking novel experiences with a more intimate, local feeling than the usual must-see attractions. Below, a sampling of more than half a dozen events to enjoy (some even for free), \u200bfrom now through the end of the year.\n\nSharing Heritage, Germany\n\nThis ongoing countrywide celebration, part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage, includes a variety of activities. Among them is the Handel Festival in Halle, May 25 through June 10, a Baroque homage to the German-born composer in and around the city where he was born. More than 100 events are scheduled, including a new production of the opera \u201c Berenice , Regina d\u2019Egitto, HWV 38,\u201d at Halle Opera. There will also be events in meaningful places throughout the city, like the church where Handel was baptized, and a cathedral where he was an organist. About a three-hour drive north, at the Museum Europ\u00e4ischer Kulturen in Berlin, is \u201cI Never Said Goodbye/Women in Exile,\u201d an exhibition (now through July 15) of photographs by Heike Steinweg of women \u2014 be it an author, artist, or political activist \u2014 living in exile in Berlin.

For instance, on May 18 in Bo\u2019ness, near Edinburgh, Kinneil House \u2014 a former noble\u2019s home beside the Antonine Wall (part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage list) that dates to the Roman Empire \u2014 will be open (for free) in the evening, as will the neighboring museum. The house and museum are part of what\u2019s known as the Kinneil Estate, where, on May 18, there will also be a nature walk and bat spotting on the grounds, an activity few museums and estates can boast they offer. Also during the festival, on May 20, Historic Environment Scotland will lead tours around the estate, which includes a cottage once used by James Watt, the inventor and engineer. (Note for long-distance walkers: The Kinneil Estate and Nature Reserve is part of the John Muir Way walking route across the heart of Scotland.)

But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.\n\nIn 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.\n\nIn addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options \u2014 something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.\n\n\u201cI turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,\u201d Mr. Sutskever said. \u201cOthers did the same.\u201d He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its \u201cmission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.\u201d\n\nOpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nPeople who work at major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them have told The New York Times that A.I. specialists with little or no industry experience can make between $300,000 and $500,000 a year in salary and stock.

While he would not reveal exact numbers, Mr. Zaremba said big tech companies were offering him two or three times what he believed his real market value was.\n\nAt DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company\u2019s annual financial filings in Britain.

They are used in everything from digital assistants in smartphones to self-driving cars.\n\nSome researchers may command higher pay because their names carry weight across the A.I. community and they can help recruit other researchers.\n\nMr. Sutskever was part of a three-researcher team at the University of Toronto that created key so-called computer vision technology. Mr. Goodfellow invented a technique that allows machines to create fake digital photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\n\u201cWhen you hire a star, you are not just hiring a star,\u201d Mr. Nicholson of the start-up Skymind said. \u201cYou are hiring everyone they attract. And you are paying for all the publicity they will attract.\u201d\n\nOther researchers at OpenAI, including Greg Brockman, who leads the lab alongside Mr. Sutskever, did not receive such high salaries during the lab\u2019s first year.\n\nIn 2016, according to the tax forms, Mr. Brockman, who had served as chief technology officer at the financial technology start-up Stripe, made $175,000. As one of the founders of the organization, however, he most likely took a salary below market value. Two other researchers with more experience in the field \u2014 though still very young \u2014 made between $275,000 and $300,000 in salary alone in 2016, according to the forms.\n\nThough the pool of available A.I. researchers is growing, it is not growing fast enough. \u201cIf anything, demand for that talent is growing faster than the supply of new researchers, because A.I. is moving from early adopters to wider use,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said.\n\nThat means it can be hard for companies to hold on to their talent. Last year, after only 11 months at OpenAI, Mr. Goodfellow returned to Google. Mr. Abbeel and two other researchers left the lab to create a robotics start-up, Embodied Intelligence.

The executives will vigorously defend the $85 billion merger, which they say will create a stronger competitor to ascendant streaming video services. The Justice Department is expected to pose tough questions to the executives on how the combined companies could try to raise prices on rival cable and satellite firms \u2014 increases that would trickle down to consumers.

The organizations are likely to repeat their message of recent months, cautioning governments to make tough reforms to increase their economic productivity now, while global growth remains strong.

When he was a boy his family relocated to Algeria; he said that growing up during that country\u2019s war of independence sparked his interest in documenting political events.\n\nHe taught himself to use a camera, and among his earliest jobs was working for the International Olympic Committee at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico. He would return to Mexico in the mid-1980s, taking pictures throughout the country over three years and producing the 1992 book \u201cReturn to Mexico: Journeys Beyond the Mask.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s he worked for the French agencies Sipa and Gamma. Early in that decade he was in Africa, covering the aftermath of the Biafran war in Nigeria and other events. He then found himself back in Iran.\n\n\u201cMy family is from Iran,\u201d he told Vice in 2015, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t as if I felt particularly Iranian back then. But I did feel that things had to change \u2014 you can\u2019t just have some shah making all the important decisions for an entire country.\u201d\n\nAs the situation became more unstable and it became clear to him that the revolutionaries were no better than the regime they were replacing, he faced pressures from friends.\n\n\u201cThey urged me not to show the revolution\u2019s negative side to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe violence was supposed to come from the shah, not the protesters. I told them that it was my revolution as well, but I still needed to honor my duty as a journalist \u2014 or a historian, if you will.\u201d\n\nHe left the country in 1980 and did not return for 17 years. The revolution, though, had instilled in him an interest in what people throughout the world were doing in the name of God.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was obvious after two years that the wave of Islamism was not going to stop at the borders of Iran,\u201d he said in a video interview with The British Journal of Photography in 2009. \u201cIt was going much beyond the borders.\u201d\n\nHe began by examining that phenomenon, resulting in the book \u201cAllah O Akbar: A Journey Through Militant Islam\u201d (1994), which recounted his travels through 29 Islamic countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve started with God you might as well stay with him,\u201d he said, explaining why he went on to look at Christianity, paganism, Buddhism and more. It was an examination not of personal faith, he said, but of how faith can be deployed and twisted in other spheres.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is the political, social, economic, even psychological aspects of religion,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMore and more, nations are defining their identities referring to religion.\u201d\n\nInformation on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nIf his work often put him in the middle of trouble spots, Abbas was not necessarily interested in images of blood and weaponry.\n\n\u201cMost photographers, when they say they\u2019re war photographers, they\u2019re not really war photographers; they\u2019re battle photographers,\u201d he said in the video interview. \u201cWar does not limit itself to boom-boom, to the battle itself. Wars are very, very complex phenomenons, because they have a source, and it takes a while to come up, then it happens, and there are consequences.

Then she looked across at the 80-year-old entertainer sitting at the defense table and called out: \u201cYou remember, don\u2019t you, Mr. Cosby?\u201d\n\nThe confrontation inside the Montgomery County Courthouse drew an immediate objection from lawyers for Mr. Cosby, who requested a mistrial. But Judge Steven T. O\u2019Neill denied their request.\n\nMs. Lasha was the second of five accusers prosecutors are calling to testify at Mr. Cosby\u2019s trial on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee, at his home near here in 2004.\n\nThe first, Heidi Thomas, testified Tuesday that Mr. Cosby drugged and assaulted her in Reno, Nev., in 1984 after inviting her to the city, where he often performed, to help her with her acting career. A third woman, Janice Baker-Kinney, testified Wednesday that Mr. Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after giving her two pills that knocked her out.\n\nPhoto\n\nDefense lawyers tried to undermine the credibility of each of the witnesses, suggesting during cross-examination that they had actually come forward out of a desire for attention and possibly money. But Ms. Thomas responded with a blunter rationale. \u201cI want to see a serial rapist convicted,\u201d she said.\n\nThose kinds of fiery statements made for some awkward #Me Too moments in the courtroom as the women \u2014 just three of the dozens who have come forward in recent years with accounts of having been sexually abused at his hands \u2014 confronted Mr. Cosby. For the most part, he stared down, impassively, while they spoke.\n\nMost defendants never face testimony from multiple people accusing them of prior crimes. Such evidence is typically viewed as too unrelated to the actual charges being considered, too prejudicial for a jury to hear. But Judge O\u2019Neill ruled that multiple women could testify, based on the prosecution\u2019s argument that the similarity of their accounts depicts a signature pattern of predatory behavior by Mr. Cosby that also ensnared Ms. Constand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe judge acknowledged, though, that such a drumbeat of accusations can be powerful, so powerful he has said he might limit the number of accusers to less than five if he felt the impact was preventing Mr. Cosby from receiving a fair trial, an argument his lawyers had put forth.\n\nCertainly Ms. Lasha\u2019s testimony was compelling as she described leaving the hotel and retreating to her car in the parking lot where she prayed. She later told her guidance counselor and her sister what had happened, she said.\n\nBut defense counsel asked why she had returned two days later, with her grandmother, to see Mr. Cosby in a show.

But one moment she remembered, she said, was being on a bed where Mr. Cosby was inserting his penis into her mouth.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Bliss asked whether she had received payments for media appearances related to the accusations.

The trial centered on whether the woman had consented to the acts performed on her, and on the sometimes contradictory accounts of what had been done, and by whom, on a night fueled by alcohol.\n\nMr. Olding said he had had consensual oral sex with the woman, but both men denied having had vaginal sex with her. A taxi driver who took her home testified that she had been \u201csobbing throughout the journey\u201d and that he saw blood on the back of her white jeans.

South Korea has undertaken its own bilateral negotiations with North Korea. Unsettled by Donald Trump\u2019s threats to renege on American security commitments, or offended by his attempt to extract tribute in exchange for American protection, these countries\u2019 leaders are thinking seriously about different security arrangements. As Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller explained in a recent paper for the Brookings Institution, Europeans, in particular, have an \u201cexistential\u201d interest in \u201cpreserving an international order that safeguards peace and globalization.\u201d\n\nOf course, one purported advantage of an American-funded global security order is that it supposedly allows Washington to call the shots \u2014 and, naturally, some worry that its allies would show less deference and be less willing to comply with Washington\u2019s dictates if they were less dependent upon American power. But that already happens: In fact, some allies have been known to act recklessly when they believe that America has their back. Look at the ruinous war that Saudi Arabia is waging in Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Greater independence could induce greater caution.\n\nAnd the benefits flow both ways. If Washington was slightly less confident that it could call the tune and expect others to dance, that might help America to avoid costly mistakes. Would the United States have invaded Iraq if it didn\u2019t believe that other countries would help clean up after?\n\nTransitioning to a world with many capable actors won\u2019t be easy. It will require a deft hand to unwind defense arrangements, and patience as others find their way.

He is among a group of University of Pittsburgh faculty members exploring unionization as a way to press for changes that include higher adjunct salaries. It is working with the United Steelworkers, which is also based in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe group is in the process of determining whether it has enough support among 4,000 faculty members (both tenured and nontenured) to proceed with collective bargaining. A similar effort involving graduate students is further along.\n\nAcross the nation, labor unions are stepping in to try to win better pay and job security for part-time faculty. As universities sit across the bargaining table from union groups, they may face tough decisions on reallocating their costs and giving up some flexibility in their course offerings. (Through its Media Relations department, the University of Pittsburgh administration declined to comment on the organizing effort.)\n\nTenure-track positions are shrinking at colleges and universities. As a result, people with advanced degrees have found themselves in lower-paying adjunct positions indefinitely. And that has led to a full-blown crisis, said Maria Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, a group that formed nearly 10 years ago to address issues faced by adjuncts and other nontenured faculty.\n\nOver the past few decades, colleges and universities have responded to budget crises by hiring low-cost, part-time faculty to teach core curriculum courses that formerly went to full-time tenured professors, Ms. Maisto said. In some cases, adjuncts may hold full-time jobs outside academia and teach a class on the side. But for others, teaching is their main source of income.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToo many adjunct professors cannot make a living wage through teaching, Ms. Maisto said. In fact, one-quarter of part-time faculty are on public assistance, according to a 2015 report from the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSometimes adjuncts are not assigned courses until days before a course begins, Ms. Maisto said, or a class may be canceled at the last minute and given to a tenured faculty member. Most adjuncts do not have health benefits. They may also lack access to professional development funds and a private space to meet with students or store their belongings, she said.\n\n\u201cAll of these conditions affect the quality of teaching and convey the idea that adjuncts are substandard and unimportant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very precarious employment situation on lots of different levels, and our concern is what that does to the quality of education.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the nation\u2019s higher education faculty work part time, according to government data. That number rises to about two-thirds if other nontenured positions such as lecturers are included.\n\nDepending on the institution, adjunct pay can range from under $2,000 a class to $6,000 and above. A full course load is considered to be three classes a semester. Some adjuncts are teaching as many six classes a semester, driving between different campuses, and taking odd jobs to make ends meet, Ms. Maisto said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt one time several years ago, Susan Harper of Dallas was teaching five classes at four separate institutions as an adjunct, for as little as $1,900 a class and no benefits. Her income was so low that she qualified for financial assistance from a drug maker for her prescriptions. To bring in more money, she took odd jobs such as freelance editing, house sitting and reading tarot cards at parties, she said.\n\nWhen she was in graduate school in the late 1990s, it was reasonable to expect that she could land a tenure track-position, Dr. Harper said. But by the time she received her Ph.D. in cultural anthropology in 2005, that expectation had changed.\n\nWith $200,000 in student debt and no health insurance, Dr. Harper decided this year to take a full-time job, with benefits, as an editor of scholarly publications. She is still teaching a course online as an adjunct, but does not think she will return full time to academia or try for a tenure-track position.\n\nLearning: A Special Section Welcome to the new Learning section \u2014 a deep dive into the joys, excitement, challenges and opportunities in the world of education and learning.

And that number is growing, with the most robust activity occurring at private institutions because of differing labor laws, said William A. Herbert, executive director of the center.\n\nAt the private Siena College, a recent labor agreement was an acknowledgment that \u201cadjuncts are an important part of our community,\u201d said Chuck Seifert, dean of the business school. He was the academic representative for the school during talks that lasted for two years. Part-time and visiting faculty were represented by the Service Employees International Union.\n\nAdjunct faculty were making $2,500 a course per semester at Siena, a college in the Catholic and Franciscan tradition based in Albany. The labor agreement reached last year raises their salaries by 37 percent over three years. The deal also gives preferential course assignments to adjuncts who have taught regularly at the college for three years. And adjuncts now have access to professional development funds and dedicated office space.\n\nSiena was able to raise adjunct salaries by achieving financial efficiencies in other areas, said Dr. Seifert, who is also a management professor at the school.\n\nOverall costs must always be part of the calculus when setting faculty salaries, he said. At Siena, \u201cwe have to develop a long term sustainable financial plan,\u201d he said. Given that some colleges in New York offer free tuition, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to price ourselves out of the market.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to hiring and paying adjuncts, there is a \u201cbasic economic supply and demand model in play,\u201d Dr. Seifert said.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Ph.D. in accounting, you can basically get a job in two weeks,\u201d he said.

Some hope to land a tenure-track position eventually, but this is becoming much harder to do, she said. Others can\u2019t find jobs because, with their advanced degrees, they are considered overqualified for jobs outside academia.\n\nOther adjuncts are deeply committed to teaching and refuse to be driven out of academia despite their low salaries, she said. This is true even as the stigma associated with being an adjunct has led to a growing divide between tenure- and nontenure-track faculty, she said.\n\nFortunately, she said, \u201cthere are tenured faculty who have recognized that this is a problem that affects the entire profession, and that we all need to work together as colleagues to try to address it.\u201d", "title": "Adjunct Professors Step up Their Efforts to Increase Pay", "authors": ["Phyllis Korkki"]}

Traumatized by political events of 1970 \u2014 the United States invasion of Cambodia, the killing of students at Kent State and Jackson State \u2014 she began to come to grips with her own identity as an African American in a violent, racist society.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe initial work that resulted from this awakening wasn\u2019t overtly topical, but it was about as far from being abstract as she could get. She used her own body as a primary image in a series of unannounced public performances.

Sometimes, he showed up in public, and verbally confronted passers-by. He also existed in hand-altered photographs.

Some of it draws on her considerable graphic skills.

I\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m not noisy. I\u2019m not shiftless. I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019m not servile. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Piper has also, over the decades, consistently used her own image in inventive, distanced, self-mocking ways, as in two well-known self likenesses done several years apart, one, a pencil drawing titled \u201cSelf-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features\u201d (1981) the other, a crayon-enhanced photograph called \u201cSelf-Portrait as a Nice White Lady\u201d (1995). In these images, as in all of her work, her aim is not to assert racial identity but to destabilize the very concept of it.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd she has fun playing with it. In her exhilaratingly witty 1983 film \u201cFunk Lessons,\u201d she coaches a class of mostly white graduate students in the how-tos of soul dancing (shake your head, lift your leg), as if blackness were a personal style that could be learned by instruction. And in a quietly scathing 1988 video installation, \u201cCornered,\u201d she treats racial identity as both a delusion and an entrapment.\n\nPhoto\n\nPlaying a role, as she usually does \u2014 very little of her work is directly autobiographical \u2014 she speaks directly to us, a very likely white art world audience, with the measured tone of a newscaster. She informs us that, despite her light complexion, she is black, and that chances are good, given the American history of racial mixing, that we are black too. This reality has negative fallout in two directions. It means that white listeners lose their politically privileged identity, and she \u2014 now a self-declared \u201cblack artist\u201d \u2014 is trapped in hers.\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause race has often been her subject, a frequent and career-shaping assumption is that it is her only one, a misperception that this retrospective makes a serious and successful effort to correct. It devotes considerable space to her early, abstract work. It reminds us that the references in her subsequent topical work has been broad-based, ranging from the war in Vietnam to poverty in America. We are reminded that the images of difference generated by the performances were images not defined by ethnicity, and that the original Mythic Being series was as much about gender as it was about race.\n\nPhoto\n\nMisogyny has always been one of Ms. Piper\u2019s targets. In 1986, she designed a business card intended to be passed out at opportune moments to defuse instances of sexual aggression. The card read: \u201cDear Friend, I\u2019m not here to pick anyone up, or to be picked up. I am here alone because I want to be here, ALONE.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe show also reminds us of the multidisciplinary texture of Ms. Piper\u2019s career. Professionally, she is both, and equally, a visual artist and an academic scholar. (She taught philosophy for decades in American colleges and universities and teaches it now in her new permanent home in Germany.) Walking through the show you can see thinking happening right before your eyes. And certain strands of her more recent work have a meditative, existentialist cast \u2014 a reminder of Ms. Piper\u2019s initial hopes for the transcendent potential of abstraction.\n\nA decade-spanning project called \u201cEverything\u201d (2003-2013) has three parts. One is a series of informal photographic portraits in which the faces have been obliterated and replaced by the words \u201cEverything will be taken away.\u201d Another is a set of images of American political martyrs (Medgar Evers, Robert F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) accompanied by the same phrase. A third is an installation of four schoolroom blackboards on which that phrase is repeatedly written in chalk, like a lesson meant to be drilled into memory.\n\nThe mortality-redolent words also form an essential tenet of Hindu philosophy: everything \u2014 lives, eras, identities, art \u2014 will change.\n\nThe great emblem of change is Shiva, the divine yogi, dancing his circular dance of life and death. His image appears repeatedly in Ms. Piper\u2019s recent art, most notably in a 2004 film documenting a spectacular iteration of \u201cFunk Lessons.\u201d And at the end of the MoMA show, just outside the final gallery, we see a projected 2007 video of Ms. Piper soul-dancing in a public plaza in Berlin, alone except for pedestrians on their way from here to there.\n\nThe image brings the retrospective full circle, back to Ms. Piper\u2019s solo performances of outsiderness of many decades ago. It\u2019s to the credit of the show\u2019s organizers \u2014 Christophe Cherix, chief curator of the drawings and prints department at MoMA; David Platzker, a former curator in that department; Cornelia H. Butler, chief curator at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; and Tessa Ferreyros, a curatorial assistant at MoMA \u2014 that they\u2019ve been careful to make such links, and by doing so point up the fierce, steady logic of this artist\u2019s career.\n\nIt\u2019s even more to their credit \u2014 and a boon to the future \u2014 that they\u2019ve kept that career\u2019s difficulty, and toughness, and nowness to the fore. Historically, institutionally, MoMA has favored smoothness and symmetry, whiteness. It has tended to shave off the awkward corners of art, sand its sharpest edges down. In this case, the corners and edges stand firm in an art and a career that is entirely about them.", "title": "Adrian Piper: The Thinking Canvas", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

Mr. Macron, who spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone on Sunday and again on Monday, has repeatedly declared that the use of chemical weapons by Syria\u2019s government would be a red line and pledged to strike weapons sites connected to such attacks.\n\nTwo Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers are in the Sixth Fleet\u2019s area of operations in the Mediterranean Sea and would be able to get within striking range within hours to days. When Mr. Trump ordered the retaliatory strike against Syria at almost the exact same time last year, it was carried out by two destroyers firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield, the suspected source of the chemical attack, hitting fighter jets, hardened aircraft shelters, radar equipment, ammunition bunkers and sites for storing fuel and defense systems.\n\nThe already tense situation in the Middle East was further inflamed early Monday morning by an attack reportedly conducted by Israel on a Syrian air base used by Iranian-backed militias. The strike killed about 14 people, according to a conflict monitoring group, and Russia and Syria said it was carried out by Israel, whose government declined to confirm its involvement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe chemical attack in the suburb of Douma over the weekend killed at least 49 people and raised the temperature of an already simmering relationship between the United States and Russia, which rejected the conclusion that Syria\u2019s military was behind the chemical attack. It asserted that the attack was staged by militants to falsely blame the government and justify an American strike against Mr. Assad\u2019s government.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei V.

Haley used an emergency meeting of the Security Council to blame Russia and Iran for \u201cenabling the Assad regime\u2019s murderous destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cEither way, the United States will respond.\u201d\n\nThe United States floated a draft resolution on Monday to establish an independent international panel to look into who used chemicals weapons, which are prohibited by international law, but there is little chance that Russia would agree to it. Late last year, Russia effectively disbanded a previous panel that had been set up to identify perpetrators of chemical weapons strikes inside Syria.\n\nThe panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, looked at eight cases of alleged chemical weapons use in 2015 and 2016, concluding that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in three attacks and that the Islamic State had used them once. The panel\u2019s mandate expired, and Russia blocked an effort to extend it, calling it a tool of Western powers.\n\nVassily A. Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, insisted on Monday that no chemical weapons attack took place at all in Douma, arguing that it had been fabricated to build an \u201canti-Russian alliance.\u201d He said the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons could visit Damascus, with Russian help, and carry out its investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Nebenzia went on to boast of Russia\u2019s popularity. \u201cYou\u2019re misguided if you think you have friends,\u201d he told Ms. Haley, adding, \u201cRussia has friends. Unlike yourselves, we do not have adversaries.\u201d\n\nIn Geneva, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, issued a scathing denunciation of the feeble response to past attacks by the international community in general.\n\nWarring parties in Syria had used chemical weapons at least 35 times since 2013, Mr. al-Hussein said, summing up the response of the international community as \u201cempty words, feeble condemnations and a Security Council paralyzed by the use of the veto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world \u2014 and in particular the veto-wielding states on the Security Council \u2014 need to wake up, and wake up fast, to the irreparable damage that is being done to one of the most important planks of global arms control and prevention of human suffering,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe crisis came on a day when Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy team was in the midst of transition as his new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, arrived for his first day on the job. Still adjusting to the assignment, Mr. Bolton sat back as Vice President Mike Pence led a national security meeting, but he sat next to Mr. Trump for his dinner with the generals. Mr. Trump was expected to huddle with Mr. Bolton, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after dinner.\n\nKnown as a national security hawk, Mr. Bolton in the past urged military action against governments in Iran and North Korea to counter their nuclear programs, and he remains a staunch defender of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein.\n\nBut like Mr. Trump, he resisted a strike against Syria when President Barack Obama was in office and facing a similar choice after a chemical weapons attack against civilians in 2013. In that instance, Mr. Obama sought support from Congress, but ultimately backed off a strike after reaching an agreement with Russia to remove Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal.\n\n\u201cIf I were a member of Congress, I would vote against an authorization to use force here,\u201d Mr. Bolton said at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in America\u2019s interest. I don\u2019t think we should in effect take sides in the Syrian conflict.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton took a different position when Mr. Trump ordered action last year. \u201cI think the Trump decision to strike as they did was the correct decision,\u201d he said then.

It has a recessive, lunar beauty compared to the sunny ambition and inventiveness of its predecessors, including her masterpiece (with the self-explanatory title), \u201cThe Bridegroom Was a Dog\u201d (2012), and \u201cMemoirs of a Polar Bear\u201d (2016), which followed three generations of a distinguished literary family of polar bears.\n\nThe new book is set in Japan after an unnamed disaster (nuclear fallout is suggested). The country has quarantined itself from the rest of the world. The only wild living things left are spiders and crows. Language has started to vanish, too. The shelf life of words seems to have shortened; they pass out of fashion quickly and aren\u2019t replaced. Men go through menopause. Children are so enfeebled that heartsick pediatricians begin to kill themselves.\n\nOnly the elderly remain robust \u2014 none more guiltily than Yoshiro, who is raising his great-grandson, the impossibly, almost unbearably sweet Mumei, who grows kinder and more tolerant as his body wastes away.

Although her work is frequently described as strange \u2014 which it is, determinedly \u2014 there is always a stark social critique at its core. \u201cMemoirs of a Polar Bear\u201d is, after all, an immigrant novel and a stirring defense of the human right to migration. \u201cFor polar bears, national identity has always been a foreign concept,\u201d she writes in that novel. \u201cIt\u2019s common for them to get pregnant in Greenland, give birth in Canada, then raise the children in the Soviet Union. They possess no nationality, no passport. They never go into exile and cross national borders without a visa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Emissary\u201d is as bleak a portrait of contemporary Japan as you could imagine. Tawada takes on the graying of the population and the trauma of the 2011 tsunami and the ensuing radiation leakage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

In the Chaparhar district of Nangarhar Province, officials said three brothers were beheaded by the group late on Sunday. Their father, a medical doctor, was killed by the Islamic State last year.\n\nAs mass-casualty attacks have increased in Kabul, the country\u2019s capital, Kabul Province has become the deadliest one for civilians, surpassing Taliban-dominated southern areas where local residents have long borne the brunt of the war, now in its 17th year. Last year, nearly 500 civilians were killed in attacks in the city and 1,350 were wounded, according to the United Nations.\n\nWhile the violence has turned life in Kabul into a game of chance, more recently the odds have been worse for Shiites like Mr. Allahdad.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis home is on a busy road in a western Kabul neighborhood.

Both before and after the march, high school students have shown themselves eager to hatch longer-term plans, with some plotting together last week through their spring breaks.\n\nIn this stretch of Northern Virginia, students are trying to organize a town hall with Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress, recognizing that her support from the National Rifle Association could be a drag in a district that preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nNew voter registration pushes, steered by teenagers, are well underway. Students are consulting with established (and adult-run) groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \u2014 with plans to discuss how to host their own candidate events before November or start clubs at their schools.\n\nEven less politically active students in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District have learned Ms. Comstock\u2019s name. \u201cThey know who she is,\u201d said Paige Thimmesch, 16, Ms. Banks\u2019s classmate in Sterling, Va., who is hoping to arrange the forum with the congresswoman. \u201cThey don\u2019t know every single policy. They do know that she is pro-gun.\u201d\n\nLooking to history, fledgling activists are researching Vietnam-era student protests for context and inspiration.

McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida. Recent polling suggests the gap could close, at least somewhat, this fall.

Shortly after the Parkland shooting, President Trump expressed support for gun restrictions opposed by the N.R.A., scolding fellow Republicans for kowtowing to the group. It did not take long, after an Oval Office meeting with N.R.A. officials, for the president to reverse himself.\n\nYet even in corners of the country unaccustomed to dissent on gun issues, supporters of restrictions sense an opening.

Several vulnerable members signed on to a Democratic bill authorizing federal research into gun violence. Two of them, Brian Mast and Carlos Curbelo, both Republicans from Florida, have endorsed an assault weapons ban.\n\nActivists appear determined to make others pay a professional price for declining to engage.

After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, his opponents did not necessarily expect a gun reckoning to be central to their 2018 strategy.\n\nLast summer, as the party strained to communicate its own agenda in the Trumpian haze, Democrats chose Berryville as the backdrop to introduce a broad-strokes platform of economic populism. Their top leaders in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and progressive stars like Senator Elizabeth Warren schlepped 65 miles outside Washington to deliver their message in the same park where Mr. Ashby, the gun owner, flicked away his cigarette on a recent afternoon.\n\nEight months later, it is gun violence, more than any fiscal issue, that has galvanized a new generation of prospective Democrats, some not yet old enough to vote.\n\nIn Virginia, the party had already long targeted Ms. Comstock, casting her as a poor fit for a district that includes some rural pockets, like Berryville, but also left-leaning Washington suburbs and vast reserves of more moderate voters repelled by Mr. Trump. \u201cBarbara Bump-Stock,\u201d said Candy Baracat-Donovan, 34, from Leesburg, Va., whose morning routine now includes a round of phone calls to the offices of representatives like Ms. Comstock.\n\nPhoto\n\nA spokesman for Ms. Comstock, Jeff Marschner, said the congresswoman was \u201ccommitted to a multipronged effort to prevent gun violence,\u201d citing her support for additional mental health funding and narrow, N.R.A.-backed legislation improving reporting to the national background check database, among other measures.\n\nIt is not clear if she will agree to a town hall with students.

At his confirmation hearing this month, Mr. Pompeo presented himself in moderate terms. He promised to defend gay rights around the world, to work to rescue the Iran nuclear deal and to reverse the administration\u2019s marginalization of American diplomats under Mr. Tillerson.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee will formally consider Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Mr. Pompeo at the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, at a hearing on May 9.

State leaders have tweaked the plan so that it will raise revenue but limit political risk \u2014 by excluding personal cars from paying, at least for now \u2014 and therefore have negligible impact on congestion.\n\nCongestion is caused by all vehicles, not just a fraction of them. The plan arbitrarily divides the vehicles that ply our streets into for-hire vehicles and applies a surcharge \u2014 $2.50 per trip for taxis, $2.75 for for-hire, $0.75 shared for-hire \u2014 and lets all other vehicles go free. Analysis from Charles Komanoff, a transportation expert who contributed to the Fix NYC report, finds that without congestion pricing on all vehicles, \u201cthe time savings from reduced traffic congestion drops by at least 60 percent. The revenues available to improve transit drop by 60 percent or more as well.\u201d\n\nThe real challenge for city streets is to move people, not cars, efficiently. Not only does Albany\u2019s plan treat a significant fraction of vehicles as if they were invisible and took up no space; it also underplays an incredibly salient distinction \u2014 how many people are in a vehicle \u2014 by lumping all for-hire vehicles together. If one person alone in a car is bad (and it is), then two people in a car is better. Three is better still. Getting lots of people into a bus or subway is the holy grail of congestion reduction. While the Albany plan will charge pooled passengers a smaller surcharge ($0.75), it doesn\u2019t go far enough to recognize the enormous benefits of ride-sharing and microtransit.\n\nIn fact, on a percentage basis, riders in shared-trip vehicles will be paying a higher tax than those who choose to ride alone, and in some cases the total tax per vehicle will be higher too. During morning and evening commutes, Via transports six people per vehicle; the collective surcharge on those vehicles will be $4.50, larger than for lone riders in other for-hire vehicles and infinitely more than for the person driving his or her own car without charge.\n\nIndependent research conducted in San Francisco finds that the regular Uber and Lyft services average 2.1 passengers per vehicle, yet neither of them will get a tax break because the services aren\u2019t registered as \u201cshared for hire.\u201d Seventy-three percent of people who commute in their personal cars travel alone and won\u2019t be paying a fee at all.", "title": "Opinion | Albany Punts on Clearing Manhattan\u2019s Clogged Streets", "authors": []}

What begins as a reflective memoir of loneliness and longing turns into a methodical investigation, as Wagner digs into the archives, calls up experts and tests her DNA.\n\nShe\u2019s primed to discover the worst. Her mother and her maternal grandmother, who became a democracy activist in American exile, spoke of their lives in Burma with such reverence that it made Wagner suspicious: \u201cIt always rang alarm bells when anyone got misty-eyed about the good times, because, in reality, those were often the actually pretty bad times for quite a few other people.\u201d\n\nWagner unearths Burma\u2019s long history of ethnic cleansing and failed social experiments \u2014 though whether her family was involved in the truly nasty stuff is never entirely clear. Her great-grandfather worked in a credit union, the pivot point in a cooperative lending system that eventually collapsed because of lax standards.\n\n\u201cIt pained me to think of my great-grandfather as an actor who\u2019d brought so many Burmese to their knees, courtesy of a failed banking system,\u201d she writes.

She doesn\u2019t find evidence that her great-grandfather actually made bad loans; only that some people in similar positions did.\n\n\u201cFutureface\u201d raises urgent questions having to do with history and complicity. Wagner is determined to look at her family with the coldest eye, making excuses for no one. Considering how tempting it is to let loved ones off the hook, her ruthlessness can feel refreshing and often admirable. I\u2019ve rarely encountered a family history this unsparing.

He \u201chad an annoying habit of adopting (his version of) the local accent, in a pathetic and ill-advised bid to \u2018fit in.\u2019\u201d She portrays her Burmese grandmother\u2019s friendships with gay men and black men in the 1960s and \u201970s as hardly more than a calculated bid for assimilation: \u201cIn her seeming tolerance, ironically, she moved closer to a certain white, liberal American ideal.\u201d\n\nSuch ungenerous assessments aren\u2019t necessarily inaccurate; Wagner knows her family better than I do. But in her push to dismantle some cherished myths, her book starts to feel bloodless, so shorn of sentiment that Wagner\u2019s project loses the profoundly personal feelings that animated it in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt would be one thing if she uncovered definitive evidence of a real whopper, an astounding family secret; what she discovers instead are the kinds of skeletons \u2014 illegitimacy, hypocrisy, selective memory, callous prejudice \u2014 that are distressing, but also distressingly common.\n\nThese ordinary cruelties might not make for riveting journalism, but they make for a rich and revealing memoir.

In California her status as a dead person is under litigation; in a small apartment in New Jersey, in the care of her mother, she is very much alive.\n\nHer fate is thus a case study in why a decent society allows families leeway to defy medical consensus: not only for the sake of parental rights and religious beliefs, not only because biases around race and class and faith creep into medical decision-making, but also because in hard cases the official medical consensus often doesn\u2019t come close to grasping all the possibilities, and letting people go their own way is often the only way to discover where it\u2019s wrong.\n\nBut this tendency to arrogate power away from the family is not just an issue for extreme medical cases. In Aviv\u2019s story on guardianship among the elderly, it plays out in a more prosaic and yet similarly shocking form \u2014 with old people who are hardly incompetent handed over to professional guardians who sell their assets and consign them to assisted living facilities from which they can\u2019t escape.\n\nThe basic dynamic is like the Gard and Evans and McMath cases but with the generational roles reversed: Instead of parents trying to pry their children away from the medical establishment, you have adult children unable to bring their parents home because their state-appointed guardians say no.\n\nAviv focuses on the Kafkaesque odyssey of Julie Belshe, a mother of three who spent years extracting her parents from the talons of a woman, April Parks, who was later indicted on charges of perjury and theft.

Flora and fauna native to the Americas were so different from the plants and animals that Europeans brought with them, and so acclimated to specific growing conditions, that they couldn\u2019t compete biologically. What Professor Crosby called \u201cthe companions of the conquistadors\u201d conquered as well.\n\nAt the same time, catastrophically, native peoples increasingly died of diseases, usually smallpox, that had moved from domestic animals to humans.

Kistler, the curator of archaeogenomics and archaeobotany at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAlternative explanations remain on the table, because the new study didn\u2019t provide enough evidence for exactly where sweet potatoes were first domesticated and when they arrived in the Pacific. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a smoking gun,\u201d Dr. Kistler said.\n\nThe sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas, is one of the most valuable crops in the world, providing more nutrients per farmed acre than any other staple. It has sustained human communities for centuries. (In North America, it often is referred to as a yam; in fact, yams are a different species originating in Africa and Asia.)\n\nPhoto\n\nScientists have offered a number of theories to explain the wide distribution of I. batatas. Some scholars proposed that all sweet potatoes originated in the Americas, and that after Columbus\u2019s voyage, they were spread by Europeans to colonies such as the Philippines. Pacific Islanders acquired the crops from there.\n\nAs it turned out, though, Pacific Islanders had been growing the crop for generations by the time Europeans showed up. On one Polynesian island, archaeologists have found sweet potato remains dating back over 700 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA radically different hypothesis emerged: Pacific Islanders, masters of open-ocean navigation, picked up sweet potatoes by voyaging to the Americas, long before Columbus\u2019s arrival there. The evidence included a suggestive coincidence: In Peru, some indigenous people call the sweet potato cumara. In New Zealand, it\u2019s kumara.\n\nA potential link between South America and the Pacific was the inspiration for Thor Heyerdahl\u2019s famous 1947 voyage aboard the Kon-Tiki. He built a raft, which he then successfully sailed from Peru to the Easter Islands.\n\nGenetic evidence only complicated the picture. Examining the plant\u2019s DNA, some researchers concluded that sweet potatoes arose only once from a wild ancestor, while other studies indicated that it happened at two different points in history.\n\nAccording to the latter studies, South Americans domesticated sweet potatoes, which were then acquired by Polynesians. Central Americans domesticated a second variety that later was picked up by Europeans.\n\nHoping to shed light on the mystery, a team of researchers recently undertook a new study \u2014 the biggest survey of sweet potato DNA yet. And they came to a very different conclusion.\n\n\u201cWe find very clear evidence that sweet potatoes could arrive in the Pacific by natural means,\u201d said Pablo Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez, a botanist at the University of Oxford. He believes the wild plants traveled thousands of miles across the Pacific without any help from humans.\n\nMr. Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez and his colleagues visited museums and herbariums around the world to take samples of sweet potato varieties and wild relatives. The researchers used powerful DNA-sequencing technology to gather more genetic material from the plants than possible in earlier studies.\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir research pointed to only one wild plant as the ancestor of all sweet potatoes. The closest wild relative is a weedy flower called Ipomoea trifida that grows around the Caribbean. Its pale purple flowers look a lot like those of the sweet potato.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead of a massive, tasty tuber, I. trifida grows only a pencil-thick root. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing we could eat,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nThe ancestors of sweet potatoes split from I. trifida at least 800,000 years ago, the scientists calculated. To investigate how they arrived in the Pacific, the team headed to the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The researchers cut bits of the leaves and extracted DNA from them.\n\nThe Polynesian sweet potatoes turned out to be genetically unusual \u2014 \u201cvery different from anything else,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nThe sweet potatoes found in Polynesia split off over 111,000 years ago from all other sweet potatoes the researchers studied. Yet humans arrived in New Guinea about 50,000 years ago, and only reached remote Pacific islands in the past few thousand years.\n\nThe age of Pacific sweet potatoes made it unlikely that any humans, Spanish or Pacific Islander, carried the species from the Americas, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nTraditionally, researchers have been skeptical that a plant like a sweet potato could travel across thousands of miles of ocean. But in recent years, scientists have turned up signs that many plants have made the voyage, floating on the water or carried in bits by birds.\n\nEven before the sweet potato made the journey, its wild relatives traveled the Pacific, the scientists found. One species, the Hawaiian moonflower, lives only in the dry forests of Hawaii \u2014 but its closest relatives all live in Mexico.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe scientists estimate that the Hawaiian moonflower separated from its relatives \u2014 and made its journey across the Pacific \u2014 over a million years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Tim P. Denham, an archaeologist at the Australian National University who was not involved in the study, found this scenario hard to swallow.\n\nIt would suggest that the wild ancestors of sweet potatoes spread across the Pacific and were then domesticated many times over \u2014 yet wound up looking the same every time. \u201cThis would seem unlikely,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Kistler argued that it was still possible that Pacific Islanders voyaged to South America and returned with the sweet potato.\n\nA thousand years ago, they might have encountered many sweet potato varieties on the continent. When Europeans arrived in the 1500s, they likely wiped out much of the crop\u2019s genetic diversity.\n\nAs a result, Dr. Kistler said, the surviving sweet potatoes of the Pacific only seem distantly related to the ones in the Americas. If the scientists had done the same study in 1500, Pacific sweet potatoes would have fit right in with other South American varieties.\n\nDr. Kistler was optimistic that the sweet potato debate would someday be settled. The world\u2019s herbariums contain a vast number of varieties that have yet to be genetically tested.\n\n\u201cThere are more than we could look at in a lifetime,\u201d Dr. Kistler said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez plans on searching for more wild sweet potato relatives in Central America, hoping to get more clues to how exactly a thin-rooted weed gave rise to an invaluable crop.\n\nWorking out the history of crops like this could do more than satisfy our curiosity about the past. Wild plants hold a lot of genetic variants lost when people domesticated crops.\n\nResearchers may find plants they can hybridize with domesticated sweet potatoes and other crops, endowing them with genes for resistance to diseases, or for withstanding climate change.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s preserving the gene pool that feeds the world,\u201d Dr. Kistler said.", "title": "All by Itself, the Humble Sweet Potato Colonized the World", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

Thirty percent of the classrooms in the district lack air-conditioning, primarily because they are in old buildings that do not have the electrical capacity to support portable units. It would cost upward of $45 million to install central air in all classrooms. In 2015 the teachers\u2019 union asked the school board for that funding, but the request was denied. Some teachers have resorted to offering sweaty and distracted students small cooling towels purchased with donated funds.\n\nAt the other end of the temperature spectrum, cold snaps have left children shivering in schools with malfunctioning boilers and drafty windows that do little to protect them when temperatures dip below zero. Low-income and black and Hispanic students are more likely to attend such poorly maintained schools.\n\nThis winter, Marietta English, president of the Baltimore Teachers Union, wrote in a letter to the school system\u2019s chief executive, Sonja Santelises, that \u201ctrying to provide a stable learning environment in these extreme conditions is unfair and inhumane.\u201d Dr. Santelises acknowledged that \u201ctoo many of our buildings have outdated heating systems, poor insulation and aging pipes as a result of years of inadequate funding for maintenance and facilities improvements.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to earthquakes, we have seen some progress in terms of seismic upgrades for schools in states such as California and Oregon.

The vast wealth gap that exists today between whites and African-Americans has its roots in this era.\n\nThe argument for what became the Fair Housing Act emerged forcefully in the 1968 Kerner Commission report, which blamed segregation in large measure for the riots that ravaged the country in the 60s and called for national fair housing legislation. The housing law might well have died in committee had the country not erupted in fresh violence after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. It was signed into law a week later.\n\nThe housing act put the federal government on record as supporting open housing and prohibiting the pervasive discrimination that had locked most African-Americans out of decent accommodations and homeownership. But the version that passed in 1968 had been declawed \u2014 stripped of enforcement provisions that would have given HUD strong authority to root out discrimination. Nearly a quarter-century would pass before Congress strengthened the law. So during that time, African-Americans were left subject to the harsh discrimination the original act was supposed to preclude.\n\nThis progressive sounding law \u2014 which requires entities that receive federal money to \u201caffirmatively further\u201d fair housing goals \u2014 was consistently undermined by officials of both parties who had little appetite for confronting entrenched segregation.\n\nThat realization came home with particular force to George Romney, Richard Nixon\u2019s HUD secretary, who initially took the law at its word and tried to enforce it by turning down grant applications from communities that continued to segregate themselves racially.\n\nWhen white communities complained directly to the Oval Office, Nixon shut down Romney\u2019s effort and eventually forced him out of government. Subsequent administrations shied away from enforcing the law in ways great and small \u2014 but the Reagan administration sold it out in an egregious fashion that angered even Republicans in Congress. The administration conspired with the real estate industry to undermine HUD\u2019s already limited powers, brought cases that attacked integration programs and showed scant vigor in enforcing civil rights laws.\n\nTHE NEXT FAIR HOUSING FIGHT\n\nThe Fair Housing Act received new life three years ago when the Supreme Court endorsed the doctrine known as disparate impact, ruling that housing discrimination did not have to be intentional to be illegal. The court reminded the country that the statute does indeed bar governments from spending federal money in a way that perpetuates segregation.\n\nSoon after, the Obama administration issued a long-awaited rule that required state and local governments to affirmatively further fair housing goals by making efforts to address the cumulative results of the discrimination that historically shut African-Americans out of many communities.", "title": "Opinion | America\u2019s Federally Financed Ghettos", "authors": []}

Hamilton\u2019s farmhouse, the Grange, figures prominently in the Mile 10 section, exploring a part of town that modern real-estate developers have christened Hamilton Heights.\n\nThere is plenty here that rings familiar to 21st-century ears. \u201cAs the city expanded, and as the divide between rich and poor grew ever wider, alarming numbers of indigent men and women gathered each day on Broadway,\u201d Leadon writes. He\u2019s talking about the 1840s. Ten years later, New York had become \u201ca city of strangers.\u201d By the 1890s, \u201cit was noisy.\u201d The homeless, referred to as \u201cthe tramp class\u201d in a blunter era, vexed the middle class just as they do now. After economic collapse in the Panic of 1893, The New York Tribune \u201ccomplained that it had become impossible to relax on a park bench without a \u2018greasy, rum soaked tramp leaning against your shoulder.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA robust act of civil disobedience in 1901 was the sort that easily could take place today. Chairs had been placed in Madison Square Park, ruled by a concessionaire who charged 5 cents to sit, equivalent to about $1.30 now. Attendants overturned the chair of anyone who dared take a seat without forking over a nickel. Many New Yorkers deemed the fee unfair, and in the collar-wilting summer of 1901, they had had enough. They ignited the \u201cMerry Chair War,\u201d refusing to pay and tossing chairs into the street. Soon enough, the concessionaire caved, and the nickel chair became history. Thousands flocked to the park in celebration. Today, they might well go by #OccupyMadisonSquare.\n\nThis is a book best read in several sittings; there is a lot of detail to absorb. At times, it can be nearly numbing. Is it really necessary to recite practically the entire inventory of the vast Arnold Constable department store, located in 1869 at Broadway and 19th Street? But Leadon is graced with a wry wit. Flashes of it are sprinkled throughout, as when he describes Union Square\u2019s ascendance as a gathering spot for all manner of causes. At the onset of the Civil War, an immense crowd formed there. New York Sun journalists reported not seeing a single drunk or hearing a profane word. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Leadon says dryly, \u201cthey weren\u2019t looking very hard.\u201d\n\nFor all the diversity of its 13 miles, from financial citadels far downtown to bodegas way uptown, Broadway will always mean the theater to many people \u2014 the Great White Way. By the dawn of the 20th century \u201cBroadway had become New York\u2019s chief cultural export,\u201d Leadon writes. To an extent, it still is. Nothing, though, can compare with the creative flow in the years before the Great Depression. In 1927 alone, 264 new Broadway shows opened.\n\nSustaining that kind of energy would have been nigh impossible. As Leadon says, \u201cIt is the nature of things in New York that very little lasts.\u201d True enough, and \u201cBroadway\u201d the book shows that Broadway the street is no exception.", "title": "America\u2019s Most Famous Street", "authors": ["Clyde Haberman", "Fran Leadon"]}

It feels impossible that something could be beyond easy American resolution, so the problem must be that the president lacks proper will or resolve to see that resolution through.\n\n\u201cFor those who want a military response, the question is simple: can you tell me any practical response short of full-fledged invasion that could prevent this?\u201d Emma Ashford, a Cato Institute analyst, asked on Twitter, referring to further chemical attacks.\n\nTo understand this, it helps to divide possible American responses into three categories, each of which comes up against hard problems that are structural to the Syrian war.\n\nPhoto\n\nOption category #1 could be termed the sort of limited, punitive strikes that Mr. Obama was pressured to execute and that Mr. Trump saw through last year.\n\nSuch action is meant to impose a modest cost on Mr. Assad or to send a message that future chemical weapons use will not be tolerated. At the same time, it is meant to avoid any risk of changing the course of the war, which could lead in unanticipated directions \u2014 like embroiling the United States in a larger conflict, or collapsing the Syrian government, which could, in turn, spread chaos that would risk millions of lives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut past efforts at these kind of strikes have failed for two reasons. First, they do not change Mr. Assad\u2019s calculus because, to Mr. Assad, this war is a matter of personal and national survival. If he believes chemical weapons are necessary to his survival, he will abandon them only in the face of some threat to his survival greater than the benefit he thinks they offer him. That requires an existential threat, which the United States is unwilling to impose because of the risks.\n\nSecond, Mr. Assad\u2019s Russian and Iranian allies can easily help him absorb the costs imposed by such strikes. If the United States bombs another Syrian runway, Russian contractors can simply pave Mr. Assad a new one. It\u2019s not exactly a game-changer for him.\n\nFuzzier arguments for limited strikes \u2014 that they will communicate American resolve and toughness \u2014 play well in domestic politics, but there is little concrete evidence that such messages make much difference to adversaries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOption category #2 might describe the policies that Mr. Obama favored: actions that make the war costlier for Mr. Assad \u2014 arming anti-government rebels, for instance \u2014 so as to pressure the Syrian leader into complying with American demands.\n\nMr. Obama supplied rebels with anti-tank TOW missiles, which they used to great effect, pushing back government forces with the weapons they called \u201cAssad tamers.\u201d\n\nThe problem with this strategy is that Mr. Assad\u2019s Russian and Iranian allies are able to escalate in turn, matching and exceeding any American bid. The Americans send guns; the Iranians send a combat brigade. The Americans send missiles; the Russians install an artillery unit. Russia and Iran can simply do more, giving them control over what military planners call \u201cthe escalation ladder.\u201d\n\nSome analysts argue that the \u201cAssad tamers\u201d were so successful that they prompted Russia\u2019s 2015 intervention in Syria. In that sense, Mr. Obama\u2019s approach not only failed, it backfired terribly. The result was a bloodier war with more Syrian suffering but little change in Mr. Assad\u2019s calculus. Further such escalations would risk the same.\n\nOption category #3 would be attacks that go beyond what the Russians and Iranians can match, which is likely to mean either a full intervention or strikes that existentially threaten the Syrian government.\n\nThese strikes would only be enough to work if they deliberately create one of two risks that the United States has strained to avoid. The first risk is that of collapsing the Syrian government, which would exacerbate Syrian suffering by throwing millions more lives into chaos and most likely prolong the war. The second risk is of a direct military confrontation with Russia, a nuclear-armed power with the ability to escalate hostilities rapidly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, putting millions of non-Syrians at risk.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBottom line: Assad\u2019s actions are abhorrent, but there is no practical military option here unless you are willing to effectively collapse the Syrian state and re-escalate the civil war,\u201d Ms. Ashford wrote.\n\nMr. Trump, she predicted, would launch another set of punitive strikes that would \u201cchange nothing\u201d but win domestic approval.\n\nBut why does such support still exist for a policy that has already demonstrably failed?\n\nResearch by Sarah Kreps and Sarah Maxey, political scientists at Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania, found that Americans feel a moral obligation to help humanitarian victims \u2014 and to provide that help in the form of military action. This can lead Americans to support seemingly incongruous policies like saving war refugees by dropping bombs.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just voters. Within Washington, an odd revisionism has arisen around Mr. Trump\u2019s previous set of strikes, meant to explain why they produced little tangible benefit. They only appeared to fail because the United States, it is said, did not properly capitalize on the \u201cleverage\u201d the strikes had provided.\n\nThere is an alternate hypothesis: The reason that limited strikes rarely seem to translate into \u201cleverage\u201d is because they do not produce \u201cleverage,\u201d a fuzzy term with no fixed meaning.\n\nThis is where this debate arguably starts to reveal more about the United States, and particularly Washington\u2019s foreign policy community, than about the Syrian war.\n\nThe cult of \u201climited strikes\u201d is so powerful in Washington that, even when they do occur, it\u2019s said they were never properly capitalized on. There is always the shimmering hope, just over the next hill, that bombing a runway will make all of Washington\u2019s dreams come true.\n\nIt sometimes seems as if the United States will be bombing empty runways until the end of time, dead certain that it\u2019s a way to get everything Americans want at no real cost or risk, and that all the past failures only prove that the next time it\u2019ll work for sure.", "title": "America\u2019s Three Bad Options in Syria", "authors": ["Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}

When American laws restricted abortion they generally did not impose such penalties, and today\u2019s pro-life movement likewise generally rejects the idea of prosecuting women. This position often gets cast as inconsistent by pro-choicers, but I think it represents the incorporation by pro-lifers of the points that my pro-choice friends actually get right \u2014 that pregnancy is unique in ways that mitigate culpability and make it unwise to treat abortion like a normal homicide, that the government can only go so far in restriction without becoming a reproductive police state \u2014 without making the literally fatal mistake of believing these things also require a civil right to kill your unborn child.\n\nNow: The fact that Williamson is an extremist doesn\u2019t change the fact that to hire him for his pen and then fire him for having expressed an extreme opinion was stupid and gutless \u2014 akin to hiring Christopher Hitchens and then firing him for antireligious bigotry (and yes, Hitch was a bigot, but worth publishing anyway), or adding Hunter S. Thompson to your masthead and then dropping him because it\u2019s pointed out that he writes under the influence of drugs. But still there is a part of me, as someone whose goal is to persuade liberal readers to reconsider their pro-abortion views, that\u2019s glad Williamson won\u2019t be carrying the pro-life flag at The Atlantic, out of fear that his extremities could make the work of persuasion harder.\n\nAnother part of me, though \u2014 the more important one \u2014 thinks that this is a case study in exactly the problem establishment editors are trying to address by widening their pool of writers: the inability of contemporary liberalism to see itself from the outside, as it looks to the many people who for some reason, class or religion or historical experience, are not fully indoctrinated into its increasingly incoherent mix of orthodoxies.\n\nBy this I mean that my pro-choice friends endorsing Williamson\u2019s sacking can\u2019t see that his extremism is mirrored in their own, in a system of supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d thought that is often blind to the public\u2019s actual opinions on these issues, that lionizes advocates for abortion at any stage of pregnancy, that hands philosophers who favor forms of euthanasia and infanticide prestigious chairs at major universities, that is at best mildly troubled by the quietus of the depressed and disabled in Belgium or the near-eradication of Down syndrome in Iceland or the gendercide that abortion brought to Asia, that increasingly accepts unblinking a world where human beings can be commodified and vivisected so long as they\u2019re in embryonic form.\n\nAll this extremism has its reasons, as those tenured philosophers will be happy to explain. But everyday liberalism is sufficiently muddled between semi-Christian ideas and a utilitarian materialism that mostly the system is defended by euphemism and evasion, and by a failure to imagine oneself as all of us once were: tiny and dependent and hidden, and yet still essentially ourselves.", "title": "Opinion | Among the Abortion Extremists", "authors": []}

It\u2019s a uniquely American place.\n\nThere\u2019s something tragically, fundamentally American, too, about an angry young white man with a firearm killing a bunch of strangers who have done him no harm. That\u2019s what happened early Sunday morning, when a man who was naked except for a green jacket loaded with ammunition opened fire with an AR-15 rifle at a Waffle House in the Antioch section of Nashville. Four people were fatally shot and four others were wounded before James Shaw Jr., an unarmed customer, wrestled the gun from him, saving untold lives.\n\nThe attacker ran away, shedding the jacket as he fled. Also left in his wake: Akilah Dasilva, DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, and Taurean C. Sanderlin, all dead. All were in their 20s. All were people of color.\n\nA search of the truck the gunman left behind led investigators to Travis Reinking, an Illinois man who had moved to Nashville only last fall. Considered armed and dangerous, Mr. Reinking immediately went to the top of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most-wanted list. After some 34 hours at large in a cold rain, he was apprehended Monday afternoon clothed and wearing a backpack containing a loaded semiautomatic handgun.", "title": "Opinion | An American Tragedy in Nashville", "authors": []}

American smiles are more assertive, reflecting Americans\u2019 rating of themselves as more dominant. A University of California at Berkeley professor of psychology claims that American smiles emphasize the upper teeth while British smiles also show the lower teeth, which Americans often mistake as \u201cdeferential\u201d or a \u201csuppressed grimace.\u201d\n\nA German friend told me she felt sorry for the actors on American television because they had to smile so much. It seemed exhausting to her, and a strain. (When Walmart opened stores in Germany, it had to scrap its requirement that employees smile because some customers had misread it as flirting.)\n\nDoes America\u2019s emphasis on smiling say something about a desire for happy endings, for appeasement and artifice? Or do we smile more as a way to cope with our troubles, as a source of comfort? A 2015 study concluded that people in Canada and the United States, countries with a long history of immigration, do smile more than those in other countries, as smiling is a form of nonverbal communication between those who don\u2019t share a language. In The Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, a 2016 study found that cultures with a \u201clow uncertainty avoidance,\u201d in which the future is judged to be relatively unpredictable and social conditions are regarded as uncertain, view smiling too much as unintelligent. The more corrupt a society is, the more its citizens see smiling as suspicious.\n\nSmiling when you don\u2019t feel like it has been proven to make you feel good by producing actual feelings of happiness. I\u2019ve tried it, and it does work, but I don\u2019t want to be ordered to smile. If a smile is the appearance of happiness, then to be commanded to smile takes away our right to our own feelings. We must appear happy, even if we\u2019re not. A man told my friend to smile, for instance, on the day that she found out her father had died.\n\nOr maybe there\u2019s just something about my neutral expression that comes across as seeming worried or displeased. People have asked if there was something wrong when I was feeling just fine. To compensate, I\u2019ve found myself smiling forcefully when socializing with strangers, wanting to assure them that they don\u2019t have to worry.

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "Paying more for better, faster care may not be fair, but the concept has been around for decades.\n\nConcierge physicians often charge patients directly, bypassing insurance companies that discount their rates. They do this through annual membership fees but also with charges for each visit. In return, patients get direct access and more time with a doctor.\n\nTop hospitals have also started to provide concierge services, offering programs with stately names that are meant to coddle dignitaries, celebrities and international patients paying their own way. In New York, Mount Sinai Hospital has its Executive Services Department, the Hospital for Special Surgery offers its Ambassador Services, and Weill Cornell Medicine provides its International Patient Services.\n\nBut emergency rooms by law treat the sickest patients first. If you\u2019ve been shot, you\u2019ll be seen right away. If you\u2019re stable, you\u2019re going to wait \u2014 and you could keep waiting depending on who else comes in.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to research by ProPublica, the average time a patient spends in an emergency room in New York State before being sent home is three hours. In certain hospitals in New York City, the wait can stretch to closer to five hours.\n\nWaiting in emergency rooms is the norm. In Maryland, it\u2019s about three and a half hours on average; in North Dakota, the wait is comparatively speedy: You\u2019re in and out in about an hour and a half.\n\nA lot of people are fed up with the process, but few can do anything about it. That\u2019s where Priority Private Care, with its care center on the Upper East Side, saw an opening for a clientele familiar with the costs and benefits of concierge medicine.\n\nDr. Bernard Kruger, a board-certified physician in oncology and internal medicine, started the company 18 months ago with two partners. He had a concierge medical practice for 15 years but saw its limitations, particularly on weekends if a patient was hurt and needed an X-ray or blood work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe got the idea for a concierge emergency room after helping a patient, an actress, who had fallen off a horse. \u201cI brought her to Mount Sinai,\u201d Dr. Kruger said. \u201cThe head of the department came down. We still waited five hours for a CAT scan. I said something is wrong here.\u201d\n\nThe Priority Private Care facility is sleek and modern, with a Chuck Close painting hanging on the wall. In addition to being well staffed, the center has the imaging machines and laboratory equipment for blood work to get results quickly and help doctors make a diagnosis.\n\nDr. Kruger summed up the experience: \u201cYou get seen right away. You get treated right away. You have a consistent doctor with you.\u201d\n\nIt has its limits. It is not equipped to handle a gunshot wound, for instance, and it is not a surgery center. But according to a 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, about three-fourths of emergency room visits by people with insurance did not require emergency room-level care.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of waiting (and unnecessary visits), given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are 141 million emergency room visits each year. The same C.D.C. study said that 11.2 million emergency room visits resulted in people being admitted to the hospital and 1.8 million, or about 1 percent, of those visits ended with people being admitted to critical care units.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe founders of Priority Private Care envisioned a service focused on three areas. The first is emergency care. They believe they can handle about 80 percent of the cases that require emergency care.\n\nThe second is access to a network of specialists and the ability to get patients in to see someone quickly. This was one thing that attracted Russ Coniglio, a businessman who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., but keeps an apartment in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cYou call a specialist on Park Avenue, and they say six months,\u201d said Mr. Coniglio, who works in the beauty care business. But when Dr. Kruger calls a specialist, he said, \u201cthey say come right over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you put a price tag on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a problem and wait three weeks for the appointment, that\u2019s hard to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Coniglio also put his children on the plan, and both of his college-age sons have used it for emergency services for sports-related injuries.\n\nThose medical connections also extend to getting a patient admitted into a hospital through its V.I.P. services, if additional care is needed.\n\nThe third is convenience for any ailment, like a sore throat or a cough, that crops up after hours or on the weekend. \u201cAs long as we have to staff a full facility to effectively run empty, people can use us for convenience services,\u201d said Andrew Olanow, a co-founder of Priority Private Care.\n\nThe center differs, though, from hospital emergency rooms, which have to take anyone who walks in off the street. Priority Private Care is not obligated to do that, though Mr. Olanow said it would.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re gushing blood, we\u2019d stabilize them and walk them the one and a half blocks to Lenox Hill,\u201d he said of a nearby hospital.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd the center, which is regulated as an urgent care facility by New York State, offers free care to the schoolchildren and teachers in its neighborhood as community outreach.\n\nTexas has addressed concierge emergency rooms in a different way. The state allows free-standing emergency rooms, many of which act as concierge providers. The advantage is the greater attention and the quicker passage through the emergency room. Like Priority, though, if you\u2019ve been shot or need surgery, the staff members will get you to a hospital emergency room.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI get to spoil my patients and go over every lab and sit with them,\u201d said Dr. Harvey Castro, a former emergency room doctor who is now medical director of Coppell ER in the Dallas area. \u201cWe have extra staff who can go and walk a person\u2019s dog. We\u2019ve picked up children at school.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of a membership fee, Coppell ER bills insurance companies and collects the hefty emergency room payments. That can be lucrative for the emergency room, if expensive for the insurance company.\n\nPriority Private Care\u2019s membership fee decreases as more family members are included. Mr. Wilson said it was $5,000 for him, $3,000 for his wife and $2,000 for their daughter.\n\nThe center has 1,100 members, from about 350 families. Mr. Olanow said it planned to cap membership at 2,000 to 2,500, depending on how crowded the facility got.\n\nOn a given day, the center, which has two doctors and a physician assistant ready to go, sees four or five patients. A typical emergency room doctor sees three patients every hour.\n\nBut like a hospital emergency room, it also gets patients who come in with nonemergencies. Mr. Wilson, who lives just a few blocks away, said he had awakened one morning with a pimple and wondered whether Priority Private Care could take care of it.\n\n\u201cIt was really bothering me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said come on over.\u201d\n\nWhen the concierge E.R. is empty, a visit for any ailment is welcome.", "title": "An E.R.

But the prime minister\u2019s allies say that Hungarians really care about his successful stewardship of the economy and that \u201cOrbanomics\u201d will most likely decide the election on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPeople feel that they have a much better life in terms of the economy,\u201d said Istvan Lovas, a radio host and one of Mr. Orban\u2019s most prominent supporters. \u201cWhatever figures you look at, they are clearly improving.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, that is true. Government debt, as a proportion of Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product, has fallen more than 6 percentage points since 2010. The country\u2019s credit ratings have improved. The budget deficit has roughly halved. Growth has almost quadrupled. Wages have risen by more than 10 percent. Though still high, deprivation has fallen by nearly half \u2014 not least in places like Siklosnagyfalu, where villagers benefit from their workfare wages. Officially, unemployment has dropped by nearly two-thirds.\n\n\u201cHungary has been on the right track,\u201d Mihaly Varga, the economy minister, said in an email that cited most of these positive developments. \u201cNow everyone who is capable of work and wants to work can find a job.\u201d\n\nBut critics argue that things are not as rosy as the traditional macroeconomic measures suggest.\n\nSince Mr. Orban came to power, Hungary has slipped to 29th place from 20th on the Euro Health Consumer Index, a comparison of European health systems. Student performance in reading, math and science has worsened, according to the Program for International Student Assessment, which compares global education systems.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd as other Central European countries have become less corrupt, Hungary has become significantly more so, according to the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators. During Mr. Orban\u2019s first six years in power, five of his closest friends were awarded roughly 5 percent of public procurement contracts, a total of $2.5 billion, according to an analysis by the Corruption Research Center Budapest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Orban\u2019s successes have also partly been the result of factors beyond his control.\n\nUnder Mr. Orban, gross domestic product has been unusually dependent on money from the European Union. Between 2009 and 2016, such funding constituted nearly 4 percent of Hungarian G.D.P. per year, one of the highest ratios in the bloc, European officials have calculated.\n\nEurope also functions as a pressure valve for the Hungarian labor market. The government says 730,000 new jobs have been created since 2010 \u2014 but that includes as many as 350,000 Hungarians who have found work elsewhere in the European Union, said Janos Kollo, research director of the Institute of Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nMr. Orban has also benefited from the global economic revival.\n\n\u201cThe Hungarian government was like any other government,\u201d said Istvan Madar, a senior analyst at Portfolio, a Hungarian financial journal. \u201cThey had some special methods, some unorthodox measures, but the overall Hungarian government economic performance was no better than any other regional government.\u201d\n\nSome of those measures raised eyebrows. Until Mr. Orban and his far-right party, Fidesz, came to power, Hungarians could hold 25 percent of their retirement savings in a private fund; the rest went into a public pot. To cut state debt, the government announced that Hungarians who did not transfer private pension assets into the public system would not receive a state pension. By the time the order was ruled unconstitutional, most people had already complied.\n\n\u201cIt was a completely unlawful blackmailing of the population,\u201d said Balazs Romhanyi, an economic analyst who at the time was chief of staff at the Hungarian Budget Council, a state body that monitors state expenditure.\n\nPhoto\n\n(Mr. Varga, the economy minister, justified the decision by arguing that the private pensions were \u201ctoo costly,\u201d and that the new system had been more \u201cstable and predictable.\u201d)\n\nThe highlight of Mr. Orban\u2019s apparent economic success \u2014 the fall in unemployment \u2014 also fades under scrutiny.\n\nIn 2017, more than 200,000 Hungarians \u2014 nearly 4 percent of the country\u2019s work force \u2014 participated in the government\u2019s workfare program, and were therefore counted as employed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Siklosnagyfalu, for example, 25 workfare participants are allocated to work all year on five hectares, or about 12 acres, of public farmland \u2014 work that requires neither that many people, nor such a permanent assignment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn really small settlements, there are no real jobs,\u201d said Gyorgy Molnar, a specialist in workfare at the Institute for Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Science. \u201cThe majority of people are working for one or two hours and then going home.\u201d\n\nHe estimated that the real unemployment rate in 2017 was 7.3 percent \u2014 lower than when Mr. Orban entered office, but far higher than the official rate of 4.2 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe program also makes participants more dependent on both on their local mayor, who decides work assignments, and on Fidesz, the party that expanded workfare.\n\nIn the last general election in 2014, Fidesz received 116 votes in Siklosnagyfalu and the runner-up nine. That result is likely to be repeated on Sunday, said the village\u2019s independent mayor, Jozsef Kosztics, who said he had talked with villagers about how they planned to vote.\n\nThough the workfare program may skew national employment figures and exacerbate feudal dynamics in the countryside, it has nevertheless improved lives in Siklosnagyfalu.\n\nParticipants are paid approximately $175 a month \u2014 less than half the minimum wage, but roughly double what was paid out in unemployment benefits. Four Siklosnagyfalu residents said they could now afford to pay for heating in the winter and to buy meat more regularly.\n\n\u201cThis little bit of money goes a long way in this village,\u201d said Eva Petrovics, 60, who helps to clean the village nursery school. \u201cThe fridge is full now.\u201d\n\nThe program has also helped to spruce up the village. Since 2012, workfare participants have built a small bridge, added a drainage system, and renovated the town hall and sports fields. The terms of the program have also allowed Mr. Kosztics to buy farming machinery for the village, including a new tractor and plow.\n\n\u201cYou can say a lot of things about the workfare program, but one thing is certain,\u201d Mr. Kosztics said. \u201cFor municipalities like this one, it means survival.\u201d", "title": "An Economic Miracle in Hungary, or Just a Mirage?", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley", "Benjamin Novak"]}

The following interview was edited and condensed.\n\nYour new book offers wide-ranging advice for parents as they try to manage their children\u2019s education. If you had to choose one takeaway, what would it be?\n\nParents have more power and more choices than they may realize in educating their children. Many parents are worried about how the world is changing and the uncertain futures their children face. Parents are especially anxious about education. They worry that there\u2019s too much testing and competition, that the curriculum is too narrow, that their children are not treated as individuals and that schools are not cultivating their curiosity, confidence and creative talents.\n\nThey worry about how many young people are being medicated for \u201clearning problems.\u201d They worry about the rising costs of college and whether their children will eventually find a job, whether or not they go to college. Often parents feel powerless to do anything about all of this. The good news is that a great many educators share these concerns and are also campaigning for change.", "title": "An Expert\u2019s View: Sir Ken Robinson", "authors": []}

Patient advocates and pain specialists demanded that the medical establishment recognize pain as the \u201cfifth vital sign.\u201d\n\nMr. Courtwright says that this was not a simple case of historical amnesia. In the earlier epidemic, doctors \u201cmade mistakes, but it was a bad situation to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no equivalent of Purdue Pharma flying you off to the Bahamas for the weekend to tell you about the wonders of these new drugs.\u201d\n\nWHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?\n\nThe AIDS crisis might provide public officials some lessons for how to move forward. Like with opioids, the federal government responded to that epidemic by doing next to nothing for many years. But an organized movement led in part by people with H.I.V. and gay activists eventually forced Congress to create and fund new programs. For example, in 1990 Congress approved the Ryan White Care Act, a bipartisan bill that poured billions of dollars into providing treatment and support to people with H.I.V. By 1995, the federal government was spending $3.3 billion a year (about $5.4 billion today after adjusting for inflation) on AIDS efforts, not including billions spent through mandatory programs like Medicaid and Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That was up from just $116 million in 1985.\n\nThough slow to act, Congress eventually treated AIDS as a complex, multidimensional problem and tackled it by funding prevention, treatment, support services and research. Lawmakers provided money to make expensive antiretroviral drugs accessible to more people and allocated money to help house people infected with H.I.V., recognizing that they needed more than just access to drugs.\n\nImage AIDs activists demonstrating in New York in 1988. Credit Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\n\nLawmakers so far have fallen far short of such a vigorous effort when it comes to opioid addiction. Congress has taken what can be considered only baby steps by appropriating a total of a few billion dollars of discretionary opioid funding in recent years. This funding amounts to a pittance relative to what is needed: substantial long-term funding for prevention, addiction treatment, social services and research. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University, says at least $6 billion a year is needed for 10 years to set up a nationwide network of clinics and doctors to provide treatment with medicines like buprenorphine and methadone. Those drugs have a proven track record at reducing overdoses and giving people struggling with addiction a shot at a stable life. Today, large parts of the country have few or no clinics that offer medication-assisted treatment, according to an analysis by amfAR, a foundation that funds AIDS research.\n\nNext, lawmakers need to remove regulations restricting access to buprenorphine, an opioid that can be used to get people off stronger drugs like heroin; its use is unlikely to end in an overdose. Doctors who want to prescribe the drug have to go through eight hours of training, and the government limits the number of patients they can treat. These limits have made the drug harder to obtain and created a situation in which it is easier to get the kinds of opioids that caused this crisis than to get medicine that can help addicts. France reduced heroin overdoses by nearly 80 percent by making buprenorphine easily available starting in 1995. Yet many American lawmakers and government officials have resisted removing restrictions on buprenorphine, arguing it replaces one addiction with another. Some of the same people have also stood in the way of wider availability of naloxone, which can help reverse overdoses, and opposed harm-reduction approaches like supervised drug consumption sites, where users can get clean needles and use drugs under the watch of staff who are trained to reverse overdoses.", "title": "Opinion | An Opioid Crisis Foretold", "authors": []}

The theory was, the country would save itself by surrendering to American demands, including nuclear disarmament, for relief from economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation.\n\nIn the meantime, few believed the hermit kingdom could develop advanced missiles to carry nuclear weapons to the American mainland.\n\nThis led to severe American demands, which only fed North Korea\u2019s conviction that it required a nuclear deterrent to survive. And it allowed the United States, confident full victory was inevitable, to miss earlier opportunities for partial victory through an agreement to freeze North Korea\u2019s nuclear program when it was smaller and less advanced.\n\nIn the American view, the coming meeting is the result of sanctions and pressure, so surely Mr. Kim is prepared to discuss the degree of his nuclear surrender.\n\nThe North Koreans, though, have long patterned their strategy on what they see as China\u2019s path: international pariah in the 1950s, rogue nuclear state in the 1960s, and, finally, accepted global power in the 1970s.\n\nThat was when the United States embraced the Beijing government and withdrew troops and security guarantees from its longtime ally in Taiwan \u2014 a possible precedent, in North Korean eyes, for partial American withdrawal of support for South Korea. For China, economic prosperity followed, securing the future of a communist government once seen as unlikely to survive the modern world.\n\nIn reality, China won acceptance by playing the United States against the Soviet Union. Its size and power, which North Korea lacks, made it impossible for other nations to ignore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that history is why, for Mr. Kim, his meeting with Mr. Trump could seem like an echo of President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s 1972 summit with Mao Zedong, where the former accepted the latter as the leader of a fellow great power. It is also why he seems to expect, like the Americans, a kind of victory that might not be realistic.\n\nPhoto\n\nClashing Expectations\n\nWith Mr. Trump unconstrained by the international norms he disdains or the diplomatic institutions he has largely circumvented, and with Mr. Kim\u2019s domestic political considerations almost entirely unknown, it is difficult to articulate even the range of possible outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe have misunderstood North Korea\u2019s promises before (and they have broken them),\u201d Melissa Hanham, an analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, warned on Twitter.\n\nMr. Kim \u201ccan go back on his promises really easily,\u201d she wrote of his pledges to stop testing. He might secure a high-level meeting, a major achievement in its own right, while offering little concrete in return.\n\nMira Rapp-Hooper, who works on Asian security issues at the Center for New American Security, has argued that Mr. Trump will feel pressured to return with a deal.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s skepticism of alliances, she has written, could lead him to offer partial American withdrawal from the region and acceptance of a North Korean nuclear program in exchange for Pyongyang\u2019s halting development on the long-range missiles that can reach the continental United States.\n\nThere are perhaps a dozen such scenarios, some more drastic than others. They have little in common other than at least potentially reconciling the contradictions in what each country expects to achieve.\n\nPerhaps even more important and even less certain is what happens if these clashing expectations cannot be reconciled, leading the talks to collapse in angry disagreement.\n\nMr. Narang, the M.I.T. professor, warned that the mile-wide gaps in the countries\u2019 goals and even their understandings of basic terminology leaves \u201ceither lots of room for a bargain, or lot of room for a war.\u201d", "title": "An Unpredictable Trump and a Risk-Prone Kim Mean High Stakes and Mismatched Expectations", "authors": ["Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}

In addition to her company\u2019s tours, she was commissioned last year by the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise to adapt Jean Renoir\u2019s classic 1939 film \u201cThe Rules of the Game,\u201d albeit with mixed results. \u201cIthaque (Notre Odyss\u00e9e 1)\u201d reflects her growing ties to the country: Alongside three women from her Brazil-based ensemble, who moved fluidly between French and Portuguese, she cast three French actors.\n\nAs often with Ms. Jatahy, there is no \u201cfourth wall\u201d to speak of in \u201cIthaque (Notre Odyss\u00e9e 1).\u201d The cast established a warm rapport with the audience, passing chips and peanuts around, even singling out one onlooker to chat. Characters proved fluid, too: The women all took turns playing Calypso and Penelope, opposite different Ulysses.\n\nThe action \u2014 Ulysses\u2019 struggle to break free of Calypso\u2019s hold, his return to Ithaca \u2014 comes in fits and starts, with unfortunate lulls throughout. What Ms. Jatahy succeeds in conveying, however, is a sense of lawlessness and despair, compounded by the misogynist violence that emerges as Penelope tries to distract her boisterous guests. In the playbill, the director cited corruption in Brazil as one inspiration, as well as the plight of refugees in Europe \u2014 at one point, a performer reads from real-life migrant stories.\n\nOver the course of the performance, the space between the two parts of the stage slowly fills with a shallow pool of water. The curtains parting the auditorium are ultimately raised for Ulysses\u2019 massacre of Penelope\u2019s suitors, which both halves of the audience see at the same time. In this \u201cOdyssey,\u201d however, the violence brings no catharsis: The damage is done, and the water remains.\n\nInstead of a contemporary makeover, Ms. Vignaud went the opposite route with the myth of Phaedra, wife of Theseus, who sexually pursues her stepson Hippolytus after the disappearance of her husband. For her debut at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, the young director \u2014 Ms. Vignaud is only 29 \u2014 opted to turn back the clock and stage a rarely seen Latin play, Seneca the Younger\u2019s telling of the tale of Phaedra.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt turns out to be more urgent, in many ways, than French literature\u2019s go-to \u201cPh\u00e8dre,\u201d Jean Racine\u2019s 1677 tragedy. This supremely classical work is one of Racine\u2019s finest creations, but its characters often have a remote quality in performance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the contrary, Seneca\u2019s play (in Florence Dupont\u2019s translation) has a warmer, more human tone. Cuts were made for this spare, 80-minute production, performed on the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s smaller Studio stage, but Phaedra emerges as a defiant woman in a man\u2019s world. She pulls no punches: After declaring her husband, Theseus, \u201ca sodomite and an adulterer,\u201d she proceeds to explain why the bull her mother, Pasiphae, mated with was a better lover than him.\n\nIt\u2019s a startling moment, as is her cunning manipulation of her nurse (played by the excellent Claude Mathieu), usually recognized as one of Racine\u2019s great Machiavellian confidantes. As Phaedra, Jennifer Decker was languor itself, with a callous side: She is very much in charge as she seduces Hippolytus, then lies to Theseus upon his surprise return. Only N\u00e2zim Boudjenah seemed miscast as the young Hippolytus. His lack of chemistry with Ms. Decker robbed Ms. Vignaud\u2019s production of some of the simmering tension that was clearly intended. Still, she has the instincts of an original director: She is one to follow.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The opening scene, in which Mephistopheles the devil visits God and bets on the fate of the erudite Dr. Faust, sees both these supernatural beings hovering in the air on invisible chairs, as if freed from gravity. The role of Mephistopheles is a true gift to Christian Hecq, one of the most distinctive character actors at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. Weightless and buoyant, he turned his tricks into sly, superlative comedy.\n\nMs. Losseau and Mr. Navarro\u2019s direction is less compelling when no special effects are required. While Laurent Natrella made a fine, restless Faust, his seduction of Marguerite and her subsequent downfall lacked potency. An appearance by the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise director \u00c9ric Ruf, who harangued the audience as himself in an introduction to the performance, proved a memorable addition, but Goethe\u2019s 19th-century play is often more heavy-handed, in moral terms, than Seneca\u2019s Roman-era take on a Greek myth.

While politically it was undoubtedly a misstep as the country grapples with the #MeToo movement, the mayor, perhaps inadvertently, gave voice to concerns about the way investigations are used as weapons within the city\u2019s schools.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m also trying to be honest about something that is different at D.O.E. than a lot of other places, and it\u2019s a pretty well-known thing in the educational world. Some people inappropriately make complaints for other reasons. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s ever about sexual harassment. But it is unfortunately a part of the culture and it has to be addressed separately.\u201d\n\nHe went on to talk about \u201culterior motives\u201d that might drive complaints in the schools.\n\nIn 2017, there were 1,932 complaints of all kinds made against principals or assistant principals to the city\u2019s Special Commissioner of Investigations, the office that investigates corruption and criminal activity in city schools, compared with 870 complaints in 2007. Principals brought in to improve struggling schools can be confronted with a cascade of allegations.\n\nThe Special Commissioner\u2019s office has been embroiled in its own turmoil in recent months. The office has long had a degree of independence, but earlier this year, Mark G. Peters, the city\u2019s investigations commissioner, tried to seize control of the unit. Mr. Peters, who was once Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign treasurer but is now feuding with the mayor, installed a new special commissioner only to fire her a few weeks later when she pushed back against efforts to limit the office\u2019s independence.", "title": "Announcing $125 Million for Schools, de Blasio Stumbles Over #MeToo", "authors": []}

And it makes it hard for researchers to know, for example, if property has become concentrated among fewer owners.\n\nBecause the stakes are so high and the spillovers significant, there has always been a public element to private property, said Susan Pace Hamill, a law professor at the University of Alabama who has written about L.L.C.s since the late 1980s.\n\n\u201cShould tenants have a right to know who they\u2019re renting from?\u201d she said. \u201cShould cities have a right to know who owns the property? The answer is a resounding yes.\u201d\n\nL.L.C.s today hide what should be public information, she argues.\n\n\u201cI am quite disturbed by that,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving participated in the evolution of L.L.C.s from their early days, I feel like they\u2019re being abused.\u201d\n\nWyoming passed the first L.L.C. statute in 1977 at the prodding of oil and gas interests, creating an entity with the liability protections of a corporation without the tax responsibilities of one. Hardly anyone took advantage of the tool, and few states followed until the I.R.S. blessed L.L.C.s a decade later. They then quickly became the entity of choice for all kinds of businesses, and by the mid-1990s, all 50 states had L.L.C. laws.\n\nIn Milwaukee, according to research by a Harvard doctoral student, Adam Travis, L.L.C.s have grown to about a quarter of the rental market in the two decades since they became legal in the state.\n\nThe original idea was never specifically about real estate, and anonymity wasn\u2019t particularly the appeal. But over time, Ms. Hamill said, state laws have made it easier to conceal who\u2019s behind L.L.C.s. So they have simultaneously grown more common and less transparent.", "title": "Anonymous Owner, L.L.C.: Why It Has Become So Easy to Hide in the Housing Market", "authors": []}

By comparison, most nonmusical plays on Broadway are between $3 million and $5 million, and even the splashiest musicals rarely top more than $25 million.\n\nBut the capitalization is only a portion of what it took to pave the way for \u201cCursed Child\u201d to get to Broadway.\n\nThe Ambassador Theater Group, the British theater giant that operates the Lyric, spent about $23 million to persuade its previous occupant, Cirque du Soleil, to shutter its \u201cParamour\u201d musical and make way for \u201cCursed Child,\u201d according to two people with knowledge of the transaction.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmbassador, which competed with other Broadway landlords to woo \u201cCursed Child,\u201d overhauled the Lyric at the behest of the play\u2019s producers. A charmless barn of a theater (previously home to a series of flops, including the $75 million musical \u201cSpider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\u201d), it was reconfigured to feel more like an old-fashioned opera house, with a vaulted ceiling, a necklace of boxes, and 1,622 seats (down from 1,896). Even the entrance was relocated, from crowded 42nd Street to the less dense 43rd Street.\n\nThe work on the building was expected to cost about $10 million, according to documents filed with the New York City Department of Buildings.\n\nThe play, a two-part experience with a running time of more than five hours, is a sequel to the series of young adult fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling about a boy wizard. \u201cCursed Child\u201d takes place 19 years after the final book, at a time when Harry and his friends have become parents.\n\n\u201cCursed Child\u201d was written by Jack Thorne, based on a story by Mr. Thorne, Ms. Rowling and the director John Tiffany. It was developed in Britain and has been sold out in London\u2019s West End for 22 months, and last year it won a record nine Olivier awards \u2014 the British equivalent of the Tonys \u2014 including one for best play. A third production, in Melbourne, Australia, is scheduled to open next year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response to questions about the show\u2019s finances, two of the lead producers, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, offered a tour of the renovated theater. Strolling through the theater, they showed off phoenix sconces and dragon lanterns and a lobby wall featuring prints of patronuses (silvery animal guardians).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The newly adorned exterior features giant wings and large sculptures of a child (symbol alert!) trapped in a nest.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a mood, without crossing a line into theme park,\u201d Mr. Callender said. Ms. Friedman added, \u201cIt was really important to us that the lobbies and the front-of-house had the atmosphere of the Harry Potter world, because this is the beginning of the audience\u2019s experience.\u201d\n\nMs. Friedman, who has been vocal about the high cost of working on Broadway, said that the play has cost significantly more to mount in New York than in London. Labor, marketing and theater rentals all tend to cost more in New York.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI find the costs here difficult to comprehend,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a number I do not like.\u201d\n\nBut she also said that particular aspects of \u201cCursed Child\u201d make it expensive. A play in two parts required twice as much time to rehearse; the show\u2019s elaborate illusions required significant substage mechanics and extra training. It took 16 weeks just to load the show\u2019s set elements into the theater.\n\nInvestment documents filed with the New York attorney general\u2019s office offer a rough breakdown of the capitalization, including $11.7 million for the physical production, $7.8 million for \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d costs, including the design and signage of the facade, $3.4 million for advertising and publicity and $3.2 million for salaries.\n\nThat money goes to pay a cast and crew that is much bigger than for most plays. According to Ms. Friedman and Mr. Callender, a shop crew of 220 people was assembled to build and install the scenery and lighting and costumes. The show has 40 actors, a stage crew of 26, some 16 people assigned to wardrobe and hair and 5 stage managers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious where the money went \u2014 the whole theater has been transformed to fit the show, and the level of technical expertise is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen on Broadway,\u201d said Jonathon Rosenthal, a 38-year-old I.T. consultant from the Bronx who runs a Harry Potter meet-up group and who saw the play on Broadway earlier this month. \u201cIt looks like there is magic going on on the stage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Broadway production is already largely sold out through next March, although there are periodic releases of more tickets, including some low-priced ones every Friday. Each part of the show had a recent average ticket price of $164.83 and a top price of $286.50; 300 seats per performance cost $40 or less. The two parts can be seen on the same day or consecutive days.\n\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries will be Ms. Rowling. The investment papers do not detail her compensation, but say that the \u201cunderlying rights owner, licensor and their affiliates\u201d \u2014 a group that includes Ms. Rowling \u2014 will initially receive 31 percent of the play\u2019s net profits, and that cut will eventually rise to 41 percent as the show moves deeper into profitability. Ms. Rowling can profit from the play in other ways as well; she is the third lead producer, through her company Harry Potter Theatrical Productions.\n\nHer deal appears to be more lucrative than the ones negotiated by other prose writers whose work was the basis of a Broadway show. Harper Lee, before her death, signed an agreement giving her 2.5 percent of the net profits, plus an author royalty, for a coming stage adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d (that money will now go to her estate), while Ron Chernow, the author of a biography of Alexander Hamilton, gets 1 percent of the adjusted grosses from \u201cHamilton.\u201d\n\nThe comparisons, however, are imperfect. Fiction writers generally get a bigger share of profits than do writers of nonfiction, since the novelists actually dream up their characters. And, unlike \u201cMockingbird,\u201d \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not adapted from a novel \u2014 it is a new story, created for the stage.", "title": "Another Harry Potter Landmark: At $68 Million, the Most Expensive Broadway Nonmusical Play Ever", "authors": ["Michael Paulson"]}

Jewdas calls itself non-Zionist, and it revels in the history of the radical Jewish diaspora; during the Seder, participants sang Yiddish songs cursing the police (in addition to observing more traditional Passover rituals).\n\nThis group was then denounced by the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jonathan Arkush, as \u201ca source of virulent anti-Semitism.\u201d The board, which has claimed to speak for British Jewry since the 18th century, usually keeps its head down and avoids the headlines. In the 1930s, it held back as other Jewish groups, mostly on the left, led the struggle against a nascent fascist movement on the streets of London. An inglorious role, perhaps, but one that has allowed the Board of Deputies to appear nonpartisan and impartial.\n\nNot this time. Interviewed on TV, Mr. Arkush opined that Jewdas\u2019s members \u201care not all Jewish,\u201d as if he were in a position to make authoritative pronouncements on the subject.\n\nWe are back in the usual arena of communal politics in which notables bandy writs of excommunication as a means of confirming their own authority. What happened to keeping shtum? Is fighting Jewdas really a priority in the struggle against anti-Semitism?\n\nIn this business no one comes out well \u2014 neither Mr. Corbyn nor his critics. But the lack of perspective and insight that both sides have demonstrated ultimately have less to tell us about anti-Semitism than they do about the diminished state of British politics. Is anti-Semitism a real issue in Britain? Yes. Is it worse for the Labour Party than for others? The evidence suggests not. Is it the most serious manifestation of racial prejudice facing the country? By no means. Muslims have it much worse than Jews, and Eastern European and other immigrants have also been the targets of far-right violence, especially since the referendum to leave the European Union.\n\nIn Brexit, Britain faces the most consequential foreign policy decision of the past half-century, one that will transform the country\u2019s position in the world. So far, the government has handled the negotiations like amateurs. Faced with a hostile use of deadly nerve agents on its own territory, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has responded with his characteristic lack of professionalism. If this is how the country\u2019s political elite tackles issues of such gravity, can we be surprised at how Mr. Corbyn, no less parochial in his way than his Conservative opponents, has fumbled his own internal crisis \u2014 and how the news media have fanned the flames?\n\nI am not sure that my grandfather would have seen much change in the Labour Party. The ongoing clash within its ranks between moderates and radicals would have been familiar to him. Nor would he have been very surprised to find prejudice extending left as well as right: This would not have affected his preference for the party of social justice. And since, as a Bundist, he had grown up in opposition to Zionism (Bundists and Zionists were locked in ideological combat from their birth onward), he would have regarded pretty searching criticism of Israel as a far more normal part of the political landscape than most people do today.\n\nBut he could only have been disappointed at the immense change in the country that took him in, in Britain itself, losing its way in a hall of mirrors, distracted by secondary issues while the country\u2019s fate hangs in the balance.", "title": "Opinion | Anti-Semitism and Britain\u2019s Hall of Mirrors", "authors": []}

Oh yes, it is nice to finally play someone who has touched greatness.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nHAD MR. BANDERAS stayed in Spain, this would have been an entirely different story. He would have continued on the path Mr. Almod\u00f3var had set for him, playing men with depth and inner lives. But he didn\u2019t \u2014 he couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe grew up going to the theater with his parents: plays by Lope de Vega, Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. He marveled at theater as an act of civilization. \u201cIt was so beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all here and we have an agreement.

He wanted to be onstage.\n\nBut his parents had seen how artists were treated under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Many were exiled. His mother was distraught. \u201cDon\u2019t be an actor,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cBe something dignified.\u201d He thought maybe he\u2019d be a soccer player instead.\n\nThen in 1976, the year after Franco died, an American theater company came through M\u00e1laga with \u201cHair\u201d and it was just over for Mr. Banderas. \u201cOh, my God. What is this? What is this beard and this long hair and this freedom?,\u201d he remembered thinking. He told his parents, \u201cI have to do this. I have to do this type of theater.

The question became one not of artistic fulfillment but of practicality. \u201cHow can I keep my career here? I\u2019m married here. I live here. I have to play here.\u201d\n\nAnd he loved America. \u201cThe culture here.\u201d He shimmered with delight. \u201cThere is something very beautiful about America, very innocent. Oh, yes. It\u2019s still new. It\u2019s innocent.\u201d\n\nI expressed some surprise. Over the course of my time in Hungary with him, we\u2019d gotten word of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla. America had become horrifying to me. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you guys believe. You believe everything \u2014 even in this moment you believe.\u201d In Europe, he said, people are skeptical. There\u2019s the weight of history. But America, man. \u201cI love NASA. I love those institutions. And I remember visiting Houston and going there and me doing my eyes like this.\u201d He made his eyes big and full of disbelief.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd the innovation! \u201cThese people that invent Googles and Apples and all these companies, they put heart in the skies. Elon Musk doing this thing is unbelievable to me.\u201d\n\nSo he played what he called the \u201cexotic guy.\u201d His agent told him he\u2019d become more powerful the more he said no. \u201cBut,\u201d he would say. \u201cI have a problem here because I have to build a career almost handicapped.\u201d He knew he was offered jobs that weren\u2019t quite the best, jobs that had been offered to five or 10 actors before him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI cannot play in the same league as certain American actors because my accent didn\u2019t allow me just to play a banker from New York or an astronaut,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have to be balancing. And it\u2019s almost like the guy in the circus that tried to keep all the plates going. And if he stops they fall. And so I did have to do in my career things that I wouldn\u2019t have done, yes.\u201d What could he do? \u201cIt was a desert for Spanish actors.\u201d\n\nBut lately, a strange thing started happening. He\u2019s not being asked to wear matador outfits anymore. At the ripe (but still extremely handsome) age of 57, the roles got better. \u201cThey have more weight, they are more complex, they are more profound and I enjoy more to play them because you can just actually find many different ways to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a pot and you can\u2019t stop putting things in. Before it was a uniform almost. They wanted the heroic, the epic, the guy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the Hispanic population coming of age, he wondered. Great numbers with advanced degrees and a real presence in cinema. \u201cNow it\u2019s normal to see at the Academy Awards Mexican directors taking Oscars, Spanish actors, actors from Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nBut it could also be him. It could also be that there\u2019s something about transforming small caricatures into great, big, memorable characters. All that time working to stay in business \u2014 as opposed to working to keep up an image \u2014 paid off. He subverted America\u2019s attempts to objectify him. He took artistic risks. He became adept at infusing soul into one-note characters (I\u2019m talking what could have been a throwaway role in \u201cMiami Rhapsody;\u201d I\u2019m talking the Nasonex bee.)\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about Picasso: He was considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and he was also prolific. He wasn\u2019t cheap with his talents. He didn\u2019t think that to practice his art would be to drain the supply of his artistry. He knew that was not how greatness works.\n\n\n\nAT THE END of the day, Mr. Banderas sat in the makeup trailer as a woman applied glue remover to his head with a paintbrush, then pulled at the netting that hosted the white hair he\u2019d been wearing. She did the same for his eyebrows, where there was a shadow of stubble. They began to work their fingers at the silicone that covered his face. He liked to help free himself from it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Watching Get the most out of your screen time with movie and TV recommendations, news and commentary from New York Times experts.

He lives there with his girlfriend, Nicole Kimpel, an investment adviser he met at Cannes a few years ago.\n\nThe truth is, he doesn\u2019t need to be in America anymore. So many movie shoots are done in Europe now for tax reasons. And Ms. Kimpel has an identical twin sister who lives in Switzerland whom she can\u2019t bear to be too far away from.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat did he need to stay in the United States for anyway? His days of co-parenting are over. Stella is off at the University of Southern California, studying cinema. Of his divorce from Ms. Griffith in 2015 he says: \u201cMelanie is a very generous woman and an excellent mother and a great lover for many years. But there is a moment that things were not working and before we started damaging each other we just decided to take that option.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the truth about why Antonio Banderas stayed in the States for so long. Yes, he got married. Yes, he loved NASA and the Googles. Yes, he loved our innocence. But you know what else? He won\u2019t say it, almost out of fealty to the country he was born in, but Ms. Hayek and Mr. Rodriguez will. In Spain, Ms. Hayek said, \u201cHe could not do some of the action movies. He\u2019d never been on Broadway.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Spain he could do a lot of interesting work. But in the U.S., he can be an action star, a comedy hero, a Nasonex bee, a spy dad. In Spain he could be in the theater, yes, but in America, he can be on Broadway. That year he was in \u201cNine?\u201d Mr. Banderas said it was his happiest time in America.\n\nThat\u2019s who Antonio Banderas is. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who wants to eat the world,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez told me.\n\nYou can\u2019t just eat the world from Europe, though. That\u2019s the thing about being an actor in America. When you\u2019re famous here, you\u2019re famous everywhere. Mr. Banderas stayed here because Spain simply wasn\u2019t big enough for him.\n\nIn Hungary, sitting in his makeup chair in the set of \u201cPicasso,\u201d Mr. Banderas said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to look into the mirror and see a doddering old man.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his eyes off himself when he spoke. \u201cPicasso is 67 here. I\u2019m two-and-a-half years away from 60. It\u2019s not so far away.\u201d He tilted his head, evaluating his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to visit an age before you get there. But it\u2019s somehow even scarier when it\u2019s not that far away.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAbout a year ago, Mr. Banderas was preparing breakfast in his home when his arm began to hurt. He\u2019d had an arrhythmia issue for years, and one of his doctors in Los Angeles had told him he had a blockage in one of his arteries. He\u2019d been under a lot of stress recently \u2014 the divorce, the move. He filmed seven movies that year. He was smoking. The pain in his arm was faint, but suddenly he felt it in his jaw. That\u2019s when he knew: He was having a heart attack.\n\nHe was in the hospital for just a day. As the nurse, who was a fan, said goodbye to him, she said: \u201cAntonio, you\u2019re going to be very sad. For like a month or two months you\u2019ll be very sad because the hearts hold feelings. And you\u2019re going to feel like the world is crumbling around you. Don\u2019t worry because you can put it back where it was and be the happy person that you are and continue doing your work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe didn\u2019t think much of it, but as he recuperated, he found that he couldn\u2019t shake his sadness. It engulfed him. It was like nothing he\u2019d ever felt before. \u201cSuddenly, you discover at your root level that it can be like in a second you can say goodbye.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s Antonio Banderas, so eventually the sadness made way for a different feeling: inspiration. He was still here. He was still here and he had so much left to do.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first script he read after his heart attack was \u201cLife Itself,\u201d written and directed by Dan Fogelman (\u201cThis Is Us\u201d). Mr. Banderas read to the last page and he knew he\u2019d found his next project, a drama about intersecting lives in Spain and America. He was offered the role of a \u201cnormal\u201d character \u2014 not a historical figure, not a masked avenger, not a slutty cat. Just a real man.\n\nDuring filming, he was different than usual. \u201cI was not so anxious about what is going to be the result of this, what is going to be their opinions. No, it was about me. It was \u2014 well, it\u2019s very genuine because actually I love this profession. What about that? I love this profession.\u201d\n\nAfter that, \u201cthings magically start happening. Picasso came walking into my life.\u201d\n\nThe silicone was now gone from his face. The hair was, too. He looked like a beautiful egg. Every day when the makeup came off, he was relieved to see that he was still there underneath. It\u2019s scary to get old. Maybe it\u2019s even scarier because you still have all the energy in the world, I suggested, and you feel like you haven\u2019t done the thing you\u2019ll be remembered for yet.\n\nHe smiled. I took him too literally, he said. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be remembered for what he\u2019s already done. It\u2019s just that \u2026 Did he tell me the story yet about what Dal\u00ed supposedly used to say? \u201cHe used to say, \u2018I am a very mediocre painter for the reason that I don\u2019t want to die. In fact, I am the best painter in the world but I don\u2019t paint a good painting because if I paint a good painting I will die the next day. So I prefer to be mediocre.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe gave me a combination [laughing with mouth open emoji] and [eyerolling emoji]. Ay, was Dal\u00ed crazy. Didn\u2019t he know? Dignity comes when it\u2019s required. Didn\u2019t he know? Greatness only gets greater the more it\u2019s practiced. Oh yes.

Pursuing this path will be offensive even to such leaders as Argentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri and Chile\u2019s Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, successful entrepreneurs and now presidents.\n\nStill, despite the shared confusion and distrust about United States policies and intentions, nearly all Latin American governments have chosen a pragmatic approach to dealing with Washington, seeking to accommodate Trump\u2019s idiosyncrasies without caving in to his often exaggerated demands. They are not ready to risk an open breach and potentially lose the United States\u2019 huge, profitable market and access to its trade, investment and technology. But Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to show up in Lima will leave the region less secure about the future of United States-Latin American relations. Yes, it is good news that Vice President Mike Pence will be there, but he is not the same as having Mr. Trump. The Latin American presidents want the opportunity to engage the president of the United States, as their predecessors have had at every summit meeting of the past quarter-century.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s absence has reduced expectations that the United States and Latin America can find a way to effectively address the one issue where some signs of common ground can be discerned: the disaster engulfing Venezuela. This crisis of unprecedented proportions has, albeit belatedly, become the concern of almost every nation in the Americas. It poses the most crucial test of the hemisphere\u2019s capacity for join action, but so far it has produced only limited agreement. Mr. Trump\u2019s off-handed suggestion last August of a \u201cmilitary option\u201d was immediately rejected across the region.\n\nThe Lima gathering gives the hemisphere\u2019s heads of state a rare opportunity to discuss face-to-face what it will take to develop a sustained regional effort, which no government could mount by itself, to press hard on the Venezuelan regime to alter its destructive economic and social policies and allow for a meaningful political opening. Urgent action is also required by the region\u2019s nations to respond to the needs of an accelerating migration from Venezuela. In just the past two years, a million Venezuelans have fled their country. This is clearly no easy task, given the divisions among nations, the lack of United States-Latin American cooperation and Venezuela\u2019s fractured opposition.", "title": "Opinion | Anxiety at the Summit of the Americas", "authors": []}

Gregorius is hitting .340, tied for sixth-best in baseball; his 10 home runs are tied for first with Mike Trout of the Angels and Mitch Haniger of the Seattle Mariners; and he leads the majors with 30 R.B.I. and a .766 slugging percentage.\n\nSimmons, who won his third Gold Glove last season, is considered in this era of advanced defensive metrics to be one of the best defensive shortstops ever. He\u2019s hitting .312 with a slugging percentage of .473 \u2014 nearly 100 points above his career average \u2014 and he has done even more damage in crucial spots, batting .417 with runners in scoring position entering Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA midcareer blossoming is not unexpected from players who grew up in Cura\u00e7ao, where facilities \u2014 and access to them \u2014 are not what they are in the United States. The sport is also not as ubiquitous in Cura\u00e7ao as it is in places like the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or Venezuela.\n\n\u201cGenerally when guys haven\u2019t played a lot of baseball, regardless of where they\u2019re from, it gives you some level of belief \u2014 cautious optimism let\u2019s call it \u2014 that there\u2019s a high amount of upside there,\u201d Angels General Manager Billy Eppler said.\n\nThat belief helped drive the Yankees\u2019 pursuit of both players when \u2014 unable to develop a shortstop to replace Derek Jeter \u2014 they went scouring the market for one when Jeter retired after the 2014 season. Unable to reach an agreement with the Atlanta Braves for Simmons, the Yankees swung a three-way deal to land Gregorius from the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nEppler, who was an assistant to Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman, was hired by the Angels a year later. His first trade was to acquire Simmons.\n\n\u201cWe saw a young, elite defender who had some process characteristics on the offensive side that were attractive to us,\u201d said Eppler, who might have been describing Gregorius as well. \u201cI have always been a big believer in the up-the-middle defense, kind of a throwback to traditional scouting.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When Gregorius got off to a poor start with the Yankees, fans at Yankee Stadium jeered his mistakes, sometimes chanting Jeter\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cYou learn from struggles,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cWhen you have your struggles, you\u2019d better find a quick way out of it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the plate, that has meant tightening up his swing \u2014 keeping his front shoulder closed against left-handed pitching \u2014 and, specifically this season, being more selective. Gregorius has taken 18 walks this year \u2014 he took 25 all of last season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe used to be like a chicken wing against left-handers with fastballs,\u201d said Meulens, pointing his left elbow up in the air. \u201cThe front arm goes up, the barrel drops and you filet balls. Now you keep that down and all of a sudden the bat head is out front and you\u2019re back-spinning balls into the seats and keeping them fair, which is not easy to do.\u201d\n\nMeulens gets to see the work Gregorius puts in each winter at the workouts he helps organize for the growing number of professional and collegiate players from Cura\u00e7ao, where Gregorius lives during the off-season. There is also the occasional barbecue and a weeklong clinic that serves 1,300 Little Leaguers around the island.\n\nSimmons, who returns home for a week or two each winter, joins the workouts and tries to time his visits with the clinic. Angels Manager Mike Scioscia traces Simmons\u2019s improvement at the plate to when he returned from missing five weeks with a thumb injury in 2016. He came back with a shortened swing.\n\n\u201cI had a little time to really look at what I was doing and be more critical of my technical stuff when I finally came back,\u201d said Simmons, who batted .315 with a .774 on-base-plus-slugging percentage the final three and a half months of the season.\n\nIn the fourth inning on Friday night, Simmons and Gregorius had a chance to catch up at second base after Gregorius hit a blooper just over the head of first baseman Albert Pujols.\n\nSimmons, standing near the bag, told Gregorius he had a bad feeling he was going to get a hit.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t gotten a hit in so long,\u2019\u201d Simmons said, rolling his eyes at the comment from Gregorius, who had been hitless in his previous five at-bats. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re hitting, like, four hundred and seventy thousand.\u2019 He was saying he wasn\u2019t getting any hits.

The point is not that Mr. Hollein isn\u2019t qualified for the post; it\u2019s that so are many others, and his hiring sheds light on the implicit biases of museum culture that continue to inform what being \u201cqualified\u201d means at the Met. In response to criticism of his appointment, Candace Beinecke, a trustee who was a co-leader of the search committee, said, \u201cThe museum\u2019s commitment to diversity is evident in everything we do, and the search was no exception to that.\u201d\n\nThis professed commitment to diversity does not appear to have been put in practice. Mr. Hollein\u2019s appointment brings the total number of white men hired to lead the institution to 10. What\u2019s more, in March, the Met ended its pay-as-you-wish policy for out-of-state visitors, and now requires that New York state residents show some form of identification for free admission. Such a requirement will likely discriminate against minorities or residents who either don\u2019t have legal identification or are reluctant to show it.\n\nMr. Hollein stood out as a candidate because of his prowess as a developer and \u201caggressive fund-raiser,\u201d attractive qualities for a museum in financial turmoil. But the Met\u2019s choice of a director based on those attributes is puzzling because, in the aftermath of Mr. Campbell\u2019s resignation the museum decided to separate artistic and fiscal responsibilities, appointing Daniel Weiss as chief executive and president. Now, instead of taking the opportunity to hire a woman or a person of color \u2014 or both \u2014 the Met has put two white men at top, instead of just one.\n\nAnd Mr. Weiss, it appears, couldn\u2019t be happier to have his mirror image as director. \u201cThe Met\u2019s a big, complicated place, and Max\u2019s area of expertise overlaps with mine quite considerably,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an art historian with an M.B.A., and he\u2019s an art historian with an M.B.A.\u201d\n\nWhile women hold the majority of directorships in smaller museums, only 30 percent of museums with budgets of $15 million or more have female directors. Women are once again seeing the glass ceiling they have been bumping their heads against for decades being reinforced by the Met.

This is Russia, 1983, so we\u2019re talking razors, not lasers. The patient has to stay in near-total darkness. As preludes to adventure go, it\u2019s sufficiently unpromising.\n\nBut over time the narrator \u2014 who may or may not be Tolstaya, I can\u2019t tell \u2014 develops a different kind of vision. She starts seeing episodes from her past, not just images but whole narratives, so precisely and clearly that she has to write them down, even though she\u2019s never written a story in her life. She eventually regains her earthly eyesight, but this new shadow world stays with her: \u201cIt turned out to be a multifaceted underside of so-called reality, a dungeon full of treasure, an aetherial world through the looking glass, a mysterious box with passcodes to all enigmas, an address book with the exact coordinates of those who never existed.\u201d Title drop! The main theme has been sounded.\n\nBut if the stories that follow are more of these aetherial worlds, they\u2019re also about people who are haunted by aetherial worlds \u2014 visions, glimpses of the transcendent, moments when the dull plastic coating of reality peels back to reveal something vastly more precious underneath. These glimpses can come at any moment, in any form: the premonitory ecstasy before an epileptic seizure; a pane of blue glass through which the shades of the dead seem to be visible; a still snowy dawn before the rest of the family is up; a beautiful patio, dreamed of but never built; the ancient mosaic ceiling of a Roman mausoleum, lost in shadow until it is briefly and gloriously illuminated when a tourist drops a coin in a box. There\u2019s no shortage of aether in \u201cAetherial Worlds.\u201d\n\nTolstaya\u2019s stories come both plotted and plotless. There\u2019s a perfectly turned Borgesian tale about a magical window from which one can collect random consumer goods for free (except that they\u2019re not) and a marvelously vivid recollection of Tolstaya\u2019s rambling old family dacha. Tolstaya is well known in Russia as a brilliant and caustic political critic, but her memories of her Soviet childhood have a tender, personal quality, devoid of any ideological ax-grinding. One could reassemble an entire midcentury Russian apartment block out of \u201cAetherial Worlds,\u201d from a characteristic doorbell \u2014 \u201ca flat brass knob the size and shape of half a butterfly\u201d \u2014 to the slow descent of an old-fashioned elevator: \u201cFirst the intestines appear in the elevator\u2019s wrought-iron cage, then the cabin itself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTolstaya is doubly haunted by the past, both by its lostness and by its stubborn refusal to go away. She is blessed, and cursed, with the mystic\u2019s gift of seeing the shades of the departed; she\u2019s visited by, among many others, the memory of an old neighbor whom she used to meet walking his dogs:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you, the names of his dachshunds.

She\u2019s much given to sudden rhetorical gearshifts \u2014 she\u2019ll swerve from a flight of melancholy lyricism straight into a thicket of profanity, shaking off her own eloquence like a bad mood. This sonorous lower register gives voice to her bracing impatience with sentimentality and disingenuousness.

I\u2019ll corner you and eat your brains for breakfast.\u201d\n\nAlthough this is Tolstaya\u2019s first book to be translated into English in 10 years, it could not be said of \u201cAetherial Worlds\u201d that it is all killer, no filler. There\u2019s a Seinfeldian outing on the subject of what-is-the-deal-with-all-those-missing-socks, and another that tackles the pressing question, \u201cWhat if there were no Italy?\u201d There\u2019s an interesting but surely misplaced academic rant about Kazimir Malevich\u2019s painting \u201cThe Black Square.\u201d (It features a cameo by the great Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, who, I should mention somewhere in this review, was Tolstaya\u2019s great granduncle; also, irrelevantly enough, my namesake.) But it\u2019s more than worth sifting through a little dross for the pleasure of seeing the world through the corrective lens of Tolstaya\u2019s vision, which reveals the world as not just a dull accretion of matter but a complex and shifting system of real and unreal realms, populated by beings both visible and invisible, floodlit by flashes of transcendence.", "title": "Are Her Characters Seeing Things?

That may be about to change, and if it does, it will have vast implications for Syria, Lebanon and the whole Middle East.\n\nI\u2019m sure neither side really wants a war. It could be devastating for Israel\u2019s flourishing high-tech economy and for Iran\u2019s already collapsing currency.

{"date": "2018-04-29 00:00:00", "text": "This strategy has produced a string of box office hits, an intensely loyal fan base, and even a surprising number of critical successes. It has also become the envy of Hollywood, with rival studios racing to create their own expanded universes, but often with mixed results (like last year\u2019s abysmal \u201cJustice League\u201d). Other studios have cloned Marvel\u2019s structural attributes \u2014 the pop-culture nostalgia, the serial storytelling, the knowing fan service \u2014 but none have managed to replicate the consistency of its product.\n\nConsider Fox, which, somewhat confusingly, owns the rights to the X-Men and related Marvel superheroes. The X-Men films, which predate the Marvel universe, have varied far more in both quality and originality than their Marvel Studios counterparts: No Marvel movie has been as bad as the 2015 reboot of \u201cFantastic Four.\u201d But no Marvel film has even attempted the elegiac despair of \u201cLogan\u201d or the manic, profane irreverence of \u201cDeadpool,\u201d and it\u2019s hard to imagine that one ever will.\n\nMore than anything else, then, Marvel has succeeded because it has become a kind of quality guarantee, a brand that represents a workshopped and audience-friendly competence. Even the lesser entries among the Marvel-universe films are sturdy and watchable. No Marvel movie has a Rotten Tomatoes score of less than 66 percent; the top nine films have all scored 89 or better.\n\nIn an era where films routinely cost $200 million to produce and just as much to market, this is no small feat for a studio or its viewers. Marvel\u2019s implicit promise is that you can buy a ticket for any of its films and know, with reasonable confidence, that even if the movie isn\u2019t great, it is, at the very least, likely to be pretty good.\n\nThis quality guarantee has given Marvel the latitude to take big-budget risks that more conventional studios might balk at \u2014 and delivered equally large box office payoffs in return: It\u2019s hard to imagine that a $230 million production of something as obscure as \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d with a talking raccoon and living tree in its main cast, could have received a green light without Marvel\u2019s presumption of an audience. And while various producers have attempted to develop a Black Panther film since at least the 1990s, it was Marvel that finally managed to transform it into a mega-budget cinematic reality \u2014 and Marvel\u2019s best-reviewed movie.\n\nYet \u201cBlack Panther\u201d also suggests the inherent limitations of Marvel\u2019s model. The movie was directed by Ryan Coogler, a talented young filmmaker whose two previous films, \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d demonstrated a remarkable gift for emotional nuance and cinematic lyricism. That gift is still on display in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d but in a way that sometimes feels muted and constrained, hemmed in by the broad formulas and expectations of a $200 million superhero movie. Mr. Coogler stitched together a characteristically impressive single-take action scene in the middle of the film, but the climactic battle in Wakanda plays out with the same sort of pixelated weightlessness that is typical of Marvel movies.\n\nTo be clear, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a better-than-average Marvel film. But it\u2019s less a Ryan Coogler movie made under Marvel than a Marvel movie made by Ryan Coogler.\n\nGiven the current state of Hollywood blockbusters, one might be forgiven for assuming that a certain amount of poll-tested blandness is necessary in order to achieve mass appeal.

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "All of those eulogies are true, of course. Wenger\u2019s longevity, as Ferguson highlighted, is an achievement in itself. The loyalty between him and the club \u201cof his heart,\u201d as he has always put it, is increasingly an anachronism in soccer\u2019s age of impatience. It is the end of an era not just for Arsenal, but for the sport as a whole, too, in that sense. There will be no more who do what Wenger did, for as long as he did.\n\nHe did, as others mentioned, shape some of the finest teams England has seen: the one that won the Premier League and F.A. Cup in his first full season, built on the granite defense he had inherited; the Invincibles of Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira in 2004; the team that came within 12 minutes of winning the Champions League in 2006.\n\nIn doing so, he transformed what Arsenal was, how it was seen, across the globe. That is Wenger\u2019s legacy, just as much as the sleek, space-age stadium the club built on the back of his success and the state-of-the-art training facility he helped design: Arsenal had not always been seen as a bastion of taste and style in England, let alone around the world.\n\nHe transformed more than just his club, though. Possibly more than any other manager in history, Wenger changed the nature of English soccer. Not just, as is always trotted out, because he accelerated great leaps forward in nutrition, in conditioning, in hydration, in sports science, in recruitment and, in later years, in analytics, too, but because of something more fundamental: He opened an entire country\u2019s eyes.\n\nPhoto\n\nWenger was only the second foreign manager to be appointed to an English club having never experienced the game on these shores. The first, the Czechoslovak Jozef Venglos, arrived at Aston Villa in 1990 championing similar methods to Wenger\u2019s, and left not long after, his players unable, or unwilling, to adapt.\n\nWenger was greeted by similar skepticism. What does he know of England, he who comes from Japan, as Ferguson \u2014 unwittingly bastardizing Kipling \u2014 almost put it. When Wenger immediately set about recruiting a battalion of French players, he was greeted by a wave of doubters and critics. A year later, he won the title, and then the cup. Wenger proved that foreign managers could cut it in an island obsessed with its own exceptionalism.\n\nIt is for all of that he should be remembered, his unyielding allies and recently converted admirers claimed on Friday, not for these last few years of drift and despair. Those long seasons punctuated by three F.A. Cup wins but dominated by the sight of Arsenal, of Wenger, being overtaken by Chelsea, by Manchester City and, worst of all, by Tottenham Hotspur; of a club first unable to compete in the Champions League and then eliminated from it entirely; of a stadium slowly emptying as fans lost patience and then hope; of a board paralyzed by its awe for an employee; of a man unable to turn away. All of that should be written out of the record, cast into shadow by the searing brightness of what went before.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt does not work like that, of course, nor should it. Wenger\u2019s second act is just as central to his legacy as his first, and the questions of why he could not halt the decline \u2014 why, for so long, he did not seem to notice it, why he kept pursuing the same solution, believing the outcome would be different, why he allowed the final years of his reign to be marked more by sadness than glory \u2014 are just as relevant as how he managed to kick-start the club\u2019s ascent all those years ago.\n\nA few years ago, in one of those many low moments that seemed to prompt a bout of soul-searching in Wenger, he contemplated how he wanted to leave Arsenal for his successor. At the annual meeting of the club\u2019s shareholders, he talked about how he wanted to bequeath a team primed for immediate, continuing success, one in ruder health than ever before.\n\nIt is hard to argue he has achieved that. No matter who replaces him \u2014 and a young, ambitious coach to re-energize a torpid club is the order of the day \u2014 that person will have to rebuild morale, reshape the squad and restore purpose. That job will be more difficult this year than it would have been had Wenger stepped down in, say, 2014.\n\nNor will it be the work of just one man. Perhaps the most eloquent testimony to Wenger\u2019s greatness came not in the words poured out in his honor over the last 24 hours, but in the work Arsenal has been doing to prepare for this day over the last 12 months. Raul Sanllehi has come in from Barcelona as director of football operations. Sven Mislintat, his reputation forged at Borussia Dortmund, is the new chief scout. The legal expert Huss Fahmy was drafted in from cycling\u2019s Team Sky to work on contracts.\n\nBilly Beane, a friend of Wenger\u2019s, has always preached the need not to find like-for-like replacements for players, but to try to replace the aggregate of what they provided. Arsenal has recognized that it will take four people, effectively, to stand in for Wenger.\n\nThat is the highest of praise, but it is also fitting recognition that Wenger was no longer a man of his time: Soccer clubs are now too vast, too complex as organizations, to be overseen by just one person. Wenger was the last of the all-powerful managers; the institution he represented, the way of thinking, is past. That, in part, is why he has been overtaken, why he lost his way.\n\nNone of that means that he should not be given a monthlong valedictory tour not just by Arsenal, but by the country he graced for 22 years, the country he changed, just a little, in his own image.\n\nNor does the fact that he was imperfect, that he stayed on too long, that he departs not with garlands but regrets, mean he does not warrant a statue. In the ancient world, even monuments to the gods contained physical imperfections, a simple metaphor. They are great, and they deserve to be remembered, and cherished, and idolized. But they have their flaws, too, just as we all do.", "title": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger Will Leave Arsenal, Proudly but Imperfectly", "authors": ["Rory Smith", "On Soccer"]}

He described himself as a libertarian, but his passion was directed less at politicians or ideology than at debunking scientific doctrine and preaching apocalyptic prophecy.\n\n\u201cHe was different, fed up with the government not because of some tax increase or a bad vote but because of what they were hiding,\u201d the journalist Jack Dickey wrote in Time magazine in 2013. \u201cWhere others had rage, he had skepticism, and lots of it.\u201d\n\nWith the horror novelist Whitley Strieber, Mr. Bell wrote \u201cThe Coming Global Superstorm\u201d (1999), in which violent climate disruptions lead to a global deep freeze.

He pledges to help advance Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda in Congress. The vice president held a fund-raiser for him at the Trump International Hotel in Washington recently, and Donald Trump Jr. will headline another later this month in New York.\n\nThe race is Mr. Pence\u2019s first for public office, and he has largely avoided attention and scrutiny. But that strategy will be tested as the Republican primary on May 8 approaches. He faces at least one serious challenger, Jonathan Lamb, who has put more than $800,000 of his own money into the race and calls himself a serial entrepreneur. He said Mr. Pence\u2019s run smacked of nepotism.\n\n\u201cNo amount of money in the world can buy the name ID that Pence has,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cBut with name ID, you step on toes.

The elder Mr. Pence\u2019s campaign says he is \u201cready to serve again,\u201d a reference to his enlistment in the Marines in 1979 after he graduated from Loyola University in Chicago.\n\nHe also highlights his business experience, which he said showcased how he cared for his employees, putting their interests ahead of his own. His most prominent position was when he served as president of Kiel Brothers Oil Company from 1998 until 2004.\n\nKiel Brothers was a growing family business in Columbus when its founder, Carl Kiel, asked Edward Pence, the father of Greg and Mike, to join the company in 1965. They sold fuel to service stations, then eventually went into the convenience store business, which grew to more than 200 outlets, primarily in Indiana and Kentucky, mostly under the name Tobacco Road.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWant a smoke, a Coke or a tank of gas? Kiel Brothers Co. is there to serve you,\u201d a company description in Hoover\u2019s said. The company prospered, building a corporate headquarters in Columbus, where it held a place of esteem.\n\nWhen Mr. Pence died in 1988, the Kiel family turned to Greg Pence to join the business. Mr. Pence steadily took on more responsibility until he became president in 1998. With that came other obligations to the company, and he and a younger member of the Kiel family, Theodore, each signed personal guarantees to the local Home Federal Bank to obtain loans to continue to expand.\n\nA year later, Mr. Pence was named to Home Federal\u2019s board of directors. As he was becoming a more prominent member of the Columbus business community, Mike was a rising power in the Republican Party.\n\nMr. Pence signed another guarantee in 2001, records show, promising to repay any outstanding debts from his personal assets if the need arose.\n\nThree years later, it did \u2014 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, facing $100 million in claims from creditors.\n\nAt the next regular board meeting of the bank, with the officials seated around a wooden conference table, Mr. Pence told them about the bankruptcy and said he would not be able to honor his personal guarantee to repay company loans. He acknowledged the obvious conflict of interest, board members said, and resigned from the board.\n\nHe had resigned abruptly from the company as well, leaving the restructuring work to the chief financial officer, David E. Roll, who, bank officials said, worked tirelessly, sometimes until midnight, trying to keep the company afloat. Attempts to reach Mr. Roll were not successful.\n\nLast Monday, in a video on Twitter in which he discussed his views on the economy, Mr. Pence said of his business experience: \u201cYou have to put your employees and customers before yourself. I\u2019ve always done that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is not how former bank and company officials said Mr. Pence acted when it mattered most.

Mr. Pence voluntarily forfeited his KERP when he resigned.\u201d\n\nThe account of Mr. Pence\u2019s actions and the bankruptcy is based on interviews with a half- dozen former bank officials and others with ties to the company, along with a review of hundreds of pages of court records, including in the bankruptcy case. One of the creditors in the case was the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which said that the company had caused $8.4 million in damage to the state.\n\nIn a separate legal action, Mr. Pence also refused several attempts from the bank to collect money based on his personal guarantee, forcing the institution to go to court.\n\nPence campaign officials defended the candidate\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cMr. Pence chose to resign in order to pursue other opportunities,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in response to written questions. \u201cEveryone knows the oil and gas industry changed rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s, and many small, independent companies like Kiel Brothers were not able to survive because of the national consolidation.\u201d\n\nRecords from the Superior Court in Indianapolis show that Home Federal Bank won a $3.8 million civil judgment against Mr. Pence to satisfy the personal guarantees. But former bank officials said he settled the matter for a small fraction of that amount. In contrast, Theodore Kiel lost his primary residence as part of his effort to satisfy his guarantee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Robertson declined to discuss those actions except to say that they were unrelated to bankruptcy court action against the company. Those \u201cpersonal guaranty liens\u201d were \u201creleased after being satisfied,\u201d Mr. Robertson said.\n\nThe Indiana Department of Environmental Management claim against the company was withdrawn after insurance payments and remediation efforts. Mr. Robertson said that Mr. Pence played no role in settling the action brought by the state.\n\nSix months after Mr. Pence resigned from the bankrupt company, the state\u2019s governor at the time, Mitch Daniels, seemed to offer him a lifeline, appointing him deputy commissioner of the same state environmental agency that had sued his company. But Mr. Pence stayed in the job at the agency, known as IDEM, for only two and a half months.\n\n\u201cGovernor-elect Mitch Daniels asked Mr. Pence to help with transition work at IDEM,\u201d Mr. Robertson said, later adding, \u201cThere was never a discussion how long Mr. Pence would stay.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence and his wife now own two antique malls in southern Indiana, valued at between $5 million and $25 million, according to financial disclosure statements he filed with the House in January.\n\nMr. Lamb, his opponent in the primary, said he could draw a sharp contrast between his business success and Mr. Pence\u2019s record. \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur and have had success,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cHe was handed a very large corporation that he ran into the ground.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Pence\u2019s business record may become one focus of the campaign, his hearty endorsement of the Trump agenda could provide another.\n\nColumbus is a rare Rust Belt town that continues to have a thriving manufacturing economy, with an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent.

In an interview with NY1 last week, Mr. Carranza called the decision to refuse to take the tests an \u201cextreme reaction,\u201d and seemed to echo many of the sentiments of the test\u2019s supporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, unless you\u2019re able to assess, where students are in the mastery of information,\u201d he said.\n\nThat is the same position taken by his predecessor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a.

As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.\n\nBut the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.\n\nBut Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump.

Villaraigosa, the former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and Assembly speaker, both Democrats. The two are known as effective public speakers with extensive political experience that could prove important in navigating the fight against Washington.\n\nOf the two, Mr. Newsom has assumed the more aggressive stance in taking on the Trump administration, drawing strong support from liberal Democrats in the process. He has also called for the impeachment of Mr. Trump. A centerpiece of his campaign is a pledge to adopt a government-run, single-payer health care system, a direct challenge to the free-market vision embraced by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Newsom told cheering delegates at the state Democratic convention here this year. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats acting like Democrats in a battle for America\u2019s soul against a president without one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the defeatist Democrats are saying we just want to defend against the status quo,\u201d he told another audience that day. \u201cHow can you just defend against the status quo? We need to do more than just push back against their agenda to wreak more havoc.\u201d\n\nMr. Villaraigosa has struck a more restrained note, saying it was too early to talk about impeachment and dismissing Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise to have California go it alone with its own health care system as a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d promise he was making to ride anti-Trump sentiment. In tone, Mr. Villaraigosa is closer to Mr. Brown in positioning himself against the president.\n\n\u201cGavin likes to talk about the resistance \u2014 I don\u2019t use that word,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said over green tea during a break from campaigning in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cI tell people the best way to resist is not to text and tweet, scream and yell at Donald Trump. The best way to resist is for us to chart a different path here in this state.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe are going to push back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of our attention, most of our efforts need to be focused on improving the human condition here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRobert Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said the divisions on health care and impeachment reflected discussions Democrats were having nationally as they debated the best way to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s stance reflects the calculation that while California is overwhelmingly Democratic in its voting habits, many voters are independent by registration, and thus might be less receptive to an overly confrontational position against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cNewsom is endorsing all of those things on the Democratic wish list,\u201d Mr. Shrum said. \u201cVillaraigosa is saying, \u2018I like those things, but we actually can\u2019t do them.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne position speaks to the anger in the base,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other speaks to what I think Democratic leadership in Congress prefers.\u201d\n\nUnder California\u2019s election system, 27 candidates will appear on a primary ballot on June 5, regardless of party. A runoff in November will be held between the top two finishers.\n\nWhile polls suggest the November contest will be between Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Newsom, the dynamics of a multicandidate field can make it difficult to predict who might finish in the top. John Chiang, a Democrat and the state treasurer, and John H. Cox, a Republican businessman, also appear to be in position to capture a spot on the November ballot, according to some polls.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd Delaine Eastin, a Democrat and the former state superintendent of public education, has drawn vocal support from the left with her own call for single-payer health care and the impeachment of Mr. Trump.\n\nIf the November election ends up being between Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Newsom, it will be a classic north-versus-south contest.

He is running when the ever-growing Latino community accounts for nearly 40 percent of the population and when California is battling with the administration over restrictive immigration policies.\n\nMr. Newsom, 50, has made a single-payer government-run health care system for California a central plank of his campaign as he has sought to ride the anti-Trump sentiment that is surging in Democratic circles here, including within the powerful nurses\u2019 union. \u201cIt is a litmus test for our endorsement,\u201d said Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of the California Nurses Association. \u201cGavin passes it with flying colors.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and his pledge to continue doing so, mean that health care will most likely be another challenge for the next governor, whether or not California carries out single-payer.\n\n\u201cIf our health care system is thrown into absolute chaos because of what happens in Washington, the voters in California are going to expect the Democrats who control California to deal with it,\u201d said Garry South, a longtime Democratic consultant who advises the nurses\u2019 union.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf Mr. Newsom won and made good on that campaign promise, he would open a up a whole new area of contention with Mr. Trump. Single-payer health care is likely to require waivers from the Trump administration in order to apply Medicare payments to financing a potentially $400 billion program, along with substantial tax increases.\n\nMr. Villaraigosa, 65, said he supported the concept of single-payer health care, but dismissed Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise as unrealistic.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s arguing with bold leadership we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 even though he knows you need Trump\u2019s waivers to do it,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cThey are not going to give us the waivers for that. Think about this: You ready to double your taxes? Nobody is going to do that. Everyone is for it until they realize \u2014 whoa. The cost. \u201d\n\nMr. Chiang said he, too, supported a state health care system. \u201cI just think Gavin Newsom should be forthcoming on how they are going to pay for it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Newsom dismissed his critics as \u201cdefeatist Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a jaw-dropping thing: to say you support something but it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in an interview a few blocks from his office in Sacramento. \u201cWho the hell is interested in \u2018it can\u2019t be done\u2019? We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality if I had listened to \u2018it can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked what his plan was to pay for it, Mr. Newsom responded: \u201cThe one that works is the one I support. I\u2019m not an ideologue.\u201d\n\nStill, the biggest question may well be whether anyone will be able to replace Mr. Brown as California\u2019s counterpoint to Mr. Trump \u2014 and whether the state\u2019s stature as a national leader in this fight will diminish when Mr. Brown retires to his ranch next January.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is usually the leading edge,\u201d said Ms. Eastin, one of the Democrats seeking to replace him. \u201cIt\u2019s the sixth-largest economy in the world.

But America\u2019s regional allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and its partners in Syria, dread it.\n\nThey argue that American forces are still needed to provide a check on Russia, which considers Syria its strategic foothold in the Middle East, and Iran, whose proxies are building a military infrastructure in Syria to counter Israel.\n\nA withdrawal could also leave the door open for the return of the Islamic State in some parts of Syria, the very reason the United States gave for intervening in the country to begin with.\n\nThe bombing that Mr. Trump was responding to was part of a battle between rebels and the Syrian government, one that the United States had withdrawn from long ago, in a part of the country where the United States has neither a military presence nor any clear allies.\n\nThere is nothing to stop Mr. Trump from ordering a missile strike on western Syria, where the chemical attack was alleged to have taken place, and still pulling the approximately 2,000 American troops out of eastern Syria, where their main task was battling the militants of the Islamic State.

He took much of the credit for the diplomatic thaw on the Korean Peninsula, and he said he would not commit the mistakes of his predecessors, whom he said had showered the North with money and extracted nothing in return.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader,\u201d Mr. Trump said after meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be played, O.K.? We\u2019re going to hopefully make a deal; if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump reiterated that he was prepared to cancel the meeting, or walk out in the middle of it, if his diplomatic efforts were not making any headway. But some of his aides say privately they worry that the president, with an eye on the history books and a flair for the theatrical, is determined to emerge with a victory, even if it falls short of his stated goals.\n\nCertainly, he seemed beguiled by the imagery of the Moon-Kim meeting. \u201cKOREAN WAR TO END!\u201d he tweeted before 7 a.m. on Friday, a few hours after the leaders shook hands in the Demilitarized Zone.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump said he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with Mr. Moon. \u201cThings are going well,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTime and location of meeting with North Korea is being set.\u201d Later, at a rally in Michigan, Mr. Trump told supporters that he deserved virtually all the credit for the success of the meeting between the North and the South.\n\nThe price of failure would be high for Mr. Trump. The United States could face a split with its ally South Korea, which is deeply invested in ending its estrangement from the North. Tensions could flare with China, North Korea\u2019s main trading partner, which only grudgingly signed on to the sanctions and would be likely to balk at keeping them in place if Mr. Kim is talking about peace.\n\nMr. Trump is also moving on other fronts that could undercut his negotiations with Mr. Kim. He appears more likely than ever to rip up the Iran nuclear deal as he faces his next deadline of May 12 to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWalking away from one nuclear disarmament deal while trying to strike another would be a trick, even for a self-proclaimed dealmaker like Mr. Trump.\n\nThere is little question, senior officials and analysts said, that the American-led sanctions, combined with Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose vows to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea if it threatened the American homeland, helped bring Mr. Kim to the table.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is only one of three actors in this drama, and perhaps not the most crucial one. Mr. Moon, a progressive former human rights lawyer, ran for office on a platform of conciliation with the North and has moved aggressively to deliver on that promise. He, not Mr. Trump, has set the pace and terms of the negotiation with the North, though American officials say that Seoul is closely coordinating with Washington.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Skeptical analysts said the advancements in North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program \u2014 as much as sanctions or threatened military strikes \u2014 made the timing right for an overture. Others say he is replaying the cycle of provocation and conciliation pioneered by his father and grandfather.\n\nWhatever his motives, the 34-year-old dictator has proved to be a remarkably adroit player on the world stage. \u201cIf anyone gets credit, it\u2019s Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs who is now at the Asia Society. \u201cIt\u2019s his show.\u201d\n\nSo far, Mr. Kim\u2019s bet has paid off handsomely. Since beginning his overture a month before the Winter Olympics in South Korea, he has been awarded a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, who had earlier treated him with thinly disguised contempt. He was welcomed by Mr. Moon with a South Korean honor guard. And he is on the verge of something once inconceivable: a meeting with the American president.\n\nThough Mr. Kim made gestures of his own \u2014 a pledge not to test bombs or long-range missiles, and an end to the North\u2019s longtime insistence that American troops withdraw from the peninsula \u2014 he has not made any tangible concessions on his nuclear weapons. The language in his joint statement with Mr. Moon about denuclearization was both vague and familiar to veterans of past negotiations with North Korea.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotten all these meetings with world leaders without making any concessions,\u201d said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. \u201cSo far, everything has been no-cost for Kim.\u201d\n\nGiven the warmth of the Moon-Kim meeting, few analysts are predicting that Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim will be sour. The most likely situation is an encounter that produces more riveting imagery and results in a broad agreement to negotiate disarmament in return for an easing of North Korea\u2019s economic isolation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump said the meeting location had been narrowed to two or three sites. Officials had hoped to have already locked down a place, but said the process was more complicated than expected. Singapore and Mongolia have emerged as prime candidates, though an official said a site in South Korea remained a possibility.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Trump will be embarking on a protracted negotiation with Mr. Kim that, if the past is any guide, will quickly bog down in highly technical discussions about inspections of nuclear sites, the dismantling of installations and the removal of nuclear fuel.\n\nSome question whether Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish new national security team \u2014 led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton \u2014 will have the stomach for that. Others note that Mr. Trump may face pressure on the right if it looks as though North Korea is playing for time, as it did during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\n\nWith the North seeking to re-establish diplomatic and economic ties to the South, Mr. Trump will find it difficult to play the cards he used during his first year in office. Some analysts said Mr. Kim\u2019s outreach to Mr. Moon amounted to a kind of insurance policy against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt becomes awfully hard for Trump to return to the locked-and-loaded, \u2018fire and fury\u2019 phase of the relationship,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAdministration officials acknowledged the risk that Mr. Trump could find himself out of sync with Mr. Moon. They said their job was to remind the president of the proper sequence of negotiations with North Korea: tangible steps toward denuclearization, followed by an easing of sanctions, and then a peace treaty.\n\nAs always, though, the wild card is Mr. Trump himself.\n\n\u201cHe sees this as a Nixon-in-China moment, and he will want to move quickly, where patience is the order of the day,\u201d said Kurt M.

But you can set out to find duos who make viewers say, \u2018Relationship goals!\u2019 or \u2018Hey, I talk to my brother like that.\u2019 Viewers like to see their own relationships reflected in the talent.\u201d\n\nMany of those viewers are enjoying the network in twos. \u201cThe fact is, our viewers are duos themselves,\u201d said Kathleen Finch, the chief lifestyle brands officer for Discovery Inc., which owns HGTV. \u201cWhat we hear is, \u2018My husband and I sit on the couch together and watch.\u2019\u201d\n\nHGTV is so focused on finding talent that reflects that audience, it sometimes lets the couch couples cross through the screen. Three years ago, Dave and Chenoa Rivera \u2014 who left their tourism and medical sales jobs to start renovating properties in Paradise, Calif. \u2014 were two of the viewers Ms. Finch describes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe had been watching \u2018Flip or Flop,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Hey, we do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rivera said by phone.\n\nShe sent HGTV\u2019s casting inbox an email that described the renovations projects she and Mr. Rivera collaborate on and included their family Christmas photo. A year later, she heard from a producer. The Riveras shot a pilot and eventually got a series greenlight. Their show, \u201cRustic Rehab,\u201d which has its premiere on April 26, paints them as savvy and down-to-earth, can-do hustlers in a woodsy corner of California.\n\nConceptually, \u201cRehab\u201d follows the blueprint of \u201cFlip or Flop,\u201d the franchise that has become HGTV\u2019s go-to format for breaking couple talent. Network executives are especially excited about two in particular: \u201cFlip or Flop Vegas,\u201d with the mixed martial arts fighter Bristol Marunde and his Realtor wife, Aubrey; and \u201cFlip or Flop Nashville,\u201d with the former N.F.L. player DeRon Jenkins and Page Turner, a real estate broker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBristol and Aubrey\u2019s projects all have this fun, blingy vibe,\u201d Ms. Finch said. \u201cDeRon and Page are exes, which adds this sweet element to the show: They\u2019ll roll their eyes at things and say, \u2018And that\u2019s why we\u2019re not together anymore.\u2019\u201d The shows\u2019 initial seasons have averaged around 1.2 million viewers per episode.

The El Moussas drew \u201cthrough-the-roof, gangbusters\u201d numbers for HGTV, according to Ms. Finch; their return to the network will probably do even better. That\u2019s because the El Moussas have divorced \u2014 proving, in the process, how heavily invested their fans were in their personal lives. A $13.99 all-HGTV edition of \u201cPeople\u201d currently on newsstands dedicates eight pages to the former couple, calling them \u201cdevoted to their kids \u2014 and their hit show\u201d and chronicling Ms. El Moussa\u2019s post-divorce dating life.\n\nThe magazine is more evidence that the network\u2019s duos have blown past the traditional star potential of home-television talent. (\u201cIt\u2019s like the Tiger Beat of HGTV!\u201d Ms. Finch said.)\n\nBut HGTV stars need more than chemistry and interesting personal lives: They have to actually know their way around a hammer, or at least look and sound as if they do on television.\n\nWhich leads to hires like the mellow, Pittsburgh-based Leanne and Steve Ford, of \u201cRestored by the Fords.\u201d The siblings have been at their respective trades for years \u2014 hers in design, his in construction \u2014 and their signature style skews more modern and minimal than the typical HGTV aesthetic.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRestored by the Fords\u201d debuted in January and has averaged nearly 1.7 million viewers per episode (it is HGTV\u2019s best-rated new program this year among viewers 25 to 54).

On her show, she and her husband, Ben, renovate homes in Laurel, Miss., where they grew up. In its second season, \u201cHome Town\u201d was watched by an average of 1.5 million viewers per episode \u2014 the fame that has followed has made Laurel feel somehow even smaller to Ms. Napier.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI am an introvert,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cI get anxious when people who don\u2019t know me want to talk at the grocery store.\u201d\n\nMr. Napier, a woodworker, was nearby with their 3-month-old daughter, Helen. \u201cPeople are spending their spring breaks in Laurel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me that 10 years ago, I\u2019d have laughed.\u201d (He might have taken a lesson from the trajectory of the Gaineses, who have brought more tourists to Waco \u2014 the vacation rentals they own sometimes sell out up to a year in advance.) In Laurel, \u201cHome Town\u201d fans shop for goods inspired by the show at the Napiers\u2019 Front Street boutique, Laurel Mercantile Co., and cruise past the couple\u2019s 1920s Craftsman home.\n\n\u201cI was planting flowers on my front porch earlier today,\u201d Ms. Napier said. \u201cAbout 15 tourists drove by and filmed me doing it.\u201d\n\nSuch anecdotes hint at why HGTV\u2019s duos have become so popular \u2014 and crucial to the network\u2019s success. They blur the line between fame and regular life, talking on TV the way you imagine they would if you invited them to dinner.\n\nBut Ms. Napier suspects there\u2019s something more subtle drawing people to her show and her street. \u201cHome Town\u201d \u2014 like many HGTV shows \u2014 celebrates common experiences that other types of TV ignore or mock: married life, modest budgets, settling down in the place where you grew up.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager, I thought I was going to go work in publishing in New York,\u201d Ms. Napier said. \u201cBut once I left Laurel, I realized how special it was.

I\u2019ve been interested in the limitations of human \u2014 or in the case of \u201cWestworld,\u201d not-human \u2014 perception. The way that we see the world and the way that our biases and our hangups and our flaws impact the way that we see this world. So with this project, we were interested in the ways that an artificial mind would perceive the world differently. Memory, which is something Lisa and I have long been fascinated by, and the clarity of memory felt like a really interesting thing to play with, and the story followed from that. We had initially turned it down because I couldn\u2019t see past the \u201cFantasy Island\u201d version of it, like we\u2019d have different guests each week and the hosts would help through their relationship problems. [Laughs.] But Lisa saw it very clearly. She said to me one night when we were having dinner and talking about it: \u201cGod, this is everything that we think about and talk about. Everything that we\u2019re interested in right now in one show.\u201d\n\nLISA JOY We\u2019re in this really lovely creative moment right now where people aren\u2019t holding themselves back anymore and saying, \u201cWell, this is the genre or this is the world that I\u2019m working in, so I can\u2019t step outside of this box.\u201d Previously, you might have thought that this should just be a kind of horror film, or a dystopian thing where robots chase humans around. And now as tastes evolve, as TV evolves, you can do an episode that has an amazing fight scene but also a scene that poses legitimate philosophical questions and also contains character elements that speak to the most simple and enduring elements of the human condition.\n\nThere\u2019s been about 17 months or so between seasons. What were you doing over that time? Do you worry about situating people in the story after so much time away without their heads swimming?\n\nNOLAN I think a little head-swimming is not a bad thing. For \u201cWestworld,\u201d Lisa and I go through three distinct phases. We write \u2014 or rather, we pull together a writers\u2019 room and we plot it out. The original film is packed with cool ideas, but there isn\u2019t really a single shared character between the film and our series. We had to build the world out from the ground up, so that means we spend six months thinking and writing. Then we turn our attention \u2014 Lisa and I both direct on the show \u2014 to the production. Then we turn our attention to the editing phase. The short version is we definitely didn\u2019t get a vacation in between the two seasons.\n\nA common theme in reviews of the second season is that the show feels more fun now that the hosts have busted out. Do you feel that, too?\n\nJOY For us, the show needs to go and follow the tone that logically extends from where our characters are at. Season 1 ended with a bang, and Season 2 picks up where that ended, and you see the hosts finally getting to be free, to slowly start liberating themselves and fighting back. That\u2019s going to be exhilarating because we\u2019ve been rooting for them for so long, but power always comes with its own complexities, and just because you have agency doesn\u2019t yet mean that you\u2019re going to be free from trouble or that you will know exactly who you want to be.

About a year before Ms. Judd was in contention for the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d role, Mr. Weinstein had her meet him in a hotel room in Beverly Hills \u2014 under the guise of discussing business \u2014 where he appeared in a bathrobe and, among other things, asked her to submit to a massage and watch him shower, the complaint said. Ms. Judd had previously recounted the episode in an interview with The New York Times published last October.\n\n\u201cWeinstein\u2019s wrongful and outrageous conduct has not just deprived Ms. Judd of the specific opportunity to play a prominent role in a blockbuster film trilogy; it has had a long-lasting ripple effect on her whole career,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cNo person \u2014 in whatever job, in whatever industry \u2014 should have to forfeit professional aspirations and the right to earn a living to the abusive whims of the powerful.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In December, when Mr. Jackson told a publication in New Zealand that Mr. Weinstein had told him not to cast Ms. Judd or Mira Sorvino, Mr. Weinstein said in a statement that he had \u201cno input into the casting whatsoever.\u201d (Ms. Sorvino has also accused Mr. Weinstein of harassment.) Although the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies were started at Miramax, a boutique studio run by Mr. Weinstein and then owned by Disney, the project moved to New Line Cinema before filming began.\n\nMr. Jackson rejected Mr. Weinstein\u2019s denial in subsequent public comments in December, saying that his creative partner on the films, Fran Walsh, \u201cremembers these negative comments about Ashley and Mira as clearly as I do.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Ms. Judd on Monday laid out a pattern of retaliatory behavior by Mr. Weinstein against actresses who rebuffed his sexual advances \u2014 what California courts have described as \u201cme too\u201d evidence in employment cases. Ms. Sorvino is cited as one example.\n\n\u201cWeinstein made false statements of fact about Ms. Sorvino to others in the film industry to punish her and damage her career,\u201d the suit said. \u201cThese comments included, but were not limited to, statements made to Mr. Jackson and Ms. Walsh in a private business meeting that Ms. Sorvino was \u2018a nightmare to work with.\u2019\u201d Ms. Sorvino told The New Yorker in October that Mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and \u201cchased her around\u201d a hotel room at a film festival in 1995.\n\nAnother example cited by Ms. Judd involved Annabella Sciorra, who has said that Mr. Weinstein raped her in the 1990s. \u201cShe believes she did not work from 1992 to 1995 because the \u2018Harvey machine\u2019 spread a baseless rumor that she was \u2018difficult,\u2019\u201d the complaint said of Ms. Sciorra. Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied ever engaging in \u201cnonconsensual sex.\u201d\n\nThe case adds to already formidable legal entanglements for Mr. Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful producers before dozens of women \u2014 led by Ms. Judd, Rose McGowan, Rosanna Arquette and others \u2014 came forward last fall with allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nProsecutors in New York, Los Angeles and London are now pursuing possible criminal cases against him. Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, is suing Mr. Weinstein and his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, for repeatedly violating state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. Mr. Weinstein also faces additional civil suits, including one filed by Kadian Noble, a British actress who is suing him for sex trafficking.\n\nAmid these investigations, the Weinstein Company has toppled into bankruptcy. Bids for the movie and television studio\u2019s assets were due on Monday, with an auction scheduled for later in the week should competing offers emerge.\n\nIn a statement on Monday afternoon, Mr. Schneiderman pressed bidders to propose \u201cenhancements that set aside financial resources to compensate and provide support services for injured employees and industry talent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added, \u201cBid enhancements also should include nonmonetary terms that protect future employees and contractors and avoid rewarding wrongdoers.\u201d", "title": "Ashley Judd Sues Harvey Weinstein, Saying He Harmed Her Career", "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"]}

Until 1987, the island was under brutal martial law, controlled by the dictator Chiang Kai-shek, who had fled the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, and later his son.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s freedoms were hard-won. Last Saturday, Taiwan marked Freedom of Speech Day on the 29th anniversary of the death of the free-speech advocate Deng Nan-jung, who burned himself to death as the police prepared to storm his office and arrest him for publishing a revised constitution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Deng\u2019s death prompted large protests that helped set the island toward democratic government and greater freedoms.\n\nC\u00e9dric Alviani, the Taipei bureau director of Reporters Without Borders, said Taiwan has since become an \u201cisland of stability\u201d in a region where press freedoms were backsliding. \u201cFreedom of expression is a big part of Taiwanese culture,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Mr. Deng\u2019s widow, Yeh Chu-lan, warned that Taiwan\u2019s freedoms were not guaranteed. \u201cWe could lose our freedom of expression anytime in the face of Chinese hegemony,\u201d she said.\n\nHong Kong has seemed a cautionary tale of Beijing\u2019s interference.

Some Chinese say it is also getting harder for mainland activists to enter Taiwan to attend workshops or conferences.\n\nPhoto\n\nZhao Sile, a Chinese journalist and author who writes about civil society in China, said Chinese activists have told her that it has become more difficult in the past two years to obtain visas from Taiwan.\n\nMs. Zhao, now in Taipei as a guest of National Chung Cheng University, said in an interview that she knew of multiple cases in which nongovernment groups or universities that invited a Chinese participant used medical visas as a workaround. The visas, which are easier to obtain than normal visas, are intended for medical tourists coming to Taiwan for plastic surgery.\n\nAccustomed to free speech at home, Taiwanese are also running afoul of the authorities in China and even Hong Kong.\n\nLast year, China made an example of one Taiwanese activist, Lee Ming-cheh, who was detained upon entering China. After being held incommunicado for months, he gave what appeared to be a forced confession before being sentenced to five years in prison for state subversion.\n\nThe case has had a chilling effect in Taiwan because the court used as evidence postings that Mr. Lee had made on social media while in Taiwan.\n\nIn November, the Taiwanese filmmaker Kevin H. J. Lee said he was denied a visa to Hong Kong. He thinks it was because of his new documentary, \u201cSelf-Censorship,\u201d which was released last month. Mr. Lee believes the authorities in Hong Kong or China acted to prevent his entry after seeing his crowdfunding page, which included a trailer that was partly filmed in Hong Kong.\n\nIn March, a group of Hong Kong university students contacted Mr. Lee to ask if he would be willing to speak with them from Taiwan after a showing of his film.

More research and original data is being posted publicly online, and a new generation of science ambassadors \u2014 in the tradition of Mythbusters or Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan \u2014 has found a large audience on social media. But they face a conundrum: the platforms that help get their message out sometimes favor a style that inflames as much as it informs.\n\nScience enthusiasts have built enormous audiences online not only because they appeal to human curiosity, but also because they have a flair for entertainment.\n\nMichael Stevens, whose YouTube channel Vsauce often explores psychology, has described how he packages his videos to reach the biggest audience and has bragged that he could even make paint drying interesting.

In her view, snark or cheeky videos are not the problem: If people are really committed to a piece of pseudoscience, a video from someone like Mr. Zozaya will not convince them otherwise, no matter how respectful.

Instead, Mr. Pruitt chose to stay \u201cat more expensive hotels with fewer standard security resources,\u201d while bringing along his own security team \u201cat taxpayer expense.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mr. Perrotta played a central role in approving Mr. Pruitt\u2019s regular use of first-class flights, and has often joined him in first class, including during the trip to Italy last June, for which travel costs totaled at least $120,000, according to public records. And when Mr. Pruitt wanted a secure place to make sensitive phone calls, Mr. Perrotta pushed for the construction of a $43,000 surveillance-proof booth in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office in Washington, over the objections of colleagues who had advocated a less expensive option. Mr. Perrotta also pressed, unsuccessfully, for a bulletproof vehicle for Mr. Pruitt and a bulletproof desk for his security detail.\n\nFrom the time Mr. Pruitt arrived at the E.P.A., the Trump transition team requested increased security for him, suggesting that safety was a concern. But as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s security measures and requests have grown over the past year, various internal reviews at the E.P.A. have questioned the need.\n\nMr. Perrotta, who joined the Secret Service in 1995 and moved to the E.P.A. in 2004, declined requests for comment left at his office at the E.P.A. and at his security consulting firm, Sequoia Security Group. An E.P.A. spokesman defended the heightened security measures, repeating previous E.P.A. assertions that Mr. Pruitt \u201chas faced an unprecedented amount of death threats\u201d and that \u201cmembers of the president\u2019s cabinet should be kept safe from these violent threats.\u201d\n\nA native New Yorker, Mr. Perrotta, 50, made a name for himself in the mid-1990s when he worked for the Bronx district attorney, investigating gambling and loan-sharking activities of the Gambino crime family, and then later helping efforts that led to the arrest and conviction of John Gotti, the longtime boss of the Gambino family.\n\nPhoto\n\nLongtime E.P.A. employees described Mr. Perrotta as a backslapper and a fast-talker who enjoys talking about his mob-busting days and has given the impression that he chafed under the leadership of others.\n\nSince taking over the protective detail weeks after Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation in February 2017, Mr. Perrotta has cheekily referred to himself as the agency\u2019s sheriff and has whistled the distinctive tune made famous by the Western film \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\u201d said two E.P.A. officials who worked with Mr. Perrotta.

The measures he advocated in the name of security provided Mr. Pruitt with perks more commonly associated with heads of state, and often came over the objections of top agency officials. Some of them complained that Mr. Perrotta was playing fast and loose with the rules, but that he could not be challenged because he was thought to have Mr. Pruitt\u2019s blessing.\n\nErcole Gaudioso, a former New York Organized Crime Task Force investigator who worked the Gotti case with Mr. Perrotta, says he thinks his former junior partner, with whom he keeps in contact, may find the work of protecting a cabinet secretary boring by comparison.\n\n\u201cHe was the guy who wanted to be out fighting the bad guy all the time,\u201d Mr. Gaudioso said.\n\nIn a self-published 2016 book detailing his work in law enforcement, Mr. Perrotta acknowledged skirmishes during his career, particularly in its early days.\n\n\u201cIt often appeared to me that my fellow agents and supervisors did not quite get me, my motivations and authenticity often maligned and misunderstood,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have come to accept that I contributed to this misconception and false labeling in part because of my high level of energy.\u201d\n\nMr. Perrotta became Mr. Pruitt\u2019s security chief after the administrator removed Eric Weese, a special agent who had a reputation, even before Mr. Pruitt\u2019s arrival, for closely following agency rules, even if it might mean standing up to political appointees, according to Fred Burnside, who led the E.P.A.\u2019s criminal enforcement division from 2008 to 2010.\n\n\u201cWe always encouraged anyone to speak up if they disagree with the direction of the organization,\u201d Mr. Burnside said.\n\nMr. Weese had denied Mr. Pruitt\u2019s requests to use lights and sirens when being driven in his agency-issued vehicle to restaurants and airports, and also made it clear he would be opposed to signing off on security waivers to allow Mr. Pruitt to fly in first class.\n\nMr. Perrotta not only indulged those requests, but also quickly moved to restrict access to Mr. Pruitt, making his office and the rest of that floor of the E.P.A. headquarters off-limits to anyone who was not on a list drawn up by Mr. Perrotta, said Ronald Slotkin, former director of the agency\u2019s multimedia office.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe used to be friends,\u201d Mr. Slotkin said, referring to Mr. Perrotta.

Mr. Perrotta, instead, turned to Mr. Steinmetz, a vice president at the security firm that Mr. Perrotta founded in 2013 and continues to work for even while on the E.P.A. payroll.

The E.P.A. did not respond to a question about whether the sweep turned up anything. But Mr. Steinmetz suggested it had been necessary because \u201cthere are people there working behind the scenes doing anything they can to cause embarrassment for this administrator,\u201d including, he said, \u201choldovers from the previous administration.\u201d\n\nThe sweep, conducted within weeks of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s taking office in February 2017, inflamed tensions between Mr. Perrotta and the agency\u2019s homeland security office, where officials were increasingly \u2014 and openly \u2014 skeptical of the expensive security demands.\n\nThings got so heated that a scuffle broke out during a meeting last summer of the agency\u2019s top security and administrative staff, according to attendees. They said that Mr. Perrotta traded expletives with Mario Caraballo, who until recently served as the deputy associate administrator of the homeland security office, and that the two men had to be physically separated.\n\nFrictions persisted as Mr. Perrotta worked to consolidate power within the security detail, giving his team a top role in evaluating threats against Mr. Pruitt and determining the financial resources needed to combat them.\n\nOne part-time member of the security detail, John C. Martin, was removed when it was discovered that his cellphone had an application that allowed him to communicate confidentially, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The application was discovered after the E.P.A. did an audit of government-issued mobile devices, looking for secure applications such as Signal and WhatsApp, which could be used to communicate with members of the media, as well as for legitimate government work. Mr. Martin had raised questions internally about the bug-sweeping contract and the security booth, agency officials said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Perrotta later instructed Kevin Chmielewski, a Trump administration political appointee who had served as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy chief of staff, to confiscate Mr. Martin\u2019s gun and badge, according to agency officials. Mr. Chmielewski later told associates that he regretted carrying out Mr. Perrotta\u2019s instructions, which he came to believe were retaliatory.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Perrotta also retained more than a dozen private security guards for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s trip to Italy, a decision that would typically be made by the agency\u2019s homeland security office and the State Department.\n\nAccording to an E.P.A. official who was involved in the trip, Mr. Perrotta and the security guards attended a five-course meal at a Rome restaurant with Mr. Pruitt and his staff, a rarity for security personnel, who usually do not dine with those they protect.\n\nOfficials from the E.P.A.\u2019s homeland security office, under Mr. Caraballo, questioned the need for all of the additional security expenses. \u201cEPA Intelligence has not identified any specific credible direct threat to the E.P.A. administrator,\u201d a memo from Mr. Caraballo\u2019s office said in February.\n\nAfter excerpts from the memo were made public by two Democrats in the Senate this week, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s staff confirmed that Mr. Caraballo had been removed from his job. He is one of several career officials who have been reassigned or removed after challenging Mr. Perrotta\u2019s implementation of enhanced security measures for Mr. Pruitt. Even political appointees have not been immune.\n\nAfter months of objecting to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s security spending, Mr. Chmielewski, who had been among the first employees of Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was asked to surrender his credentials, electronic security card and parking pass to one of Mr. Perrotta\u2019s agents late one night in the agency\u2019s parking lot.\n\nMr. Chmielewski refused, got in his car and began driving to his family\u2019s home in Maryland, at which point he got a call from Mr. Perrotta, according to an administration official briefed on the exchange and the letter sent Thursday by Democrats in Congress. If Mr. Chmielewski did not immediately return to the E.P.A. to surrender his credentials, security card and parking pass, Mr. Perrotta said he would drive to Mr. Chmielewski\u2019s home that night and personally retrieve them.\n\nMr. Chmielewski reported the exchange, which he characterized as a threat, to the White House and to the E.P.A.\u2019s internal affairs and criminal investigative divisions. Mr. Chmielewski, Mr. Martin and others who have crossed Mr. Perrotta have told associates that they are concerned Mr. Perrotta will not be held to account by the inspector general.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven after Mr. Perrotta\u2019s colleagues raised concerns about his oversight of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s security, Mr. Perrotta and the assistant inspector general who oversees investigation, Patrick Sullivan, have been spotted drinking beers together at Elephant and Castle, a bar across the street from the E.P.A. headquarters. The men were both with the Secret Service before coming to the E.P.A. Mr. Perrotta initially worked in the inspector general\u2019s office when he arrived at the agency, and moved to the security detail late in George W.

Mossie!,\u201d he cried out to the director in the darkened orchestra, stepping into the footlights. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to open tonight \u2014 and I may never open.\u201d\n\nAmong the backstage witnesses to that piece of theater history: Jerry Adler, now 87, who was an assistant stage manager. \u201cHe flung his hat into the orchestra and stormed off to his dressing room, slamming the door behind him,\u201d Mr. Adler recalled recently.\n\n\u201cHe was terrified,\u201d added Mr. Adler, now best known as a late-in-life actor (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d). \u201cWe were opening that night and we hadn\u2019t been through the second act yet.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Mr. Adler remembers it, Harrison\u2019s British valet emerged from his dressing room to make a formal announcement: \u201cMr. Harrison would like to see Mr. Hart.\u201d\n\nMr. Adler went on: \u201cThe rest of us were all standing around, like, what do we do now? So we did a little rehearsal of the next scene, which was \u2018A Little Bit of Luck\u2019 with Stanley Holloway.\n\n\u201cEverything was fine and great with that number,\u201d he added. \u201cFinally, Moss came out and told us to release the cast for the day.\u201d\n\nThe creative team scurried in and out of Harrison\u2019s dressing room to urge the star to change his mind.\n\nFinally, an emergency telephone call was placed to Maurice H. Bailey, who ran the Shubert and was playing bridge at the local country club, according to Edith Goodmaster, his executive secretary at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bailey rushed to the theater, remembered Ms. Goodmaster, 87, and told Harrison that if he didn\u2019t perform that night, Mr. Bailey would go onstage and tell the audience of the actor\u2019s refusal.\n\nHarrison\u2019s manager \u201cturned white,\u201d Ms. Goodmaster said, adding: \u201cMr. Bailey later told me that he would never have gone through with the threat. He was bluffing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Mr. Bailey\u2019s warning \u2014 or the failure-to-perform lawsuits that were then being discussed with Harrison\u2019s lawyer and agent \u2014 had an impact, but the actor relented, appeased by the promise that Hart would advise the theatergoers of the production\u2019s tenuous state before the curtain rose.\n\n\u201cMoss told Rex that we would explain to them that there are technical problems, and that it\u2019s more like a rehearsal,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cHe said, \u2018They won\u2019t mind at all, because audiences love things like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAround 6 o\u2019clock, Hart came out of Harrison\u2019s dressing room. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what he said,\u201d Mr. Adler recalled. \u201cHe said, grandly: \u2018Gather the players! We\u2019re opening tonight!\u2019\u201d\n\nWord of the performance\u2019s cancellation, which had been broadcast on the radio, was rescinded, and crowds started forming at the theater: Yale students, local fans and trainloads of theater folk from Manhattan.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Adler and another assistant stage manager crisscrossed New Haven, rounding up the actors from Kaysey\u2019s (a theater hangout) and the nearby Taft Hotel, where most of the cast was housed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first scene began with Harrison\u2019s revealing himself from behind a pillar. He was holding a notebook. \u201cI could see that he was shaking,\u201d Mr. Adler said.\n\nThe welcoming applause helped calm him, and he got through his opening number: \u201cWhy Can\u2019t the English?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat gave him confidence,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t It Be Loverly,\u201d which showcased Ms. Andrews\u2019s soprano, was welcomed even more warmly. By the time the old music hall pro Holloway performed \u201cWith a Little Bit of Luck,\u201d it was clear that the audience was loving the show.\n\nBut the night\u2019s high point, according to those who were there, was at the end of \u201cThe Rain in Spain,\u201d when Ms. Andrews, Harrison and Robert Coote \u2014 who played Colonel Pickering \u2014 joyously collapsed on a sofa after Eliza\u2019s linguistic breakthrough.\n\n\u201cThe audience just went berserk, leapt to their feet and refused to stop applauding,\u201d Mr. Adler said.\n\nHarrison and Coote didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cIt was little Julie \u2014 a veteran of England\u2019s music halls \u2014 who took command,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cShe grabbed their hands and led them in taking a small bow, acknowledging the audience\u2019s applause so they could go on with the show. It never happened quite like that again.\u201d\n\nAt intermission, Ms. Goodmaster remembered, members of the audience were rushing to the box office to snap up remaining tickets for the run.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the show was perfect.

A modernization plan for the subway, which carries about six million riders each day, will be released in May.\n\nThe region is also struggling to respond to a broader transit crisis, with frequent problems on commuter railroads and bus lines. On Monday, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced that New Jersey Transit would hire 40 new bus drivers as part of his proposed state budget.\n\n\u201cFor all the discussion on rail, it\u2019s buses that make the show go in urban centers and urban communities,\u201d Mr. Murphy said at a news conference in Newark, with a shiny New Jersey Transit bus parked behind the podium.\n\nAfter the M.T.A. board meeting, Mr. Byford also stood in front of a shiny bus \u2014 this one a blue double-decker model similar to the iconic two-tiered red buses in London. The new bus was expected to run on the X17J express route between Staten Island and Manhattan as part of a pilot program.

They plan to expand a program known as traffic signal priority, which allows a bus to hold a green light or shorten a red light, in order to keep buses moving.

Fed up with slow buses, some commuters have switched to bicycles or ride-hailing apps like Uber.

The Times also viewed copies of three complaints to human resources.\n\n\u201cI came to the realization that I, as a female, would not grow in that company,\u201d said Francesca Krane, who worked for five years in Nike\u2019s retail brand design area before leaving in 2016. She said she grew tired of watching men get promoted into jobs ahead of women she felt were equally or better qualified.\n\nMany of those interviewed, across multiple divisions, also described a workplace environment that was demeaning to women. Three people, for instance, said they recalled times when male superiors referred to people using a vulgar term for women\u2019s genitals. Another employee said that her boss threw his car keys at her and called her a \u201cstupid bitch.\u201d She reported the incident to human resources. (She told her sister about it at the time, the sister confirmed.) He continued to be her supervisor.\n\nMost of the people who spoke to The Times insisted on anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements or a fear of being ostracized in the industry, or in the Portland community, where Nike wields outsize influence. Some have spouses or family members still working there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response to questions, Nike portrayed its problems as being confined to \u201can insular group of high-level managers\u201d who \u201cprotected each other and looked the other way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not something we are going to tolerate,\u201d said a spokesman, KeJuan Wilkins.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Parker said the vast majority of Nike\u2019s employees work hard to inspire and serve athletes throughout the world. \u201cIt has pained me to hear that there are pockets of our company where behaviors inconsistent with our values have prevented some employees from feeling respected and doing their best work,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Amanda Shebiel, who left Nike in September after about five years at the company, the promise to address longstanding systemic problems is welcome, but late.\n\n\u201cWhy did it take an anonymous survey to make change?\u201d she asked. \u201cMany of my peers and I reported incidences and a culture that were uncomfortable, disturbing, threatening, unfair, gender-biased and sexist \u2014 hoping that something would change that would make us believe in Nike again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one went just to complain,\u201d Ms. Shebiel added. \u201cWe went to make it better.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAn Inner Circle of Men\n\nWith a market value of about $112 billion and annual revenues of around $36 billion, Nike is a global behemoth in the athletic market, where its dominance went largely unchallenged for several decades.\n\nBut the company is facing significant business hurdles. Adidas, one of its biggest competitors, has gained ground in key markets like apparel and footwear. Nike is also struggling to get traction in women\u2019s categories, the fastest-growing segment of the market.\n\nSome of those interviewed by The Times said the weakness in women\u2019s products in part reflected a lack of female leadership and an environment that favored male voices. Nike\u2019s own research shows that women occupy nearly half the company\u2019s work force but just 38 percent of positions of director or higher, and 29 percent of the vice presidents, according to an April 4 internal memo obtained by The Times.\n\nAnd while Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Nike did put money behind campaigns targeting women, it sometimes flailed.\n\nLast year, Mr. Edwards, the former president, gave the green light for a marketing campaign for the fall launch of the VaporMax shoe for women; the female British singer FKA Twigs was given creative license for a shoot in Mexico City. The result, according to a person who saw a rough cut of the commercial and another who saw the final cut, featured few shots of the shoes and instead had a woman twirling on what looked like a stripper pole and male athletes in sports bras striking odd poses. The campaign was killed, costing Nike millions of dollars.\n\nAsked about the aborted campaign, Mr. Wilkins of Nike said the company was proud of its relationship with the singer. \u201cWe have a history of pushing the boundaries in marketing, just as we do in product development,\u201d Mr. Wilkins said. \u201cWe create a lot of material that is not deployed in the marketplace.\u2019\u2019\n\nNike forcefully disputed the notion that women were not involved in the creative and marketing operations, noting that a female executive leads its women\u2019s division. But Mr. Wilkins, the spokesman, acknowledged that, in areas like basketball, \u201cthere was more room and opportunity for the company to increase female representation in its senior positions.\u201d\n\nWhile women struggled to attain top positions at Nike, an inner circle of mostly male leaders emerged who had a direct line to Mr. Edwards. Within the company, as reported earlier in The Wall Street Journal, this group was known as F.O.T., or Friends of Trevor. They texted him in meetings or bragged about having lunch or dinner with him.\n\nA charismatic and creative marketing force, the London-born Mr. Edwards joined Nike in 1992. He oversaw marketing in Europe in the late 1990s, before moving to the United States and taking over the brand in 2002. In 2013, he became Nike brand president.\n\nPhoto\n\nPaige Azavedo recalls her first meeting in 2014 with her new boss, Daniel Tawiah, then a senior director for Nike\u2019s digital brand in North America. She expected they would discuss digital marketing plans.\n\nInstead, she was surprised when he talked mostly about himself and how Mr. Edwards had nominated him for a fast-track career program. \u201cHe basically said, I\u2019ve been nominated to be in this V.P. program and that\u2019s going to be my goal for the next six months to a year,\u201d said Ms. Azavedo, who left Nike in 2015. \u201cHe made it clear he was a friend of Trevor.\u201d\n\nMultiple women, including Ms. Azavedo, told The Times they reported Mr. Tawiah to human resources for berating them in front of their peers, sometimes to the point of tears.

Ms. Hoyt-Pack and Ms. Neuburger did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nWhen Ms. Neuburger left, she sent a pointed letter to Mr. Parker as well as other members of her team, laying out the reasons for her departure. They covered familiar themes, said one person who said she was read the letter: harassment, and the exclusion of women from the inner circle of decision makers.\n\n\u201cNikki did write a letter,\u201d Mr. Wilkins said. \u201cIt was thoughtful and professional. Mark took the letter very seriously and did meet with Nikki.\u201d\n\nConcerned about these departures, a group of women inside Nike started the behind-the-scenes survey that eventually ended up on Mr. Parker\u2019s desk.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018I Was Looking for Help\u2019\n\nThe obstacles to advancement for women at Nike are not new and, in many ways, common in companies with male-dominated leadership. Since Nike\u2019s early days in the 1960s, many employees have been guided by a simple ethos: work hard, party hard, get up for your five-mile run in the morning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe culture that evolved could be belittling to women. On the way to a work dinner in Los Angeles, two senior men debated whether Los Angeles or Portland had better strip clubs, according to a person who attended, as the women traveling with them in the van stared out the windows.\n\nOne current employee said a supervisor pushed his way into a bathroom and tried to kiss her, according to a copy of her complaint that was viewed by The Times.\n\nOver time, many women developed a deep skepticism of Nike\u2019s human resources services. Some avoided the department altogether, fearing retribution or convinced that nothing would happen. Those who did seek help said they often came away frustrated.\n\n\u201cI was looking for help and they just totally shut it down, like \u2018You\u2019re the problem,\u2019\u201d said Marie Yates, a former retail designer, who said she went to human resources seeking help with issues she was having with a manager. She left the company in 2016.\n\nA senior manager who mentioned a female employee\u2019s breasts in an email was not terminated, but rather given a verbal warning, according to a former staff member in the human resources department.\n\nIn one complaint reviewed by The Times, a woman described her manager bragging about the condoms he always carried and the magazines he kept on his desk with scantily clad women on the covers, despite being told to remove them. She reported him to human resources, and was told she had made a mistake by not confronting him first, she said.\n\nUntil last year, human resources was run by David Ayre, who was hired in 2007 by Nike from PepsiCo and reported directly to Mr. Parker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ayre did not return phone and email messages seeking comment.\n\nComplaints were sometimes handled casually. The employee whose supervisor tried to kiss her in the bathroom set up a meeting with human resources to discuss it, and was taken aback when she was told to meet her representative in the Mia Hamm cafe \u2014 a public space on Nike\u2019s sprawling campus.\n\nAmber Amin said her manager routinely belittled her with sexist and dismissive comments but still worried about what would happen if she reported him.\n\n\u201cI think his general attitude toward women was just, subtly, that we were less capable,\u201d said Ms. Amin, a junior designer on one of the Nike apps, who added that she had received positive performance reviews since becoming an employee in 2014.\n\nShe eventually sought help from human resources, which told her that corrective action would be taken. Two days later, she was part of a round of layoffs.\n\nMr. Wilkins said Nike has a no-retribution policy that it takes seriously and noted that there was a significant reorganization of the work force last year.\n\nThe callousness that some women experienced extended at times to the work force at large, employees said. By the summer of 2016, for instance, Nike had decided to stop making golf balls, golf clubs and other equipment. Members of the division were summoned to a meeting inside the Clubhouse, the nickname for one of Nike\u2019s buildings.\n\nThere, horrified employees watched their names appear on a large screen, directing them to different rooms, where some would be laid off, according to one person who attended the meeting and two people who were told of it. The person said it left employees with the impression they were being let go via PowerPoint presentation.\n\nAsked about those layoffs, Mr. Wilkins said, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not normal practice for us,\u201d and suggested the situation was more nuanced than it appeared. In layoff situations, he said, \u201cwe make great efforts to treat every employee in a very thoughtful manner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegarding complaints to human resources, Mr. Wilkins said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on individual cases, but cases are often more complicated than simply listening to one side of the story.\u201d\n\nWhile Nike believes it has a set of human resources procedures installed, those systems \u201chave not worked consistently,\u201d Mr. Wilkins said. \u201cAs Mark has said, we are currently reviewing and improving our practices to re-establish trust where it has been lacking and to guard against this happening in the future.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPressure on Chief Executive\n\nNike\u2019s goals would have been hard to achieve even before the recent departure of high-level executives. In October 2015, Mr. Parker announced an ambitious target: By 2020, Nike would reach $50 billion in annual revenues. But last fall the company pushed the target date to 2022.\n\nAnd while Nike\u2019s stock has climbed 25 percent in the past year, its revenues for the first nine months of its current fiscal year grew by only 4 percent, with North American sales dipping in crucial areas, like footwear.\n\nIn women\u2019s products, Nike \u201cis growing in the low single digits, which means it is a long way away from where it wants to be,\u201d said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group. Companies like Lululemon and even Old Navy are finding greater success in the women\u2019s sportswear market, Mr. Powell said.\n\nFor now, Mr. Edwards\u2019s duties have been split between two other executives. Nike recently named a woman, Kellie Leonard, as chief diversity and inclusion officer, and Mr. Wilkins said Nike is focused \u201con attracting, developing and elevating both women and people of color throughout the organization.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt now falls to Mr. Parker, 62, to move Nike forward. A quiet executive who designed several of Nike\u2019s running shoes, Mr. Parker has been the company\u2019s chief executive since 2006. He appeared to solidify his control over the company\u2019s operations around 2015 when Nike\u2019s co-founder Phil Knight stepped down as company chairman.\n\nBut given the recent tumult at Nike, Mr. Parker may face tough questions himself. At least a dozen current and former employees told The Times they could not see how Mr. Parker was not aware of the problems with his top leaders. What is unclear, some said, is whether information was deliberately kept from Mr. Parker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs he did with other executives who reported directly to him, Mr. Parker met regularly with Mr. Ayre when he was the head of human resources to discuss, among other things, any active investigations of suspected employee misconduct, Mr. Wilkins said.\n\nWhen appropriate, he said, action was taken. But with 74,000 employees, Mr. Wilkins said, \u201cMark would not have been aware of all issues.\u201d\n\nThat explanation did not satisfy Ms. Shebiel, the former employee who left in September.\n\nIf Mr. Parker did not know, she said, \u201cit negates the times over the years my peers and I sought support and counsel from the people we were told we could trust to bring about change.\u201d\n\nMs. Shebiel said she and her colleagues risked or experienced retaliation \u201cfor shining a light on both significant and everyday experiences that left us feeling bullied, uncomfortable and intimidated.\u201d", "title": "At Nike, Revolt Led by Women Leads to Exodus of Male Executives", "authors": ["Julie Creswell", "Kevin Draper", "Rachel Abrams"]}

In the 1970s, the books proliferated as professional players and caddies, in search of a legal edge, turned to the course field guides compiled by pioneers like Mark Long, who has followed the high-tech path. He supplies his greens books to caddies for $150 apiece.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarl Jackson is widely considered a priceless alternative. Known as the greens whisperer of Augusta National, Jackson worked 54 Masters, including 39 as the bag man for the two-time champion Ben Crenshaw. When Greller was about to caddie in his first Masters, in 2014, he sought out Jackson to try to absorb some of his knowledge about Augusta\u2019s bedeviling breaks and slopes.\n\nEvery tournament week since, Greller has checked in several times with Jackson, who first caddied at the Masters as a 14-year-old in 1961. The two do not go over notes because Jackson stores all his knowledge on the pages of his mind.\n\nSince Crenshaw regards Spieth as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of sorts, Greller is never shy about using Jackson as a resource.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCarl probably wants to throw his phone any time he gets a phone call from Michael, he\u2019s probably talked to him so many times,\u201d said Justin Thomas, Spieth\u2019s competitor and close friend.\n\nGreller said the best advice he had received from Jackson had nothing to with a fall line or a pin placement. It was simply: \u201cThere will be multiple times you\u2019ll be confused. Then you trust your instincts.\u201d\n\nTo remind himself, Greller writes a note on some pages amid all the technical jargon: \u201cTRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Spieth, who, like most golfers, keeps books of his own.\n\nJohn Wood, a veteran caddie who works for Matt Kuchar, spent Monday morning walking the course by himself, stopping often to take notes.

Bossert. Two White House officials said the move came at the urging of the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, whom one of the officials described as serving as the president\u2019s shiny new object.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s mood had begun to sour even before the raids on his lawyer. People close to the White House said that over the weekend, the president engaged in few activities other than dinner at the Trump International Hotel. He tuned into Fox News, they said, watched reports about the so-called deep state looking to sink his presidency and became unglued.\n\nMr. Trump angrily told his advisers that people were trying to undermine him and that he wanted to get rid of three top Justice Department officials \u2014 Jeff Sessions, the attorney general; Rod J.

His participation in an interview with Mr. Mueller, which the special counsel has sought, seemed less likely, three people close to the president said.\n\nMr. Trump has long felt as if he has been unfairly hit by the Mueller investigation, and he has wanted to hit back.

Mr. Kelly has told Mr. Trump it is frustrating for staff members that the president deems most news media stories fake news but believes the ones accusing various advisers of leaking, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Trump can fire Mr. Mueller himself. Many legal experts believe the president would have to direct Mr. Rosenstein to do so because Mr. Sessions has recused himself from the case and Mr. Rosenstein technically oversees Mr. Mueller.\n\nMr. Rosenstein has told Congress that he would dismiss Mr. Mueller only for cause, and people close to Mr. Rosenstein have indicated he would resign if the president ordered him to fire Mr. Mueller. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to protect Mr. Mueller, with senators urging the president to let it go forward \u201cwithout impediment.\u201d\n\nRepublican leadership has dismissed such legislation as unnecessary.

They occurred late at night or early in the morning, with the attackers using long-range sniper rifles and night-vision equipment, according to Afghan officials, who tallied at least 10 wounded in all, along with those killed.\n\nIn separate assaults, a girls\u2019 high school in Logar Province, near the capital, Kabul, was burned on April 11, and masked attackers struck a school in the village of Momandara, in Nangarhar Province, on Saturday night, setting archives and labs ablaze, according to education officials.\n\nNo one was reported hurt in those two attacks.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but government officials blamed Taliban insurgents for the attacks on the government outposts. In recent years, mainstream Taliban forces have normally refrained from attacking schools.\n\nIn the Sancharak District, in the northern Sar-i-Pul Province, which has teetered between government and Taliban control over the past year, the governor, Naqibullah Daqiq, said that two government checkpoints in the west had been attacked by Taliban fighters using night-vision equipment and sniper rifles, with one guard killed at first.\n\nWhen local pro-government militiamen tried to counter the assault, they fell into a Taliban ambush, and 10 others were killed, Mr. Daqiq said.\n\nNematullah Tofan, the police chief of the district of Dawlat Abad, in another northern province, Faryab, said that two government checkpoints in the village of Khairabad had fallen to Taliban fighters after their snipers killed four government defenders, shooting each of them in the head.\n\nAttacks by insurgents using sophisticated night-vision technology have risen in the past year, especially against police and militia units that do not have such equipment. Afghan officials have asked for the gear to be issued to their police officers, but American officials have been reluctant to do so for fear that it would fall into Taliban hands.\n\nThe third attack was in Ghazni Province, in southeastern Afghanistan, where two Afghan Local Police checkpoints in the district of Jaghatu were attacked at 2 a.m. Sunday, killing eight officers and wounding four others, according to Hamidullah Nawruz, a member of the Ghazni provincial council.\n\nAfghan Local Police officers are militiamen defending their own communities; they are generally less trained and not as well equipped as the national police.\n\nA fourth attack took place on Sunday afternoon, when three guards outside Nangarhar University in the eastern city of Jalalabad took a break for worship. Gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on them while they were praying, killing two immediately, according to a news release from the provincial governor\u2019s office.

Speaking by telephone from London, where he lives, Mr. Guselnikov said he had been asked to pay 100,000 euros, around $125,000, in bribes a month by an intermediary sent by Mr. Rimsevics. He also accused the central banker of having once worked for the Soviet K.G.B.\n\nMr. Guselnikov\u2019s accusations, said Mr. Rimsevics, \u201care total, total lies.\u201d\n\nLatvia\u2019s Defense Ministry, in a statement in response to the crisis rocking the country\u2019s financial world, claimed that the tiny Baltic nation had fallen victim to a \u201cmassive information operation from outside\u201d that was \u201cidentical in structure and execution\u201d to operations linked to Russia that preceded elections in France, Germany and the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nHardly anybody is buying that, least of all the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, which issued the February report cataloging how ABLV bank\u2019s \u201cexecutives, shareholders and employees have institutionalized money laundering as a pillar of the bank\u2019s business practices.\u201d\n\nMarshall Billingslea, an assistant secretary at Treasury, visited Riga last month to again press officials to curtail Latvia\u2019s shady nonresident banks and assure them that Washington has evidence that ABLV not only laundered dirty money but \u201cused bribery to influence Latvian officials when challenging enforcement actions and perceived threats to their high-risk business.\u201d\n\nThe bank has categorically denied paying bribes and has cast itself, like Mr. Rimsevics, as a victim.\n\nThe finance minister, Ms. Reizniece-Ozola, said the Defense Ministry statement portraying Latvia as a victim of a Russian-inspired hybrid war did not mean to suggest that Moscow is to blame for all the troubles that have engulfed Mr. Rimsevics and ABLV bank. It was, she said, simply a reminder of the tense geopolitical backdrop to the banking crisis at a time when Russia is working hard to undermine NATO and the European Union, both of which Latvia has belonged to since 2004.\n\nOnly 6 percent of ABLV\u2019s deposits, which totaled $3.2 billion at the end of 2017, came from Latvians. The largest share \u2014 43 percent \u2014 was from Russians.\n\nThe problem, said Ms. Reizniece-Ozola, is not that depositors are Russian but that \u201cwe don\u2019t really know who they are,\u201d as most operate through layers of opaque shell companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the years Latvian banks, particularly ABLV, have figured in scandals involving crime-tainted money. These include the transfer of funds stolen by corrupt Russian officials exposed by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in a Moscow prison in 2009; money from a $1 billion bank heist in Moldova in 2014; and billions of dollars transferred out of Russia in what the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project called the \u201cRussian laundromat.\u201d\n\nAfter long denying that Latvia had a serious problem and arguing that the country was merely utilizing its \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d as Russia\u2019s neighbor but part of Europe, the authorities and even some banks have tried to end the free-for-all. They have imposed tougher anti-money laundering controls and are at least paying lip service to the idea that crime-tainted money should be shunned.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the credibility and reputation of the financial sector has been damaged,\u201d said Sanda Liepina, the new chairman of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, which for years played down accusations of money laundering. Control measures introduced starting in 2015, she said, \u201cshould have been taken four or five years earlier.\u201d\n\nMr. Rimsevics, the beleaguered central bank chief, says he, too, \u201cfelt uneasy about what has been going on for years\u201d in Latvian banks catering to Russians, but when he tried to curb their shady activities, ABLV, Norvik and other banks \u201c complained about me big time.\u201d\n\nHe said he had even received text messages on his cellphone warning that he would be shot if did not ease up.\n\nWhatever the truth of that, one thing seems clear: Latvia\u2019s role as the \u201cSwitzerland of the Baltics,\u201d a business model eagerly cheered by European and American consultants and officials in the early 1990s, seems over.\n\n\u201cThis is really yesterday\u2019s business,\u201d Ms. Reizniece-Ozola said. \u201cThe sooner the banks themselves understand that, the better.\u201d", "title": "Banker Finds He Has \u2018Even More Enemies Than I Thought\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"]}

Our bodies are subject to randomness and even outright \u201cconflict at the cellular level.\u201d She cites a biologist who describes pregnancy as \u201cmaternal-fetal competition\u201d: The fetus tries to siphon off the nutrients from the mother, whose body struggles to retain them for herself. Our immune system has been found to nourish cancer cells (\u201cthe fire department is indeed staffed by arsonists\u201d).\n\n\u201cNatural Causes\u201d is peevish, tender and deeply, distinctively odd \u2014 and often redeemed by its oddness. Ehrenreich is so offended by the American conflation of health with virtue and offers charming contrarian essays on the \u201cdefiant self-nurturance\u201d of cigarette smoking, for example, and the dangers of eating fruit. The pleasures of her prose are often local, in the animated language, especially where scientific descriptions are concerned. Her description of cells rushing to staunch a wound is so full of wonder and delight that it recalls Italo Calvino.\n\nThere are, however, a few swan dives into near-nonsense. In arguing that the wellness epidemic seeks to prettify our body\u2019s actual processes, she reveals a horror of menstruation \u2014 a \u201cviolent occurrence\u201d that she claims can be \u201cappalling, even terrifying, to the young girl who experiences it.\u201d She rails against \u201cpro-menstrual propaganda\u201d that dares \u201cnormalize this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a confusing moment of squeamishness and overstatement from a woman who was politicized as a young mother by the funky feminism of the 1970s. (There\u2019s even a fond mention of a speculum in these pages.)\n\nMore surprising, Ehrenreich never really grapples with the obvious point that most Americans suffer from a lack \u2014 not excess \u2014 of access to basic health care. This is especially true for women of color, as the alarming rates of maternal mortality make clear.\n\nEhrenreich\u2019s focus on relatively rarefied issues and pet preoccupations make it clear that this is a book born out of private not public concerns \u2014 despite masquerading as such. It possesses what the critic Helen Vendler described as \u201cthe strange binocular style\u201d of late works, in which the writer is attentive to death\u2019s encroaching shadow but also vividly alive to the present moment. There is a feeling of Ehrenreich getting her affairs in order, slaying a few final foes.\n\nThe wellness movement neatly dispatched, she sits in contemplation of death itself in the book\u2019s concluding, very beautiful passages, bringing to it her characteristic curiosity and awe at the natural world. \u201cIt is one thing to die into a dead world and, metaphorically speaking, leave one\u2019s bones to bleach on a desert lit only by a dying star,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is another thing to die into the actual world, which seethes with life, with agency other than our own, and at the very least, with endless possibility.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a haiku by Mizuta Masahide, the 17th-century Japanese poet who commemorated the burning down of his barn, which left him homeless: \u201cMy storehouse burned down\u2014/now nothing stands between me/and the moon above.\u201d", "title": "Barbara Ehrenreich Urges Us to Accept, Accept the Dying of the Light", "authors": []}

If the Twins are still trying to preserve their lead by shifting the defense, then so be it. No one really can complain about either team playing hard through the last out. After all, many a game has been won with just a strike left and one team\u2019s back against the wall.\n\nIt just happened that the spirit of competing to the undying end \u2014 which is what we expect from big leaguers \u2014 created this unwritten moment. Bunting in the third inning while down 7-0 would not have prompted outrage. Not so in the ninth. Theoretically, a player versed in the unwritten lexicon should know when to say when.\n\nThere is some historical context. Unwritten rules fill in the blanks concrete law leaves us. Two major safety rules have come about since I retired in 2005: the \u201cPosey rule,\u201d which protects catchers at home plate from getting smashed by runners, and the \u201cUtley rule,\u201d which prohibits runners from targeting infielders. During my time, you could run the catcher over and wipe out the infielder on a double play, though you still had interference-regulating rules about going in \u201cspikes high\u201d or body-rolling or being required to reach the base when you slid.\n\nThe unwritten rules made us all accountable, not just the umpires and coaching staff, and through them players educated other players on caring about safety. Now that these rules have adapted to a world with less contact, players continue to share their nuances to underscore the importance of safety for all.\n\nWhen my children eat dinner, I often pull my hair out. All four of them are under 10, and all do something that offends my sensibility.

At times, it seemed that the United States might even try to make that happen. But Mr. Assad took steps to protect against an American intervention. He allowed the Islamic State to flourish, essentially creating a dilemma for the Americans: Would they rather have the jihadists take over Syria? So long as the Islamic State existed, Mr. Assad was safe \u2014 all he had to do was wait.

In Sweden, children use rear-facing seats all the way till age 4, then move to front-facing booster seats. (Here in the United States, we use front-facing car seats from about 2 years old until children outgrow them.)\n\nHow do Swedish parents manage this? For one thing, rear-facing car seats in Sweden and other parts of Europe are different from those here. They are often built with a bar that comes down from the car seat to rest on the floor of the car. This allows the seat to rest farther from the back of the car\u2019s rear seat, giving the child much more room. Parents in Sweden find it easier to get bigger children into them. Such seats, which are not available in the United States, were also found to be safer in the sled tests than the versions we use.\n\nBut rear-facing car seats for older children are just one of the many differences between the United States and Sweden.\n\nBecause accidents are inevitable, Swedish regulations aim to make them nonlethal. Roads rely more on roundabouts, less on intersections. Cars are not allowed to turn at all when pedestrians are crossing. There are national camera enforcement policies. Sweden also focuses on pedestrian bridges, and separates cars from bicycles and oncoming traffic.\n\nFar fewer people drive under the influence of alcohol; stricter policing has reduced impaired driving to less than 0.25 percent of tested drivers vs. about 1.5 percent of American drivers. (Sweden also has a more stringent definition of driving under the influence, 0.02 percent vs. 0.08 percent.) The speed limit in areas where cars might come into contact with pedestrians (think all of New York City) is less than 20 m.p.h. Speed bumps and other traffic-calming interventions are common. The average cost of obtaining a driver\u2019s license is the equivalent of more than $1,800.\n\nAll of this seems to work. Over the last 20 years, Sweden reduced pedestrian deaths by 31 percent and overall traffic deaths by 45 percent. In 2013, Sweden\u2019s rate of death from car accidents was about 3 per 100,000 people, about one-quarter the rate in the United States. But Swedes are not necessarily satisfied with that.

And in February, the number of active listings for single-family homes declined to 872, the lowest inventory has been in 13 years.\n\nThere are marked differences, however, between the affluent southern part of the county, which includes the manicured estates and picturesque towns of Great Barrington, Lenox and Stockbridge (literally Norman Rockwell country \u2014 the artist lived in Stockbridge from 1953 until his death in 1978, and his museum remains), where the average home price was $426,600 in 2017, and the rest of the county, where some cities are still struggling to recover from the departure of manufacturing jobs decades ago.\n\nIn the slightly scruffier central part of the county, including Pittsfield, the largest city in the Berkshires, the average sales price last year was $197,667. In the northern part of the county, anchored by North Adams, where 18.9 percent of the population is living in poverty and the median household income is $32,804, according to United States Census Bureau data, the average sales price was lower still, at $186,388.", "title": "Betting on the Berkshires", "authors": []}

The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\u201d This centering of black womanhood is not what black people have been taught to do when given as much power and attention as Beyonc\u00e9 has.\n\nIt would have been reasonable to assume Beyonc\u00e9 would perform the entire show in a glamorous couture number, like the Nefertiti-inspired costume she came onstage in. Respectability is also imagery: Black people are told, when we gain power, and are under the gaze of the public, we must always wear our most formal and elegant attire.\n\nInstead, with millions of people watching in the desert and online, Beyonc\u00e9 reappeared in blue distressed denim shorts and a hoodie advertising a fake historically black college. Success does not need to have a preferred style; a black person does not have to wear a glamorous gown or a tailored suit to captivate the imagination of the public. Beyonc\u00e9 shows that talent and discipline are enough.\n\nShe follows in the tradition of black performers like Michael Jackson and Tina Turner, but she is unique in imagining blackness as something so big. To Beyonc\u00e9, attending a historically black college is more than a niche experience coveted only by students and alumni. Instead, it\u2019s something thematically paramount and worthy of an enormous stadium.\n\nYou might think that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s promotion of historically black colleges and their intellectual traditions also might have conflicted with her sexually charged songs like \u201cPartition\u201d and \u201cDrunk in Love.\u201d We\u2019re taught that an intellectual being can never be sexual one. This is especially true for black people who have been hypersexualized in media and daily life. So it wouldn\u2019t have been odd for her to edit her sexuality to fit society\u2019s ideas of what it means to be proud, black and smart.\n\nNot at Coachella. Beyonc\u00e9 performed her sensuality proudly in those songs making political statement that a person can be both intellectually rigorous and sexually expressive.\n\nWe know Beyonc\u00e9 can sing and move, and that she treats stadiums as if they are her living room. But it wasn\u2019t clear whether, after Clive Davis called her \u201cthe first lady of music,\u201d she would adhere to respectability politics, especially on a stage like Coachella, where she may have alienated a large portion of her audience.

When asked about the cost of her sons\u2019 hockey training, Dawn-Marie Movalli laughed. \u201cAn arm and a leg,\u201d she said.\n\nHer husband said $10,000 a year would be on the low end. But that is just for the hockey program and skates. It does not include the two homes they maintain and the costs associated with traveling to games, which could require hotel stays over a weekend and hours on the road or in an airplane. The Movallis rent a home from another family that uprooted for a child: Kiley McKinnon, an Olympic snowboarder who trains in Park City, Utah.\n\nEach sport has its own expenses. Jane Hill declined to say how much her daughter\u2019s riding cost, but said the family owned and leased several horses and traveled around the Southeast for competitions. Maggie said she could ride four or five horses in a competition.\n\nBecause these athletes are still children, parents are likely to pay for private school or tutors. Maggie Hill is taking high school classes through an online program at Laurel Springs School and working with private tutors in Wellington.\n\nThere are also private schools geared toward children who want to focus on athletics. They often charge the same rate as top New York private schools: Tuition is $54,000 at Stratton Mountain School in Vermont, which focuses on winter sports, and $59,000 at Spire Academy in Geneva, Ohio, which specializes in basketball, track and field, and swimming.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn some sports, children can pay their own way. Brock Crouch, an 18-year-old based at Mammoth Mountain, Calif., several hours east of San Francisco, has been snowboarding since he was 3. His sponsors have paid his travel expenses for the past three or four years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that did not cover all the financial obligations, said Denise Crouch, his mother. She lived with her son in Mammoth Mountain while he trained, while her husband and other son were 400 miles away in Carlsbad, Calif. \u201cYou still have two houses with expenses,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd there are other indirect costs.\n\nParents need flexible jobs. The Movallis, for instance, own their own technology company, Orion Systems, which allows them to work remotely and travel back if necessary. Ms. Crouch said that when her son was starting out, she was allowed to work remotely for three months a year in Mammoth. But after Brock began to travel internationally for competitions, her husband quit his job of 20 years working for a commercial contractor so he could travel with him.\n\nMs. Hill said her husband, Thomas, the chief executive of Summit Materials, a building materials company, commuted to Denver, where the company is based.\n\nThere are often other children to consider, too. In some of these families, younger siblings followed older ones into the same sport.\n\nJustin Movalli started playing hockey a decade ago. But it was his younger brother\u2019s interest that was the impetus for the family to move to Connecticut so Connor could get started at the elite level sooner than his brother had.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut some siblings never develop the appetite. Ms. Hill said her younger daughter enjoyed riding a horse when they lived in Wyoming but did not share her sister\u2019s passion for the sport. But she said moving to Wellington, where Maggie trained, had brought everyone together.\n\n\u201cFlorida is the place where we could rebalance our family,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many of these families, relocating can save on travel costs.\n\nJustin Movalli said he had moved to Kansas City at age 17 to play hockey and live with a family there. His parents paid a fee to the host family, which receives about $500 a month for taking in a young hockey player. But then he was bused all over the Midwest to play games. His younger brother benefits from living in Connecticut, where his games are closer to home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter all of the expenses and time spent, there is no guarantee of professional success. Managing expectations can be among the costliest things to do.\n\nThe sports schools say they are, in some ways, the managers of overinflated expectations. They essentially serve as curators of talent, placing one child athlete into the mix of others who may be more gifted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get 200 inquiries a year, and we\u2019ll assess them,\u201d said Christopher G. Kaltsas, headmaster of the Stratton Mountain School. He stressed that the program, which accepts about 40 applicants a year, was not going to turn every student into an Olympian or a member of the United States national team. Some would simply go on to top schools with sports programs.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning them into incredible athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re also focused on time management. The application of those traits extends far beyond us.\u201d\n\nRon Clutter, founder and chief executive of Spire Academy, said the school and its related training facility had 16 athletes in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. That\u2019s catnip for parents and children alike.\n\nBut he said that for many student athletes, the best they might hope for would be playing at a college where they were paying their own way.\n\n\u201cSome parents have grander visions for their kids but don\u2019t understand what the real world is like,\u201d Mr. Clutter said. \u201cThey quickly learn there are a lot of athletes around them that are as good or better than they are.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWorking with the parent is just as hard as working with the athlete.\u201d\n\nBrock Crouch said that he had missed the Olympic team for slopestyle snowboarding by two spots, but that he planned to try again in four years. Until then, being a professional in his sport allows him to travel and enjoy himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m making a film for Snowboarder Magazine,\u201d he said. \u201cI envision myself being in a few more movies and having as much fun as I can, being in some contests over the next two years.

We tracked whether hotel employees responded and also analyzed the content of the emails from those who did respond.\n\nAcross the range of responses, racial discrimination was clear. Overall, hotel employees were significantly more likely to respond to inquiries from people who had typically white names than from those who had typically black and Asian names. But racial bias did not end there. Discrimination also happened in many subtle ways.\n\nHotel employees provided 20 percent more restaurant recommendations to white than to black or Asian people. Employees\u2019 politeness also varied by race. When responding to white people, employees were more likely to address them by name and to end their emails with a complimentary close (e.g., \u201cBest,\u201d \u201cSincerely\u201d) than they were when responding to black or Asian people. And employees were more likely to go \u201cabove and beyond\u201d in their service: They were three times as likely to provide extra information \u2014 even when the initial inquiry was just about restaurants \u2014 to white than to black or Asian people.\n\nThe manager at Starbucks called the police with the claim that the two men were \u201crefusing to make a purchase.\u201d The manager did not believe that they were customers.\n\nOur research suggests that this belief \u2014 that a nonwhite person cannot or will not be a legitimate customer \u2014 can indeed worsen discrimination in service delivery. In a follow-up study, we emailed nearly 2,000 hotels and made a similar inquiry about local restaurants. But this time, in addition to varying the race of the inquirers, we varied whether they made clear their intention to stay at the hotel. Indeed, making customer status explicit helped reduce discrimination against minority people. These results are in line with the recent incident at Starbucks: We see that service workers do not apply the rule that every person is a potential customer deserving the same level of service.", "title": "Opinion | Beyond Starbucks: How Racism Shapes Customer Service", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "Dennis McAndrews, a Pennsylvania lawyer who has followed the case closely, said that the most likely scenario, because of Mr. Cosby\u2019s age and the similarity of the counts, is that Judge Steven T. O\u2019Neill will merge the counts and base the sentencing on just one count. As a result, Mr. Cosby will probably face a maximum sentence of 10 years.\n\nHow long will Mr. Cosby be free on bail?\n\nPhoto\n\nNo sentencing date has been set, but that would typically occur within two to three months. Until then, Mr. Cosby remains free on $1 million bail but is essentially confined by order of the court to his Pennsylvania home until the sentencing hearing.\n\nMs. Ashcroft said Mr. Cosby had not been shown any special treatment when he was allowed to leave on bail. Bail would have been revoked if he were an especially dangerous risk to society or was a flight risk. Where he did have an advantage was the ability to meet the $1 million bail, she said.\n\nNow his lawyers will probably ask Judge O\u2019Neill to postpone Mr. Cosby\u2019s incarceration until after their appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court is decided. Weighed against that, however, is any flight risk, something emphasized by the district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, at the trial on Thursday.\n\nIn the interim, experts said, Mr. Cosby will be classified as a sex offender and will be required to register with the state police.\n\nWhere might Mr. Cosby serve his sentence?\n\nInmates with short sentences often serve them in a county jail, but Mr. Cosby is likely to enter the state correctional system, experts said. Susan McNaughton, communications director for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, said the state has 22 institutions to care for men, and it was too early to say which one he would go to. All are set up to cope with elderly inmates, and there is no facility that is especially designated for such prisoners.\n\nWhat are the grounds for an appeal?\n\nPhoto\n\nSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS Mr. Cosby\u2019s spokesman mentioned that issue as a likely ground for appeal in a conversation he had after the verdict. Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers argued in court that there is little evidence that the sexual encounter with Ms. Constand occurred in January 2004, as she testified. Any earlier and the state\u2019s 12-year statute of limitations would have expired by the time he was charged in December 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTESTIMONY FROM THE FIVE ADDITIONAL WOMEN Ordinarily, prosecutors cannot introduce evidence or accusations of prior bad behavior. It is viewed as too prejudicial for a jury as it considers the facts of the single case before it. But here five women were allowed to describe their own encounters with Mr. Cosby. The judge did not provide a legal reasoning for his decision to allow five, compared with one other accuser he permitted to testify at the first trial, and the introduction of evidence like this has been allowed in other cases, but several experts said it is a likely target of the defense team.\n\n\u201cThis is an enormous issue that is going to be argued on appeal,\u201d said Shan Wu, a former sex-crimes prosecutor in Washington.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Judge O\u2019Neill would not recuse himself, and experts said higher courts have typically not viewed spousal affiliations as grounds for judicial recusal, but the defense could revisit the topic.\n\nTHE DEFENSE\u2019S INABILITY TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FROM SHERI WILLIAMS Ms. Williams, a friend of Ms. Constand, testified during Ms. Constand\u2019s civil suit against Mr. Cosby. But Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers had sought to have her testify at the trial, and when they could not find her, they asked that her deposition testimony be read to the jury. It\u2019s unclear what the defense hoped to show with Ms. Williams\u2019s testimony, but The Associated Press reported that the defense thought it would show that Ms. Constand was not as unaware of Mr. Cosby\u2019s romantic intentions as she had indicated.\n\nThe judge denied, reasoning that prosecutors had been unable to cross-examine the witness when she gave the deposition. Mr. Wu said the defense\u2019s inability to produce this witness may be something they emphasize on appeal, especially since the prosecution was allowed to bring five prior bad acts witnesses.\n\nTHE JUROR WHO WAS KEPT ON Before the retrial started, the defense lawyers had asked to bar one of the jurors who had been selected to hear the case. They said the juror had been overheard by another prospective juror saying he thought Mr. Cosby was guilty. After several hours of discussion with both sides, Judge O\u2019Neill ruled that the juror could continue on the case, but he never made his reasoning publicly known.\n\nWhat happens to the civil suits?\n\nThe review of Mr. Cosby\u2019s behavior is now likely to shift to the arena of the civil courts, where he has been sued by several women. Many of the women are suing him for defamation because, they say, he or his staff branded them as liars by dismissing their allegations as fabrications.

My husband of 11 years was supportive and grounded in his duties as a new father to be. But one week after a cherry-blossom-themed baby-shower luncheon, I got the news that my daughter no longer had a heartbeat. Flower-essence treatments, reiki sessions, acupuncture and a birth doula didn\u2019t save the life of Lulu Mika, stillborn at seven months (May 8, 2017). She was 3 pounds. I held her but couldn\u2019t stand to see her face.\n\nMy OB-GYN of 10 years was super-attentive, but at a loss for the medical language of what cut my daughter\u2019s life short. The autopsy showed nothing. My follow-up postnatal treatments included many talks with her about managing myself and the pros and cons of jumping back into work. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of taking a complete pause while working through a broken heart, nor did I have family members to help me navigate the emotional tunnel ahead.\n\nLuckily, I had a circle of friends who held me up in big and small ways, with weeklong getaways, french-fry dates, bouts of absences, phone calls (not text messages), Rancho Gordo beans deliveries, flowers, cards and showing up at my apartment with wine. Mostly, women of color who understood the definition of \u201cpush through it.\u201d In the beginning, I wanted to die, but I tucked that feeling away; I\u2019m lucky the thought faded. This nuclear group understood that being a black career woman doesn\u2019t allow much room to mourn. They knew the unspoken rule of protecting the lineage narrative or never speaking the trauma of the women closest to us. It\u2019s silence that contributes to the demise of black women and our babies. After counseling and many days of reflection, my eyes were open to the multitude of unhealthful societal structures that were riding my back while carrying a child.

But studies continue to show pervasive discrimination in housing, and lower-income whites still have greater access than middle-class African-Americans to healthy mixed-income communities.\n\nA study by the National Fair Housing Alliance of a dozen metropolitan areas \u2014 including Atlanta; Austin, Tex., Birmingham, Ala.; Chicago; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit; New York; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; San Antonio; and the District of Columbia \u2014 showed that real estate discrimination was pervasive.\n\nThe alliance filed a federal fair housing complaint against a real estate group in Jackson, Miss., charging that real estate agents were denying African-Americans the right to buy homes in high-value areas that would provide greater returns on their investments after testers posing as home buyers established that black and white clients were treated very differently. The real estate group settled the case by agreeing to specific steps to expand equal housing opportunities.\n\nA HOME MORTGAGE \u2018BLACK TAX\u2019\n\nAfrican-Americans who had amassed equity in their homes and who should have been offered safe, reasonably priced loans were set up for default in the run-up to the recession, when they were targeted for predatory loans that were often deceptively marketed. A study of the problem in Baltimore found that black residents were charged higher rates and discriminated against at every stage of the transactions compared with comparably qualified white customers.\n\nThe authors determined that the loan default rate would have been considerably lower for black customers had they been treated in the same fashion as whites. Most tellingly of all, the study took into account factors like credit scores, income and down payments that would have been known to brokers and lenders when these abusive loans were made.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that such tactics took a heavy toll on black homeowners, who already lagged far behind whites in terms of wealth and homeownership levels. An analysis by the nonprofit Urban Institute shows that between 2001 and 2016 the homeownership rate for African-Americans declined about five percentage points, to 41 percent, as opposed to just one percentage point for whites, whose rate fell to just over 71 percent. The nine percentage point decline for middle-aged black homeowners is particularly ominous, given that these people are closer to retirement with fewer resources to rely on.\n\nThe Urban Institute\u2019s analysis of the black-white homeownership gap in 100 cities across the country shows that none have actually closed the ownership gap. The gap was widest in Northeastern and Midwestern cities \u2014 with the widest gaps, listed in order of severity, found in Minneapolis; Albany; Buffalo; New York; Salisbury, Md.; and Bridgeport, Conn.

Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nStraight Tennessee Bourbon\n\n$49.99\n\n750 milliliters\n\n90 proof\n\nOn the nose, this is a classic, no-fuss bourbon, though with more oak-derived notes \u2014 think caramel, vanilla and wood char \u2014 than you\u2019d expect from a seven-year-old. I also smelled sandalwood, leather and linseed oil. And there\u2019s a creamy cola note that suggests a good bit of rye in the mash bill. (Mr. Dylan and his team say they use just 70 percent corn, leaving a lot of room for other grains to show their influence.) The palate opens with a soft cocoa and buttercream note, then sharpens toward black pepper and cigar tobacco. The finish is slightly bitter, with the sweet spiciness of an Atomic Fireball. My favorite of the bunch.\n\nDouble Barrel Whiskey\n\n$49.99\n\n750 milliliters\n\n100 proof\n\nMore restrained than its stable mates, the Double Barrel \u2014 in which different whiskeys have been blended and further aged together in another cask \u2014 smells of cake batter, fresh berries and children\u2019s cough syrup; as it develops in the glass, its nose turns darker and woodier, with a hint of sweet fortified wine lurking in the background. It tastes surprisingly astringent and medicinal, given the nose, with a thin mouthfeel and notes of tobacco, allspice and wood smoke, resolving in ground pepper. The wood influence on this one is strong, perhaps too much, but it would make a nice substitute for a rye in a manhattan.\n\nStraight Rye Whiskey\n\n$79.99\n\n750 milliliters\n\n92 proof\n\nMost rye whiskey on the market these days is made at a distillery in southern Indiana called Midwest Grain Products, then sold to brands like George Dickel and Bulleit. Some brands then \u201cfinish\u201d the whiskey by placing it in a used or new barrel to give it a twist \u2014 in this case, the rye goes into toasted Vosges oak barrels, which are often used to age pinot noir. Heaven\u2019s Door doesn\u2019t reveal where its rye comes from, but its nose is rich with MGP\u2019s trademark dill and herbal notes. There\u2019s also a sweet grassiness, cocoa powder, tobacco and a slap of leather. It opens deceptively smooth on the palate, but builds to a sweet spiciness before finishing with a burst of spicy, bittersweet chocolate.", "title": "Bob Dylan\u2019s Whiskey: A Taste Test", "authors": ["Clay Risen"]}

Bajau divers been observed plunging more than 200 feet underwater, their only protection a pair of wooden goggles \u2014 a physiological marvel.\n\nIn 2015, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of traits that made the task easier for them.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like the perfect opportunity for natural selection to act on a population,\u201d said Dr. Ilardo.\n\nHer first step was to travel to Sulawesi, Indonesia, and then to a coral reef island where she reached a Bajau village. After she proposed her study, they agreed to the plan. She returned a few months later, this time with a portable ultrasound machine to measure the size of the Bajau people\u2019s spleens.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen people plunge into water, they respond with the so-called diving reflex: the heart rate slows and blood vessels constrict as a way to shunt blood to vital organs. The spleen also contracts, squirting a supply of oxygen-rich red blood cells into the circulation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll mammals have a diving reflex, but marine mammals like seals have a particularly strong one. Scientists suspect that the reflex helps them dive deeper \u2014 as it turns out, seals with bigger spleens can dive deepest. An enlarged spleen seems to function like a bigger scuba tank.\n\nDr. Ilardo scanned the abdomens of the Bajau villagers and then traveled about 15 miles inland to a village occupied by farmers known as the Saluan. She scanned them, too.\n\nWhen Dr. Ilardo compared scans from the two villages, she found a stark difference. The Bajau had spleens about 50 percent bigger on average than those of the Saluan.\n\nYet even such a remarkable difference might not be the result of evolution. Diving itself might somehow enlarge the spleen. There are plenty of examples of experience changing the body, from calloused feet to bulging biceps.\n\nOnly some Bajau are full-time divers. Others, such as teachers and shopkeepers, have never dived. But they, too, had large spleens, Dr. Ilardo found. It was likely the Bajau are born that way, thanks to their genes.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn her visit to Sulawesi, Dr. Ilardo also took mouth swabs from the Bajau and Saluan from which she extracted DNA. She looked at the genetic variations in each village and compared them to people from neighboring countries, such as New Guinea and China.\n\nA number of genetic variants have become unusually common in the Bajau, she found. The only plausible way for this to happen is natural selection: the Bajau with those variants had more descendants than those who lacked them.\n\nOne variant of a gene called PDE10A influenced the size of spleens in the Bajau. People with one copy of the mutant gene had bigger spleens than those with none. People with two copies had even bigger spleens.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

PDE10A has been shown to control the level of thyroid hormone in the body. And scientists have found that injecting thyroid into mice with stunted spleens can make the organs grow larger.\n\nStill, that wouldn\u2019t pin down exactly how PDE10A became so common in the Bajau. \u201cIt\u2019s the question that\u2019s harder than others,\u201d said Rasmus Nielsen, a geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley, who collaborated with Dr. Ilardo.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor her own part, Dr. Ilardo suspects that natural selection favored the Bajau variant of PDE10A because deep diving is so risky. \u201cI would think, as morbid as it is, that if they didn\u2019t have this, it would kill them,\u201d she said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Ricaut, an anthropologist at the University of Toulouse who was not involved in the study, said that it wasn\u2019t clear yet how quickly this evolutionary change happened.\n\nSome researchers suspect the Bajau only began diving to great depths when a market for sea cucumbers opened up in China in the 1600s. Or perhaps the adaptation began thousands of years earlier, at the end of the Ice Age, when rising sea levels turned the region around Indonesia into islands.\n\n\u201cThis study acts as a cornerstone for exciting questions to follow,\u201d said Dr. Ricaut.\n\nDr. Ilardo said there were likely a number of other genes that help the Bajau dive. She and her colleagues also found evidence for natural selection on a gene called BDKRB2.\n\nIn a study published last year, Russian scientists discovered that it plays a role in the diving reflex. In people with variants of BDKRB2, blood vessels are more tightly constricted when they plunge their faces into cold water.\n\nTo see if that\u2019s the case with the Bajau, Dr. Ilardo will need to take another trip to beautiful Sulawesi. \u201cI would be happy doing this as long as I can,\u201d she said.", "title": "Bodies Remodeled for a Life at Sea", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

Indeed, the charter has a name for such an operation. It is \u201caggression.\u201d\n\nA disingenuous lawyer might argue that an attack on North Korea would not be a first strike but merely another strike in a continuing conflict, because combat in the Korean War halted in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty. But that is specious. Given the armistice\u2019s indefinite duration \u2014 during which the parties committed to \u201ca complete cessation of hostilities\u201d \u2014 the right to resume hostilities would require a new legal justification.\n\nA domestic legal issue also arises because President Trump lacks constitutional authority to launch a preventive strike against North Korea.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "One term that comes up often in discussion of gender and, especially, what it means to be a man, is \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d But as Colleen Clemens writes in Teaching Tolerance, \u201c\u2018Toxic masculinity\u2019 is tricky. It\u2019s a phrase that \u2014 misunderstood \u2014 can seem wildly insulting, even bigoted.\u201d\n\nThe Good Men Project defines it this way:\n\nToxic masculinity is a narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status and aggression. It\u2019s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly \u201cfeminine\u201d traits \u2014 which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual \u2014 are the means by which your status as \u201cman\u201d can be taken away.\n\nIt is crucial, however, that students understand some key ideas:\n\n\u2022 Talking about toxic masculinity is not about vilifying boys, men or any of the particular qualities society has deemed \u201cmasculine.\u201d Rather, it is an opportunity to begin to reconstruct a more positive model of masculinity that makes room for the many different ways to be a boy or man and allows all individuals to feel secure in their masculine identity.\n\nMichael Ian Black sums up this sentiment in a response to a reader comment on his Op-Ed, \u201cThe Boys Are Not All Right\u201d:\n\nMr. Florentino: I cried as I read this. My son \u2014 a high school and college wrestler who achieved much success on the mat \u2014 is one of the most sensitive souls I know. But far too often, I cheered his masculinity, his fierceness, and his muscles. I should have been cheering his kindness, his empathy, and his innate ability to be gentle. Those emotional qualities are what REALLY make him strong. MIB: I am very interested in a fuller expression of male strength. Physical strength is great (I wish I had more of it, because I would like, for once in my life, to look good shirtless on a beach). But a man\u2019s strength can be expressed in innumerable ways, including the strength to be vulnerable, the strength to ask for help, to seek forgiveness, to display empathy. By all means, root for your son, but root for his entire being. It sounds like you\u2019re doing that.\n\n\u2022 Toxic masculinity is not just a men\u2019s issue \u2014 its consequences are pervasive and affect everyone, including girls and women. Also, girls, boys, women and men all make choices about their behavior that can either perpetuate a culture of toxic masculinity or disrupt it. (And, of course, \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d is its corollary.)\n\nTo further explore this phrase, students might complete a Frayer model, including the definition, characteristics, examples and nonexamples of toxic masculinity. You can also see how it has been used in New York Times articles.\n\nAfter defining the term, show students this three-minute trailer of the documentary \u201cThe Mask You Live In\u201d by the Representation Project. As they watch, they might continue to add to their Frayer models. (Note to teachers: This clip includes some profanity and graphic language. Please preview it to make sure it is appropriate for your students.)\n\nThen, have students read Mr. Black\u2019s Op-Ed, \u201cThe Boys Are Not All Right,\u201d highlighting the characteristics and examples of toxic masculinity he gives. You might also assign students to read some of the 2,000-plus comments from readers that the article inspired. Do they agree with Mr. Black\u2019s assertions? Why or why not? What arguments made by readers are also compelling?\n\nAsk students if they can think of any other characteristics, examples or nonexamples of what it means to be a man according to this model of masculinity \u2014 such as those they came up with during the warm-up \u2014 and add them to the Frayer model.", "title": "Boys to Men: Teaching and Learning About Masculinity in an Age of Change", "authors": []}

Mandelker, a top American Treasury official in London to meet with her counterparts, said British banks could face \u201cconsequences\u201d if they continued to carry out significant transactions on behalf of the 24 influential Russians sanctioned by Washington on Friday. The list includes the industrialists Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, along with Kirill Shamalov, who American officials have identified as President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s son-in-law.\n\n\u201cThese are blocking sanctions,\u201d Ms. Mandelker, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said at a briefing with reporters. \u201cThere of course would be consequences for U.K. financial institutions\u201d that continued to do business with the Russians.\n\nThe warning has resonated in London, which for decades has served as a haven for Russia\u2019s wealthiest families. Russian investors own iconic British assets like the Chelsea Football Club and swaths of high-end London real estate, and they support thriving networks of lawyers, financial advisers and estate agents.", "title": "British Banks Will Have to Cut Ties to Sanctioned Oligarchs, U.S. Says", "authors": []}

A warning flare of sorts was fired last fall at the Frankfurt Book Festival, when Simon & Schuster\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn Reidy, told an audience that, after Brexit, \u201cthe argument the British have used to grab Europe as an exclusive market will then be over.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about as close to a public declaration of hostilities as you can expect. The battle for Europe\u2019s book market is already being fought quietly wherever author contracts are drafted. These contracts always include a list of territories where publishers want exclusive rights of distribution. More and more often, the list now drafted by American publishers includes the European continent.\n\nPatrick Walsh, a literary agent based in London, has seen Europe included in early drafts of two deals with United States publishers. In both cases, the publishers argued that by the time the book was in stores, Britain and the European Union will have parted company. In both cases, Mr. Walsh pushed back, suggesting that it was too early to know how Brexit would play out, and the codicil was removed.\n\n\u201cIt was a relatively friendly opening gambit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely certain we\u2019re going to see more of this.\u201d\n\nMuch of the talk here about the terms of Britain\u2019s divorce from Europe has centered on banks, real estate and blue-collar industries like fishing and mining. But the creative sector is also bracing for change and fretting about life after Brexit. Few are as worried as the roughly 30,000 people employed by the British book business.\n\nPart of it is a concern that Britain will cease to serve as one of the world\u2019s great cultural hubs. London in particular has been a huge attraction for foreign artists in fields like contemporary dance and theater.\n\n\u201cThose people are based here because they can come and go,\u201d said Andrew Franklin, co-founder of Profile Books, a London publishing house. \u201cThe same is true of literary culture. It\u2019s hugely dependent on new voices coming in from other places, and I worry that as this place puts up walls, the literary culture will become more isolated, with a consequent effect on publishing.\u201d", "title": "British Book Publishers Fear Brexit Will Bring a U.S. Invasion", "authors": []}

After years of what the N.B.A.\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers have labeled \u201cThe Process,\u201d anchored by a few young stars, that team is a series away from its first Eastern Conference finals since 2001. Baseball\u2019s most successful recent tankers were the Houston Astros, the reigning World Series champion.\n\nAfter a few years of counterproductive mediocrity, the Browns got the losing thing right, going 1-15 in 2016 and a perfect 0-16 last season. That made them the first team to receive the top overall pick in consecutive years since 1999 and 2000. Of course, the Browns held the top spot those years, too.\n\nCleveland secured the fourth pick this year after trading the 12th pick last year to the Houston Texans, who used it to select a franchise quarterback in Deshaun Watson.\n\nThe Browns came away from this year\u2019s draft with what they hope will be their own franchise quarterback along with an immediate contributor on defense to go along with last year\u2019s top pick, Myles Garrett, an electric defensive end at Texas A&M who managed to lead the Browns in sacks last year while playing barely half their games because of injury trouble.\n\nGarrett was a no-brainer. Mayfield will prove much more controversial. His character is bold or brash, depending on one\u2019s perspective, as illustrated by his infamously planting an Oklahoma flag at Ohio Stadium\u2019s midfield last year after beating Ohio State. He also pleaded guilty to public intoxication last year.\n\nHe is shorter than a typical top quarterback prospect, and smaller than the other three selected high this year. But he is a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist \u2014 and the reigning winner \u2014 who led Oklahoma to the national semifinals with a sure and accurate arm.", "title": "Browns Take Baker Mayfield at No. 1 Amid a Quarterback Frenzy", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "Early in the morning, Natasha Pickowicz ducked into the walk-in refrigerator, the one all the way at the end of the dishwashing station in Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso\u2019s kitchen, and studied the family shelf. As usual, the tidy nook was stacked with plastic containers of odds and ends, leftover prep from the night before, set aside for staff meal. A pint of blanched broccolini stems here, a lump of blue-cheese butter there. But where anyone else might have seen a random muddle of junk, Natasha Pickowicz saw tarts \u2014 big, beautiful tarts that would feed the whole kitchen before noon.\n\nShe gathered a few pint containers: ham and red-onion scraps, spare confit leeks and yesterday\u2019s mashed potatoes, tatters of provolone and raw cauliflower debris. She reached for fluttery maitakes, a sticky paste of caramelized onions and a handful of cold, slightly sad-looking boiled potatoes with their skins still on. Pickowicz set everything on the counter, just across from a cook smashing raw beef for carpaccio. \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying to find a purpose for all these things,\u201d she said, already seeing how the bits and pieces would come together on cold discs of pie dough.\n\nPickowicz is a pastry chef, known for desserts like her glamorous fruit crostatas and the pastries she makes at both Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar in New York. She started baking savory tarts at an old job when there was an excess of squash one summer, and now she builds a few out of whatever\u2019s on hand each morning, working quickly among the tasks on her to-do list so that she can set out a late breakfast for herself and the cooks. Her approach is spontaneous but deliberate, which is to say, the scraps are random, but there\u2019s nothing random about the way that Pickowicz composes them. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking critically about how they\u2019ll cook,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about creating layers, so when you bite into it, you\u2019re transitioning from tender dough through body and structure.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she meant, until I watched her make four tarts.\n\nFor one, she layered mashed potatoes and cauliflower over dabs of caramelized onion. After it came out of the oven and cooled, she covered it in parsley leaves and lemon zest and draped over those thin, soft pieces of ham. She arranged the leeks over smudged mascarpone and lemon zest, keeping it simple. For the third, she broke the potatoes apart with her hands, creating rough, jagged edges that would go golden as they roasted on the pastry \u2014 which she coated first with smears of ricotta and an oily condiment of preserved lemon. The maitakes, after they were roasted with red-onion pieces and caramelized onion for the very last tart, would be covered with crisp, dressed leaves of pink radicchio del Veneto.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepurposing leftovers, making something entirely whole and new from fragments, isn\u2019t only about economy and efficiency in the kitchen. There\u2019s joy in limiting yourself to what you already have, in finding a use for every scrap and stretching a little into a lot. At home, I made Pickowicz\u2019s pastry dough, with its giant flecks of butter, using as little ice water as possible to bring the crumbs together, and tucking some extra dough into the freezer for another day\u2019s tart. It was only technically spring in New York, so I didn\u2019t have much to work with. Some ricotta, some small boiled potatoes and a single shallot. I asked myself, what would Natasha do?\n\nI smeared ricotta all over the cold dough, grated lemon zest over the top and cracked a little bit of black pepper. Then I broke the potatoes up into big pieces with my hands, mixed in the sliced shallot and dressed it all with olive oil and salt. That went on top of the ricotta. I filled a few gaps with torn up provolone, using the last few slices in the fridge. And when the tart came out of the oven, when it had cooled down to room temperature, I seasoned it again and covered it in dressed radicchio leaves, which wouldn\u2019t have been quite enough to make a meal on their own. It was a delicious and inexact emulation, a spontaneous salad tart, and somehow it was big enough to feed six.\n\nRecipe: Potato-and-Radicchio Tart | Tart Crust", "title": "Build a Beautiful Savory Tart Out of Your Leftovers", "authors": ["Tejal Rao"]}

The company will also install \u201cintelligent\u201d lighting \u2014 streetlights with sensors that can track sound, light and other conditions. The data can be used to monitor traffic, help drivers find parking spaces and alert law enforcement if a gun is fired.\n\nG.E. has piloted some of its smart products in existing cities, but Union Point is an unusual opportunity because most of the infrastructure does not exist yet and the developer is open to experimentation, Mr. Gebhardt said.\n\nLStar plans to open an innovation center in the air station\u2019s old power plant. The center has expressed an interest in featuring an interactive planning tool developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology City Science Group called CityScope, which could aid in Union Point\u2019s evolution by allowing users to visualize and explore trade-offs around factors like density, transportation and walkability, said David Rose, a researcher and lecturer at MIT\u2019s Media Lab.\n\nPhoto\n\nLStar wants \u201cthe center to be a showcase for what the city could be, a place to monitor what it is becoming, and a place to ask existential questions like, \u2018Could it be more inclusive, say, or energy efficient?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rose said.\n\nLStar also has an agreement with Optimus Ride, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Boston, to set up a self-driving vehicle service at Union Point. The company is already testing its electric vehicles at the property.\n\nUnion Point\u2019s first commercial tenant is expected this spring, when Prodrive Technologies, a Dutch company that develops and manufactures products for the automotive, medical and other industries, will break ground on its 60,000-square-foot United States headquarters. The site\u2019s proximity to Boston, access to commuter rail service and ample room for expansion were crucial to the firm\u2019s location decision, said Roy Willems, the company\u2019s general manager of United States operations. He said Prodrive expected to build a second 200,000-square-foot building within three years, and increase its work force to roughly 300 people.\n\nLStar had to persuade the three host communities to approve critical zoning changes before it could move forward with the project. They also granted the developer considerable latitude over the design and layout of the community, which will take shape over 15 to 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe three towns recognized an opportunity to do something quite extraordinary\u201d on a site where previous development plans stalled, said David P.

Hedlund. \u201cIt\u2019s the commercial build-out that we\u2019re lusting after,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, similarly ambitious smart city projects have proved perilous. Mr. Rose cited Songdo, a smart city nearing completion in South Korea, as a prime example. The city boasts advanced connectivity, but it has so far failed to meet expectations in attracting international businesses and residents.\n\n\u201cWhat they got wrong was any sort of sense of streetscape,\u201d said Mr. Rose, who has visited Songdo. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of patina, no authentic street life. It\u2019s super sterile. It was built as this fantasy of the future, but it\u2019s a place that humans don\u2019t want to occupy.\u201d\n\nThe integration of technology into urban planning has prompted questions about how the data being collected will be used. In Toronto, for example, Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, attracted considerable publicity when it was selected last year to help create a smart neighborhood of sorts in a waterfront district called Quayside. Some local officials and critics are questioning whether the deal gives too much authority to Sidewalk Labs without putting limitations on Google\u2019s collection and use of data.\n\nThe need for greater regulation of driverless vehicles has also come up for debate after the death last month of a woman who was struck by one of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

But there is not a single intelligence-related document written or signed by her.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Ms. Kristeva vigorously dismissed the accusation as \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cbarefaced lie\u201d \u2014 \u201cmud being slung at me,\u201d she said, by unspecified people who wished her harm.\n\nAfter the release of the dossier, she reiterated her denials in an interview on Friday. She had never been approached by anyone claiming to be a State Security agent, she said emphatically, and certainly never agreed to collaborate.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are completely false,\u201d she said, speaking in French. \u201cI find it quite extraordinary that the commission, which read these allegations, never thought that the secret services could have been lying.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Kristeva\u2019s defenders, the case recalls something out of Franz Kafka \u2014 or perhaps one of her own murder mystery novels, which mix racy conspiracy plots with heady metaphysical speculation.\n\n\u201cEveryone is trying to keep an open mind, but nobody who knows anything about her or her work believes this,\u201d said Alice Jardine, a French literature professor at Harvard who is writing an intellectual biography of Ms. Kristeva.\n\nInstead of showing that Ms. Kristeva was a spy, she added, the dossier \u2014 which also includes intercepted letters and other surveillance of Ms. Kristeva \u2014 shows \u201chow she was targeted and spied upon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Bulgaria, where opinion is divided, the case has stirred debate about what counts as collaboration and the reliability of the state security archives.\n\nSome have argued that Ms. Kristeva might have spoken to agents without realizing it. Others have called the evidence insufficient and have expressed doubt about the fairness of the procedure for branding someone a collaborator. (On Friday, after the release of the dossier, the commission announced that its website had been attacked by hackers.)\n\nMartin Dimitrov, a Bulgarian political scientist at Tulane University who has written about State Security, said the documents do seem to show that Ms. Kristeva knowingly, if not enthusiastically, shared information on French intellectual and political life with the agency.\n\nBut her handlers, he noted, frequently complained about her lack of commitment, and in 1973 dropped her as an associate after deeming most of the information she provided \u201cof little interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas she a spy? State Security thought so; she says otherwise,\u201d Mr. Dimitrov said. \u201cThis raises a question that is more moral than legal: Namely, who is a spy?\u201d\n\nMs. Kristeva was born in Sliven, Bulgaria, in 1941, to Christian Orthodox parents. In the recent documentary \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Julia Kristeva?\u201d she describes arriving in Paris in late 1965 to study literature on a French government scholarship, with the equivalent of $5 in her pocket.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy 1971, the year of her alleged recruitment, she was established and well-connected enough to be deemed a useful source of information by State Security. She was writing prolifically and was part of a group of politically engaged intellectuals around the avant-garde journal Tel Quel, including the critic Roland Barthes, the novelist Philippe Sollers (whom Ms. Kristeva married in 1967) and the philosopher Jacques Derrida.\n\nThe radical politics and intellectual glamour of that generation of French intellectuals were sent up in Laurent Binet\u2019s recent novel \u201cThe Seventh Function of Language,\u201d which imagined them as theory-addled James Bond wannabes embroiled in a conspiracy around the death of Mr. Barthes (who, in real life, died in 1980 after being hit by a laundry van).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one scene Ms. Kristeva coolly confesses to murdering Mr. Barthes.

In January 1971, she reportedly asked to give testimony only orally, rather than in writing, and her handlers, who are identified by code names, agree.\n\nIn multiple reported meetings between that year and 1973, Ms. Kristeva allegedly offered information on French political and intellectual figures, Arab progressive movements, Bulgarian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and other subjects, most of which is deemed \u201cof little interest.\u201d (Among other things, she reports back on a Bulgarian national who had a stomachache.)\n\nThe operatives expressed dismay when Ms. Kristeva and Mr. Sollers signed a petition in Le Monde in 1972 protesting repression in Czechoslovakia. By that time, the Tel Quel group, like others on the French left, had broken with the pro-Soviet French Communist Party in the wake of the crushing of the Prague Spring, and turned toward Maoism.\n\nAccording to the dossier, the agency formally released Ms. Kristeva from the ranks in 1973 after handlers cited frustration with her \u201ccompletely pro-Maoist\u201d politics and her general lack of commitment. But operatives continued to communicate with her as late as 1978 with the hope of reactivating her.\n\nAt various points in the dossier, she is described as requesting travel permission for her parents, who were still in Bulgaria, and sister, who was in France on a limited visa.\n\nIn 1976, after she wrote a letter to a government office complaining that her parents were not allowed to visit their new grandson in Paris, a document reads: \u201cSabina is employing the same tactics once again \u2014 trying to get something from us without giving anything in return.\u201d\n\nIn the interview on Friday, Ms. Kristeva acknowledged that she had known Vladimir Kostov, a former Bulgarian spy who is described in one document as having met with her in France in the 1960s to \u201cpsychologically prepare\u201d her for possible work as an agent, and who some have suggested might also be behind one of the code names in the dossier. (After defecting, Mr. Kostov survived an apparent poison umbrella attack in the Paris Metro in 1978.)\n\nBut she said she was unaware that Mr. Kostov \u2014 whom she had worked with at a newspaper in Bulgaria, and recalled encountering again in Paris around 1974 or 1975 \u2014 had worked with State Security.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for the commission, she said it had put too much trust in the story the dossier told. \u201cThey saw it as a document, and not as a manipulation,\u201d she said.\n\nSince 2007, when the state security files were opened, there have been questions about material that may have been redacted, destroyed or manipulated. Hristo Hristov, a Bulgarian journalist who has written extensively about the state security files, said that parts of Ms. Kristeva\u2019s dossier appear to have been removed, but that the documentation that remained was persuasive.\n\n\u201cShe was clearly aware who she was meeting with and what kind of information she\u2019s providing,\u201d Mr. Hristov said.\n\nThat the file contains only accounts of Ms. Kristeva\u2019s alleged oral reports, and nothing written or signed by her, was not unheard-of, said Ekaterina Boncheva, a former journalist who has been a member of the commission for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe important fact is that she has a registration card\u201d as an agent, she said.\n\nSince the fall of Communism in 1989, Ms. Kristeva has been vocal about her harsh judgment of the former Bulgarian regime.\n\nOn Thursday, she reiterated her belief that her father had been \u201cinvoluntarily assassinated\u201d in 1989 in a Bulgarian hospital where, she said, \u201cexperiments were carried out on the elderly.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned her 1991 novel \u201cThe Old Man and the Wolves,\u201d a postmodern parable about a professor who is the only person to speak out about sinister animals that begin arriving in a sleepy Eastern European town, and who then dies in a hospital after his artificial lung is disconnected.\n\nWith the release of the dossier, Ms. Kristeva said, she felt like the old man\u2019s daughter, who uncovers evidence of conspiracies she cannot untangle.\n\n\u201cBut fortunately, freedoms exist and we can talk,\u201d she said. \u201cI am going to keep siding with freedom of speech.\u201d", "title": "Bulgaria Says French Thinker Was a Secret Agent.

Oil and gas companies carry large loads of lower-rated debt that is due to mature in the next five years, according to S.&P. New fracking technology has helped to expand domestic oil and gas output and loosened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 grip on prices. But as the new supply depresses prices, it also pinches cash flow.\n\nIndeed, 14 of 16 midsize and larger drillers tracked by Gordon Douthat, a director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, had higher capital spending costs than cash flow last year: Anadarko Petroleum, Noble Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources are among them.\n\nCarl Kaufman, who manages the Osterweis Strategic Income fund, said of domestic drillers: \u201cThose companies don\u2019t throw off any cash.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne central problem is the modest level of oil prices which, despite a recent rebound, remain well below highs of over $100 a barrel. Mr. Wildstein said he expects them to remain \u201caround $60\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll go back to the $70s or $80s,\u201d he said.\n\nFor investors who are bearish on the price of oil, there is the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil E.T.F. For equity investors who expect domestic drillers to rebound eventually, there are E.T.F.s like iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration & Production.\n\nTelecom debt also is worth watching. Citing increased price competition, Moody\u2019s has a negative outlook on the entire sector. Bill Wolfe, Moody\u2019s senior vice president, said the industry was rife with \u201clarge companies with a lot of debt,\u201d including Frontier Communications, CenturyLink and Sprint.\n\nPhoto\n\nVerizon Communications also carries a large debt load, but it may be something of a special case. \u201cThey\u2019re an extremely large issuer,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said.\n\nOne important positive for Verizon, Mr. Wolfe said, is that it has \u201cthe premier wireless network.\u201d But the cost of upgrading that network may also be a Verizon vulnerability. The company is moving aggressively to put in place 5G technology, which uses higher frequencies to speed wireless transmission. But 5G is expensive to install, and it faces widespread opposition in many municipalities and from some scientists, who say it entails health risks.\n\nMr. Wildstein\u2019s fund holds Verizon debt, and he says the company may be overly dependent on its wireless network. It needs to diversify by acquiring a cable provider or media company, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But since they are borrowing at historically low rates, their repayment abilities have not been measurably affected, he noted.\n\nAmong investment-grade companies, the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to interest expense has inched up to 9.9 in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2017, from 9.7 in 2010.

Some residents who heard the explosions and lived to tell about them described the sound like \u201ca water tank bursting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen came the smell, which burned eyes and throats, like onions or chlorine,\u201d The New York Times wrote at the time.\n\nOpposition groups said rockets carrying chemical weapons hit the towns of Ain Tarma, Zamalka, Jobar and Muadamiya. Videos and photos posted online showed hundreds of bodies without visible wounds. Many victims exhibited symptoms like vomiting, intense salivating, suffocation and tremors. The chemicals were believed to be a \u201ccocktail\u201d of the toxic nerve agent sarin and other components.\n\nOpposition activists also posted photos of rockets they said were used in the attack. The deadliest toll fell on the heart of Eastern Ghouta.\n\nWhen the enormity of the attacks became clearer to the administration of President Barack Obama, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the \u201cindiscriminate slaughter of civilians\u201d and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a \u201ccowardly crime.\u201d\n\nThe attack spurred Mr. Obama to ask Congress for permission to launch a military counterattack. It also emerged as a test of Mr. Obama\u2019s willingness to hold to his stance that a chemical attack would cross a \u201cred line.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, he stated at an impromptu news conference at the White House:\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people. We have been very clear to the Assad regime but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d\n\nBut in 2013, as he drew criticism for not taking more decisive action on Syria after the suspected chemical attacks, Mr. Obama said while on a trip to Stockholm: \u201cI didn\u2019t set a red line. The world set a red line.\u201d\n\nIn September, the United States and Russia reached an agreement that called for Syria\u2019s arsenal of chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by the middle of 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nApril 2014: Poison Gas\n\nAn attack in the village of Kfar Zeita sent streams of choking patients to hospital, and Syrian state television and antigovernment activists said that poison gas had been used in the rebel-held village in the central province of Hama.\n\nAccording to opposition activists, government helicopters dropped improvised bombs on the village, covering it with a thick smoke that smelled of chlorine. Syrian state television blamed the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, for the attack.\n\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said in a statement in September 2014 that it had collected evidence that chlorine had been used as a weapon, \u201csystematically and repeatedly,\u201d in three villages in northern Syria in April. A United Nations report also said chlorine attacks had taken place in April and May.\n\nMay 2015: Chlorine\n\nIn spring of 2015, two years after Mr. Assad agreed to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile, the smell of bleach hit the Syrian town of Sarmeen, making it difficult for residents to breathe.\n\nThat May, rescue workers began raising the alarm: There was growing evidence that the government was flouting international law to drop jerry-built chlorine bombs on insurgent-held areas.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The gas injures the respiratory tract, and, in some cases, can cause victims to choke to death as the lungs fill with fluid.\n\nHatem Abu Marwan, then 29, a rescue worker with the White Helmets civil defense organization, told The Times in 2015: \u201cWe know the sound of a helicopter that goes to a low height and drops a barrel. Nobody has aircraft except the regime.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council discussed a draft resolution that would create a panel, reporting to the secretary general, to determine which of the warring parties was responsible for using chlorine as a weapon. But Syrian state media dismissed it all as propaganda.\n\nPhoto\n\nAugust 2015: Mustard Gas\n\nLater that year, in August, the Syrian American Medical Society, a humanitarian group, said it had received more than 50 patients, 23 of whom showed symptoms of chemical exposure.\n\nSome had blisters associated with mustard gas after an attack in the city of Marea. A United Nations report blamed the Islamic State.\n\nSeptember 2016: Chlorine\n\nAnother attack in 2016 killed at least two people when barrels containing chlorine gas were dropped over a rebel-held section of Aleppo.\n\nUsing chlorine as a weapon is forbidden, but it was not included in the eradication of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons because it also has many civilian uses.\n\nPhoto\n\nApril 2017: Sarin\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, dozens of people, including children, died on April 4, 2017, in Khan Sheikhoun, in northern Syria, and hundreds more were injured in what was described as the worst chemical attack in years.\n\nThis time, the doctors and rescue workers suspected something beyond chlorine gas. Soon after, the Turkish health minister confirmed a preliminary report that the nerve agent sarin had been found in the blood and urine of victims who were evacuated to Turkey.\n\nIn response, President Trump ordered a military strike that fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Al Shayrat airfield, where the chemical weapons attack had originated.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia expressed doubt that the attack had happened and said it wasn\u2019t the Syrian government that possessed the chemical weapons \u2014 it was the insurgents fighting Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. The White House accused Russia of engaging in a cover-up.\n\nPhoto\n\nApril 2018: \u2018Chemical Agent\u2019\n\nIn the latest episode of violence, dozens of Syrians were killed in a suspected chemical attack in the rebel-held suburb of Douma, aid groups said on Sunday.\n\nThe Syrian Civil Defense and the Syrian American Medical Society said in a joint report that more than 500 people had gone to medical centers after the assault \u201cwith symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent.\u201d Symptoms included including trouble breathing, foaming at the mouth, burning eyes and the \u201cemission of a chlorine-like odor.\u201d\n\nThe attack could not be independently verified, but rescue workers reported that at least 49 people had died.

It could be a coincidence, though it is also notable that some of the things the women who have shaved their heads stand for represent a group of values and cultural beliefs that the administration does not share: gun control, L.G.B.T.Q. rights.\n\nPhoto\n\nHair is not solely a female issue, of course; men\u2019s hair is also fraught (hello, Samson; hello, skinheads). Though as Dr. Vearncombe said, \u201cbecause we focus so much attention on the head, especially on the female head, and because this attention is gendered, and because, more than anything, this attention is visible, absent hair on a woman\u2019s head can be read as disruptive to the politics of the male gaze. Looking at a woman\u2019s face, at her hair, has conventionally been an exercise of desire, and of an assertion of male power. Disrupting this convention, disrupting this gaze, allows us to see a different set of possibilities for the female head. The shaved head \u2018speaks\u2019 in a different way.\u201d\n\nAnd what is says is multitudes. It can sometimes speak of punishment: After World War II, women in France who were accused of being collaborators had their heads shaved in public; Natalie Portman\u2019s character in \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d had her head shaved during a torture scene. It can reflect discipline and toughness: See Demi Moore in \u201cG.I. Jane\u201d and Charlize Theron in \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d It can represent instability: When Britney Spears had her breakdown in 2007, she shaved her head in an act that has practically become a synonym in the pop lexicon for unstable. And it can be a direct riposte to a certain set of social and cultural values and expectations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an excerpt from her book published in i-D, Ms. McGowan wrote of shaving her head: \u201cI broke up with you. The collective you, the societal you. I broke up with the Hollywood ideal, the one that I had a part in playing.\u201d It was a way of rejecting, she wrote. \u201cThe ideal version of a woman that is sold to you by every actress in every hair commercial telling you, \u2018this the secret to being beguiling, the secret to getting a man to want you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is hair as seen through the Freudian lens, wherein the whole head becomes a stand-in for sexuality. Ms. McGowan later went on to say that her hair made her feel like a blowup sex doll. And yet, by rejecting it, by shaving it, she did not escape it (none of us do); she simply transformed its messaging.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Geraldine Biddle-Perry, an Associate Lecturer at Central Saint Martins and the co-editor of \u201cHair: Styling, Culture and Fashion,\u201d wrote in an email exchange, \u201cFor women who voluntarily cut/shave their hair, volition alters the symbolic grammar and so the act functions in terms of female agency and empowerment.\u201d\n\nWhich in turn raises the question of whether we are in for more head shaving, and whether that may ultimately lead to a time when, Dr. Vearncombe said, \u201cwe will not care about what a woman puts on or removes from her head.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible. Though given the history, gun control may have a better chance.", "title": "Buzzed: The Politics of Hair", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"]}

In Libya, Italy is accused of bribing some of the same militiamen who have long profited from the European smuggling trade \u2014 many of whom are also accused of war crimes.\n\nIn Sudan, crossed by migrants trying to reach Libya, the relationship is more opaque but rooted in mutual need: The Europeans want closed borders and the Sudanese want to end years of isolation from the West. Europe continues to enforce an arms embargo against Sudan, and many Sudanese leaders are international pariahs, accused of committing war crimes during a civil war in Darfur, a region in western Sudan.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the relationship is unmistakably deepening. A recent dialogue, named the Khartoum Process (in honor of Sudan\u2019s capital) has become a platform for at least 20 international migration conferences between European Union officials and their counterparts from several African countries, including Sudan. The European Union has also agreed that Khartoum will act as a nerve center for countersmuggling collaboration.\n\nWhile no European money has been given directly to any Sudanese government body, the bloc has funneled 106 million euros \u2014 or about $131 million \u2014 into the country through independent charities and aid agencies, mainly for food, health and sanitation programs for migrants, and for training programs for local officials.\n\n\u201cWhile we engage on some areas for the sake of the Sudanese people, we still have a sanction regime in place,\u201d said Catherine Ray, a spokeswoman for the European Union, referring to an embargo on arms and related material.\n\n\u201cWe are not encouraging Sudan to curb migration, but to manage migration in a safe and dignified way,\u201d Ms. Ray added.\n\nAhmed Salim, the director of one of the nongovernmental groups that receives European funding, said the bloc was motivated by both self-interest and a desire to improve the situation in Sudan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want migrants to cross the Mediterranean to Europe,\u201d said Mr. Salim, who heads the European and African Center for Research, Training and Development.\n\nBut, he said, the money his organization receives means better services for asylum seekers in Sudan. \u201cYou have to admit that the European countries want to do something to protect migrants here,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics argue the evolving relationship means that European leaders are implicitly reliant on \u2014 and complicit in the reputational rehabilitation of \u2014 a Sudanese security apparatus whose leaders have been accused by the United Nations of committing war crimes in Darfur.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere is no direct money exchanging hands,\u201d said Suliman Baldo, the author of a research paper about Europe\u2019s migration partnership with Sudan. \u201cBut the E.U. basically legitimizes an abusive force.\u201d\n\nOn the border near Abu Jamal, Lieutenant Omar and several members of his patrol are from the wing of the Sudanese security forces headed by Salah Abdallah Gosh, one of several Sudanese officials accused of orchestrating attacks on civilians in Darfur.\n\nElsewhere, the border is protected by the Rapid Support Forces, a division of the Sudanese military that was formed from the janjaweed militias who led attacks on civilians in the Darfur conflict. The focus of the group, known as R.S.F., is not counter-smuggling \u2014 but roughly a quarter of the people-smugglers caught in January and February this year on the Eritrean border were apprehended by the R.S.F., Lieutenant Omar said.\n\nEuropean officials have direct contact only with the Sudanese immigration police, and not with the R.S.F., or the security forces that Lieutenant Omar works for, known as N.I.S.S. But their operations are not that far removed.\n\nThe planned countertrafficking coordination center in Khartoum \u2014 staffed jointly by police officers from Sudan and several European countries, including Britain, France and Italy \u2014 will partly rely on information sourced by N.I.S.S., according to the head of the immigration police department, Gen. Awad Elneil Dhia. The regular police also get occasional support from the R.S.F. on countertrafficking operations in border areas, General Dhia said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey have their presence there and they can help,\u201d General Dhia said. \u201cThe police is not everywhere, and we cannot cover everywhere.\u201d\n\nYet the Sudanese police are operating in one unexpected place: Europe.\n\nIn a bid to deter future migrants, at least three European countries \u2014 Belgium, France and Italy \u2014 have allowed in Sudanese police officers to hasten the deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers, General Dhia said.\n\nNominally, their official role is simply to identify their citizens. But the officers have been allowed to interrogate some deportation candidates without being monitored by European officials with the language skills to understand what was being said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore than 50 Sudanese seeking asylum in Europe have been deported in the past 18 months from Belgium, France and Italy; The New York Times interviewed seven of them on a recent visit to Sudan.\n\nFour said they had been tortured on their return to Sudan \u2014 allegations denied by General Dhia. One man was a Darfuri political dissident deported in late 2017 from France to Khartoum, where he said he was detained on arrival by N.I.S.S. agents.\n\nOver the next 10 days, he said he was given electric shocks, punched and beaten with metal pipes. At one point the dissident, who asked that his name be withheld for his safety, lost consciousness and had to be taken to the hospital. He was later released on a form of parole.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The Regional Operational Center in Khartoum, set to open this year, will enable delegates from several European and African countries to share intelligence and coordinate operations against smugglers across North Africa.\n\nBut potential pitfalls are evident from past collaborations. In 2016, the British and Italian police, crediting a joint operation with their Sudanese counterparts, announced the arrest of \u201cone of the world\u2019s most wanted people smugglers.\u201d They said he was an Eritrean called Medhanie Yehdego Mered, who had been captured in Sudan and extradited to Italy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe case is now privately acknowledged by Western diplomats to have been one of mistaken identity. The prisoner turned out to be Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, an Eritrean refugee with the same first name as the actual smuggler. Mr. Mered remains at large.\n\nEven General Dhia now admits that Sudan extradited the wrong man \u2014 albeit one who, he says, admitted while in Sudanese custody to involvement in smuggling.\n\nBlack Sea ITALY TURKEY GREECE Mediterranean Sea Sabha SAUDI ARABIA LIBYA EGYPT Kufra Red Sea SUDAN NIGER Abu Jamal CHAD Khartoum Darfur ERITREA 500 miles S. SUDAN\n\n\u201cThere were two people, actually \u2014 two people with the same name,\u201d General Dhia said.\n\nMr. Berhe nevertheless remains on trial in Italy, accused of being Mr. Mered \u2014 and of being a smuggler.\n\nBeyond that, the Sudanese security services have long been accused of profiting from the smuggling trade. Following European pressure, the Sudanese Parliament adopted a raft of anti-smuggling legislation in 2014, and the rules have since led to the prosecution of some officials over alleged involvement in the smuggling business.\n\nBut according to four smugglers whom I interviewed clandestinely during my trip to Sudan, the security services remain closely involved in the trade, with both N.I.S.S and R.S.F. officials receiving part of the smuggling profits on most trips to southern Libya.\n\nThe head of the R.S.F., Brig. Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, has claimed in the past that his forces play a major role in impeding the route to Libya. But each smuggler \u2014 interviewed separately \u2014 said that the R.S.F. was often the main organizer of the trips, often supplying camouflaged vehicles to ferry migrants through the desert.\n\nAfter being handed over to Libyan militias in Kufra and Sabha, in southern Libya, many migrants are then systematically tortured and held for ransom \u2014 money that is later shared with the R.S.F., each smuggler said.\n\nRights activists have previously accused Sudanese officials of complicity in trafficking. In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said that senior Sudanese police officials had colluded in the smuggling of Eritreans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA British journalist captured by the R.S.F. in Darfur in 2016 said that he had been told by his captors that they were involved in smuggling people to Libya. \u201cI asked specifically about how it works,\u201d said the journalist, Phil Cox, a freelance filmmaker for Channel 4. \u201cAnd they said we make sure the routes are open, and we talk with whoever\u2019s commanding the next area.\u201d\n\nGeneral Dhia said that the problem did not extend beyond a few bad apples.

Kill the bill, kill the bill.\u201d\n\nDespite the disagreement, there was a broad consensus \u2014 among senators on the raised dais, among the constituents and lobbyists in the room \u2014 that housing costs remain a central issue.\n\n\u201cThis issue isn\u2019t going away,\u201d Mr. Wiener said.\n\nThe public reaction to the bill seemed to underscore that. Ever since Mr. Wiener introduced S.B. 827 on Jan. 3 \u2014 the first day of the legislative session \u2014 it has dominated the state\u2019s conversation about housing. The bill came up in political debates and candidate interviews, and cities across the state had votes on whether or not they supported it.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wiener added amendments to reduce the bill\u2019s height limits and strengthen protections for lower-income residents who might be displaced by demolition of older, more affordable buildings. But that did little to move the most entrenched opponents, and introducing it in an election year made it tough for lawmakers to support something so polarizing.\n\nSome of the fiercest opposition came from local governments arguing that the bill would strip them of land-use decisions. The bill was also opposed by groups concerned about gentrification in neighborhoods already pummeled by rising rents.\n\n\u201cThis bill will exacerbate an already perilous situation for tenants throughout the state,\u201d said Damien Goodmon, director of Housing Is a Human Right, a division of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. \u201cWe need to be talking about protective measures\u201d like rent control.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMore than anything else, the bill showed the political challenges of building housing in places where people already live \u2014 something California will almost certainly will have to do to make progress on this problem. In the 1950s and 1960s, California became the most populous state by constructing vast freeway and water systems that allowed developers to pave over farmland to build suburbs and house the swelling population. Today the biggest housing pressures are in the urbanized parts of the San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas.\n\nAnd yet, despite broad agreement that the state will probably need to house more of its population in places where infrastructure has already been developed, there seems to be little consensus on how to go about that. Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill split a number of constituencies, largely over just how far to go in prodding localities to build more housing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wiener pitched his bill as a way to combat climate change by fostering neighborhoods that allow more people to commute to work without car \u2014 a goal that almost every conservation group supports. But the California chapter of the Sierra Club opposed the bill, while other groups, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, stood in favor of it.\n\nLikewise, while a host of tenants\u2019 rights and anti-gentrification groups opposed the bill for fear it would displace lower-income residents, a number of scholars wrote a letter of support, saying it would help undo decades of racial segregation brought on by restrictive zoning.\n\nEven with the committee action, the idea of state intervention in what has historically been a local problem is unlikely to go away. Mr. Wiener vowed to bring back the bill. So this may be remembered as the start of a long negotiation over how to make cities less hostile to new construction.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year, Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor now running for governor, said that California was in \u201ccode red\u201d for housing affordability and that he liked the \u201cspirit\u201d of Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill, but he would not support it as written. \u201cI told him point blank, \u2018I would not sign this bill, but I love what you are doing.

It encompasses territory on the West Coast and adjacent states covering roughly one fifth of the U.S. population. Twenty-nine full-time judges sit on the court. Whereas the Supreme Court hears only about 75 cases a year, the Ninth Circuit hears thousands.\n\nBecause California and other western states continually innovate everything from the economy to social policy, the Ninth Circuit tends to hear an outsized portion of \u201cbig\u201d cases. It is no accident, therefore, that Judge Reinhardt found himself so often on panels asked to resolve cutting edge legal issues.\n\nQ: Who decides who will replace Judge Reinhardt \u2014 and how does it happen?\n\nMr. Matz: Federal judges are nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. Although presidents have traditionally consulted with home-state senators, President Trump and the G.O.P.-controlled Senate have largely abandoned that practice. Instead, they have moved at an aggressive pace to confirm deeply conservative judges.\n\nThere are several vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, now including Judge Reinhardt\u2019s seat.

The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they\u2019re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn\u2019t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.\n\nThis pattern \u2014 a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were \u2014 is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn\u2019t be; poor stewardship of user data isn\u2019t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we\u2019ve come to depend.\n\nPhoto\n\nExperiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service \u2014 maybe one you never even meant to interact with \u2014 knows things about you that you don\u2019t remember telling it.\n\nThe wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives\u2019 worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone \u2014 a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government \u2014 might, one day, discover new uses for the data.\n\nA loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that\u2019s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be \u2014 or merely became \u2014 the sorts of services we\u2019d rather not. They\u2019re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they\u2019re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they\u2019ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn\u2019t anywhere else to go.\n\nIn a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to \u201cmake sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.\u201d It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements \u2014 an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too.

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "For nearly 20 years, Williams worked as a contractor, building houses in Kansas City. But work dried up after the financial crisis hit in 2007. Williams decided to return to the family farm near Waverly, an area of gently rolling plains, and give farming a try. His family had farmed some when he was a teenager before leasing the land to tenants for years, and he knew it was difficult to make ends meet. But he was inspired by an article about a North Dakota rancher and farmer named Gabe Brown, who claimed to have developed, through trial and error, a more efficient and cost-effective way to farm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe gist of Brown\u2019s argument was that if you focus on the health of the soil and not on yield, eventually you come out ahead, not necessarily because you grow more corn or wheat per acre but because the reduction in spending on fertilizer and other inputs lets you produce each bushel of grain more cheaply. Williams decided to follow Brown\u2019s prescription. \u201cIf after three years, I\u2019m bankrupt, I\u2019ll admit it was a bad joke,\u201d Williams remembers thinking.\n\nSeven years later, his gamble seems to have paid off. He started with 60 acres, now farms about 2,000 and, when I visited last fall, had just purchased an additional 200. In one of his fields, we walked down a lane he had mowed through his warm-weather cover crops \u2014 plants grown not to be harvested, but to enrich the soil \u2014 which towered over us, reaching perhaps eight feet. They included sorghum, a canelike grass with red-tinted tassels spilling from the tops, mung beans and green-topped daikon radishes low to the ground. Each plant was meant to benefit the earth in a different way. The long radishes broke it up and drew nutrients toward the surface; tall grasses like sorghum produced numerous fine rootlets, adding organic material to the land; legumes harbored bacteria that put nitrogen into the soil. His 120-strong herd of British white cattle \u2014 he introduced livestock in 2013 \u2014 would eventually eat through the field, turning the plants into cow patties and enriching the soil further. Then he would plant his cash crops. \u201cHad I not found this way to farm,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe would not be farming.\u201d\n\nA mat of dead vegetation \u2014 from cover crops, cash-crop residue and dung \u2014 covered Williams\u2019s fields. The mulch, along with his cover crops, inhibited weeds from becoming established, a major concern for conventional farmers, because so many weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. \u201cI don\u2019t lie awake at night wondering how I\u2019m going to kill weeds,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWilliams doesn\u2019t till his fields. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming prevents erosion, helps retain moisture and leaves the soil ecosystem \u2014 worms, fungi, roots and more \u2014 mostly intact. At one of his soybean fields, Williams showed me how this translated to soil with \u201cstructure.\u201d \u201cSee how that crumbles into a cottage-cheese look?\u201d he said, massaging a fistful of earth. Small clods fell through his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want.\u201d Worm holes riddled the dirt, giving it a spongelike quality that was critical, he said, for absorbing rain and preventing runoff. Weather patterns seemed to be changing, he noted. Rain used to arrive in numerous light storms. Now fewer storms came, but they were more intense. \u201cWe have to be able to capture rain and store it,\u201d he said.\n\nBy focusing on soil health, Williams says he has reduced his use of herbicides by 75 percent and fertilizers by 45 percent. He doesn\u2019t use pesticides \u2014 he relies instead on beneficial insects for pest control \u2014 and he saves money by not buying expensive genetically modified, herbicide-resistant seed. He estimates that he produces a bushel of soybeans for about 20 percent less than his conventionally farming neighbors. Last fall, he claims, his yields ranked among the highest in the county. While doing all this, he has so far raised the amount of soil organic matter, a rough predictor of soil carbon concentrations, from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent in some fields. Gabe Brown, for his part, says he has more than tripled his soil carbon since the 1990s. And an official with the U.S.D.A.\u2019s Agricultural Research Service confirmed to me that the amount of carbon in Brown\u2019s soil \u2014 what his farming has pulled from the atmosphere \u2014 was between two and three times as high as it was in his neighbors\u2019 land.\n\nThe successes of Brown and Williams suggest that farmers can increase carbon in the soil while actually reducing their overall expenses. This could be vital, because in order for carbon farming to have an impact on the climate, as much land as possible, including both crop- and rangeland, will have to be included in the effort.\n\nCritics of regenerative agriculture say that it can\u2019t be adopted broadly and intensively enough to matter \u2014 or that if it can, the prices of commodities might be affected unfavorably. Mark Bradford, a professor of soils and ecosystem ecology at Yale, questions what he sees as a quasi-religious belief in the benefits of soil carbon. The recommendation makes sense intuitively, he told me. But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn\u2019t been quantified, making it somewhat \u201cfaith-based.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWilliam Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that \u201cregenerative\u201d practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven\u2019t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. He thinks the climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold.\n\nWilliams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger\u2019s broader point \u2014 about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases \u2014 is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren\u2019t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example. What they do demonstrate is that augmenting soil carbon while farming is not only possible, but also beneficial, even in a business sense. And that makes the prospect of rolling out these practices on a larger scale much easier to imagine.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe carbon-farming idea is gathering momentum at a time when national climate policy is backsliding. The Trump administration has reversed various Obama-era regulations meant to combat or adapt to climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, which required power plants to reduce their carbon emissions, and a rule instructing the federal government to consider sea-level rise and other effects of a changing climate when building new roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\n\nIn the absence of federal leadership on climate \u2014 and as emissions continue to rise globally, shrinking the time available to forestall worst-case outcomes \u2014 state and local governments (as well as nonprofits) have begun to look into carbon farming. Last year, Hawaii passed legislation meant to keep it aligned with the Paris agreement, which President Trump has said he will abandon; the state has also created a task force to research carbon farming. The New York state assemblywoman Didi Barrett introduced legislation that would make tax credits available to farmers who increase soil carbon, presumably through methods like those employed by Darin Williams and Gabe Brown. A bill to educate farmers about soil has been proposed in Massachusetts. And in Maryland, legislation focused on soil health passed in 2017. Other carbon-farming projects are in the works in Colorado, Arizona and Montana.\n\nBut it is California, already in the vanguard on climate-mitigation efforts, that has led the way on carbon farming. By 2050, the state aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 20 percent of what they were in 1990. Nearly half its 58 counties have farmers and ranchers at various stages of developing and implementing carbon-farming plans. San Francisco, which already has the largest urban composting program in the country, hopes to become a model carbon-farming metropolis. Cities don\u2019t have much room to plant trees or undertake other practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere, says Deborah Raphael, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of the Environment. But they can certainly produce plenty of compost. \u201cIf we can show other cities how doable it is to get green waste out of landfills, we can prove the concept,\u201d Raphael told me. \u201cWe like to say that San Francisco rehearses the future.\u201d\n\nMany of California\u2019s carbon-farming efforts owe a debt to Wick, Creque and Silver. In 2008, they founded the Marin Carbon Project, a consortium of ranchers, scientists and land managers. The goal is to develop science-based carbon-farming practices and to help establish the incentives needed to encourage California farmers to adopt them. Silver continues to publish her findings in respected journals. Creque also started a nonprofit, the Carbon Cycle Institute, that assists farmers and ranchers in making carbon-farming plans.\n\nWick has thrown himself into the policy realm, hiring a lobbyist in Sacramento to push a carbon-farming agenda. (In 2014, he even testified before Congress, outlining the project\u2019s discoveries and explaining how compost could increase soil carbon on public lands. He deliberately mentioned \u201cclimate\u201d only once.) Educating policymakers matters because, as Torri Estrada, executive director of the Carbon Cycle Institute, points out, carbon-mitigation efforts that focus on agriculture can be much cheaper per ton of carbon avoided than the flashier energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects that usually get most of the attention. The major obstacle to their implementation, he says, is that government officials don\u2019t understand or know about them.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Healthy Soils Initiative, which Wick helped shape, explicitly enlists agriculture in the fight against climate change. In principle, that means this carbon farmers can receive money from the state\u2019s climate-mitigation funds not just for compost but also for 34 other soil-improving practices already approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That\u2019s important because the compost needed to cover just a few acres can cost thousands of dollars. Wick has also tried to tap federal funding. Once N.R.C.S. scientists vet Silver\u2019s work, a compost amendment could become the service\u2019s 35th recommendation. As a result, farm bill money, which farmers receive to subsidize food production, could help finance carbon farming done according to Wick\u2019s protocol \u2014 not to fight climate change explicitly (which is now seen as politicized), but to bolster the health of soil (which isn\u2019t).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a carbon-farming tool, compost bears some notable advantages \u2014 namely, it works both preventively and correctively. Composting prevents emissions from the starter material \u2014 manure, food scraps \u2014 that, if allowed to decompose, might emit potent greenhouse gases. (About one-fifth of United States methane emissions comes from food and other organic material decomposing in dumps.) By enhancing plant growth, it also aids in removing carbon from the atmosphere, a corrective process. And because the carbon in nearly all organic material was originally pulled from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, compost that enters the soil represents the storage of carbon removed from the air earlier \u2014 the grass eaten by cows that became manure, or the trees that became wood chips \u2014 and at a different location. That, too, is corrective.\n\nCalla Rose Ostrander, Wick\u2019s right-hand person at the Marin Carbon Project, told me that the project\u2019s greater goal is to completely reframe how we think about waste, to see it as more than a nuisance \u2014 to recognize it as a resource, a tool that can help us garden our way out of the climate problem. Before the modern era, farmers had no choice but to return human and animal waste to the fields. (Wick is looking into the possibility of composting human waste as well; the end product is called humanure.) In a sense, Wick and Ostrander seek to resurrect these ancient practices and, with the aid of modern science, to close the loop among livestock, plants, air and soil \u2014 and between cities and the agricultural land that feeds them.\n\nWhat seems to most impress experts about the Marin Carbon Project is the quality of Silver\u2019s research. Eric Toensmeier, the author of \u201cThe Carbon Farming Solution\u201d and a lecturer at Yale, says that the project figured out a new way to increase carbon storage on the semiarid grasslands that cover so much of the world. Jason Weller, the former head of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, told me that \u201cthe level of science investment is out of the ordinary, or extraordinary, for a group that is really self-started.\u201d Weller added that the agency\u2019s scientists still needed to vet the research, which they are in the midst of doing. In late 2016 the agency oversaw the application of compost to different California regions \u2014 inland, Southern, Northern \u2014 to see if land in various conditions would, like Wick\u2019s ranch, suck up atmospheric carbon.\n\nBut the group also has critics. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of their results and their claims,\u201d William Horwath, a soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, told me. He wants to see Silver\u2019s experiments replicated. This is the project\u2019s major weakness: Its big idea is based almost entirely on extrapolation from a few acres in California. At this point, it\u2019s impossible to say whether compost can cause land to become a carbon sponge in all climates and conditions, and for how long treated grassland will continue to take in and retain its carbon.\n\nCows, a flash point in any discussion about climate change, may also present problems. Ruminants burp methane, and while carbon farming does not require their presence, some argue that merely accepting them on the land undermines the goal of reaching a carbon-neutral or -negative future. Livestock emissions account for almost half the heat-trapping gases associated with agriculture, so an obvious way to reduce emissions is to decrease the number of cows on the planet. Instead of dumping compost on rangeland, says Ian Monroe, a lecturer on energy and climate at Stanford University, why not allow forests cleared for pasture to regrow, and change people\u2019s eating habits so they include less meat?\n\nCriticism is directed at compost too. The stuff requires energy to produce; huge machines are required to shred the material and keep it aerated. And it\u2019s unclear if compost, like synthetic fertilizer, can cause nitrogen pollution when put on the land, or how much greenhouse gas composting itself generates. (As long as compost mounds are regularly aerated to prevent low-oxygen conditions, composting is thought to produce few emissions.)\n\nOrganic material from municipal sources can contain bits of plastic and glass, which no one wants on their fields. Manure might carry seeds of invasive plants. (Silver has seen no evidence of this.) Spreading compost on public rangeland could disrupt plant communities, squeezing out species adapted to conditions of scarcity. And in any carbon-farming scheme, who will monitor and verify that far-flung stretches of land are really absorbing and storing the carbon as they\u2019re supposed to?\n\nHorwath considers the amount of compost used in Silver\u2019s research \u2014 about 10 times the usual application, he estimates \u2014 to be unrealistically high for practical use. \u201cIt seems an inordinately large amount to apply to any system,\u201d he told me. And given what he sees as the many unknowns in Silver\u2019s research, that compost would be put to better use on cropland where, he says, scientists know with greater certainty that it could improve water retention and the efficiency of fertilizer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem of supply. Demand for San Francisco\u2019s compost, which mostly goes to vineyards in California\u2019s wine country, already outstrips what\u2019s available. But Wick thinks more starter material shouldn\u2019t be hard to find: Americans throw out between 30 and 40 percent of all the food they buy, sending it to landfills where it rots and generates greenhouse gases. Silver has calculated that there\u2019s enough organic waste material in California to treat one-quarter of its rangeland every few decades.\n\nStill, given the energy requirements, the logistical headaches and the cost, skeptics question whether spreading compost across extensive portions of the world\u2019s surface \u2014 including conflict zones in the Sahel or Central Asia \u2014 is really feasible. Even if it is, soils probably can\u2019t soak up carbon indefinitely. If they have a saturation point, increases in carbon will eventually stop when that moment is reached. And because soil degradation can cause the release of whatever carbon it holds, treated lands would have to be well cared for in perpetuity.\n\nOn a cool autumn day at Wick and Rathmann\u2019s ranch house, Wick fielded phone calls while I wandered around the cluttered, semicircular room that served as his office and meeting space. A whiteboard displayed scribbles from a presentation on the carbon cycle. Coils of warmly hued yarn hung from the doorways. They came via a local nonprofit dedicated to climate-friendly ranching practices called Fibershed. And draped over a chair was a T-shirt bearing what might as well have been Wick\u2019s battle cry: \u201cseq-C,\u201d it read, punny shorthand for \u201csequester carbon.\u201d Under that it read, \u201cDoing it in the dirt.\u201d\n\nDown the road, he showed me a composting facility that Creque dreamed up initially. He and Wick hoped it would serve as a self-sustaining prototype. \u201cAnything that has ever been alive can be composted,\u201d he told me, surveying the 10-foot-tall piles of chicken droppings and feathers, horse bedding (manure and straw) and shredded trees. A tractor mixed woody refuse with animal waste \u2014 to get the composting process started requires the right mix of carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "The researchers begin by extirpating some common myths. Are our health care costs astronomically high because we don\u2019t have enough primary-care doctors? No; the number of primary-care physicians in the United States lies squarely in the middle of the 11 countries. Is our population more prone to illness? Yes and no; Americans smoke fewer cigarettes and drink less alcohol, but our rate of obesity is highest. Do we pay more for health care because we use more health care? Again, at face value, no. As a country, we went to the hospital about half as often as the Germans. We consulted doctors about a third as often as the Japanese. We beat the stoic Swiss and the frugal Dutch in the number of days that we spent in the hospital.\n\nSo what is driving the cost? Each time we did go to a doctor, it seems, we managed to spend more. Tests were ordered more frequently: We sat inside M.R.I. and CT scanners more often than patients in most other countries. We had high-cost surgical procedures performed more often than most other populations in the world. Knee replacements, cataract surgeries, cesarean deliveries, coronary-bypass grafts, angioplasty. Not every procedure was performed more frequently, Jha reminded me; hip-replacement rates were slightly lower, and the C-section rate, albeit high, was essentially tied with that of three other countries. On average, though, the United States ranked among the highest in most operations. Many of these procedures cost more in America (an M.R.I. costs $1,150 in the United States and $140 in Switzerland; it\u2019s hard to insist that an American M.R.I. is eight times as good). And some of these procedures inevitably led to complications, and then we paid for those complications. The impact on overall life expectancy was evidently minimal. The United States leads developed nations in what the surgeon and writer Atul Gawande has called an epidemic of \u201covertesting, overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\u201d\n\nIf expensive procedures explain some of the costs accrued by Americans, pharmaceutical prices and spending offer an even more alarming explanation. We spent $1,443 annually per person (yes, you read that number right) on drugs \u2014 in part because each medicine costs us more, and in part because we used new drugs that weren\u2019t even available in many other countries. Humira, the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, was priced at $2,500 per month in the United States versus $980 in Japan and France. Lantus, the long-acting form of insulin, cost us $186 per month, four times the price in France. Adding pharmaceutical insult to injury, many more expensive drugs were invented in America \u2014 and yet we paid more than any other rich nation to use them ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study\u2019s authors also analyzed the costs of labor, salaries and administration. American doctors and nurses were paid substantially more than their European, Canadian or Japanese counterparts. But as Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and bioethicist, noted in an accompanying editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Americans also have fewer doctors per capita than many other countries, and so these salaries, weighted on a \u201cper patient\u201d basis, are only minimally higher than those in most countries. The administrative burdens were, however, disproportional and unique to American care. In one 2009 survey, the costs associated with doctors and nurses \u201cinteracting\u201d with health-insurance plans \u2014 a euphemism for those deadly hours spent filling out forms, recording prior authorizations and negotiating with insurers \u2014 amounted to more than $23 billion a year.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe three major factors identified by the researchers \u2014 administrative waste, pharmaceutical price and procedural cost \u2014 may provoke familiar-sounding solutions to the costs of health care. Decrease waste by removing unnecessary and burdensome paperwork. Drive down pharmaceutical prices \u2014 through negotiation on costs, for instance, or by enabling the introduction of generic alternatives for patent-expired medicines. And limit the use of high-cost, low-value procedures where possible.\n\nBut what of the Khullar conundrum? What can an individual doctor do to fix health care costs? At first glance, the prescriptions prompted by the study\u2019s authors seem dispiriting: The solutions are abstract and political, and they lie outside the realm of medical practice. Yet if you look more closely, this essential quandary of medicine may require a medical solution. Among the problems of American health care is a startling dissociation between \u201ccost\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d: We pay more, but we often don\u2019t get more. How might anyone restore the cost-value balance? In part, of course, through legislative and administrative reform, via political and public pressure. But in part, also, by deploying powerful tools that are newly at our disposal \u2014 genetics, epidemiology, computational analysis, biochemistry.\n\nWe might try to find, say, deep biological markers that would identify the few men and women who will benefit substantially from Brilinta over Plavix (perhaps the man with the heart attack would return for a blood test, or have his genes sequenced, to identify him as a likely responder); to define the subsets of elderly people who won\u2019t benefit from a knee replacement (perhaps some combination of anatomical and physiological features predicts the lack of benefit); to identify women normally asked to have cesarean deliveries who can safely have vaginal births.\n\nThese strategies, if successful, will focus treatments on those most likely to benefit, reducing expenditures and complications. The big hope, yet unfulfilled, is that such treatment will ultimately increase value and decrease overall cost (in recent times, the focusing of medicines on subsegments of patients has resulted only in more expensive drugs). It\u2019s the sort of medicine that might treat medicine\u2019s cost crisis. It\u2019s the kind of problem that a young doctor might learn to love.", "title": "Can Doctors Choose Between Saving Lives and Saving a Fortune?", "authors": ["Siddhartha Mukherjee", "On Medicine"]}

The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit \u201copt in\u201d for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected.\n\nThis didn\u2019t last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements.\n\nFortunately, the European Union\u2019s law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn\u2019t respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact.\n\nInternet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person\u2019s data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation.

{"date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "The Algerian government manages such statistics with prudence. Too large a number of Algerian emigrants would be evidence of its shortcomings and serve as fodder for its opponents. Yet too small a figure couldn\u2019t mobilize public opinion against the exodus.\n\nThe harga already signals the authorities\u2019 failing twice over. First, it\u2019s proof that the government hasn\u2019t managed to build a nation that is attractive to its own people. And the government\u2019s disastrous attempts to stem the problem have only made it worse: Emigration has increased since the state criminalized it in 2009. (Any citizen or resident of Algeria who tries to leave the country illicitly is subject to a fine and a prison term of two to six months.)\n\nWas it fair to penalize the victims of a national failure? Worse, the law designed to do that, controversial from the outset, has turned out to be ineffective.\n\nAnd so the government has resorted to other methods. To block emigration with more than the coast guard, it has begun tapping conservative media. Those outlets publish appeals to patriotism and numerous reports about shipwreck victims, disconsolate parents, disillusioned returnees and mistreatment in Spanish refugee camps. In February, Echorouk, a popular Islamist newspaper, ran a teaser of a headline that claimed \u201cgangs\u201d were stealing the organs of some migrants and contaminating others with H.I.V. (The article itself contained hardly a word about any of this.)\n\nMore spectacular and more problematic still, the government has mobilized the religious to help with its messaging. Early this year, it called on imams for help. The Higher Islamic Council, the country\u2019s most important religious body, decreed that the harga was haram, contrary to religious law, and a sin.\n\nBut the move backfired with at least one segment of the public. Some people have asked: How can these religious men declare the right to leave to be a sin while staying silent about repression, corruption, ecological destruction and the lifetime mandate of a president who won\u2019t die? Such criticism puts the minister of religious affairs in a bind \u2014 and so he has defended the imams, but not too much. To say nothing would have amounted to passively watching a tragedy unfold; to say anything more would have been an attack on his own administration. He also announced that the government would consider offering young people favorable terms for bank loans.\n\nOddly, the flow of harragas leaving Algeria seems to both offset and imitate the flow of immigrants who come to Algeria from sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 only to be welcomed here with indifference at best, and more often with violent racism. Besides, the regime\u2019s apparatchiks are exiling their own children even as they condemn the harga. Why? Because illegal emigration is a sort of indirect denunciation \u2014 against the lack of democracy and clean elections, the lack of the right to free expression or, simply, to happiness. One votes \u201cno\u201d by leaving the country \u2014 and all the more so when leaving for Europe, which many Algerian conservatives and political or religious leaders hold responsible for nearly all of our great ills.\n\nOn their makeshift boats, departing migrants often sing instead of staying silent and being discreet. They seem to be mocking those who stay behind. Really, they are yelling things at the government from the sea that for years they didn\u2019t dare tell it to its face. To leave illegally is, above all, to speak out.", "title": "Opinion | Can It Be Illegal to Leave Your Country?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "Albright does this via an examination of cases in Europe and America from World War I through the present day. From this, some patterns emerge.\n\nFirst, fascism flourishes alongside economic, social and political chaos. Take the classic cases of interwar Germany and Italy. The Weimar Republic was buffeted by the Great Inflation and the Great Depression, violent left- and right-wing uprisings and the humiliation of a lost war, together with a punitive peace. Interwar Italy was battered by high inflation and unemployment, and paralyzed for almost two years by strikes and lockouts as left- and right-wing gangs battled in the streets. These conditions resulted in citizens who were fearful and desperate.\n\nImage\n\nWhile the turmoil in Europe after World War I was extreme, Albright notes similar dynamics in other places and times: Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s recent rise to power was fueled by deteriorating social and economic conditions and growing inequality in Venezuela; Viktor Orban came to power as Hungary was experiencing the painful fallout of the financial crisis; and Vladimir Putin emerged as Russia was in the midst of economic and national decline similar to that experienced by interwar Germany. (During the 1990s Russia\u2019s economy shrank by more than half.)\n\nBut problems only become opportunities for fascists and other antidemocrats if their opponents can\u2019t or won\u2019t address them. A second factor emerging from Albright\u2019s cases is weak and divided oppositions. In interwar Italy liberal governments dithered while the country slid into chaos and the two largest parties, the Socialists and Christian Democrats, were more interested in defending the interests of their particular constituencies than democracy. In the Weimar Republic, the country\u2019s largest party, the Social Democrats, was more committed to democracy than its Italian counterpart, but it too faltered during the Great Depression and was continually attacked by antidemocratic left- and right-wing forces. While their opponents fought among themselves and let their country\u2019s troubles deepen, fascists offered voters simple explanations of their problems in the form of enemies like nefarious foreign powers or Jews, and simple solutions to them, namely replacing weak and unresponsive democracies with strong dictatorships truly responsive to \u201cthe people.\u201d Adolf Hitler once explained: \u201cI will tell you what has carried me to the position I have reached. Our political problems appeared complicated. The German people could make nothing of them. \u2026 I, on the other hand \u2026 reduced them to the simplest terms. The masses realized this and followed me.\u201d\n\nAlbright finds similar dynamics in many other cases. In her native Czechoslovakia after World War II the weakness of the country\u2019s president, Edvard Benes, facilitated Communism\u2019s takeover. In modern Hungary, the corruption and dishonesty of the governing Socialist party paved the way for Orban. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin\u2019s inability to halt his country\u2019s precipitous economic decline or the rapacious raiding of resources by oligarchs eased Putin\u2019s power grab.", "title": "Can It Happen Here?

Muslim women are not all victims, renegades or standard-bearers for religious or cultural authenticity. They are not foils with which to bash Islam or through which sympathetic Westerners can congratulate themselves on their cultural superiority.\n\nTrue solidarity with women in this part of the world means paying less attention to self-serving male rulers and to cosmetic official initiatives and more to the lively, often contentious debate taking place within Muslim societies, to the diverse voices of women here and to their ideas of how they want to advance their own cause. These voices are secular and religious, young and old; they are also often critical of Western policies in the region.\n\nInheritance inequality, Ms. Lamrabet told me, is part of an ideology that assumes that women are worth less and deserve less.

And they formed an alliance, the Clean Air Coalition, that includes leaders of organizations funded by the power company, among them a group of African-American pastors.\n\nThat\u2019s when the campaign became more than Bishop George McKinney could stand.\n\nBishop McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral Church of God in Christ here for the last 55 years, said he believed that those attacking the program, including fellow African-American clergy members, were doing so only because of financial support from the utility company.\n\n\u201cI think that the inner-city residents are being taken advantage of,\u201d the 85-year-old bishop said. \u201cThe cost of energy now is escalating in the community. There has to be someone who is willing to speak truth to power.\u201d\n\nThe move toward such government-run electricity programs, known as community choice aggregation, has been gathering steam over the last year in Southern California, with Los Angeles County adopting the effort and recruiting dozens of cities to enroll. Similar programs have been operating in Northern California for almost a decade.\n\nPhoto\n\nBroad success of the community choice movement in California could contribute to a substantial reshaping of the West\u2019s energy market. Managers of the state\u2019s complex power grid would have to factor in the supply agreements struck by these new energy players while ensuring that service remained reliable.\n\nSan Diego Gas and Electric, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, is one of California\u2019s three big shareholder-owned utilities, along with Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Together they serve about 70 percent of California\u2019s electricity customers and have been raising concerns about the impact of government-run utility programs on their businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe support customers\u2019 right to choose an energy provider that best meets their needs,\u201d said Helen Gao, a spokeswoman for the San Diego utility. \u201cAt the same time, we have an obligation to protect customers who remain.\u201d\n\nWhen local governments adopt community choice programs, they typically require the traditional utilities to maintain the network of power lines and often the billing for all customers. California programs are usually designed so that customers are automatically enrolled in community choice and must opt out to go back with the utility company.\n\nUtilities argue that the required services impose an unfair financial burden on them and ultimately their remaining customers.\n\nCalifornia regulators are expected to have a proposal by summer\u2019s end about how much community choice programs should pay the power companies in so-called exit fees to make up for the loss of customers.\n\nIf the fees are too high, though, community choice provides no savings to consumers. If the fees are too low, the utility companies might not be able to cover their costs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The city has a target date of 2035.\n\nAfter reviewing feasibility studies, city leaders determined that one of the few ways they could reach their goal was through a community choice program supported by the development of new solar and wind facilities locally and with neighboring California counties. In addition, any cost to carry out the program would be recouped within five years, they said, citing a Northern California county that covered its $2.7 million in expenses within two years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying these guys are bad and we\u2019re the white hats,\u201d Beth Vaughan, executive director of the California Community Choice Association, said about the utility companies. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is times are changing. It makes sense to me that the communities want to have a say.\u201d\n\nMark Pruitt, principal of the Illinois Community Choice Aggregation Network, said savings to ratepayers through the state\u2019s program had diminished over time from as high as 30 percent compared with the utility companies down to 5 percent or less.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen community choice programs begin, they have an advantage over utilities: Particularly with the falling prices of solar and wind power, they can often secure wholesale contracts at better terms than the long-term agreements that the incumbents are locked into.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn some cases, however, the utilities now offer lower rates in Illinois than the community choice programs, Mr. Pruitt said. Cities there determine each year whether to use the public program or the utility, based on the better deal. But about 50 to 60 percent of electricity customers in the state remain with the community choice programs.\n\n\u201cIt has forced better practice throughout the utility sector in Illinois,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said.\n\nBut the critics of San Diego\u2019s community choice proposal said they worried that it could drain the city\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cIt may double the budget at a time when we don\u2019t have the resources that we need,\u201d said the Rev. Gerald Brown, co-chairman of the Clear the Air Coalition. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any new taxes or any new rates at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown runs a nonprofit organization, the United African American Ministerial Action Council, that receives financial support from San Diego Gas and Electric.\n\nHe said the support had nothing to do with his criticism of the community choice proposal. He said he was troubled by an estimate that it could cost the city up to $2.8 billion to support the program \u2014 a worst-case scenario that the city says it no longer includes in its estimates because it was too far-fetched.\n\nMr. Brown and members of the Clear the Air Coalition also contend that similar government-run utility programs are not producing new alternative-energy projects as they promise. They noted that the utility produced 45 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources, and argued that community choice programs achieved their climate-friendly goals through purchases of clean energy credits rather than actual generation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about possible environmental fraud,\u201d said Haney Hong, another co-chairman of the coalition and the president and chief executive of the San Diego County Taxpayers Association. \u201cI feel like folks might be sold a bill of goods.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSan Diego officials said the city was not including renewable-energy credits in its assumptions in becoming carbon-free. (San Diego Gas and Electric also benefits from renewable-energy credits, but says most reflect power sources created specifically for the utility.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a fear-based campaign,\u201d said Nicole Capretz, executive director of the Climate Action Campaign, a group backing the community choice proposal, which she shaped while she was the city\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cThe utility is made whole. That\u2019s what\u2019s baffling.\u201d\n\nBishop McKinney said he believed that opponents of the plan had made up their minds prematurely, taking a position that would ultimately harm the disadvantaged and minorities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support the change,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cone possible means of equalizing and bringing justice to the table.\u201d", "title": "Can San Diego Ditch the Power Company?

{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "In fact, for all the \u201cthis was living\u201d justification of her drinking life, Jamison\u2019s book actually becomes more alive and more interesting in the second half, when she starts wrestling with her demons sober, which is to say really wrestling.\n\nJamison\u2019s prose is strikingly uneven. The writing itself seems tipsy: It can be energetic, colorful, fun, buzzy, affecting and spot on, but also loose, sloppy, digressive and excessively poetized at moments, veering into nebulous grandiosity. In \u201cThe Empathy Exams,\u201d Jamison\u2019s acclaimed book of essays, her writing benefited from the tighter form of the essay, whereas in this book, like a drunk spinning a colorful yarn at a party, she sometimes loses track of her audience and what we need to know. Her tale is bloated with detail about what she and various boyfriends did together too, while far too little is said about more central questions such as the curious lack of attempts at intervention by those boyfriends, not to mention her accomplished parents and her brothers. Perhaps she wants to preserve her family\u2019s privacy, but, of course, the need for privacy is at odds with the needs of a memoir.\n\nThe redeeming grace of the book is Jamison\u2019s honesty. She shared at an A.A. meeting that before she gets out of the car, she makes sure to turn the radio from the pop station she was enjoying to NPR in order to impress her boyfriend, and a woman in the meeting laughed and warmed up to her \u2014 and so will readers. Just when her self-indulgence becomes wearying, she cuts through it with a critique of her own self-absorption. She chooses to share many unflattering moments, both large and small. There was the time, for example, when she was living with her dying grandmother in order to take care of her, but instead she spent her nights holed upstairs in her room drinking wine she pinched from the hotel where she worked and her mornings trying to write her novel about alcoholism through a hangover. (In fact, her sense of moral failing was so keen that she was driven to ease her guilt with more booze.)\n\nEmotional, as well as factual, honesty is the sine qua non of a memoir. Yet this kind of deep honesty \u2014 the merciless self-examination and exposure that Jamison displays \u2014 is increasingly rare in memoirs now that readers can, and will, attack them online. And many memoirists no longer feel the literary necessity of self-scrutiny, as the advertisements-for-myself-style writing on social media has been culturally validated.\n\nThe book is at its least successful when Jamison diverges from alcoholism to the larger social issue of criminalization of drug addiction, including the persecution of pregnant drug abusers and the targeting of minorities in the war on drugs. She trots out familiar arguments (that addicts should be suffering from a disease, not criminals) that may be true, but fail to advance the conversation. Attempts to link those arguments to her story seem more than a little strained. She writes about the infamous case of Marcia Powell \u2014 a mentally ill prostitute and crystal meth addict who died of heat exposure in 2009 in an outdoor holding cell in the Arizona desert. \u201cMy story included the woman who died in a cage in a desert, or her story included me; not just because of my guilt \u2014 the guilt of my privilege, or my survival \u2014 but because we both put things inside our bodies to change how we felt,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe analogy seems like such a stretch that it belies the truth of each of their experiences. Jamison writes that while society would prefer to view the two women separately, she rejects that narrative \u2014 an assertion that seems like a clumsy attempt to ward off potential (unfair) criticism that her social privilege makes her own suffering an unworthy topic. Likewise, at the close of the book, she writes of the recovering alcoholics she met in A.A.: \u201cIn Iowa, in Kentucky, in Wyoming. In Los Angeles, in Boston, in Portland. I could say I wrote this book for all of them \u2014 for all of us \u2014 or I could say they wrote this book for me.\u201d Identification rendered that broadly \u2014 the fantasy that the similarity between her and other addicts is so great that those strangers could actually have written her memoir \u2014 feels fulsome and so simplistic as to be almost silly.\n\nThe book is dedicated to \u201canyone addiction has touched.\u201d Such readers will doubtless relate to her story and be grateful for her honesty and insight. But what about readers who do not have a personal interest in the subject? Jamison\u2019s book falls into that vast category of good books that tantalize the reader with all the ways in which they could have been better.", "title": "Can Sobriety Be as Interesting as Addiction?

His original character, Scarlet, which he created with the artist Alex Maleev, has been picked up by a television network that Mr. Bendis said he couldn\u2019t yet name.\n\nHe\u2019s fully aware, however, of the limitations of comics. After all, to date, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d has made $667 million domestically, and become a pinpoint in popular culture \u2014 but that won\u2019t mean $667 million in new comic book sales for the Black Panther character.\n\n\u201cThat has never has happened,\u201d Mr. Bendis said, referring to the bump effect of a popular film. \u201cSince the Christopher Reeve Superman movie, there\u2019s just people who will never read anything \u2014 comics, magazines, books; they love their television and film.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the way they want to experience these characters,\u201d Mr. Bendis added. \u201cBut inside that mix is a group of people, usually young people like myself when I was a kid, that finds a character that captivates you, and someone says you should read the comic, and all of a sudden you\u2019re reading the comic and are a die-hard fan of comics. You become a die-hard fan of the medium.\u201d\n\nMr. Bendis, who lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Alisa, and their four children, was born in Cleveland, the older of two brothers, and raised by their mother. At age 6, when he discovered that writing and drawing comic books was an actual profession, he declared that someday he would be the artist on Spider-Man. By 19, he managed, after a rejection, to get accepted by the Cleveland Institute of Art. While still in the city, he began drawing cartoons for The Plain Dealer while also working on independent comics that brought him critical if not financial success. In order to stay afloat, Mr. Bendis worked as a caricature artist, even at bar mitzvahs and weddings.\n\nThen came Marvel. Mr. Bendis, who began writing for the publisher in 1999, can remember vividly the moribund offices in New York as the company crawled out of its 1996 bankruptcy. This was not the raucous center of counterculture that Stan Lee had romanticized in the 1960s. This was a broken company, one where even the filing cabinets were being put up for sale. At the time, he wondered if he was going to be the person to write the final Marvel comic.", "title": "Can This Man Save Superman?", "authors": []}

The encounters frequently involved minor issues like loitering \u2014 a situation analogous to the Philadelphia Starbucks incident. Over a six-week period, the officers selected to have those conversations were about 12 percent less likely to resolve an incident with an arrest.\n\n\u201cWe were getting the police officers to slow down their thinking,\u201d said Emily Owens, an economist at the University of California, Irvine, who was one of the researchers. Although the study didn\u2019t look explicitly at arrest rates by race, Ms. Owens argued that, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not automating, and you\u2019re thinking slowly, bias is less likely to influence your behavior.\u201d (Ms. Owens stressed that the study was only suggestive and that overall the evidence on the effectiveness of bias training for police is very thin.)\n\nStill, Joelle Emerson, chief executive of Paradigm, which advises companies on strategies for increasing diversity, argued that limiting employees\u2019 discretion altogether can be a far more effective way of reducing bias than trying to alter their thinking.\n\nWell-understood policies that leave less room for discretion can often save employees from having to make decisions that reflect bias, said Ms. Emerson, whose company advises several retailers. For example, rather than generally urging employees to keep an eye out for suspicious-looking customers in order to cut down on shoplifting, which can prompt sales associates to follow customers of certain races at disproportionate rates, stores concerned about theft might want to adopt a clear, uniformly applied security protocols.\n\n\u201cThe whole challenge of implicit bias is that we\u2019re not the best judges of when it\u2019s impacting us,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Emerson pointed to hiring, another area that is often rife with unconscious bias.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "There are very rational explanations to account for the cloud that suddenly hangs over the league\u2019s overwhelming preseason favorites heading into the start of the 2018 playoffs.\n\nStephen Curry, the two-time M.V.P. guard, played in only one of Golden State\u2019s final 17 games after suffering a knee sprain just as he\u2019d recovered from a sprained ankle. Curry\u2019s absence, combined with a nagging flurry of injuries around him, rendered the Warriors\u2019 last dozen or so games meaningless; catching Houston in the race for the West\u2019s No. 1 overall seed was, realistically, out of reach. Those factors inevitably combined to chip away at the Warriors\u2019 intensity, discipline and focus and, by season\u2019s end, dropped them from their customary top-five slot in defensive efficiency all the way down to No. 9.\n\nGolden State\u2019s hope is that a return to high-stakes basketball, after grinding through a seemingly interminable regular season to get there, will usher this team back to its usual standards and thus back to its happy place. But a measure of gloom, for all the rationalizations, has been hard for the Warriors to shake as Saturday\u2019s Game 1 against the pesky San Antonio Spurs \u2014 sans Curry \u2014 draws near.\n\nFor the past few years, Golden State seemed to be the one powerhouse impervious to the seminal claim of Pat Riley, the legendary coach and executive, that winning or misery were the only state-of-mind options for the N.B.A. elite. It was just two short years ago that the Warriors defied conventional wisdom and relentlessly chased a record 73 wins in the regular season, finding great enjoyment in their quest amid the incessant chatter of naysayers who insisted that the extra gas guzzled to get there would lead to a fatal fuel shortage in the postseason.\n\nThis, however, is Year 4 of Golden State\u2019s run as the N.B.A.\u2019s modern-day version of the Beatles. Kerr remembers how mentally draining it was just to drag through three seasons like this as a player, specifically as a teammate to Michael Jordan before Jordan\u2019s second retirement from the Chicago Bulls. He has, for months, been warning anyone who would listen about how hard it would be to keep this group consistently plugged in \u2014 even with a shot to win the first back-to-back titles in the Warriors\u2019 evolution.\n\nKerr was right. Bliss is not a given, even with a roster like this.\n\nHow joyful can the Warriors really be, for that matter, when the prime supplier of their let-it-fly frolic \u2014 Curry \u2014 is out of the lineup?\n\nThe only real surprise here, according to the former Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin, is that the Warriors dodged such a malaise for as long as they did.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very predictable,\u201d said Griffin, who has been working as an analyst for NBA TV and Sirius XM Radio as he awaits his eventual return to front-office work after his own tension-filled stint in charge of the Cavaliers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was amazed that they found a way to remain the joy engine they were for the previous three years of the run. But when you have the shortest turnaround in league history and hear all off-season that you can\u2019t be beaten, you\u2019re going to have to battle complacency.\n\n\u201cThey have been together longer than any other group and have been grinding longer mentally than everyone other than Cleveland.

Griffin\u2019s old team practically bathes in torment, perhaps because LeBron James, after spending four years in Miami, seems to have adopted the Riley way as his own.\n\nOver in Houston, meanwhile, the Rockets general manager Daryl Morey inspired a lengthy story this week in The Houston Chronicle about his inability to stomach watching games in person, even though he assembled the Rockets squad that just won a franchise-record 65 games and has been picked in some corners to unseat Golden State as the Western Conference champion.\n\nIn the wake of the Chronicle story, I asked Morey why it\u2019s so hard for even the best teams to have fun. It is sports, after all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to explain it well,\u201d Morey said. \u201cThe only analogy I can think of is how people feel when they are close to something they have worked for and wanted for a very long time. It is stressful. Add in that the odds are long every year, and you get pain as the dominant feeling.\u201d\n\nNo one, mind you, is ever going to feel sorry for a juggernaut like the Warriors, after two championships in the past three seasons and given the talent Myers has assembled. That\u2019s especially true when San Antonio has only had the All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard in uniform for nine games all season and when the two biggest threats to the Warriors besides Houston \u2014 Oklahoma City and Utah \u2014 are on the Rockets\u2019 side of the playoff bracket. Golden State may not have Curry back until Round 2, and it faces uncertainty about the reliability of its bench, but it will only have to face one of those three troublesome teams to get back to a fourth successive N.B.A. finals.\n\nNot that the Warriors can dare to assume anything. They haven\u2019t played well enough in the season\u2019s second half, and certainly haven\u2019t been healthy enough, to avoid being questioned, psychoanalyzed and doubted like never before in this four-season stretch. And just imagine what happens if Leonard makes an unexpected comeback in this series.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo for his own reassurance, Myers turns to Kerr.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s probably the best person in the world to try to navigate a team through what we\u2019ve experienced, because he\u2019s actually lived it as a player,\u201d Myers said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m always asking him what we should expect.\n\n\u201cBut the reason sports generates so much passion is because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

But since he last ran for office, in 2006, when he won all 95 counties, his party has suffered a string of defeats: only in Nashville and Memphis do Democrats hold congressional seats; at the state level, Democrats have been reduced to superminority status in both houses, meaning they are not even needed for the Legislature to hold session.\n\nWhy then did Mr. Bredesen, at 74, dive back into the political fray? Associates say that he never would have challenged Mr. Corker, a friend and, like him, a former mayor and businessman, but the thought of losing a nominal check on Mr. Trump bothered him. And even last fall, before the Democrat Doug Jones beat Roy Moore for a Senate seat in Alabama, internal Democratic polls put him slightly ahead of Ms. Blackburn in a state that Donald Trump carried by 26 percentage points.\n\nMs. Blackburn, on the other hand, was ready made for the Trump era. As a state senator she hounded Mr. Sundquist on taxes; after jumping to Congress, she became an at-the-ready Obama critic who spent the last decade as a fixture on cable news outlets. She\u2019s one of the president\u2019s strongest defenders in Congress, voting with him 91 percent of the time.\n\nBut a statewide campaign in Tennessee is not like running in a safe House district or doing another segment on Fox News.

As commuter traffic has intensified over the past several years, it\u2019s become increasingly dangerous to walk along Main Street.\n\nThe mayor of my tiny Virginia town has worked incessantly to fix this, by fostering walkability and traffic-calming measures since he ran for town council in the 1990s. I\u2019m determined to help him: I want to walk with my daughter to the playground or the farmer\u2019s market without fearing for her safety.\n\nOur mayor is liberal. He drives around town with an Obama \u201908 bumper sticker on his car. I am a conservative, pro-life Christian; in 2016, I voted for Evan McMullin for president. But our partisan political differences mean nothing when it comes to caring for this town and making it better. Here at the local level, our interests intertwine: They are practical, achievable, even apolitical.\n\nThis is localism, a bottom-up, practically oriented way of looking at today\u2019s biggest policy dilemmas. Instead of always or only seeking to fix municipal issues through national policy, localism suggests that communities can and should find solutions to their own particular problems, within their own particular contexts.

{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "Crucially, these voters made up their minds very late in the race. In September, 68 percent thought they would vote for a third-party candidate or were undecided. This changed little by mid-October. In this poll, taken during the height of the controversy over the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, 54 percent still intended to vote third party or were undecided. This group didn\u2019t break for Mr. Trump until the very end of the race, when they returned to their party preferences to reluctantly back the Republican over the Democrat.\n\nRepublicans who want to reverse the special election trends of 2017-18 must incorporate these findings into their messaging and campaigns. Simply encouraging partisans to vote won\u2019t be enough: These swing voters still don\u2019t like Mr. Trump, and they don\u2019t respond to simple, partisan appeals.\n\nInstead, Republicans need to focus on the voters\u2019 choice in November. Their midterm votes will not be a consequence-free way to express displeasure with the White House; their vote will empower Democrats to do the very things these voters don\u2019t want them to do.\n\nThis also requires the right use of imagery and pictures for television ads and staged events. That means knowing exactly who these voters are: They are disproportionally employed, married men with children at home. They are also mainly college educated and are the likeliest group to call themselves \u201cupper class.\u201d These are upscale suburban dads, not suburban moms.\n\nThese men see some things in Mr. Trump that they can respect. The George Washington Battleground Polls found the men thought Mr. Trump was a strong leader and overwhelmingly thought he said what he believed.\n\nReducing the infighting and lack of coordination between Congress and the president is also a must. When asked about the most important challenge facing America, they cited many common priorities: jobs, the economy and so forth. They also mentioned one unusual item: dysfunction in government. Every time it looks like the president, Congress or both can\u2019t handle their jobs, it drives home the message that Republicans can\u2019t do what many of these voters want most: make government work.\n\nMaking government work may also require the party to go outside its ideological comfort zone, especially on issues like the president\u2019s tariffs. Most Republican legislators and intellectuals hate them, but it turns out that the party\u2019s voters like them. A March poll for Politico found that 65 percent of Republicans backed the president\u2019s tariffs. Strikingly, a Monmouth University poll taken just before the Pennsylvania special election found that 43 percent of that district\u2019s voters thought the tariffs would help the Pittsburgh-area economy. Seventy-five percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents thought tariffs would help. Among voters backing the Republican Rick Saccone, tariffs were favored by a whopping 81-1 margin; even 10 percent of voters supporting Mr. Saccone\u2019s opponent, Conor Lamb, thought tariffs would help the local economy.", "title": "Opinion | Can \u2018Reluctant Trump\u2019 Voters Rescue the G.O.P.?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nHUMBOLDT, Saskatchewan \u2014 People flooded the sports and social complex in the small Canadian town of Humboldt on Saturday, seeking solace after learning the devastating news that much of the roster of its beloved junior hockey team had been killed, and many others wounded, in a terrible highway crash the day before.\n\nFifteen people died when a bus carrying the team, the Humboldt Broncos, to a Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League playoff game collided with a tractor-trailer near Tisdale, where two rural highways intersect, late Friday afternoon. The other 14 people aboard were injured. The team\u2019s head coach, Darcy Haugan, was among the dead.\n\n\u201cThe worst nightmare has happened,\u201d said the league\u2019s president, Bill Chow, at an emotional news conference Saturday at the complex, where the team was scheduled to return to play a home game Sunday night. Instead, the town will hold a vigil for them there, where the stairs leading into the arena were covered with flowers, teddy bears and hockey jerseys Saturday night.\n\nThe team has a storied history, having twice won national championships, and, as a community-owned squad, it holds a central place in this town of about 4,800 people. The players, aged 16 to 21, are mainstays at community fund-raisers, hospitals and senior citizen homes. During a big snowstorm this past winter, they all went out to shovel people\u2019s driveways, former Mayor Malcolm Eaton said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe arena is really the focal point of the community,\u201d Mr. Eaton said.\n\nLike many small towns across Canada, hockey is stitched into the identity of Humboldt, a farming and potash mining hub 87 miles northeast of Saskatoon. The main road is named Glenn Hall Drive, after its hometown hero who went on to the N.H.L., winning two Stanley Cups as a goalie for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks.\n\nThe Humboldt arena has a capacity of 1,854 \u2014 a seat for every 2.6 residents, given the town\u2019s official population. And yet during playoff games, like the two held against the Nipawin Hawks this past week, the arena is so full of spectators, it is standing room only, Mr. Eaton said.\n\nBut on Saturday, people came to the sports complex for a far different reason: to meet with crisis counselors, commiserate and get updates on their players.\n\nAll of the wounded were transferred from three local community hospitals to Saskatoon to be treated at larger hospitals, officials said. The driver of the tractor-trailer did not sustain injuries in the crash, the police said. The authorities released no details of the collision, but said an investigation into the cause is continuing.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of great sorrow for our province,\u201d Premier Scott Moe of Saskatchewan said Saturday during a news conference.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe added: \u201cBecause in this province we are really just one small town. We are neighbors, we are friends and we are family, tightly knit. The bonds are strong. And there is no place where they are stronger than in our hockey arenas. And today, our heart is broken.\u201d\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the town\u2019s mayor and team president to offer condolences. In a statement he called the accident \u201cevery parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the entire Humboldt community: We are here for you. As neighbors, as friends, and as Canadians, we grieve alongside you,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly four of the team\u2019s 24 players are from Humboldt. The rest moved there from towns across Saskatchewan and neighboring provinces, and live with local families.\n\n\u201cThey become part of the family,\u201d said Mr. Eaton, who took many into his own home over 10 years, growing so close he has been invited to weddings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe town and the team have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of grief and support they\u2019ve received since the accident. Hotels offered family members of the victims free accommodation. A Go Fund Me webpage for the team, raised more than $1.5 million in 21 hours.\n\n\u201cIt certainly affects all the Prairie Provinces,\u201d said Kevin Garinger, the team\u2019s president and the local director of education. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how widespread this is and it\u2019s well beyond Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba.\u201d\n\nMr. Garinger was wearing the yellow and green jersey of Conner Lukan, a team member from Slave Lake, Alberta, who billeted with his family and who died in the crash. He was barely able to retain his composure as he looked through enlarged photographs of the dead players.\n\nAs the news spread, other sports teams \u2014 professional and amateur \u2014 began sending their condolences. Sheldon Kennedy, a retired N.H.L. player who was in a similar fatal bus crash involving a Saskatchewan hockey team in December 1986, tweeted that he was \u201csending all my thoughts and prayers to those impacted with the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that Humboldt is devastated, and I don\u2019t know if it will ever come back from a situation like this,\u201d Mr. Hall told NHL.com.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets announced their players would wear the word \u201cBroncos\u201d instead of their names on the back of their jerseys during Saturday night\u2019s games.\n\nThe league wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe N.H.L. mourns the passing of those who perished and offers strength and comfort to those injured while traveling to play and be part of a game they all love.\u201d\n\nAcross the country in Toronto, the mayor announced the city\u2019s sign was glowing green and yellow \u2014 the official colors of the Humboldt Broncos \u2014 in support.\n\nMost Canadian parents \u2014 including Mr. Trudeau \u2014 have children who play the national sport, and so the news of the accident sent a shudder down the country\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cThroughout Canada, we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses, all the time. And it\u2019s always a thought in parents\u2019 and families\u2019 minds, what can happen and unfortunately has happened,\u201d said Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench, wearing a team jersey Saturday. \u201cI grew up watching the Broncos in the old rink as a kid.\u201d\n\nMr. Moe called on fellow Canadians to support the families of the victims. \u201cIn these boys, we see teammates, we see classmates, we see friends, we see brothers, sons and grandsons,\u201d he said. \u201cThese boys are our boys, their team is our team, their school is our school, their community is our community and their families are now our families.\u201d", "title": "Canadian Town Reels After Bus Crash Kills Beloved Hockey Players", "authors": ["Ian Austen", "Catherine Porter", "Matt Stevens"]}

The state\u2019s unemployment rate, 7.3 percent in February, was the highest in the nation, as the state\u2019s oil industry has sputtered. The State Legislature also overhauled the criminal justice system in 2016, reducing penalties for some property crimes.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t just one thing,\u201d Justin Doll, the Anchorage police chief, said.

Thieves swiping a car in the lower 48 have options: Drive it to another state for resale or sell the parts for scrap. There are few getaways here.

And most communities \u2014 more than 85 percent \u2014 aren\u2019t reachable by road at all.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo vehicles are stolen to commit other crimes, the police said, or to live in for a while, or simply as a quick lift.

Last year, Equifax, a credit reporting firm, disclosed that sensitive financial information on 145.5 million Americans had been exposed in a breach of the company\u2019s systems.\n\nThe research firm that identified the Saks breach, Gemini Advisory, said on Sunday that a group of Russian-speaking hackers known as Fin7 or JokerStash posted online on Wednesday that it had obtained a cache of five million stolen card numbers, which the thieves called BIGBADABOOM-2. The hackers, who have also hit other retail chains, offered 125,000 of the records for immediate sale.\n\nFin7 did not disclose where the numbers had been obtained. But the researchers, working in conjunction with banks, analyzed a sample of the records and determined that the card numbers all seemed to have been used at Saks and Lord & Taylor stores, mostly in New York and New Jersey, from May 2017 to March 2018.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear exactly how the malware was installed in the stores\u2019 checkout systems, Gemini said it was most likely through phishing emails sent to Hudson\u2019s Bay employees. In a phishing attack, hackers send seemingly legitimate emails to a company\u2019s employees that encourage them to click on a link or attached file that secretly installs software on their computers, giving the attackers a back door into the systems.\n\nThe breach comes at a difficult time for Saks and Lord & Taylor, and retailers more generally.\n\nOnline shopping has cut deeply into the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry, and department stores have been particularly slow to adapt to the new ways that people shop.", "title": "Card Data Stolen From 5 Million Saks and Lord & Taylor Customers", "authors": []}

So he went to Bergdorf Goodman and bought a tie. And he put on his jacket and said, \u2018Here I am.\u2019 And then they let him in.\u201d It was, she acknowledges, a different kind of place to show.

Even as some of the most talented American designers are opting to present their collections in Paris, not New York, we are harking back to a moment when American fashion came into its own.

But it also echoes her fundamental ambitions: to celebrate glamour and beauty, even in unglamorous times. \u201cI think to survive in this business you have to believe in something. Make it your own and stay with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be a designer, you have to be really sure that what you\u2019re doing is what you really believe in. I believe in glamour.

The patriarchs of each of those teams has died in recent years or are in failing health.\n\nRichardson, the Panthers\u2019s founder and owner, said he would sell the team in December, shortly after an article in Sports Illustrated linked him to allegations of sexual harassment. The N.F.L. is investigating those allegations. Richardson was initially seeking at least $3 billion for his team, but trimmed his expectations when no potential buyers emerged at that price.\n\nEven at $2.5 billion, the Panthers would set a record for the highest-priced sale for any team, and nearly a billion dollars more than the Buffalo Bills, who sold for a record $1.4 billion in 2014.

In a virtuous cycle, the money goes to better public transit and more bike lanes. Early legislative discussions are underway about trying the same thing in Seattle and in some of California\u2019s more congested cities. New York has just turned down such a plan for the second time in a decade, but the idea is not going to die \u2014 the city needs it too badly.\n\nIn the crowded cities of Asia, people are not allowed to get a car just because they want one. Shanghai residents must buy license plates that have gone for up to $13,000 at auction, and Beijing residents have to enter a lottery for a plate. Such measures might seem extreme, but they are sensible in a country that endured a 60-mile traffic jam in 2010 requiring 11 days to unsnarl.\n\nAs we write these words, we can sense the bile rising in some drivers. Americans have such a sense of entitlement about cars that any attempt to limit them can provoke a fight, as New York has discovered.\n\nYet the truth is that people who drive into a crowded city are imposing costs on others. They include not just reduced mobility for everyone and degraded public space, but serious health costs. Asthma attacks are set off by the tiny, invisible soot particles that cars emit. Recent research shows that a congestion charge in Stockholm reduced pollution and sharply cut asthma attacks in children.\n\nThe bottom line is that the decision to turn our public streets so completely over to the automobile, as sensible as it might have seemed decades ago, nearly wrecked the quality of life in our cities.\n\nWe are revealing no big secrets here. Urban planners have known all these things for decades. They have known that removing lanes to add bike paths and widen sidewalks can calm traffic, make a neighborhood more congenial \u2014 and, by the way, increase sales at businesses along that more pleasant street.

Even if it\u2019s simply a hefty down payment to get them started, think of it as a final investment. One that means that maybe they\u2019ll come back only to visit, not to move back in.\n\nFirst, determine whether they\u2019re getting a new, used or leased vehicle. Buying new provides the security of knowing that the car wasn\u2019t abused, plus a warranty and the possibility of no-cost maintenance. That\u2019s reassuring if they live thousands of miles away. Going with a low-mileage two- or three-year-old car can be a great value, one that eliminates the sting of instant depreciation. If that\u2019s your route, buying a certified pre-owned car adds peace of mind. Leasing typically offers more car for a lower monthly payment, but an early-career job switch out of state can complicate matters.\n\nNext, get educated on brands and reliability.

He prized Ellington for his orchestral approach to the piano and Horace Silver for his rough, vernacular energy; he saw Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Sarah Vaughan and the relatively little-known pianist Dick Twardzik, all of whom would contribute to his conception of music, as did Stravinsky.\n\n(The answer to the question of what music gave rise to Mr. Taylor, and what he liked to listen to, would encompass all those names as well as Marvin Gaye, Gyorgy Ligeti, Betty Carter, Judy Garland and Thelonious Monk. The Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and the flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya had also influenced him to think about structure, movement and time, he said.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBack in New York, Mr. Taylor formed groups with the vibraphonist Earl Griffith and the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy. In 1956, with a quartet rounded out by Mr. Lacy, the bassist Buell Neidlinger (who died on March 16) and the drummer Denis Charles, he made his first album, \u201cJazz Advance.\u201d Featuring standards as well as his own compositions, it was produced by Tom Wilson, who later worked with Bob Dylan, the Mothers of Invention and the Velvet Underground.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

(The other side featured a group led by the alto saxophonist Gigi Gryce and the trumpeter Donald Byrd.)\n\nMr. Taylor\u2019s music at that time was steadily swinging and fit recognizably within the modern jazz idiom \u2014 its spiky phrases had a clear connection to Monk\u2019s \u2014 but it was also already moving beyond it. \u201cTune 2,\u201d for example, from the Newport record, had an 88-bar form, a long way from the 32-bar song structure more commonly used in jazz.\n\nHe went further in that direction on the 1958 record \u201cLooking Ahead!,\u201d then recorded a session, originally issued as \u201cHard Driving Jazz,\u201d with an ad hoc group, put together by Mr. Wilson, that included John Coltrane.\n\nPhoto\n\nListeners \u2018Fidgeted\u2019\n\nWith renown came a particular kind of scrutiny. In 1959, Gunther Schuller devoted a long essay in The Jazz Review to the question of whether Mr. Taylor\u2019s music was atonal.\n\n\u201cListening carefully to his playing leaves no doubt of the fact that Taylor indeed does think tonally, but the result of his thinking most of the time cannot be analyzed on tonal terms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhitney Balliett of The New Yorker described a crowd reacting to Mr. Taylor\u2019s performance at the Great South Bay Jazz Festival on Long Island in 1958: A few were mesmerized, he wrote, while others \u201cfidgeted, whispered and wandered nervously in and out of the tent, as if the ground beneath had suddenly become unbearably hot.\u201d\n\nBy 1961, given the chance to contribute half the music on an album under the arranger Gil Evans\u2019s name (the other half showcased the composer Johnny Carisi), Mr. Taylor played only original music: striking pieces with shifting tempos and splintering melodic lines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next year he formed a bond with the alto saxophonist Jimmy Lyons, who would work with him for more than 20 years; the two were the core of the Cecil Taylor Unit, a group with an otherwise shifting membership. (Mr. Lyons died in 1986.)\n\nBy 1966, when he recorded the album \u201cUnit Structures\u201d for Blue Note, Mr. Taylor was forming a syntax where none had existed. He was using blues tonality and dissonance in his improvisations and original structures in his written music, organized in ways that were not traditional for jazz, even for the relatively new avant-garde sort with which he was generally associated.\n\nIn one piece on \u201cUnit Structures,\u201d titled \u201cEnter Evening,\u201d piano, oboe, alto saxophone and bass play staggered and unresolved melodic lines that refer to one another only in a distant sense, coming together loosely only in places. There is percussion, but no steady rhythm.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the technique and feeling of jazz that Mr. Taylor was rejecting, only its form: the 32-bar song, the theme-solos-theme progression.\n\nInstead, his structures often proceeded sequentially, shifting among motifs and tonal centers. When he used written scores for his musicians, melodies were indicated by note letters, but there were no staves or bar lines; this gave musicians more freedom within his music, and, he decided, more investment in it.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about musicians who are reading music,\u201d he said in \u201cAll the Notes,\u201d a 1993 documentary directed by Chris Felver, \u201cmy contention has always been: The energy that you\u2019re using deciphering what the symbol is is taking away from the maximum creative energy that you might have had if you understood that it\u2019s but a symbol.\u201d\n\nThere was no academy for what Mr. Taylor did, and partly for that reason he became one himself, teaching for stretches in the 1970s at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and at Antioch College in Ohio. (He was given an honorary doctorate by the New England Conservatory in 1977.) Not until the mid-1970s, Mr. Lyons told the writer John Litweiler, did the Cecil Taylor Unit have enough work that the musicians could make a living from it \u2014 mostly in Europe.\n\nSolos and Duos\n\nDuring this time Mr. Taylor was giving a lot of solo-piano performances, a practice he started around 1967 and refined through albums like \u201cIndent\u201d (1973), \u201cFly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly!\u201d (1980) and \u201cFor Olim\u201d (1986).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe would occasionally perform in a duo with another improviser: pared-down and sometimes jarring situations if the other performer pushed too hard against Mr. Taylor. Those pairings led to a clashing concert with the swing-era pianist Mary Lou Williams in 1977; memorable performances with Max Roach in 1979, 1989 and 2000; and collaborations with the Japanese butoh dancer Min Tanaka. In 1979, he collaborated with the dancers Mikhail Baryshnikov and Heather Watts on a short ballet.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, Mr. Taylor played a series of concerts in East and West Berlin \u2014 solo, in duos and with groups of various sizes \u2014 which were released on the FMP label as an 11-CD set, \u201cCecil Taylor in Berlin \u201988.\u201d\n\nSince 1983, Mr. Taylor had lived alone in a three-story home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. During that time he would perform occasionally in nightclubs, but more often in theaters or even museums around the world.\n\nIn 2014, a contractor working on his house, Noel Muir, bilked him out of nearly all of the $500,000 that Mr. Taylor had received for the Kyoto Prize; Mr. Muir was sentenced to one to three years in prison.\n\nNo immediate family members survive.\n\nAs uncompromising as Mr. Taylor could be, many musicians bear his influence, directly or by general example; a list of pianists alone would include Marilyn Crispell, Vijay Iyer, Craig Taborn, Chucho Vald\u00e9s and Jason Moran.\n\nIn 2016, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York organized a two-week exhibition and residency dedicated to Mr. Taylor; it featured panel discussions, a play, films, dance performances, displays of his written scores and live music. He performed at the beginning and end of the event, playing piano and reading poetry, with Mr. Tanaka and with various ensembles. It was an ambitious attempt to take the full measure of Mr. Taylor as an artist who would not be held to the conventions of any one discipline.\n\n\u201cWhat I am doing,\u201d he said in 1994, \u201cis creating a language.

Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa, where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member?\n\nA corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation, on whose board Mr. Grassley sat as a trustee. Over the period covered by the study, the foundations of AT&T, ConAgra Foods, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Medtronic, Merck, Monsanto, Nationwide Insurance, Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other.\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s office, when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator, said: \u201cSenator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations.

Clyburn Research and Scholarship Foundation, each affiliated with a Democratic member of Congress.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the new study don\u2019t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process. But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political, rather than charitable, motivations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is possible that when the Exelon Corporation donated $25,000 to Representative Joe Barton\u2019s effort to build a Boys and Girls Club in Texas in 2008, it did so because it believed in boys and girls, not because Mr. Barton was the top Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board. And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm.\n\nThe authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy, money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess. But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign-finance practices realize.\n\nThe researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage. Applied to $18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014, that would amount to $1.3 billion, almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations\u2019 lobbying expenditures.\n\nThere are a couple of lessons here. For those who favor campaign-finance reform, perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence. But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society.\n\nCorporations are likely to tally their foundations\u2019 charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility. But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations, promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare.\n\nAs the researchers write, \u201cIf corporations\u2019 good deeds (in the form of charitable contributions) cater to politicians\u2019 interests, who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters, the overall welfare effects are ambiguous \u2014 society benefits via increased charity, at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation.\u201d\n\nNone of this would happen, of course, if politicians weren\u2019t so hungry for corporate money. \u201cCompanies wouldn\u2019t do this if it didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Professor Bombardini told me. \u201cPoliticians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community.

Zwick Center for Food and Resource Policy, which seeks market solutions to problems involving food and energy.\n\nIn 2011, he donated $1 million to the RAND Corporation to establish the Zwick Impact Fund, which has studied autonomous vehicle safety, the benefits of educating prison inmates, the prevention of hazing in the military and the cost of caring for patients with dementia.\n\nCharles John Zwick was born on July 17, 1926, in the Plantsville section of Southington, Conn., to the former Mabel Rich and Louis Zwick, a farmer who raised vegetables and flowers.\n\n\u201cThen we grew what is known as the last crop of every farm in Connecticut, a housing development,\u201d he said in 2000. \u201cThat was the end of the Zwick farm.\u201d\n\nHis mother sent him off to the University of Connecticut, where the only A grade he received as a freshman was in economics.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Gee, that is pretty good. Maybe that is what I ought to be, an economist,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zwick recalled.\n\nWhen his father was seriously injured in a tractor accident, he returned home to run the farm for several years.\n\n\u201cThat was enough for me to decide I did not want to be a farmer full time,\u201d Mr. Zwick said.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army and served in Japan after World War II, then completed his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in agricultural economics in 1950 and 1951 at the University of Connecticut.

His lyrics were clearly the product of somebody with a puzzler\u2019s mind \u2014 just glance at the all-palindrome lyrics of \u201cBob,\u201d or his innumerable pun-filled parodies. When a documentary about the man briefly showed a picture of him holding an issue of Games magazine, I was simultaneously a) completely unsurprised and b) transported with delight at this further proof that Al and I would get along famously should we ever meet. Back in early December I got it into my head that Al would make an ideal addition to the celebrity/constructor pairings that The New York Times has been featuring on its crossword page. I pitched this to Will Shortz. He turned around and pitched it to Al. (And thanks to my old friend and occasional Times contributor, Gavin Edwards, who has a knack for knowing how to get in touch with famous people.) Al, to my delight, leapt at the idea, and all of a sudden I found myself in a weeklong many-e-mails-a-day correspondence with one of my childhood \u2014 and heck, adult \u2014 idols. We batted around a few theme ideas, some of which seemed worth developing but none of which made it to the finish line. I suggested \u201cThe ____ Film Festival,\u201d with that blank to be filled in with whatever struck Al\u2019s fancy. He replied with a long list of cheese/movie puns, and I had no doubt that we had a winner. My very first attempt at the grid included one of my favorites from his list, QUESOBLANCA. I was under the misapprehension that queso is not just the Spanish word for cheese but also a specific kind of cheese. Whoops, not quite. (This was entirely on me, I should note \u2014 Al, not knowing during his brainstorming that the end result would be restricted to specific cheeses, had several cheese-adjacent puns in his list, including FONDUE THE RIGHT THING and CHEESY RIDER.) Back at the start of all this, Al suggested a puzzle that would salute his peers and predecessors in comedy. That didn\u2019t quite work out, but I was pleased to have worked Tom LEHRER into the grid, and John CLEESE. [Fun fact: Mr. Cleese\u2019s father\u2019s last name was Cheese until he changed it during World War I to avoid being picked on. \u2014 D.A.] Thanks very much to Al for diving so enthusiastically into the world of crosswords!

But his aides also point out that Mr. Trump relishes doing things his own way and bristles against being told he must adhere to certain conventions, even when failing to do so may mean enduring political fallout.\n\nIn interviews in recent days with conservative news outlets, including Fox News and The Washington Examiner, Mr. Pruitt pushed back hard against accusations that his actions were unethical.

This would end a nearly 70-year split between the Chinese government and the global church, which Beijing traces to the Vatican\u2019s historically strong anti-Communist stance.\n\nObservers said the new measures could be a sign of a broader crackdown. At a news conference on Tuesday outlining Beijing\u2019s approach, a government spokesman said the Vatican would never be allowed control over the clergy in China. That came after a recent government reorganization in which a hard-line Communist Party department took over management of religious policy.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like the opposition force within the Chinese authorities who oppose the Vatican-China relations have their voice,\u201d said Yang Fenggang, head of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University. \u201cIt clearly shows that they worry or are concerned about Catholics as well as Protestants.\u201d\n\nTexts for other major religions are available online in China: The Taoist classic the Daodejing is for sale on JD, Taobao, and Amazon, and Buddhist sutras are available commercially.\n\nThe Quran was also sold online, perhaps reflecting Islam\u2019s status as a faith practiced by minorities who sometimes enjoy more privileges than the majority ethnic Chinese population.

At the same time, the government has stepped up measures against what it sees as excessive public displays of the Islamic faith, such as men wearing long beards or women wearing headscarves, as well as shops and restaurants that do not sell pork products, tobacco or alcohol.\n\nAt the same time, government policy has encouraged faiths that it sees as more indigenized, for example by subsidizing Taoist music or folk religious pilgrimages. Mr. Xi has also spoken favorably about Buddhism, calling it integral to Chinese people\u2019s cultural and spiritual life.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis overall approach to faith was reflected in a report issued Tuesday that shows the extent of the country\u2019s religious revival. The previous report, in 1997, showed that China had 100 million followers of all of its officially sanctioned religions. The new report doubles the number.\n\nAlthough other surveys show higher overall numbers, the new report is significant because it represents official recognition of China\u2019s religious boom.\n\nThe report shows that most religions in China have been quickly increasing their reach. The number of Buddhist or Taoist believers was not counted because those faiths lack membership rolls, but their growth can be seen in the increasing number of temples \u2014 to 33,500 and 9,000 today from 13,000 and 1,500 in 1997.\n\nChristianity presented a more bifurcated picture.

Mr. Xi accepted an invitation from Mr. Kim to make a return visit to Pyongyang, but there were no signs that would happen before Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Kim, a Chinese government spokesman said.\n\nAnalysts say that since coming to power, the young Mr. Kim has resented his country\u2019s almost total economic dependence on Beijing, which has only increased under the tough United Nations economic sanctions that China voted for last year.\n\nAbout 90 percent of the North\u2019s foreign trade in essential items \u2014 coal, minerals, seafood, textiles \u2014 passes through China, and China is its biggest supplier of fuel.\n\nAt the urging of the Trump administration, China approved the sanctions that have severely cut the North\u2019s access to fuel and hard currency. North Korean ties with China seemed to hit a low, with Mr. Kim refusing to even meet a Chinese envoy in November, and conducting a ballistic missile test instead.\n\nPerhaps wary of alienating the North, and unhappy with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Beijing was no longer so willing to punish the North, Chinese analysts said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are already signs that trade is picking up along China\u2019s border with North Korea, Chinese traders say, which could mean a relaxing after six months of near total trade embargo.\n\nHours after the North\u2019s announcement on Saturday of its suspension of nuclear tests, one outspoken Chinese state-run newspaper, The Global Times, said the United Nations should \u201cimmediately discuss the cancellation of part of the sanctions against North Korea.\u201d\n\nFurther, the United States, South Korea and Japan should lift their unilateral sanctions against the North, the paper said.", "title": "China, Feeling Left Out, Has Plenty to Worry About in North Korea-U.S. Talks", "authors": ["Jane Perlez"]}

The university also revealed that it had given a warning to Mr. Shen over suspicion of inappropriate behavior after the police investigated the case in 1998.\n\nStudent activists said they were pleased that the case had resonated so widely. But they said universities needed to give students more of a say in determining how sexual harassment and assault are reported on campus, and to better train professors in appropriate conduct with students.\n\n\u201cMerely resolving one or two specific cases is meant to gag the public,\u201d said Zheng Xi, 30, an activist in the eastern city of Hangzhou.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During the first 10 weeks of this year there were more than 400 publicly reported strikes, more than double the number during the comparable period last year. President Xi Jinping\u2019s government has responded with a firm hand: Labor activists are being arrested and assaulted simply for demanding their wages.\n\nAs China\u2019s rate of economic growth has slowed over the past few years, China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based organization, tracked a surge in reported strikes \u2014 most likely a small measure of all the actual strikes \u2014 from fewer than 200 in 2011 to 1,256 in 2017.

While party committees are a fixture in many foreign-managed workplaces, they were seen by foreign executives for years as more like social clubs. They would meet to read party announcements, recruit new members, make sure dues were collected and generally keep an eye on operations.\n\nBut on at least three occasions in recent months, foreign executives have been approached by their Chinese joint venture partners demanding that they involve internal party committees in strategic decisions, say lawyers and business executives.\n\n\u201cInfiltration by party operatives into the executive circle of foreign-invested enterprises is not extensively apparent at this time but things are certainly going in that direction,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing whose clients include American multinational corporations.\n\nHe said several of his clients in joint ventures had received explicit requests to give their internal party organizations a greater say in the company\u2019s operations.

In November, the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce said it was concerned about \u201cproactive calls on foreign-invested companies to promote the development of the Communist Party of China within companies.\u201d The European Chamber of Commerce has called such incidents a \u201cgreat concern\u201d that would represent \u201ca significant change from the legal framework under which joint ventures were negotiated and under which they have been operating successfully for decades.\u201d\n\nThe creeping influence of the party in foreign offices and factories is a sensitive subject in a country where the party seems ready to punish anyone who questions its widening influence. Many companies are loath to discuss the issue.\n\nCummins, for example, declined to comment on the changes to its joint venture\u2019s articles of incorporation that gave the party greater power. Cummins had not \u201cexperienced any challenges or impact due to the structure we have in place and the role of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCummins\u2019s Chinese partner, Dongfeng Motor Group, has recently taken steps to intensify the party\u2019s activities at its other joint ventures, according to an article last year from Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. They include ventures with Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the French automaker; Honda, of Japan; and Dana, the American auto parts maker.\n\nDongfeng\u2019s other partners, like Peugeot and Dana, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A Honda spokesman declined to comment about its partnership with Dongfeng.\n\nHowever, the Honda spokesman confirmed that the party claimed a more assertive role in another joint venture with a different Chinese company, GAC Group.\n\nGAC, an automaker owned by Guangzhou Automobile Group, is pushing its joint ventures to change their articles of association to give the party a greater role, a spokeswoman said. In addition to Honda, it has joint ventures with Toyota and Mitsubishi, both of which declined to comment.\n\nIn November, at the most important Communist Party meeting, which takes place every five years, Mr. Xi called on officials to strengthen the party in \u201cgovernment, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west.\u201d The message was quick to reach party members lower down in the ranks.\n\nSoon after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, party officials in the central province of Hunan issued a notice to members instructing them to write the party into legal documents for private and state-owned companies alike. The document was accidentally made public when a local state-owned newspaper published it, but it was quickly taken down.\n\nOver the past year, the state-owned oil giant Sinopec has begun to ask its foreign joint venture partners to legally require \u201cparty-building work,\u201d according to one executive with direct knowledge of the requests who was not authorized to speak publicly. Party building is an amorphous term that can mean general recruiting and educating but can also refer to more direct, specific activity. The foreign executive told Sinopec that putting the party in the joint venture\u2019s legal documents would pose major problems for the head office overseas.\n\nSinopec did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nDongfeng Motors, Cummins\u2019s partner and one of China\u2019s biggest carmakers, has long had strong Communist Party ties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstructors at Communist Party schools have used Dongfeng\u2019s joint venture with Nissan as a model of how the party can be involved with business, according to the book \u201cThe Party\u201d by Richard McGregor. When the partnership was negotiated, Dongfeng insisted that the new company give the chief party representative a senior management role, with a salary and compensation for expenses.\n\nToday, Dongfeng\u2019s Communist Party committees are working to expand their influence further. In other Dongfeng joint ventures, committees have tried to make the party more relevant for employees by holding social events.\n\nIn 2016, a group of employees from Dongfeng-Cummins traveled to the site of the Communist Party\u2019s first base, according to Dongfeng\u2019s website.

Industrial production rose 6 percent in March, less than most economists had expected. Urban fixed-asset investment also rose less than expected.\n\nThe central bank announced a measure Tuesday evening that would make it easier for commercial banks to keep lending, a move that would tend to support continued economic growth and that could indicate concern on the bank\u2019s part. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said that it was reducing by a full percentage point the reserves that commercial banks are required to deposit with it, freeing up more cash for commercial banks to lend to businesses and households.\n\nAnother measure experts look to for insight into China\u2019s economy is trade, which at one time was a major driver of Chinese growth. Over the last decade, however, it has been far eclipsed in importance by Chinese investment and household spending.\n\nThe latest figures show exports to the United States are growing considerably faster than China\u2019s purchases of American goods. That could provoke more ire from President Trump, who had threatened to impose $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese products.\n\nThe trade figures present a mixed picture of how painful those tariffs could be for China. Over all, trade is not as important to China\u2019s economy as it was a decade ago, suggesting the country could better weather a trade fight.

When Mr. Zhuang said yes, there was a pause and his father\u2019s voice came on the line. \u201cSon,\u201d he said, \u201cstop doing what you\u2019re doing. It will be bad for your family.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Zhuang had been doing, for the most part, was posting on Facebook. He was putting up photos that had been sent by friends and family, which recorded a police crackdown that had swept his home village, Wukan. Five years earlier, during the fall of 2011, Mr. Zhuang had been a ringleader in a series of protests that overtook the little seaside village. He had helped alert his fellow villagers to land grabs that were chipping away at village boundaries and filling the pockets of local officials. When those protests ended, it seemed the villagers had emerged victorious. Villagers had been granted the right to hold local elections, and Mr. Zhuang was one of seven new village committee members tasked with administrating the village and returning stolen land.\n\nBack then, Wukan was held up among democracy activists as a symbol of liberalization, a hopeful sign that China was open to political change. But the elections were misleading, the hope misplaced. Mr. Zhuang fled to New York in 2014. Two years later, he found himself answering that phone call in New York City, swept up in new political currents. The Communist Party of China was taking a recent crackdown on dissent and moving it over borders. Mr. Zhuang had moved to the United States to speak freely about his village. In his father\u2019s voice he heard the ventriloquism of the corrupt officials who had sold off his village land. Mr. Zhuang guessed that his father was surrounded by security personnel. He felt the phone call suggested a trade \u2014 his father\u2019s freedom for Mr. Zhuang\u2019s silence.\n\nSince 2015, a sweeping crackdown on internal dissent has ensnared hundreds of human rights lawyers, feminists, journalists and democracy activists. China now spends more on internal security than it does on its military. And as the crackdown continues at home, the Chinese Communist Party has started to expand its reach, looking to enforce censorship, increase surveillance and silence dissent across borders. Their targets have included academics, exiled business elites, former judges and activists like Mr. Zhuang.", "title": "Opinion | China\u2019s Oppression Reaches Beyond Its Borders", "authors": []}

Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.\n\nThe influx of original programs coincides with news reports about Netflix\u2019s thorny relationship with cinema. The Cannes Film Festival, making good on a pledge last year, has codified its ban on Netflix-produced films in its competition. (If it\u2019s a Netflix movie, it will not screen in competition.) This is because of what Cannes regards as Netflix\u2019s intransigence about showing its films in theaters.

Mr. Cosby made blackness palatable to a country historically conditioned to think the worst of black people. And to pull that off, he had to find a morally impeccable presentation of himself and his race. This is what Sidney Poitier, his friend and movie partner, was always up against: inhabiting the superhumanly unimpeachable. But Mr. Cosby might have managed to pull a fast one, using his power and wealth to become the predator that white America mythologized in a campaign to terrorize, torture and kill black people for centuries.

This was his sickest one.\n\nMr. Cosby\u2019s guilty verdict happens to fall during a week in which Kanye West brought a lot of people a lot more grief, not with new music but with a blizzard of tweets that included an expressed affinity for President Trump, right down to wearing a Make America Great Again cap of his own. Mr. West began his career as a kind of black-sheep Huxtable.

And then he married into the Kardashian family and things got as vivid and incoherent as one of Cliff\u2019s Van Den Akker sweaters.

Mr. West presents a new vexation that\u2019s the opposite of Mr. Cosby\u2019s stringent black conservatism. He can be offensive and rude and self-aggrandizing.

The terrain was relatively flat, and we chatted as we strolled. I was going through a rough patch at home, and it was a relief to be away from the stress. I shared this thought with Dad, and he replied that he understood. \u201cWe all need a break from our lives,\u201d he said. Such open conversation might be the norm between many fathers and daughters, but for my dad and I, it was a first.\n\nIn the evening, we had pre-dinner drinks by the fireside and then it was onto a delicious dinner. Our server presented us with different menus, each customized for our dietary restrictions \u2014 I have celiac disease so anything with gluten is off limits, and Dad is allergic to dairy. The care the staff took with our meals was remarkable. I ate a simple mixed salad composed of leaves grown in the property\u2019s gardens, beef kebabs and local roasted sweet potatoes, and meringues and creamy milk chocolate from a chocolatier in the nearby city of Musanze. Dad had a dairy-free risotto, roasted chicken, dairy-free vanilla ice cream and spongecake. Bisate\u2019s rates include all meals and drinks so we could eat and imbibe as much as we wanted.\n\nThat night, we slept in twin beds, but before drifting off, we discussed our excitement about the day to come. Dad said that he was looking forward to the day, but confessed that he was slightly nervous. \u201cWhat if I won\u2019t be able to keep up with the trek?\u201d he asked.

Yet it used non-taxpayer funds to pay for the trip anyway, Lang said, \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nThe California attorney general\u2019s office has been considering whether the ban applies to \u201cUniversity of California and California State University athletic team staffs\u201d for nearly a year. But the question remains unanswered. The attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.\n\nIn the past, the N.C.A.A. has taken a stand in reaction to some state laws. It opposed the 2014 \u201creligious freedom\u201d law in Indiana, where the association is headquartered. And before last year\u2019s tournament, it responded to North Carolina\u2019s passage of a notorious bill that put restrictions on bathroom access for transgender citizens by pulling some events from the state and threatening not to schedule more there. In both cases, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s public opposition played a significant role in the laws\u2019 subsequent modification or repeal, with the N.C.A.A. going on to keep events in those states and schedule others.\n\nThe N.C.A.A. sends a questionnaire to prospective host sites asking how they plan to accommodate all participants or spectators, including those who are gay or transgender. Although the association moved a basketball subregional out of North Carolina last year, it seems to recognize the extreme difficulty in making plans, often years in advance, around the shifting political priorities of all 50 states where it has members.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control what states\u2019 laws are, nor should we,\u201d Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, said last year.\n\n\u201cIf any state says they\u2019re not going to travel to any other place for some other reason,\u201d he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t then say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re not going to go there because another state has decided it.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral future N.C.A.A. championship sites could test this question. The Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments alone have scheduled several regionals and subregionals in states on California\u2019s list. Several Division II baseball tournaments, including this year\u2019s, are planned for North Carolina.\n\nAs with many boycotts, the travel bans stir complex feelings even among their supporters.

About half of colleges do this, awarding more grants to freshmen than upperclassmen, said Jackie Bright, executive director of the National Scholarship Providers Association. Also, keep in mind that even if the aid level stays the same, it won\u2019t go as far if the cost of attending the school increases.\n\nPell Grant Increase\n\nThis year some of the neediest students can look forward to a little bit of extra financial aid from the federal government.\n\nThe maximum amount for Pell grants \u2014 need-based grants that help low-income students cover the cost of college \u2014 was just increased for the 2018-19 academic year. The maximum award for the coming school year rose by $175, to $6,095.\n\nThe unexpected increase was included in the fiscal 2018 budget finalized in March.\n\nBefore the passage of the spending bill, the Department of Education had instructed colleges to use the prior maximum, $5,920, in initial financial aid packages sent out this year. So, students who are eligible for Pell grants should be on the lookout for revised financial aid letters reflecting an increase, said Megan Coval, vice president of policy and federal relations with the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\nWhile the increase of about 3 percent isn\u2019t huge, every bit helps for students who are scrimping for college, Ms. Coval said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice bump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very pleased.\u201d\n\nNot all students will get the maximum grant, but all who are eligible for Pell grants should see some increase, Ms. Cheng said.\n\nLast-Minute Aid\n\nIf financial aid is a bit short for your preferred school, students could try to make up the difference by finding more scholarships. Most deadlines had passed by March, but some local scholarships may still be available. One place to search is the scholarship providers association website.\n\nAvoid services that charge a fee to search for scholarships, Ms. Bright said; they\u2019re likely to be scams.", "title": "College\u2019s First Test: How to Pay for It", "authors": ["Ann Carrns"]}

Eight thousand were there last May, but by November, there were perhaps 3,600. There are fewer today, and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s job to know where the rest are.\n\nBetween 1,000 and 1,500 (including some new recruits) have returned to the jungle as \u201cdissident\u201d groups. They are once again enriching themselves from cocaine, illegal mining and extortion, intimidating the population and attacking the security forces.\n\nFARC shares some of the blame. It wanted \u201ccollective reintegration\u201d to keep its cadres together in rural areas. But its leaders weren\u2019t clear about how they wanted this collective model to work, and the government didn\u2019t want it at all. Sixty percent of ex-FARC guerrillas say they want to be farmers. Now the FARC is asking for 67 plots of land around the country, covering just 5,000 hectares (12,400 acres).\n\nThe cost of reintegration shouldn\u2019t be a roadblock. Whether for land, training or busywork, funding an ex-combatant at four times Colombia\u2019s gross domestic product per capita would cost $25,000 per year. Multiplied by 13,000 guerrillas, that would be $325 million per year. That\u2019s less than 0.4 percent of Colombia\u2019s national government budget for 2018.\n\nForeign donors can help. But as it\u2019s interpreting current law, the United States government can\u2019t buy even a cup of coffee for a former FARC member, because the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force, the political party that sprang from FARC, is on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations. Any aid \u2014 even for reintegration \u2014 is interpreted as \u201cmaterial support for terrorists\u201d under United States law.\n\nTaking a group off the terrorist list is a slow process, and FARC will remain on it for a while. The question is whether the \u201cmaterial support\u201d provision should continue to apply to all individual ex-combatants. If someone with skills for making war wants to leave them behind and is resisting the lure of crime, it\u2019s in the United States\u2019 interest to help him or her to do that. The United States should be able to help ex-guerrillas who are not top leaders, not wanted by American justice, not awaiting trial for war crimes and reasonably believed to have abandoned violence. At least 7,000 people fit these criteria and need attention. But the number shrinks every day, as ex-guerrillas abandon the process and melt into the countryside.\n\nPeace processes are fragile, but they can and do work. Negotiated agreements save years of bloodshed and are an honorable endeavor. Past experience offers rich lessons for reintegrating ex-combatants.

Ideas don\u2019t joust. People do. And it\u2019s vanity, not verities, at stake.

Mr. Comey seems likely to be the star witness in any obstruction of justice case that might be brought against the president by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the sprawling Russia investigation. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal fate, as well as his political fortunes in Washington, may depend on whether he succeeds in undermining the credibility of Mr. Comey and the law enforcement institutions he views as arrayed against him.\n\nWhile many of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics believe that the proper remedy for his perceived transgressions is impeachment, Mr. Comey insisted that would just \u201clet the American people off the hook.\u201d He said the public was \u201cduty bound\u201d to vote Mr. Trump out of office in the next election.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have, as president of the United States, someone who does not reflect the values that I believe Republicans treasure and Democrats treasure and independents treasure,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cThat is the core of this country. That\u2019s our foundation. And so impeachment, in a way, would short-circuit that.\u201d\n\nEpic Battle of Wills\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s intensely personal attacks \u2014 a reflection of his self-righteousness, his detractors say \u2014 are all the more combustible because they are aimed directly at a president who has said with pride on Twitter that \u201cwhen someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, hours before the interview aired, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey a \u201cslimeball\u201d for the second time in three days, saying in a pair of early-morning Twitter posts that he belonged in jail for what the president said were lies to Congress and leaks of classified information. In another post, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey would go down in history as \u201cthe WORST FBI Director in history, by far!\u201d He added that \u201che is not smart!\u201d\n\nIn the ABC interview, Mr. Comey had kinder things to say about Mr. Trump\u2019s brainpower, saying he did not think the president suffered from mental incompetence or was in the early stages of dementia. He said Mr. Trump struck him as a person of \u201cabove average intelligence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Comey responded to the president\u2019s Twitter posts with a more subtle dig of his own.\n\n\u201cMy book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201c3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear where this epic battle of wills will lead, other than a sustained escalation of insults between two men who have each admitted to having outsize egos. But it is certain to be a test of powerful forces in the modern media landscape: the presidential megaphone, amplified by 50 million Twitter followers, and the global reach of an adversary who is on a seemingly endless, 24-hour, cable-news-driven book tour.\n\nThe president took a break from his attacks on Mr. Comey as he left the White House on a rainy Sunday afternoon to spend time at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. But it seemed likely that he and his allies would not back down in the face of Mr. Comey\u2019s barrage of public accusations, which are expected to continue for weeks.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday morning, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, unloaded on Mr. Comey, calling him a \u201cself-admitted leaker\u201d and a liar. At the White House on Friday, she had called him a \u201cdisgraced partisan hack\u201d and a fired employee trying desperately to \u201crehabilitate his tattered reputation and enrich his own bank account.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey was similarly unrestrained in his ABC interview, speaking with the abandon of a man who finally feels unleashed. He repeated for the cameras some of the assertions from his book that he must know will get under the president\u2019s skin: that Mr. Trump\u2019s hands are \u201caverage-sized,\u201d that his skin is \u201corange\u201d and that he seemed shorter than Mr. Comey had imagined he would be.\n\n\u201cHis tie was too long, as it always is,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cHe looked slightly orange up close with small white half-moons under his eyes, which I assume are from tanning goggles.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey described in vivid detail the interactions he had with Mr. Trump, including meetings and phone calls about which he said he meticulously wrote down notes afterward for posterity.

That day, intelligence officials, including Mr. Comey, briefed the incoming president on Russia\u2019s attempt to meddle with the election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Comey said Mr. Trump and his aides seemed interested only in what the former F.B.I. director called the \u201cP.R. and spin\u201d about the issue.\n\n\u201cThe conversation, to my surprise, moved into a P.R. conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any questions about, \u2018So what are they going to do next; how might we stop it? What\u2019s the future look like? Because we\u2019ll be custodians of the security of this country.\u2019 There was none of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was all, \u2018What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had?\u2019\u201d Mr. Comey said.\n\nIt was at the end of the meeting that Mr. Comey said he asked to speak to Mr. Trump alone to brief him on the salacious \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d which contains unverified allegations about Mr. Trump, including a claim that the Russian government has video recordings of him watching prostitutes urinate on one another in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.\n\nMr. Comey said Mr. Trump denied the allegations that day, saying, \u201cDo I look like a guy who needs hookers?\u201d Weeks later, in a telephone call after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed, Mr. Trump again denied the account in graphic terms, Mr. Comey said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d let people pee on each other around me,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey\u2019s account. Mr. Comey said the president also raised the idea that the F.B.I. should investigate the claim as a way of proving that it never happened. Mr. Comey said he warned Mr. Trump that doing so would add to \u201cthe narrative\u201d that the president was under investigation.\n\nMr. Comey said in the interview that he did not know whether the episode had taken place, or whether the Russians had material they could use to blackmail Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Comey told Mr. Stephanopolous. \u201cThese are more words I never thought I\u2019d utter about a president of the United States, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHallmarks of a Mob Boss\n\nMr. Comey also offered additional details about the one-on-one dinner at which he says Mr. Trump demanded his loyalty.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018You will always get honesty from me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Comey recalled. \u201cAnd he paused and then he said, \u2018Honest loyalty,\u2019 as if he was proposing some compromise or a deal. And I paused and said, \u2018You\u2019ll get that from me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat dinner felt like a mob initiation of sorts, Mr. Comey said in the interview, similar to the ones he often came across as a young prosecutor working to break up the mafia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and, you know, shaking down shopkeepers,\u201d Mr. Comey said. Instead, it was reminiscent of \u201cthe loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything. It\u2019s all about how do you serve the boss, what\u2019s in the boss\u2019s interests. It\u2019s the family, the family, the family, the family.\u201d\n\nIn one of his Sunday Twitter posts, Mr. Trump insisted that \u201cI never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy.\u201d\n\nAs he does in his book, Mr. Comey largely kept a distance in the interview from the Russia investigation. But he said Mr. Trump must have known that it was improper to ask his other top aides to leave the Oval Office so he could privately ask Mr. Comey to drop the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his just-fired national security adviser.\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t know he was doing something improper, why did he kick out the attorney general and the vice president of the United States and the leaders of the intelligence community?\u201d Mr. Comey said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice,\u201d he said, though he added that a prosecutor would need to evaluate \u201cother things that reflected on his intent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president has repeatedly criticized Mr. Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email case. On Sunday, he did so again in a Twitter post, claiming that Mr. Comey had admitted in his book that he went easy on her because he thought she would win the election.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Comey said the opposite in his book, acknowledging that he may have unconsciously assumed she would win when he reopened the email investigation just days before the election, something that many Democrats believe was devastating to her campaign.\n\nIn the ABC interview, Mr. Comey said he believed at the time that it would be extremely damaging to the credibility of the F.B.I. if the reopened investigation did not come to light until after Mrs. Clinton had won the White House.\n\n\u201cIf I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we\u2019re done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer that group in America that is apart from the partisans, and that can be trusted.\u201d", "title": "Comey, in Interview, Calls Trump \u2018Morally Unfit\u2019 and \u2018Stain\u2019 on All Around Him", "authors": ["Michael D.

On a quiet river in the middle of a beautiful Australian landscape, Andy, played by Martin Freeman, steers a houseboat. In its kitchen area, his wife, Kay, feeds their infant daughter. Things look idyllic. The boat eases toward the shoreline; some balloons in trees hint of a celebration. Andy looks across the water at a patriarchal figure, who stares back, deadeyed. The man raises his shirt to show a revolver tucked into his jeans.\n\nAndy and his family, we learn, are running out of food. Something catastrophic is afoot.

His comics unfold in neat, regular panels, small boxes containing wonderment in the everyday.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis collection revolves around the power of place, as Porcellino bounces from various Midwestern locales to Denver and San Francisco and back; wherever he is, he finds tranquillity in open space, in the silence and grandeur of nature. \u201cFrom Lone Mountain,\u201d earnest and sweet, is not as wacky and weird an art object as the hybrid \u201cWhy Art?,\u201d but it does put on display, zine-style, a mix of modes, from long comics stories, such as the moving \u201cLas Hojas\u201d (about playing football with a group of kids in Elgin, Ill., in November 2001), to written ones, such as Porcellino\u2019s memories of his father, to meditative four-panel comic vignettes and Porcellino\u2019s signature \u201cTop 40\u201d lists of things he loves in his life, which are my favorite element (they routinely combine \u201cthinking about Thoreau\u201d and specific Led Zeppelin songs).\n\nPhoto\n\nPorcellino and Davis are two of the most important cartoonists still dedicated to the punk-inspired world of self-publishing. But even before Porcellino launched King-Cat from his parents\u2019 home in the Chicago suburbs, Jennifer Camper was publishing her queer and feminist comics in underground comic books and independent newspapers.\n\nThere\u2019s a great example of her work in the April/May issue of The Believer in the form of a 16-page comics story called \u201cBoys Will Be Boys.\u201d The fictional yet true-to-life story was inspired by Bill Cosby \u2014 who was just found guilty of sexual assault \u2014 and spotlights the sordid life of Bobby Otis, a celebrity baseball player, on trial for rape.\n\nCamper uses to brilliant effect the ability of comics to easily switch perspective: She presents readers with Otis\u2019s interactions with eight different women over the decades, starting from the late 1960s, but at the same time spotlights, throughout, how the women themselves experienced the abuse. While Otis doesn\u2019t seem to distinguish between them, the reader can \u2014 we see their names and witness the aftermath \u2014 thus restoring a sense of their humanity. Camper\u2019s piece is devastatingly timeless and current at once. It includes hard-to-look-at scenes of assault, rendered in a black and white much less airy than either Porcellino\u2019s or Davis\u2019s.

Artnews reported that Ms. Molesworth had criticized the overwhelming whiteness of the MOCA board during a January talk at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nShe made a similar point two months earlier at a talk in San Francisco. \u201cMuseum boards are increasingly comprised of exceedingly affluent people who don\u2019t come from a philanthropic or cultural background,\u201d Ms. Molesworth said. \u201cThey often come from a financial background or a being-rich background,\u201d Artnews quoted her as saying.\n\nThe MOCA board has the Los Angeles collector Maurice Marciano as a co-chair, and it includes other wealthy collectors such as Steven A.

The suggested admission price of $19.95 for adults lets patrons see this monumental image of a skull that drew headlines around the world in May when it sold for $110.5 million at Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nSeattle is the latest stop in a world tour that the painting\u2019s new owner, the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, planned for the painting.

The details of how it came to be acquired by the Louvre Abu Dhabi have yet to be clarified, but whenever it goes on show \u2014 no dates have been announced \u2014 it should bolster visitor numbers at the Jean Nouvel-designed museum, which opened to the public on Nov. 11. The Louvre brand will then have the distinction of displaying the world\u2019s most valuable painting (the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d) in France, and the most expensive in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs leading museums compete for crowd-drawing exhibits, and try to balance commercial interests and cultural diversity, visitors are bearing a rising proportion of the cost.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough admission to the permanent collections of Britain\u2019s public museums is free, adults are paying 22 pounds, or about $31, to view the must-see Tate Modern exhibition \u201cPicasso 1932 \u2014 Love, Fame, Tragedy.\u201d British museums had long been careful to keep exhibition ticket prices below \u00a320.\n\nSince March 1, people who do not live in New York State have to pay a mandatory admission fee of $25 to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Concacaf\u2019s members include the United States and Mexico, and Montagliani\u2019s three predecessors all were charged with graft. About 40 percent of the administration has since been replaced. Moggio, a former N.B.A. executive, became general secretary in May 2016. His annual salary is $1 million.\n\nSince the scandal, soccer has renewed its focus on how much its leaders make from the game. FIFA and UEFA have decided to release executive compensation information. Infantino did not receive a bonus in 2017, though he is eligible for one in 2018, the year the men\u2019s World Cup is played. That event accounts for the vast amount of FIFA\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe president of South America\u2019s 10-member confederation, Alejandro Dominguez of Paraguay, earns $44,000 per month, according to news media reports. It is not clear what the leaders of confederations for Africa, Asia and Oceania earn.\n\nConcacaf hired external experts to help set Montagliani\u2019s pay. A separate compensation committee negotiated the deal, which the organization\u2019s top board members ratified. The committee agreed to a base of $1.25 million and the provision of a nonguaranteed 100 percent bonus. The figure was based on the assumption that Montagliani, an insurance executive, would spend 2,000 hours working on Concacaf business. Some of Montagliani\u2019s bonus includes work done in 2016, before the terms of his bonus were fixed.

In good years, when the biennial Concacaf Gold Cup is played, revenue is about $100 million. When the Gold cup is not played, revenue drops to about $25 million. FIFA has budgeted $5.7 billion in earnings for the four-year cycle through the 2018 World Cup, and UEFA \u2014 through its own championship and also the lucrative Champions League \u2014 has projected collecting about $15.5 billion through its current four-year cycle.\n\nConcacaf is battling to restore its nonprofit status in the United States, a designation that remains uncertain after the criminal indictments against several former officials, including Jeffrey Webb, the last permanent Concacaf president. Webb pleaded guilty to a raft of charges after he was arrested in Switzerland in 2015. An internal audit found he supplemented a $2 million salary with at least an additional $1 million in expense claims. Webb\u2019s deputy at the time, who was later banned from soccer, approved those expenses.\n\nConcacaf\u2019s new regulations don\u2019t allow for similar excesses. Private jet flights that once were common are now prohibited, as are stays at some of the world\u2019s most exclusive hotels and limousines for top officials. Still, officials on the group\u2019s executive committee are paid on average $125,000 a year. Efforts by some of the members to supplement that with bonuses were rejected. Montagliani gets an additional $300,000 for his role as one of eight vice presidents on FIFA\u2019s governing council. The group meets three or four times each year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConcacaf\u2019s three-person compensation committee includes two independent members. They received a report from external experts who looked at the pay of top executives of similar sports organizations based in North America, including the United States Olympic Committee, top college sports organizations and Major League Soccer, whose commissioner, Don Garber, earns a base salary of $5 million.\n\nMoggio said the compensation experts based Montagliani\u2019s salary on the pay of his peer group.\n\n\u201cI can assure you he spends way more than 2,000 hours per year,\u201d Moggio said. \u201cHe\u2019s involved in every part of the business.\u201d\n\nAt the height of the corruption crisis, outside consultants ran Concacaf as it teetered on the brink of collapse. Montagliani joined as the organization\u2019s members approved a series of governance reforms. UEFA, by contrast, has largely been able to operate as it did before the scandal, although its former president Michel Platini was barred for receiving an illicit payment from FIFA. That has allowed Ceferin to enjoy a relatively stable tenure, with competitions like the Champions League continuing to swell the organization\u2019s coffers.\n\nUnder Montagliani, Concacaf has retained key sponsors, signed new broadcast agreements, revamped some of its competitions and created a new national team league. The organization also is in talks with South America\u2019s confederation, Conmebol, which may cooperate to create a regular tournament for the Americas.\n\nConcacaf renewed its principal partner Scotia Bank on better terms, and signed richer contracts with Fox Sports in the United States and Latin America. A recent deal with Verizon, Moggio said, was a sign of increased confidence in the organization\u2019s new corporate governance structures. He said the operating income target for 2017 was double the projected amount.\n\nConcacaf will present its latest financial results to its member nations at an annual meeting in Moscow shortly before the start of the World Cup there in June.

It lets the free market help steer us in the direction of consumer protection.\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asks the subjects of complaints to respond within 15 days. Complaints are later posted online, regardless of a company\u2019s response. The bureau has used the complaints to spot patterns of bad behavior. A wave of complaints about Wells Fargo helped spur the agency\u2019s investigation and exposure of the bank\u2019s sham accounts. Complaints have also prompted actions against student loan servicers, debt collectors, mortgage lenders and credit card companies.\n\nMore than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.\n\nDavid M. Perry was one of the beneficiaries.\n\nLast year, he filed a complaint against Midland Credit Management, a collection firm, over an inaccurate entry on his credit reports. Years earlier, a thief had fraudulently opened credit card accounts in his and his wife\u2019s names, Mr. Perry said. Most of the accounts were shut down, but one slipped through and was referred to Midland. Mr. Perry learned of it only last June when he applied for a mortgage and discovered that his credit score was hundreds of points lower than he expected.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So he filed a complaint with the consumer bureau.\n\nThirteen days later, Midland sent Mr. Perry a letter: \u201cMidland Credit apologizes for the inconvenience caused to you.\u201d The collection firm agreed to close the disputed account, end collection efforts on it and instruct the credit bureaus to delete the record from their files.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time feeling grateful to the federal government, but I was really grateful to the C.F.P.B. at that moment,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cWe need more accountability and transparency from our financial institutions, not less.\u201d\n\nFinancial institutions, however, say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPublishing unverified complaints \u2014 or, worse, using those complaints to paint a picture of guilt in the public domain \u2014 is irresponsible,\u201d said Richard Hunt, the chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association.\n\nMr. Mulvaney\u2019s disdain for the complaints database has already lessened its use.

To underscore the point, he submitted a quarterly budget request recently that was a nice round number: $0.\n\nThat attitude, though, apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.\n\nMr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries of more than $230,000, amounts that are far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request.\n\nThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.\n\nAs a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat.

{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "Schneider played in only five games in the last five weeks of the season and compiled a save percentage of .850. Not surprisingly, Devils Coach John Hynes made Kinkaid the starter for the first-round series against the top-seeded Lightning. But then Kinkaid gave up nine goals on 46 shots.\n\nHynes replaced Kinkaid with Schneider midway through a 5-3 loss in Game 2 on Saturday in Tampa that put the Devils in an 0-2 hole in the best-of-seven series. Schneider stopped all 10 shots he faced, and Hynes played a hunch Monday for Game 3.\n\nSchneider was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks in June 2013 to eventually replace Martin Brodeur, who now has a statue in the plaza outside Prudential Center. The Devils got Schneider just for enormous games like Monday\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI was looking forward to it,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cThese are fun games. This is the exciting time of year. There\u2019s no real time to overthink it or to be nervous. We\u2019ve had a fun year all year, and everything\u2019s kind of reset for the playoffs. For me, it\u2019s starting over, starting fresh and just having a lot of fun playing the game.\u201d\n\nSchneider stopped 34 of 36 shots Monday. He had no chance on Alex Killorn\u2019s second-period power-play goal, set up by a magnificent pass from Nikita Kucherov. But Schneider did get his glove on Steven Stamkos\u2019s power-play goal early in the third period that put the Lightning up, 2-1.\n\nSchneider shut out Tampa Bay from that point, and the Devils beat Lightning goaltender Alexei Vasilevskiy twice and flipped in two empty-net goals to ice the victory.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe looked steady, where it\u2019s a nice, calming effect,\u201d Devils forward Blake Coleman said of Schneider.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHynes said: \u201cHe looked like the Cory Schneider we know. He was poised in the net. He controlled rebounds. I thought he read plays well. He was quiet. He came up with some big saves when we needed them. Those are the attributes that make Cory such a good goalie \u2014 how under control he is, his hockey sense, his ability to read plays and how quiet he plays in the net.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cquiet\u201d Hynes meant that the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Schneider did not fling himself around the crease, like Brodeur sometimes did, often in the playoffs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t make all of these miraculous saves,\u201d Hynes said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in position, and his ability to read the play makes the saves look a little bit easier sometimes than they are.\u201d\n\nMidway through the third period, with the score tied, 2-2, Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh, a former Ranger, barreled into Schneider while attempting a backhand shot. Schneider stopped the shot but stayed down during a chaotic scramble.\n\nFinally, Devils rookie center Nico Hischier drew a tripping penalty on Tampa Bay forward J.T. Miller while clearing the puck. As a sellout crowd chanted, \u201cCory!,\u201d a trainer came out to attend to Schneider. He skated slowly to the bench. The crowd stopped chanting.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cI was able to push through a bit and finish the game. I should be fine.\u201d\n\nHis groin had cramped. Hynes said: \u201cYou always want to make sure when you have competitive players that they\u2019re not trying to push through something. For him, it was more cramping than anything. For me, that was comforting as a coach.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay still leads the series, two games to one, with Game 4 on Wednesday at Prudential Center. Monday\u2019s game ended with a melee that resulted in five 10-minute misconduct penalties for each team.\n\nIf Hynes will have Schneider back in goal, Schneider said he will be delighted to be there. He was asked if ending his long losing streak was as important as ending the team\u2019s long streak without a playoff victory, and Schneider had an answer quicker than a pad save.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the fans,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve supported us all year, and hopefully, we\u2019ve been a fun team to watch. It\u2019s never about me. It\u2019s not about one individual player. Every person is trying to contribute to the greater good.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor me, this is what I expect from myself, and it\u2019s never changed the entire year.

But in August, the Trump administration ended that ban following years of opposition by the bottled water industry, which argued that it removed water from the shelves while leaving unhealthy sweetened drinks.\n\nCouncilman Kallos said the Trump decision spurred him to action.

A 2009 state executive order barred state agencies from buying bottled water, to save taxpayer dollars and improve the environment.\n\nThe city has also targeted other plastic waste. In 2016, the Council sought to encourage shoppers to give up plastic store bags by charging 5 cents for most plastic and shopping bags.

While lawmakers typically close ranks around one of their own, rank-and-file Republicans told me that there were \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about him, and that his ethical lapses are \u201ctroublesome.\u201d The Republican strategist John Feehery put it more bluntly: \u201cPruitt has made a lot of people very angry.\u201d Perhaps most remarkable was the exchange I had with Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s longtime political patron, who said he, too, now believed that there should be an investigation into the ethics of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Mr. Pruitt walked briskly into the hearing room wearing a red tie and a smile. As the questioning began, I was most interested in what Republicans would do: Would they come after one of their own with pointed lines of inquiry that put Mr. Pruitt on the spot? Such a break in party unity would be remarkable, but Representative Greg Walden, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, had assured me just days before, \u201cHe\u2019s got some tough questions to answer.\u201d\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve now covered Mr. Pruitt\u2019s congressional testimony several times, so I\u2019m familiar with his style. For all the controversy and criticism swirling around him, he always manages to deliver a calculatedly calm, low-wattage performance. He deflects, defuses and never loses his temper. At the center of the red-hot controversy is a beige career lawyer, who is a master of the bland non-answer. It\u2019s a tactic that enrages his Democratic opponents, but also ensured that he emerged from previous congressional grillings battered but unbroken.", "title": "Covering Scott Pruitt, Beige Career Lawyer and Master of the Non-Answer", "authors": []}

Generally, there is no gender difference in how stories are perceived here. There are roughly as many women who are reporters, journalists, editors and international correspondents in Danish media as there are men, and they are at least as prominent. In asking them I found that Ms. Wall\u2019s killing struck at the core of the sense of trust that is the fabric of our society.\n\n\u201cShe was doing \u2014 brilliantly \u2014 exactly what we as women in our society have been taught that we can do.

In the court\u2019s verdict on Wednesday, the judges noted that Ms. Wall had walked into a trap set up for any random woman with the right amount of curiosity and trust. In the days before the murder, Mr. Madsen had searched online for images of mutilated women \u2014 and had also invited three other women to join him on his submarine. Among them were women who had randomly walked by the vessel and taken an interest in him and his projects. All three declined.\n\nThe fourth he asked, Ms. Wall, said yes in spite of being busy hosting a going-away party. She was moving to China a few days later, but she wanted the interview for a story.

He does better with female voters than male, and best among self-described moderates.\n\nBut the race is much closer upstate \u2014 with the governor leading by 48-37 \u2014 despite the governor\u2019s repeated assertions that he has done more than any other governor to revive the economy. Ms. Nixon also does well against Mr. Cuomo with younger voters, aged 18 to 34, trailing the incumbent by 14 points in that demographic.\n\nThe poll also showed that Mr. Cuomo would easily defeat two Republican candidates \u2014 Senator John DeFrancisco and Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive \u2014 by margins similar to what he currently holds over Ms. Nixon. The two Republicans, neither of whom are well known, are in a dead heat among voters, with each receiving 18 percent.\n\nThe poll, conducted from April 8 to 12, surveyed 692 registered voters in New York State, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.", "title": "Cuomo\u2019s Lead Over Nixon Slightly Narrows in 2018 Election Poll", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "I have some help with travel arrangements from The Times (and data scientists from Kayak, the travel aggregation site, who crafted an initial itinerary for me), so that\u2019s taken a burden off. I try to make sure I have three days of activities in a place, and a full day of writing, plus two mornings for editing and fact-checking. That isn\u2019t always possible so I\u2019m often squeezing writing and social media into whatever spare moment I have.\n\nI have two sacred times for myself: a weekly therapy call (this job is stressful!) and dinner. I\u2019m willing to pull an all-nighter as long as I can have an hour of eating good food and sipping wine very slowly.\n\nMost important, if I\u2019m somewhere incredibly beautiful, I pause to take a mental image and be grateful. Who knows when I\u2019ll be back to any of these places. That\u2019s precious time, too, and I don\u2019t want to waste it.\n\nPacking for the journey\n\nQ. How has your fast traveling pace streamlined your packing or the perception of what you \u201cneed\u201d? - Shelley Steingraeber\n\nGlad you asked, because I think about packing constantly! I\u2019ll go over more of this in a separate packing article to come, but I\u2019ve sent back maybe four shipments of stuff and the majority has been clothes. Cute dresses, cute shoes, cute jacket \u2014 all of it is gone.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve needed are items (mostly black) that can act as a uniform, layers to keep me warm, fast-drying underwear and a bra that won\u2019t dig into me on the plane. Toiletries, I\u2019m still carting around too many. I also joke that half the weight of my bag is tampons, but those aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nFavorite meals\n\nQ. What country or place has your favorite typical breakfast, and what did you eat for breakfast there? - Elise Evans\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQ. What\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve eaten? \u2014 Juliana Baldo Walker via Facebook\n\nI\u2019m combining these two because all roads in food satisfaction lead to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. I would eat every meal I had there a million times over.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Click Clack Hotel, where I stayed for a few nights, had hands down the best breakfast of the trip. Nothing crazy, just omelets done well, strong coffee and platters of exotic fruits.\n\nI also went to the Plaza 7 de Agosto market and got this insane fruit cocktail called a salpic\u00f3n, which is mango, papaya, banana and watermelon bathed in a pur\u00e9e of papaya and watermelon. Also, arepas de choclo at brunch (sweet corn cakes with cheese) \u2014 yum. The best of the bunch was the lulada, a drink made out of lulo, a tart fruit that grows in Colombia and Ecuador. Eat it with a spoon, die of happiness.\n\n(For future breakfasts, I\u2019m looking forward to France and Italy, always, and China. Love egg and tomato and any breakfast foods with a kick of soy sauce.)\n\nSurprises along the way\n\nQ. What has been a surprising discovery for you at any of your locations so far? An unexpected turn of events, a detour, a random act of kindness? - Shelley Steingraeber\n\nWhen I think of surprises, San Juan, Puerto Rico, is the first that comes to mind. I was eager to go there to see the Hurricane Maria damage for myself, and also to see if there was a way that, in writing about it, I could help out somehow. The hotel stock was so depleted that I was still scrambling to find a room when my plane took off. (I ended up booking an Airbnb, but just barely.)\n\nSo I was pretty stressed out when I got there. But the first thing I encountered was a bunch of women dancing around and singing by baggage claim. And through that encounter, I met everyone I hung out with on that trip. People were dealing with so much trauma and loss and yet I was welcomed into homes, onto farms, at parties.\n\nI hope everyone gets a chance to experience the warmth of Puerto Rico as I did.\n\nHealth and sanity\n\nQ. How are you keeping yourself healthy and sane during the many hours of alone time? - Sara Brenneis\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe healthy part, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m succeeding at. So. Many. Carbs! So. Little. Exercise.\n\nMy mind, I have a better handle on. I\u2019ve cried a few times, and felt quite overwhelmed, but that\u2019s what phone calls to my therapist in New York City are for.\n\nI\u2019d like to tell you I\u2019m finally watching \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d but mostly I unwind with TV shows that don\u2019t require much thinking (\u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d the entire first season of \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d). Phone-a-friend is always a good option. I have a few folks on Instagram \u2014 and folks I\u2019ve met while traveling \u2014 who have become pen pals.\n\nAnd a friend encouraged me to talk into voice memos as a feelings diary, which I did a ton while driving hours by myself on dirt roads in Chile. Essentially, my iPhone is my Wilson.\n\nTraveling alone, as a woman\n\nQ. I realize that solo female travel is becoming a much more common thing. Have you encountered any discrimination, uncomfortable sexualized situations, or barriers due to being a solo woman on the road? - Elise Evans\n\nI definitely encountered tons of uncomfortable sexualized situations when I was in my late teens and 20s and traveling solo. Either I\u2019m getting too old to get hit on or sadly, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. So far, nothing overt has happened, other than some construction workers in Chile relentlessly asking about my marital status. I let it slide because it just didn\u2019t seem worth the energy expenditure.\n\nQ. What would you recommend to young women solo travelers who love off-the-beaten-path destinations and enjoying night life, but still want to remain cautious and safe? - Livia Halltari\n\nWhen you say \u201cyoung,\u201d I\u2019m assuming you mean young enough to handle slightly rugged lodging. I\u2019d stay in hostels. They have a community around them, and you can form a buddy system with other solo female travelers. Hotels make it harder to have those kinds of interactions.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen you\u2019re out, keep yourself on a two-drink regimen, for your sake and your buddy\u2019s, be mindful of being slipped drugs, and always have the club or restaurant call you a taxi home, unless you\u2019re ride-sharing and feel O.K. with that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout off-the-path destinations, I think the safest thing you can do is always make sure someone knows where you are: the innkeeper, plus a parent or a close friend who will know to sound the alarm if you go off the grid for too long.\n\nSafety is a huge concern for women (and often people of color and other minority groups), and I\u2019m not sure everyone gets that. Trust your gut and be as cautious as you feel like you need to be, even if people make fun of you.\n\nThe worst trouble I\u2019ve gotten into while traveling has been when I\u2019ve tried to act like a local. Hang out with locals, but remember you\u2019re always a potential target.\n\nAnd try to have fun. It\u2019s possible, I promise!\n\nQ. What has been the easiest and hardest thing, specifically about solo travel, as a woman? - Ashley Zari\n\nHardest: Definitely safety concerns. There\u2019s a patina of anxiety that coats me every time I go out in an urban environment \u2014 especially since I\u2019m doing so much work with a phone and a camera that are ripe for getting snatched. It\u2019s infinitely better to walk around with someone else, not just for the warmth of companionship, but also to have the chance to relax into my environment a bit.\n\nEasiest: Not having to compromise and be on anyone else\u2019s schedule (except for my editor\u2019s). That probably says something about why I\u2019m still single!\n\nAdvice for older women\n\nQ. What advice do you give for an older woman (healthy, but 70), traveling alone? - Alyn Caulk\n\nHi Alyn, if you are the older woman in question, I say mazel! Happy to have a fellow adventuress on the road.\n\nTour groups and activities like cooking classes are great ways to make friends while maintaining the independence of traveling alone. Europe by bicycle is my favorite way to see the countryside, and all the trips I\u2019ve taken have included active seniors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis time around, I\u2019ve hired private guides for wilderness hikes, both for the company and a fail-safe should anything go wrong.\n\nAlso, say hi to the 30- and 40-somethings you meet. Chances are we think you\u2019re very cool.\n\nTraveling as a woman of color\n\nQ. Can you write about what it\u2019s like to travel alone as a woman, and even more so, what it\u2019s like for a person of color perhaps? Many articles and blogs I find of solo female travel are white women, and I think their privilege plays into a lot of their experiences, especially positive ones on the road.\n\nAs an Asian woman who blends in easily in many eastern and Southeast Asian countries and has traveled to many of them, I always worry about how I\u2019m perceived and treated by locals. - Emily L\n\nHi Emily! I\u2019m half Chinese, but I don\u2019t read as \u201cAsian\u201d in China, so I can\u2019t speak to your experience of being able to blend. Chinese people can spot the pale, not-so-skinny American in me right away. I have, however, seen my dad encounter confusion and surprise that he doesn\u2019t speak the language. He\u2019s a scientist and is antisocial (sorry, Dad, it\u2019s true!), so he mostly runs off, which seems like a fine enough policy to me.\n\nThe phenomenon of young white women writing about travel being easy doesn\u2019t seem as noticeable to me as young white men doing it. As you\u2019ve seen, a good deal of the questions here are women asking about safety while traveling solo. It\u2019s a pervasive concern and every time I don\u2019t see it mentioned in another writer\u2019s article, I feel a bit of a disconnect \u2014 as I\u2019m sure some people from other backgrounds feel while reading my work.\n\nPhoto\n\nI, for one, would love to experience what it\u2019s like to pass as an Asian local, to not be immediately marked as a tourist, to fly under the radar and observe subcultures unnoticed. Think of it as a blessing. Maybe you\u2019ll get some weird looks when people figure things out, but by that time, you\u2019ll be at an underground karaoke party.\n\nThe bigger issue here seems to be that you aren\u2019t finding writing out there that jibes with your experience. It sounds like you want to change that. I\u2019d definitely be a reader.\n\nFriendly spots for singles\n\nQ. As a single person who would love to make these stops someday, I would be curious to learn which places are single traveler friendly. Not just in terms of safety, but places where you can walk into a bar or hotel, or roam a beach or village, and random people would want to be your friend, chat with you, and even invite you to dine with them. - ND\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not asking about the dating scene, because I\u2019ve sadly had no time for that!\n\nAny kind of resort destination, for me, has been the hardest as a single person. I felt pretty out of place at Disney Springs, which is made for families, couples, and gaggles of friends drinking around the world at Epcot. Peninsula Papagayo in Costa Rica, San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo in Mexico, and even where I\u2019m staying now in Rogue River, Ore., all seem geared toward couples vacations.\n\nThe easiest time I\u2019ve had making friends was on the adventure travel circuit of Chile, or any time I\u2019ve taken a tour. Activities are bonding; you\u2019ll likely find other single folks with similar interests. And the line, \u201cHey, so I\u2019m traveling the world by myself, where are you from?\u201d seems to work wonders at starting conversations.\n\nLanguage barriers\n\nQ. How have you been able to overcome language barriers? \u2014 Lorene Lynn, writing from Utqiagvik, Alaska, via Instagram\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been lucky in that the only language I\u2019ve been required to speak, other than English, has been Spanish. I\u2019m pretty rusty, but it\u2019s a language I started studying in first grade, as a requirement of New Mexico public schools \u2014 and I improved a lot over the course of my travels in Latin America. I\u2019ll be O.K. in places with French and Italian, too.\n\nMost places, I\u2019ve befriended native speakers who know English and have been happy to volunteer as interpreters.\n\nIn my first instance of trying to talk to someone who spoke zero English, we spoke into Google Translate on my phone.\n\nDangerous locations\n\nQ. Is this trip going to bring you into any overt danger? \u2014 Michael Erard via Twitter\n\nNot that I know of, but political situations around the world change all the time, and quickly. I was vacationing in Delhi when the 2008 Mumbai attacks happened, and I was visiting a friend during several bombings in Kabul over Thanksgiving in 2012. Danger is real, but I\u2019ve got a pretty great support network at The Times to help me keep an eye on it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018The essence of a place\u2019\n\nQ. Do you think you really can glean the essence of a place by spending at most just a week there? - Ben\n\nDefinitely not. But the word \u201cessence\u201d is interesting here. If we think of it as the diffuse aroma of a perfume, perhaps a scent you remember deep in your brain, then it may be possible.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the job of a travel writer and I agree with my colleague Lucas Peterson, who writes the Frugal Traveler column, that it may be to simply encourage the idea of travel as a good thing in the world.\n\nSo if I can give you, the reader, a detail to hang onto or tell a story that compels you travel to that place, or travel anywhere, then I\u2019ve done my job.", "title": "Cute Shoes Are Useless, and Other Lessons From Three Months Traveling the World", "authors": ["Jada Yuan"]}

Comprising over 90 drawings, collages and the occasional painting on paper at the West 21st Street gallery, this concentrated presentation spans over five decades and gives Twombly\u2019s art a new pace and immediacy. No matter how well we may think we understand his achievement, it introduces an artist we haven\u2019t quite seen before.\n\nThe show has been selected and organized by Mark Francis of Gagosian, with the help of Nicola Del Roscio from the Cy Twombly Foundation; its title is from a Navajo night chant that Twombly used in the title of a voluptuous unbound book of 36 paintings on paper (1983-2002) in the final gallery here. The exhibition, celebrating the publication of the eighth and final volume of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his drawings, coincides with a presentation of his \u201cCoronation of Sesostris,\u201d a 10-part painting from 2000 at Gagosian\u2019s Madison Avenue gallery, in commemoration of what would have been his 90 birthday on April 25.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe gathering of works in Chelsea reconfigures the general sense of Twombly (1928-2011) as a lanky, slow-moving, ever-relaxed Southerner who worked in fits and starts and soaked up the good life on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast or in Lexington, Va. \u2014 his birthplace, to which he returned in his later years. In its stead is a man driven by an almost demonic energy, who never stopped pushing and testing his aesthetic engine, drawing, making it ever bigger and more encompassing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParaphrasing Shakespeare, this show could be said to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a line?\u201d Everything: drawing, painting, language from vulgate to Olympian, mathematics, pictographs, architecture, writing in tongues, the body, the war between the sexes, myth and history, and nature, especially the sea.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe show is densely installed and has an immersive feeling that becomes oceanic as the rhythms of Twombly\u2019s hand expand. It begins with a startling vitrine of 39 drawings, which are being exhibited for the first time: tiny scraps mounted on index cards made in 1951. They show a range of quasi-abstract motifs resembling trees, fences, rows of flowers and \u2014 strangely \u2014 little sketches for Wiener Werkstatte broaches.

She has worked for years with the Alliance for Quality Education, a progressive public school advocacy group backed by the teacher\u2019s union. She first got involved with the organization when Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed cutting public school budgets in the early 2000s. She enjoyed her first political arrest outside City Hall in 2002 and has been an unflagging advocate of public education since, with a focus on combating segregation.\n\nShe\u2019s taking a similar approach to her campaign. Ms. Nixon declared her candidacy in Brownsville, one of Brooklyn\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. She has called for legalizing marijuana, single-payer health care and, citing Mr. Sanders, raising taxes on the rich.\n\nMs. Nixon has also built on the areas where the Sanders campaign fell short: She has made a point to address racism directly, especially when it comes to housing and educational disparities. She has talked about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s sexism \u2014 he invented the bogus Women\u2019s Equality Party during the last election but has refused to push for legislation that would guarantee New Yorkers the right to an abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nMs. Nixon\u2019s critics say that her appeal will be only in New York City, but there\u2019s good reason to think she will find support elsewhere. In Brownsville, she cited \u201cthe tyranny of landlords.\u201d That\u2019s not just an issue in Brooklyn: Places like Syracuse face severe housing crises, and homelessness statewide has grown around 40 percent under Mr. Cuomo as of 2016. Similarly, while much of Ms. Nixon\u2019s public education activism has been based in the city, the issue is a hot one across the state.\n\nThis week, the Working Families Party endorsed Ms. Nixon, refusing to once again be bullied by the governor. That\u2019s a great start. Every other progressive organization in the state should get behind her, too, from criminal justice advocates to labor unions. She faces an uphill battle against Mr. Cuomo\u2019s $30 million in campaign funding, but she\u2019s gaining in the polls.\n\nAnd Ms. Nixon\u2019s is only one name on a slate of reformers, including the candidate for lieutenant governor, Jumaane Williams, a City Council member from Brooklyn with grass-roots support, who has government experience that Ms. Nixon lacks. Across the state, new left-wing candidates are standing up to save New York from Cuomo-style centrism. This is the kind of coalition that working people need to win more power, and it\u2019s the kind of slate commentators always declare impossible \u2014 rural and urban, multiracial, feminist, unified against the influence of the 1 percent.

But in recent weeks, when he might have hoped to begin striding toward the White House, the governor has instead had to endure the indignity of a primary challenge, and that from a woman who had the audacity to seek the Democratic nomination without any political experience. Even worse, she was familiar to millions of New Yorkers for playing a lawyer on the TV show \u201cSex and the City\u201d who slew scores of professional adversaries without wrinkling her pantsuit. Now, his challenger is taking on the role of liberal hero, at Mr. Cuomo\u2019s expense.\n\nThe governor has real progressive accomplishments to point to. He successfully pushed to legalize same-sex marriage, extending basic rights to millions. He secured one of the toughest gun safety laws in the country, astonishing even his supporters by expanding the state\u2019s assault weapons ban in a matter of weeks after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a school in Newtown, Conn. He helped thousands of families in New York City and elsewhere in the state secure free prekindergarten, a triumph.\n\nIs everyone showing gratitude? No, they\u2019re talking about that celebrity challenger, Cynthia Nixon.\n\nJust weeks into the race, Ms. Nixon has already stolen the endorsement of the state leadership of the Working Families Party, a coveted seal of liberal approval.

This spring, new productions of the Waits-Wilson collaborations are among several glitteringly dark musicals to be found in sunny southern Germany.\n\n\u201cAlice,\u201d a very adult riff on \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d that premiered in 1992, is the hit of the season at Munich\u2019s Metropoltheater, an independent theater in the residential neighborhood of Freimann. The show plumbs the mind of Charles Dodgson \u2014 the logician, photographer and church deacon better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll \u2014 and his obsession with the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. Paul Schmidt\u2019s free-associative book interprets \u201cWonderland\u201d as a surreal fantasy concocted by the writer to protect Alice from his sexually aggressive desire. It features some of Mr. Waits\u2019s finest songs (co-written with his wife and frequent collaborator, Kathleen Brennan), but aside from a performance in Brooklyn in 1995, \u201cAlice\u201d has gone pretty much unseen in the United States over the past two decades.\n\nThe young German director Philipp Moschitz\u2019s intimate and intricate staging, coupled with the company\u2019s high production values, makes a strong argument for increased public support for this small, innovative theater.

But Reed, the world\u2019s 24th-ranked golfer, has been forced to wait impatiently for his first major victory. His best finish in a major has been second place at the P.G.A. Championship last year, when he finished two strokes behind Thomas.\n\nAnd Reed\u2019s Masters record is far from glittering. In four appearances, he has twice missed the cut.

Despite those setbacks to Mr. da Silva, he has campaigned vigorously for a third presidential term, and has carved out a comfortable lead in the polls.\n\nThis week, Mr. da Silva\u2019s bid to remain a viable candidate appeared to fizzle as the country\u2019s top court rejected his petition to remain free pending further appeals.\n\nHours after the ruling was handed down on Thursday morning, Judge Moro signed a warrant ordering Mr. da Silva to surrender to the authorities in Curitiba.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Curitiba, a crowd of about 50 people chanted against Mr. da Silva as they ignited fireworks and honked horns.\n\n\u201cLula, you drunk, give me my money back!,\u201d some chanted.\n\nRegina Santos, a 53-year-old resident of Curitiba, watched the demonstration with mixed feelings. She voted for Mr. da Silva in 2002, the first time he was elected.\n\n\u201cLike every Brazilian, I had hope he would be different because he was from the people, like us,\u201d she said.

As director of that organization\u2019s worldwide field conservation work, Mr. Walston routinely comes face-to-face with the dark forces of human overpopulation, mass extinction of species, climate change and pollution. But he is also the co-author of a paper being published this week in the journal BioScience that begins with the uplifting words of Winston Churchill to the British nation in June 1940, under the shadow of the Nazi conquest of France: \u201cIn casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye,\u201d Churchill declared, \u201cI see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair.\u201d\n\nMr. Walston and his co-authors go on to argue against the increasingly common view that these are the end times for life as we know it. Instead, they suggest that what the natural world is experiencing is a bottleneck \u2014 long, painful, undoubtedly frightening and likely to get worse in the short term \u2014 but with the forces of an eventual breakthrough and environmental recovery already gathering strength around us.\n\nMr. Walston sipped his beer and listed what he called \u201cthe four pillars\u201d of conservation in the modern era \u2014 a stabilized human population, increasingly concentrated in urban areas, able to escape extreme poverty, and with a shared understanding of nature and the environment \u2014 \u201cand all four are happening right now.\u201d He singled out the trend toward urbanization as the biggest driver of environmental progress, bigger perhaps than all the conservation efforts undertaken by governments and environmental groups alike.", "title": "Opinion | Despairing on Earth Day?

The bank had a hand in virtually all of the major scandals of the era. It paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to the fraudulent sale of mortgage bank securities, and over its role in a conspiracy to rig the benchmarks used to set the interest rates on trillions of dollars in loans and other financial products.\n\nStill, Deutsche Bank was more reluctant than its European rivals to reduce its Wall Street presence. Others like Credit Suisse moved more quickly, and have since been rewarded with better profits.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s position in investment banking has become increasingly untenable. The bank\u2019s share price has fallen 30 percent since December, and it has not reported an annual profit since 2014. The stock market values the bank at less than half of the nominal value of its assets, an indication that investors believe there are hidden risks.\n\nTraders seemed Thursday to be waiting to see if Deutsche Bank\u2019s latest strategic plan by would be more successful than others.

But he was criticized as not moving fast enough. Mr. Sewing\u2019s plan appears to go much further by explicitly shifting the focus from the United States to Europe.\n\n\u201cWe will change the path of our bank now,\u201d Mr. Sewing said. \u201cThere is no time to waste.\u201d", "title": "Deutsche Bank Abandons Wall Street Ambitions, and Focuses on Europe", "authors": ["Jack Ewing"]}
{"date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "One of Mr. Sewing\u2019s main tasks will be to resolve Deutsche Bank\u2019s ambivalence toward its investment banking unit, which has produced huge profits in some years and huge losses in others. The bank, based in Frankfurt, is one of the last European banks with a prominent outpost on Wall Street, but has struggled to keep up with its American rivals even as they have come back stronger than ever.\n\nMarcus Schenck, the co-head of the investment bank, will also leave as part of the shake-up announced Sunday. Garth Ritchie, who shared leadership of the investment bank with Mr. Schenck, will assume sole responsibility.\n\nMr. Sewing (his name is pronounced \u201csaving\u201d) is not expected to radically change the bank\u2019s direction, but he will face pressure to move more aggressively than Mr. Cryan, whose dismissal had been widely rumored in recent weeks.\n\nDuring his three-year tenure, Mr. Cryan, a bookish Briton who speaks German fluently, helped Deutsche Bank begin to crawl out from under the legal problems that had weighed on the bank\u2019s reputation and cost it billions of euros in fines and settlements. Late in 2016, for instance, Deutsche Bank reached a settlement with the United States government to pay $7.2 billion related to the sale of toxic mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBut new scandals have continued to appear.

Mr. Cryan initially shared the top job with J\u00fcrgen Fitschen and became the sole chief executive in 2016.\n\nUnlike almost all of his recent predecessors, Mr. Sewing is not primarily an investment banker.

He held top positions in risk management at the bank and was its chief auditor until being named to the management board in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a German and a Deutsche Bank lifer with a background in risk management, Mr. Sewing will reassure German regulators concerned that the bank has taken too long to pare down the risky assets accumulated by its London-based investment banking unit. With its zeal to remain in the Wall Street big leagues, Deutsche Bank was slower than its European rivals like Credit Suisse to scale back its investment banking operations after the financial crisis.\n\nMr. Sewing\u2019s management portfolio has included Postbank, which offers banking services from German post offices. That background will most likely raise expectations that he will shift Deutsche Bank\u2019s emphasis from investment banking back to its roots in the German domestic market.\n\nThose expectations may be misplaced. The German banking market is overcrowded and profit margins are slim. Deutsche Bank has little prospect for growth without investment banking and international expansion. In a sign that the bank continues to have ambitions in investment banking, the supervisory board has nominated John Thain \u2014 former chief executive of Merrill Lynch and the New York Stock Exchange and a former co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs \u2014 as a new member. The nomination must be approved by shareholders at their annual meeting in May.\n\nMr. Cryan\u2019s departure followed several weeks of media speculation that created the impression of intense infighting between him and Mr. Achleitner, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who has been chairman of the Deutsche Bank supervisory board since 2012.\n\nOn March 28, Mr. Cryan wrote a memo to Deutsche Bank employees in which he acknowledged the rumors but said, \u201cI am absolutely committed to serving our bank and to continuing down the path on which we started some three years ago.\u201d\n\nLate Saturday, Deutsche Bank issued a one-sentence statement saying that the supervisory board would discuss the chief executive job, tacitly confirming that Mr. Cryan was on his way out. On Sunday evening, the 20 members of the supervisory board held a conference call, issuing a statement well after 11 p.m.\n\nThe public power struggle was reminiscent of previous management changes, and could also put pressure on Mr. Achleitner, who bears ultimate responsibility for the bank\u2019s strategy.", "title": "Deutsche Bank Replaces C.E.O.

Where I am now is the Midwest, a newly tenured professor at a Big Ten school. My best friend from high school, who graduated second in our class and was supposed to be my Gator roommate, went to the University of Florida and loved it. She has a fulfilling career, rewarding friendships and a gorgeous house in a South Florida neighborhood we\u2019d both always dreamed of living in: There is no \u201cbut\u201d to alter these facts.\n\nAt Cornell, I had a hallmate from Iowa whose family worked in pig ranching; the school she\u2019d almost attended instead was the University of Iowa. She eventually chose to transfer back home. The way she put it, she realized she just didn\u2019t need to be in upstate New York spending so much money for what she wanted to do with her future, though I\u2019m sure there was more to it than that. The girls in my hall \u2014 myself included, all of us from the East Coast \u2014 teased her about her pig-ranching background, a fact of which I\u2019m now very much ashamed.\n\nI don\u2019t know why the University of Florida didn\u2019t feel like the right place for me, but that feeling was strong enough to make me sign on for some major financial commitments at a school far from home at the ripe old age of 18 and head to a school that may not have been right for me either.\n\nI want to be clear here: I\u2019m not trying to encourage people to take on debt. It would probably be even harder for me today to make the same decision I made in 1999, with the debt feeling even more insurmountable and new fears about what the job market would look like when I finished.\n\nBut was it worth it? Did I need to go to the more expensive school?\n\nHere is my answer: When I started high school, my mother took me to an orthodontist. I had inherited my parents\u2019 jacked-up teeth, and at the time when most of my friends were getting their braces removed, we were there potentially to start the whole ordeal, having waited until we were in a good enough financial position to do so. After poking around in my mouth and taking impressions of my teeth, the orthodontist declared that I did not need braces \u2014 my bite was mostly fine, so braces weren\u2019t necessary and would be primarily for cosmetic reasons. Because we\u2019d already identified ourselves as the kind of people who would need help affording orthodontics, the doctor thought this news would come as a relief to my mother. It did not: She started crying.\n\n\u201cIf she needed them, in my head that would make it easier to pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is getting braces. Someday they\u2019ll all be people with straight teeth. I don\u2019t want her to not have that.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to give me an advantage she never had, and this itself counted as a need \u2014 it had to. She knew that people might make assumptions about me based on something superficial.\n\nMy braces came off my junior year of high school. I still sometimes wear my top retainer: I grind my teeth in my sleep, unconsciously undoing the work that made them straight. The bottom retainer no longer fits, thanks to a wisdom tooth I foolishly chose to leave in my head. It has all but pushed my bottom teeth back to where they started.", "title": "Opinion | Did I Choose the Wrong College?", "authors": []}

When he was with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014, he batted just .137 against lefties, but that has steadily improved; this season, he is batting .333 against them.\n\nAnd he is showing signs of becoming a more selective hitter; after having walked just 19 times in 2016 and 25 times last year, Gregorius has already drawn 15 walks in 22 games this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s continued to make adjustments,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming off a great year last year but to really control the strike zone has been the next step in continuing along as being a really, really good player.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the legitimate sluggers in the Yankees\u2019 lineup, Gregorius has batted cleanup 12 times, more than any of his teammates \u2014 although Boone last week moved him up to third while moving Stanton down to fourth, an effort both to jump-start the struggling Stanton and to insert a left-handed hitter between Stanton and Judge, both right-handers.\n\nThe lineup shake-up has shown some promising, if minor, results. Stanton, despite a three-strikeout performance on Tuesday, showed signs of life on Monday with a four-hit game that included a homer, and on Tuesday Judge hit a long home run in the Yankees\u2019 three-run seventh inning. And in a development that could portend even more devastating results in the near future, Sanchez, who came into Tuesday\u2019s game batting just .192, went 2 for 4 with a pair of home runs, including one that traveled an estimated 436 feet.\n\nInside Pitch\n\nIn his second start since a brief stint on the disabled list with a hip injury, C.C. Sabathia worked six innings of two-hit ball, allowing an unearned run in the first when Aaron Judge bobbled Eduardo Escobar\u2019s double to right, allowing a run to score. Sabathia\u2019s strikeout of Ryan LaMarre leading off the third inning was the 2,856th of his career, moving him ahead of the Hall of Famer Jim Bunning for 17th place on baseball\u2019s all-time list. \u2026 Reliever Dellin Betances had another rocky outing, facing just three batters: He walked two, allowed a single and made a throwing error before Manager Aaron Boone replaced him with David Robertson. Betances was booed as he left the mound. \u2026 Third baseman Brandon Drury, on the disabled list since April 7 with migraines and blurred vision, took batting practice on the field before the game and will begin a rehab assignment with Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "In the spring of 1992, there was no one left on the court who sought to harness the Constitution as an engine of social progress. To Judge Reinhardt, that was the law\u2019s highest, if not its only, purpose. What I in my journalistic capacity saw as fact, he saw as tragedy.\n\nAt his death at age 87, Judge Reinhardt was the last of the 56 Court of Appeals judges appointed by President Jimmy Carter who was still in active service. Although President Carter never had a chance to name a Supreme Court justice, he had a transformative effect on the federal judiciary. During his single term, he was able to take full advantage of the creation by Congress of 152 new judgeships \u2014 a 30 percent expansion of the federal bench. The 41 women among his 262 judicial appointments amounted to five times the number of women who by then had ever been named to a federal court. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Carter appointee to the federal appeals court in Washington. So was Patricia Wald, the first woman to become chief judge of that important court. Despite the crises that plagued the Carter years, for the courts, it was an expansive and progressive era.\n\nThat was the world that Stephen Reinhardt watched disappearing. Above, I described his project as maintaining access to habeas corpus. Actually, it was bigger than that. It was calling out the Supreme Court\u2019s failings as he saw them. It was to make a record. Why bother? In his long life, Judge Reinhardt saw the pendulum swing more than once. He believed it would swing again, and when it did, the record would be there for reference.\n\nHe was an optimist, he said in his 2015 article on habeas corpus. \u201cI see a trend toward progress and social justice, sometimes after painful battles and sometimes after painful lapses or even painful defeats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet this is a nation that in most respects continues to improve its democracy, sometimes dragging the Supreme Court with it and sometimes being dragged in that direction by its judiciary. I would hope that some of the recent errors the court has made will be corrected as the arc of history unfolds.\u201d\n\nHis final opinion was in fact a corrective \u2014 not of the Supreme Court, but of his own court. On Monday, the Ninth Circuit released an important opinion he completed before his death. The decision, Rizo v. Yovino, interpreted the federal Equal Pay Act to prohibit basing a new employee\u2019s starting salary on the previous job\u2019s final salary. That common practice is widely viewed as disadvantaging women; in Judge Reinhardt\u2019s words, it \u201csimply perpetuates the past pervasive discrimination that the Equal Pay Act seeks to eradicate.\u201d A 1982 Ninth Circuit decision had interpreted the Equal Pay Act as not barring the practice. Since a three-judge panel can\u2019t overturn a circuit court\u2019s precedent, an 11-judge panel heard this case. All 11 judges agreed on rejecting the precedent, although five took issue with aspects of Judge Reinhardt\u2019s statutory analysis.\n\nJudge Reinhardt\u2019s approach raises the question of what stance a judge \u2014 or justice \u2014 should maintain toward an evolution in the legal landscape that he or she regards as profoundly misguided. Justice Brennan, a central player during the Warren Court years, shared Judge Reinhardt\u2019s dismay at how things were turning out by the time he retired in 1990. He was a strategic player who picked his battles, and won a surprising number of them given the dwindling number of allies he had to work with.\n\nPart of Justice Brennan\u2019s approach was to do what he could at the margins, to write dissenting opinions that sought to minimize the damage the majority had done rather than declare that each defeat was another step on the road to destruction. Doctrinal purity mattered less to him than extracting even the most gossamer claim to a favorable result. By contrast, there is Justice Thomas, who believes that constitutional law went wrong sometime early in the last century, and to whom compromise is pointless and purity matters more than effectiveness.", "title": "Opinion | Dissenting Against the Supreme Court\u2019s Rightward Shift", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "As young survivors of the Parkland shooting lead efforts to tighten limits on firearms, they have met deep resistance from strong supporters of gun rights, and both sides have dug in. But the renewed national gun debate \u2014 reignited again after the shooting in the Nashville Waffle House \u2014 has gotten the attention of a subset of people who are often overlooked: gun control supporters who own guns.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of these gun owners will never take part in marches or make public speeches. But interviews with two dozen gun owners around the country found what polls have shown \u2014 that many of them are firm supporters of some gun control measures. In recent weeks, some have grown more vocal, holding signs at demonstrations, lobbying lawmakers or writing letters to the editor, adding their voices to those of the protesting students.\n\nOf the 60 million to 70 million Americans who own guns, measuring how many are likely to take part in activism in favor of gun control or to change their political choices over the issue is difficult. One rough proxy for those who do not want tougher gun laws could be the five million gun owners the National Rifle Association claims as members, said Robert Spitzer, the chairman of the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has written extensively about gun policy and politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.R.A. is staunchly opposed to new gun control measures, and events following the Parkland shooting may have deepened the resolve of its supporters. In March, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund raised $2.35 million \u2014 the highest monthly amount raised for the fund in records dating back to 2003, according to an analysis by the news outlet McClatchy and verified by The New York Times. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly a small number of gun owners seem to be stepping forward in activism in favor of stricter gun laws, and not all agree about which laws should be toughened. But advocacy groups that support increased gun control say they sense a new kind of participation in more subtle ways, such as calls from gun owners wanting to know what the groups do, and a greater willingness to listen. The shift could also have political implications: Some gun owners said they are now paying closer attention to which political candidates receive money from the N.R.A., which takes a hard line against firearm limits.\n\n\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Lindsey Donovan, an Army veteran in Georgia who is a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she began getting calls and inquiries from distant corners of that state, including gun shop owners in tiny towns \u201cwanting to talk about what it is we are about.\u201d Conversations about gun restrictions with friends in the military, she said, seemed to grow more searching and less combative.\n\n\u201cThey are not shutting me down anymore,\u201d Ms. Donovan said.\n\nBefore Parkland, her organization in Georgia had five local groups. Now there are 12. Around 1,800 people showed up to the organization\u2019s annual advocacy day in Atlanta in late February, up from 150 last year. And local chapter meetings used to draw around 30 people on any given night. Now it\u2019s often more than 100 showing up.\n\nDr. Spitzer said gun owners who favor gun limits reflect an often-silent middle who could be powerful allies for gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a voice that\u2019s not heard.\u201d\n\nLong before Parkland, he said, gun owners who are not members of the N.R.A. have tended to see things differently than members. A 2009 survey by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, found that 30 percent of N.R.A. members supported a ban on assault weapons, compared with 47 percent of gun owners who were not members \u2014 closer to the views of the general public in such polls.\n\nSurvey data has long shown gun owners to be broadly supportive of some restrictions on firearms. Polling just after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland suggested a small uptick in support for stronger gun laws in gun-owning households. A poll by Quinnipiac University between Feb. 16 and 19 found that 50 percent of respondents in gun-owning households supported stricter gun laws \u2014 a figure that was seven percentage points higher than when people were asked the same question last December. In February, 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households said they supported background checks for all gun buyers, compared with 94 percent in December. (The 1994 Brady Bill created a requirement for gun buyers to pass a background check, but the rule does not apply to private sellers online or at gun shows.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before long, 61 gun owners in the state, including Mr. Galinat, had signed on to a letter to lawmakers, urging them to expand background checks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, and none of those gun safety measures threaten any of those things that I believe in,\u201d said Mr. Galinat, who also went to Montpelier for a news conference on the issue. He said his only quibble with the letter, which was written by the consultant and a local gun safety group, was that he wanted lawmakers to set even stronger gun limits.\n\nSome gun owners said the Parkland shooting motivated them to be more vocal about their support for background checks, or about long simmering discontent with the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cWhat put me over the edge was this series of recent tragedies, both in schools and in other areas, and they just never budged,\u201d John S. Liccardi said of the N.R.A. Mr. Liccardi, 73, a hunter from Rutland, Vt., who owns several guns, stepped publicly into the gun debate for the first time in March. He denounced the N.R.A. in an op-ed for the news website VTDigger.\n\n\u201cIf there ever is going to be any progress in sensible gun ownership and control,\u201d Mr. Liccardi said, \u201cit has to be from the middle ground.\u201d\n\nSome members of gun-owning families have entered the debate hesitantly. Karen Fowkes from Vienna, Va., joined a sea of people at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., last month. Her husband owned a gun, she said, and she initially worried about feeling hypocritical, but joined her daughter, Colleen, at the march after some convincing.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mom, this is not an anti-gun march,\u2019\u201d the younger Ms. Fowkes said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Are you for universal background checks?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that, the younger Ms. Fowkes told her mother, \u201cYou are for gun control, too!\u201d\n\nBut for other gun owners, the marches had the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit more trepidation now,\u201d said Rob Mason, 47, an educational aide at a high school in Maineville, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, who owns several guns and practices shooting with his children at a range. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going too far.\u201d\n\nMr. Mason, who is not an N.R.A. member, said he supports universal background checks. But he is uncomfortable with the notion of an assault-rifle ban. His daughter, Grace, who is 16, went to a march in Ohio. He was proud she participated. But he also felt worried.

One reason the rapist-murderer may have stopped in the late 80s, speculated Mr. Safarik, is that he was becoming aware of the ability to collect DNA evidence, left by the most meager material.

{"date": "2018-04-29 00:00:00", "text": "Nothing is simple in America when guns are the issue. It took until 1993 for this bill to become law \u2014 12 years after John Hinckley Jr. shot Mr. Reagan and several others on a Washington sidewalk. Among the wounded was Mr. Brady, shot in the head. He survived, but was left permanently disabled. As he later said, \u201cWhat I was, I will never be again.\u201d He died at 73 in 2014, his death classified as a homicide even with the passage of 33 years.\n\nLong before then, he and his wife, Sarah, who died at 73 in 2015, were viewed by many as the \u201cfirst family\u201d of firearms regulation. Their intention, they said, was simply to limit the mayhem. But they had to contend with N.R.A. slippery slopesters and their congressional allies who insisted that the Bradys\u2019 true goal was arms confiscation, with measures like background checks merely a first step. The pro-gun side believed it was \u201cbetter to prevent the first good step than having to fight over the last bad step,\u201d Richard Feldman, a former N.R.A. lobbyist, told Retro Report.\n\nThat concern was always bogus, said Gail Hoffman, a former legislative director of Handgun Control Inc., a group that evolved into the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Confiscation, she said, was never on the agenda. \u201cWe were not gun grabbers,\u201d she said, just advocates interested in \u201cmaking sure that bad guys don\u2019t get them.\u201d\n\nAny battle over guns can be epic. Even so, the pro-regulation forces could claim victory on occasion. The 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, as the law was formally called, was one such moment. So was a 1994 ban on many assault weapons. They included the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, a weapon of choice for rampaging killers, including the young man accused of killing four people and wounding four others this month at a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since the assassinations of Dr. King and Senator Kennedy in 1968, more Americans have been killed by guns (at least 1.6 million victims of suicides or homicides) than have died in all of the country\u2019s wars put together (about 1.4 million).\n\nThere was a time when the N.R.A., founded in 1871, focused principally on hunting, marksmanship and conservation, and was willing to compromise on gun legislation. But in the late 1970s, its moderate leadership fell to a cadre of absolutists opposed to any hint of regulation. That hard line is embodied now by the organization\u2019s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, who in the wake of the assault weapons law described federal officials charged with enforcing gun laws as \u201cjackbooted government thugs.\u201d\n\nThe road in recent years has been steeply uphill for gun control advocates. The assault weapons ban had a built-in sunset clause, and it expired in 2004. In 2005, President George W. Bush signed a law protecting firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers from lawsuits by victims of crimes involving guns. Three years later, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a de facto Washington ban on handguns in the home for self-defense ran afoul of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe power of the N.R.A., which claims about five million members, is unmistakable. In the 2016 presidential election, it reportedly spent more than $11 million promoting the candidacy of Donald J. Trump and another $19.7 million attacking Hillary Clinton. After every mass killing, it has gone on a war footing, typically warning that its enemies would use the latest horror to pursue their supposed goal of rounding up all guns. Responding to that cry, many people have rushed out to arm themselves more thoroughly than ever. America has about as many guns as it has Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet polls show that people in this country overwhelmingly favor measures like universal background checks and tighter rules that keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally unstable and the criminally menacing. And cracks are beginning to show in the N.R.A. armor, evidenced by widespread support for the Parkland students and the millions of others who have marched to demand that federal lawmakers finally do something to stem the violence.\n\nHow sustained this nascent movement will be remains to be seen. The long slog from the Brady shooting to the Brady Bill showed that any attempt at gun regulation is a marathon, not a sprint. But even in states that are politically as red as a barn door, some Democratic congressional candidates in the approaching midterm elections feel comfortable openly defying the N.R.A. and its demand for heel-clicking loyalty from elected officials.\n\nNot all gun owners oppose every form of regulation. In Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, senses a mood shift post-Parkland. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit a moment in time,\u201d he said recently, \u201cwhere the N.R.A. is denigrating a whole lot of responsible gun owners, so it\u2019s not surprising that folks finally say, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough \u2014 they don\u2019t represent me, and they don\u2019t represent either the mainstream of America or the mainstream of firearm owners.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Do Stronger Gun Laws Stand a Chance?

Amazon\u2019s brazen public call for proposals for its second headquarters reveals how far governments will go to keep these secrets. Some cities and states revealed their bids, including New Jersey\u2019s $7 billion taxpayer-funded incentive. But the majority didn\u2019t. In January, when Amazon cut down this list down to 20 locations, the finalists signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the rest of the process secret.\n\nEven the cities that were eliminated by Amazon have refused to make their bids public. Minnesota and Washington both have reputations for transparency and received \u201cleading\u201d rankings from the Pew Charitable Trusts in their evaluation of economic incentives. But Minneapolis and Tacoma, Wash., submitted their bids through nongovernment entities and claim they don\u2019t even have access to the cities\u2019 pitches to Amazon.\n\nAnother strategy to avoid transparency in a competition like this is through complexity. The idea is to make economic development so twisted that it\u2019s nearly impossible to figure out who is responsible for it. If governments aren\u2019t submitting these bids, with taxpayers\u2019 money, who is responsible for economic development?\n\nIn many states, companies are wooed by getting a break on paying local taxes. In some of these cases, local interests get overlooked \u2014 in particular, schools. There are school districts where economic developers were empowered to give away the tax revenues without the input of educators. The California Teachers\u2019 Association supported a law to help stop giving away their tax dollars. Louisiana just allowed school districts to modify or decline these incentives.\n\nIn Texas, rather than cutting school districts out of the process, the rules were written to make sure districts always say yes to company incentive requests. Our program, called Chapter 313, allows a school district to forgive a company\u2019s taxes, but the state pays the taxes to the school district. Even better, schools can request \u201csupplemental payments\u201d from companies, which in some cases exceed 40 percent of the company\u2019s incentive benefits. Ironically, school districts make more money from companies that accept a tax incentive than a company that comes with no government support. As you can guess, in these cases, school districts say yes to every request, companies receive tax incentives, and Texas taxpayers are on the hook for billions of dollars.\n\nMany activists hoped that the true costs of these programs would be revealed this year. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board, a private-sector group that sets generally accepted standards for governments, issued a rule that state and local governments must now reveal how much communities lose in tax revenues through business tax abatements. Unfortunately, half of local governments are simply not complying with this rule. In complex programs \u2014 like the Chapter 313 Texas tax limitation that is authorized by the school districts but paid for by the state \u2014 nobody seems to be reporting it.", "title": "Opinion | Do Taxpayers Know They Are Handing Out Billions to Corporations?", "authors": []}

An investigation by the medical school found that before Dr. Noji was named to the academy, he had plagiarized five research papers, fabricated an account of his personal exploits in Iraq, and claimed unearned degrees and awards, according to the school\u2019s documents. The school dismissed him in May 2016.\n\nBut when Dr. Arthur Kellermann asked the academy to dismiss Dr. Noji as well, he hit a roadblock. Nothing in the academy bylaws allowed for ousting a member who had committed scientific misconduct. So Dr. Kellermann, who was on the academy\u2019s governing board, and colleagues, lobbied for the change. Dr. Victor Dzau, president of the academy, supported it.\n\nFormerly known as the Institute of Medicine, the organization is a division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and has over 2,000 members in the United States. It accepts about 70 new members from the U.S. a year. It is not a government agency, but it is often relied on as a source of independent, objective analysis for policymakers on subjects ranging from gun violence to regulation of medical devices. There is a long list of researchers who would like the cachet that comes from election to the academy and the high profile that can come from serving on one of its advisory panels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They are still considering Dr. Noji\u2019s case.\n\nBrian Martinson, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, and a specialist in research ethics, believes that\u2019s an unfortunate loophole.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Martinson said. \u201cI serve on a district council in my neighborhood and our bylaws are such that if you behave badly while you are on the board of directors we can kick you out.\u2019\u2019\n\nAttempts to reach Dr. Noji at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he is a professor, according to the school\u2019s website, were unsuccessful. A native of Hawaii, Dr. Noji spent roughly 20 years as a medical officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leaving in 2008.\n\nIn \u201cNotes from the Field: Crisis in Iraq,\u201d published in the International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters in March 2003, Dr. Noji wrote that he played a major role in the disaster assistance response after the invasion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMuch of my work has been in hospitals, directly with patients and trying to identify the most critical needs of the health system, which has been under strain before, during and after the war,\u201d Dr. Noji wrote.\n\nDr. Burkle, who was his supervisor on the mission, contradicts the account and say Dr. Noji never visited hospitals or treated patients, and spent just a few hours in Iraq. The university\u2019s investigation confirmed Dr. Burkle\u2019s account, their records show.\n\nDr. Burkle said he was pleased by the university\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored because one feels quite alone when this kind of plagiarism or fabrication happens, and not aware that it is happening to others,\u201d Dr. Burkle said. \u201cEverybody wants to avoid the subject. This is the first major step forward.\u201d\n\nPaul Auerbach, a Stanford medical school professor and editor of a popular medical textbook, said he was stunned to receive a call last year from Dr. Kellermann, telling him that a chapter written by Dr. Noji was actually heavily copied from the work of Dr. Burkle and Mark Keim, now retired from the C.D.C. and working as chief executive of DisasterDoc, an emergency services consulting firm. Dr. Auerbach compared the two copies.\n\n\u201cI was shocked, I went \u2018oh my goodness!\u2019\u2019\u2019 Dr. Auerbach said. \u201cThat was my worst nightmare. Once I saw it, it was a no-brainer. I won\u2019t ever write a paper or publish a book again without putting it through plagiarism checks.\u201d\n\nWith Dr. Burkle\u2019s health fragile, Dr. Kellermann and others want Dr. Noji expelled from the academy while Dr. Burkle is still alive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a mentor to the entire field,\u201d Dr. Keim said, referring to Dr. Burkle as the father of disaster medicine. \u201cThat\u2019s why it hurts us so much.\u201d", "title": "Doctors Urge Elite Academy to Expel a Member Over Charges of Plagiarism", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan"]}

And no wonder. The last moments of the film are by far the most interesting. They bring intimations of darkness and grief that feel like something new in the Marvel Universe. The bad guy (his name is Thanos and his chin is remarkable) not only wins, but triumphs in a way that brings despair rather than sequel-setting rage or defiance.

The emergence of a former coal boss with a criminal record as a potential Senate nominee seems partly an expression of many West Virginia voters\u2019 desire to poke a thumb in the eye of the Washington establishment, Republicans very much included.\n\nMr. Blankenship offers no apology for his many contradictions and personal and business decisions, some of them previously undisclosed. Though he lives a baronial lifestyle thanks to a fortune built on coal scratched from West Virginia\u2019s mountains, he says the size and origins of his wealth are no one\u2019s business. He is the only candidate in either party in the Senate race who has not disclosed his personal finances as required by law to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. There isn\u2019t \u201cmuch of a penalty\u201d for flouting the law, he explained in an interview, justifying his refusal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t personally think anybody should have to disclose private information,\u201d he said while awaiting the start of a \u201cmeet the candidates\u201d event last week in Cabin Creek, W.Va.\n\nNational Republican leaders are alarmed that Mr. Blankenship could emerge as the winner of the primary, which they fear would cost them a winnable seat in November against Senator Joe Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, a super PAC linked to Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky senator and Republican leader, began saturating the West Virginia airwaves last week with an ad attacking Mr. Blankenship for poisoning local drinking water from his former coal mines. The nearly $745,000 campaign of TV and digital ads is meant to boost the chances of two conventional Republicans in the race, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins. A Fox News poll conducted last week found a fluid race, with Mr. Blankenship trailing his rivals but about one in four voters undecided.\n\nOn Monday, responding to the attack ads, Mr. Blankenship brought up Mr. McConnell\u2019s marriage to Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, and questioned whether the majority leader faced a conflict of interest in foreign relations. Ms. Chao\u2019s father is \u201ca wealthy Chinaperson,\u201d Mr. Blankenship said, speaking on a West Virginia radio show, adding, \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of connections to some of the brass, if you will, in China.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI read in books that people think he\u2019s soft on China,\u201d he said of Mr. McConnell.\n\nChina, as it happens, is a topic of personal interest to Mr. Blankenship. His fianc\u00e9e, Farrah Meiling Hobbs, was born there. The two met on a flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas about eight years ago, Mr. Blankenship said. According to the website of an international trading company Ms. Hobbs founded, she is \u201ca former Chinese professional basketball player and part-time model\u201d who moved to the United States in 1996.\n\nIn 2016 Ms. Hobbs and Mr. Blankenship paid $2.4 million in cash to buy the palatial home near Las Vegas that Mr. Blankenship claims in court papers is his principal residence. It is a six-bedroom, eight-bath Spanish-style mansion with marble floors and a dolphin sculpture beside the pool, according to an online real estate site. (He also owns a residence in West Virginia.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was purchased just before Mr. Blankenship began a one-year prison sentence following his conviction on a misdemeanor count related to the 2010 explosion at Upper Big Branch mine, the deadliest mine accident in the United States in 40 years.\n\nThough Mr. Blankenship stepped down that year as chief executive of the Massey Energy Company, he exited with his sumptuous earnings intact. Massey paid him $17.8 million in his last year. He gained an additional $86.2 million when the company was later sold, by one estimate.\n\nPart of Mr. Blankenship\u2019s assets are now paying for some $2 million of TV and digital ads \u2014 far more than his rivals \u2014 that seek to muddy the picture of his 2015 conviction by painting him as a victim of a politically driven \u201cObama judge\u201d and \u201cObama prosecutors.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFamily members of the 29 Upper Big Branch victims said it was crushing to watch those ads, in which Mr. Blankenship portrays himself as a champion of safety and refuses responsibility for the loss of life.\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Blankenship to say he\u2019s sorry, I want him to feel contrition, I want him to feel compassion,\u201d said Dr. Judy Jones Petersen, whose brother Dean Jones died in the explosion. \u201cPeople have to understand that Mr. Blankenship is a bad man. Your character doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nIn his campaign, Mr. Blankenship positions himself as a West Virginia populist, an \u201cAmerican competitionist\u201d who stands for unfettered capitalism.

According to records from Panjiva, which tracks global trade, a shipment of 386 items was sent from Fuzhou, China, the next year to Ms. Hobbs\u2019s company, Amerasia International.\n\n\u201cThey arrived and we did sell them, but we didn\u2019t grow the business or continue it,\u201d Mr. Blankenship said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a position to do that.\u201d It was a dry reference to his trial, sentence and one-year parole, which will end the day after the May 8 primary.\n\nIn the absence of much public polling, the clearest sign that Mr. Blankenship is a threat in the race is the hefty advertising budget of national Republicans who seek to disqualify him with voters.\n\nOtherwise, signs of his support can be elusive. He draws sparse crowds to his events, and when he appears at multicandidate gatherings, he shows little knack for political skills. Rather than working a room, he keeps to himself, as he did at the Mineral County Lincoln Day dinner on Friday in Keyser.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone who\u2019s on parole at this moment in time should be running for office,\u201d Jessica Imes, a voter at the dinner, said.\n\nMr. Morrisey, the attorney general, moved easily among the party activists dining on stuffed chicken breast and mashed potatoes beneath a giant stuffed moose head at the local Order of Moose hall. His campaign has spent little time attacking Mr. Blankenship, in the belief that primary voters recognize that Republicans should not run a convicted criminal in the general election.\n\n\u201cI think he would get crushed in the fall, crushed,\u201d Mr. Morrisey said.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy runs deep in this race,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s a Nevada resident. He abandoned West Virginia when we really needed people to stand up to Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Blankenship maintained in numerous court proceedings that his principal residence was Nevada, he still owns a home in West Virginia, in Mingo County not far from where he was raised. He said he paid property taxes in West Virginia but not income taxes.\n\nThere is nothing legally barring him from seeking a Senate seat from the state if he declares a primary residence elsewhere.\n\nHe scoffed at the notion that voters might regard him as an outsider, even a carpetbagger, because he lives mostly in Nevada.\n\n\u201cMany people have two homes,\u201d he said. \u201cMost coal miners now have one in Tennessee and one in West Virginia.\u201d", "title": "Don Blankenship, West Virginia Candidate, Lives Near Las Vegas and Mulled Chinese Citizenship", "authors": ["Trip Gabriel", "Stephanie Saul"]}

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "But what speaks most succinctly about how Villanova won two titles in three seasons is precisely that DiVincenzo was able to go from imitating an opposing superstar in one Final Four to being the superstar in the next one. It is a trajectory distinctive to the program, which could reasonably be expected to lead to another title a year or two from now.\n\nHield never had a game as spectacular as DiVincenzo had on Monday, particularly on a Final Four court.\n\nThe statistics \u2014 31 points on 15 shots, five rebounds and three assists \u2014 still undersell the extent to which DiVincenzo was his team\u2019s fulcrum Monday night. The team\u2019s sixth man, he was the one who stopped the bleeding after the underdog Michigan surprised the 67,831 spectators in the Alamodome and millions more watching on television who had expected a fairly easy victory by Villanova, the top seed.\n\nPhoto\n\nBefore DiVincenzo scored his first basket, Michigan led 14-8. Villanova\u2019s next 8 points were DiVincenzo\u2019s: a 3-pointer, a 3-point play, a jump shot. DiVincenzo responded to ball screens by hitting long 3s from where he was standing or, once, finding Omari Spellman down low on a brilliant bounce pass.\n\nOn defense, during one stretch he forced a driving Zavier Simpson into a miss and then, on the next possession, the 6-foot-5 DiVincenzo straight-up blocked an attempted dunk by Charles Matthews.\n\nAt one point, after back-to-back 3-pointers, DiVincenzo winked at the crowd. He later said he was aiming for Hart.\n\nHad DiVincenzo been in a video game, flames would have been coming off his ball.\n\nIt would be easy to characterize him as an overachieving diamond in the rough, another scrappy kid from Villanova\u2019s backyard (he is from Delaware) who thrived in Coach Jay Wright\u2019s system. The story sounds great, but it doesn\u2019t check out. DiVincenzo was a four-star recruit who had offers from Florida, Notre Dame, Syracuse and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Villanova innovation, rather, is to have a talent like DiVincenzo, as a redshirt sophomore, come off the bench.\n\n\u201cAll he wants to do is play,\u201d said DiVincenzo\u2019s mother, Kathy, elated in a straw cowboy hat with a Villanova \u201cV\u201d as she watched him being named the Final Four\u2019s most outstanding player. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care if he starts.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Villanova the class of college basketball \u2014 the first team to win two titles in three seasons since Florida repeated more than a decade ago, the second since Kentucky did it in 1996 and \u201998 \u2014 is this model of sustainable success, with players who could be the center of attention at other big programs sacrificing to play for the Wildcats.\n\n\u201cDonte could do more,\u201d Assistant Coach George Halcovage said on Sunday, the day before the title game. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player.

(It also shows that the popular dichotomy between one-and-done programs and others is an oversimplification.) Players graduate. Players transfer \u2014 though fewer than the norm do from Villanova.

And so it was that I found myself on a recent day in a village many Quebecers would rather forget. I was curious to observe whether attitudes had shifted.\n\nMy initial reception was as cold as the chilly March weather.\n\n\u201cNothing ever happens here \u2014 we have a church and a few chalets. Oh, that\u2019s about it,\u201d said the first woman who crossed my path. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\nThe code, which polarized Quebec, helped spur a loud national debate and even a provincewide commission on what constituted \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d when it came to respecting the cultures and traditions of immigrants. Should veils, for example, be worn by Muslim students at school? Should a Montreal Y.M.C.A. have installed frosted windows at the request of ultra-Orthodox Jews who didn\u2019t want to see scantily clad women exercise?\n\nQuestions of identity and cultural preservation run deep in Quebec, a majority French-speaking province of eight million people, which fears that its native tongue could be subsumed by the large English-speaking majority in much of the rest of North America. To help preserve the French language, there are laws in place, including a requirement that immigrants send their children to French schools.\n\nPhoto\n\nH\u00e9rouxville became such a target of derision that it was recast in a comedy show as \u201cH\u00e9rouxtyville,\u201d in a now famous skit in which a Muslim couple accidentally end up in the village. They are brought before a stern village councilor because, among other things, the veiled woman has ordered baklava at the local bakery and they are driving a Hyundai, a foreign car. Pointing to the car, the red-faced councilor barks at them to drive their \u201cmoving bomb\u201d out of town.\n\nTo take today\u2019s political temperature in the village, I contacted H\u00e9rouxville\u2019s mayor, Bernard Thompson, an early supporter of the code of conduct. He declined to meet me, citing an urgent meeting with other local leaders. (He later told residents his mother had been ill when I was in town.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNor were some Quebecers pleased about my H\u00e9rouxville visit. On radio shows and social media, commentators tut-tutted me, suggesting that there were more interesting places. \u201cYou are completely out of touch with Quebec society,\u201d Johanne Vallin, a history teacher, wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn H\u00e9rouxville, many residents declined to disclose their full names, citing fears of retribution. At the local convenience store, a truck driver, a beer in each pocket, complained that the code of conduct was the first subject visitors brought up.\n\nA woman buying groceries said locals were fed up with all of the attention. Suzanne Lamothe, a retiree whose house is next to the main H\u00e9rouxville sign, said visitors came to the village to take selfies in front of the sign, some putting mock head scarves on their heads. She defended the code of conduct. \u201cIf immigrants come, they should respect local customs,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to a Muslim country and walk around scantily clad.\u201d Another resident asked whether I was Muslim.\n\n50 MILES quebec canada Quebec City H\u00e9rouxville Montreal me. Vt. N.Y. N.H.\n\nYet for all of the annoyance at the apparent impertinence of my visit, I was struck by the way the identity politics raised by H\u00e9rouxville still resonate.\n\nLate last year Quebec introduced Bill 62, a law requiring people to show their faces when using public services like buses and libraries. Some human rights advocates have pilloried the law for stigmatizing Muslims who wear head scarves. But others have defended it as a necessary measure to ensure Quebec\u2019s vaunted secularism and way of life.\n\nMarie Louise H\u00e9roux, whose great-uncle, the abbot Joseph-Euchariste H\u00e9roux, founded H\u00e9rouxville in 1897, said she had wanted to walk with a \u201cbag over my head\u201d after the village that bears her name became synonymous with xenophobia. She said the guidelines had been a particular source of angst for her, as she had been in love with a Muslim doctor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In H\u00e9rouxville it was pushed to ridiculous proportions, but it tapped into something that had to be taken into account.\u201d\n\nOthers said the visceral reaction to safeguard Quebec against immigration, and conservative Islam in particular, was a reflection of the province\u2019s history, its staunch feminism and its strong reflex against outward signs of religiosity.\n\nG\u00e9rard Bouchard, an eminent historian and sociologist who helped lead the commission on cultural accommodation spurred by H\u00e9rouxville, lamented that the code of conduct had attracted outsize notoriety. Nevertheless, he said the backlash against accommodating ethnic minorities partly reflected the extent to which Quebec was still under the sway of the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, when Quebecers revolted against a Roman Catholic Church that had once ruled daily life, including pressuring women to reproduce.\n\nAlluding to the situation of majority-French Quebec surrounded by English-speaking Canada, he added, \u201cWhen a majority feels like a minority, it\u2019s not a very good neighbor for other minorities.\u201d", "title": "Don\u2019t Burn Women: Warning to Immigrants Looms Over a Quebec Village", "authors": ["Dan Bilefsky"]}

Been to a Vietnamese restaurant, much less a Vietnamese household or Vietnam itself? We\u2019re really, really loud.\n\nThe situation, now and in the past, is that the minority and marginalized communities of this or any other country are often not voiceless. They\u2019re simply not heard.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with being called a voice for the voiceless, whose exceptional status is related to what we call genius. We would rather deal with a solo voice than a chorus, or a cacophony, of voices. And in praising today\u2019s voice for the voiceless, we would just as soon forget, or not even know about, all the other voices for the voiceless that came before.\n\nI think back to Edith Maude Eaton, half-Chinese and half-white, who adopted a Chinese pen name and wrote as Sui Sin Far. She advocated for Chinese immigrants and chose to be Chinese in the early years of the 20th century, at a time when to be Chinese was to be despised in North America. She published one book of short stories, \u201cMrs. Spring Fragrance,\u201d and died in poverty and obscurity at an early age in 1914.\n\nI think back to Carlos Bulosan, who migrated from the Philippines in the 1930s as a colonial ward of the United States. He worked as a journalist and a labor organizer and became a nationally celebrated writer. His fame peaked with his book \u201cAmerica Is in the Heart\u201d in 1946. By 1954, however, suspected of having Communist sympathies, he was a target of McCarthyism. He died poor and alone, of pneumonia.\n\nI think back to John Okada, who fought in World War II even though his Japanese-American family was in an internment camp. Okada came back from the war and published \u201cNo No Boy\u201d in 1957, the first novel dealing with the little-known story of Japanese-American draft resisters. America did not want to think about the internment, and the Japanese-American community, intent on being patriotic, did not want to acknowledge draft resisters. \u201cNo No Boy\u201d immediately disappeared. Okada died relatively young and his widow, in despair at his rejection, burned his second manuscript.\n\nThose are three of the most iconic Asian-American writers, and I wish genius grants were retroactive. It took genius to decide to write about Asian-Americans at a time when there was no market for Asian-American literature, no recognition for Asian-American writers, and when there weren\u2019t even any Asian-Americans. (Until the 1960s, we were collectively Orientals.)\n\nThinking back to writers like Sui Sin Far, Carlos Bulosan and John Okada, it is clear that genius is too often unrecognized in its day.

It has worked its way into our lives and has come to help satistify the basic human need to connect and catch up. Facebook, in fact, claims lofty goals, saying it seeks to \u201cbring us closer together\u201d and \u201cbuild a global community.\u201d Those are indeed noble purposes that social media can serve. But if they were Facebook\u2019s true goals, we would not be here.\n\nThe ideal competitor and successor to Facebook would be a platform that actually puts such goals first. To do so, however, it cannot be just another data-hoarder, like Google Plus. If we have learned anything over the last decade, it is that advertising and data-collection models are incompatible with a trustworthy social media network. The conflicts are too formidable, the pressure to amass data and promise everything to advertisers is too strong for even the well-intentioned to resist.\n\nSo what stands in the way of building a genuine alternative? It isn\u2019t the technology. A good Facebook competitor needs merely to build a platform that links you with friends and allows posting of thoughts, pictures and comments. No, the real challenge is gaining a critical mass of users. Facebook, with its 2.2 billion users, will not disappear, and it has a track record of buying or diminishing its rivals (see Instagram and Foursquare). But as Lyft is proving by stealing market share from Uber, and as Snapchat proved by taking taking younger audiences from Facebook, \u201cnetwork effects\u201d are not destiny. Now is the time for a new generation of Facebook competitors that challenge the mother ship.\n\nOne set of Facebook alternatives might be provided by firms that are credibly privacy-protective, for which users would pay a small fee (perhaps 99 cents a month). In an age of \u201cfree\u201d social media, paying might sound implausible \u2014 but keep in mind that payment better aligns the incentives of the platform with those of its users. The payment and social network might be bundled with other products such as the iPhone or the Mozilla or Brave browser.\n\nAnother \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be a nonprofit that uses that status to signal its dedication to better practices, much as nonprofit hospitals and universities do. Wikipedia is a nonprofit, and it manages nearly as much traffic as Facebook, on a much smaller budget. An \u201calt-Facebook\u201d could be started by Wikimedia, or by former Facebook employees, many of whom have congregated at the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit for those looking to change Silicon Valley\u2019s culture. It could even be funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was created in reaction to the failures of commercial television and whose mission includes ensuring access to \u201ctelecommunications services that are commercial free and free of charge.\u201d\n\nWhen a company fails, as Facebook has, it is natural for the government to demand that it fix itself or face regulation. But competition can also create pressure to do better. If today\u2019s privacy scandals lead us merely to install Facebook as a regulated monopolist, insulated from competition, we will have failed completely.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "The Republican attack on these repayment plans is based in part on the claim that the benefits are too generous and too expensive. For example, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate committee considering reforms to the program, says it is now \u201cstandard\u201d for students to expect their debt to be forgiven. This view is backed even by some left-leaning organizations concerned about costs. A New America Foundation report called the program a \u201cwindfall.\u201d One from the Brookings Institution said that the program was \u201csinking under its own weight.\u201d Yet another from the Urban Institute said that \u201cthe current IDR system is likely to impose high costs on taxpayers.\u201d\n\nEmboldened, Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, sponsored the Prosper Act, which has passed out of committee in the House. Under the bill, new borrowers would pay 50 percent more per month and would no longer have their loans forgiven after 20 to 25 years of repayment. The bill would also drastically cut the amount that can be borrowed for graduate school.\n\nIncome-driven repayment does have a price tag, of course. Estimates vary, but the Department of Education puts the cost for all loans outstanding at about $36 billion. Even though this may sound like a lot of money, $36 billion is pretty low in context. For one thing, it\u2019s a tiny piece of the $1.3 trillion in loans outstanding. For another, the cost of the program is nearly the same as one year of Pell Grants, the other major federal program for low-income students, but it covers 25 years\u2019 worth of loans. And most of this cost is just lost interest \u2014 the government anticipates that it will still get back more than it lends to these borrowers.\n\nEven with this cost, the student loan program could still net as much as $50 billion for taxpayers. It has long been a profit center. The profit used to be sucked up by banks, but today it belongs to the federal government, and it is appropriate to reinvest some of this money in higher education rather than kick it all back to the Treasury. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Prosper Act\u2019s changes to student loans would pad the government\u2019s profit by another $40 billion over the next 10 years. That\u2019s money coming directly out of borrowers\u2019 pockets \u2014 to what end?\n\nEven if income-driven repayment did erase the loan program\u2019s profit margin, would that be such a bad thing? Taxpayers have always subsidized higher education, recognizing that it produces enormous gains for the economy and for society as a whole. The prospect of high debt is a financial (and psychological) barrier for many students, and some insurance for those who may end up with lower incomes is a worthy goal. To call that insurance a \u201closs\u201d is to imply that taxpayers are entitled to profit off the backs of struggling borrowers.\n\nIncome-driven repayment is not without flaws. The various plans are too cumbersome and confusing, and the system of loan servicing does not work well and has led to some predatory practices. But these problems are bureaucratic, not financial. Cutting back on student loan relief because of hysteria about nonexistent losses is pound-foolish. The Department of Education is a lender, but it is not a bank; its purpose \u2014 and the purpose of the student loan program \u2014 is to further education and support students, not to turn a profit.", "title": "Opinion | Don\u2019t Let the G.O.P.

{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "Imagine a black man who lived in the Bronx around 2011, the height of the stop-and-frisk era. New York police officers threw him up against walls; they turned his pockets inside out. Some days they accused him of trespassing in his own apartment building. Every time, the police let him go without a summons and without arresting him \u2014 because he was doing nothing wrong. He was only walking to the corner store or home. Now he\u2019s a father. And while the police department says that stops have dropped, his son is also getting stopped, tossed and humiliated,even if less often.\n\nBut the words of lawyers or federal court appointees cannot serve as a substitute for that black father\u2019s voice and experiences. He knows better than we do what lasting change looks like.\n\nThousands of people like this man \u2014 people who were repeatedly stopped, or whose children or friends were repeatedly stopped \u2014 gave their input into the design of reforms through 64 focus groups and 24 community forums across the city. At the very least, the New York Police Department must adopt these three reforms to fix the problems that took it to court in the first place.\n\nFirst, the department must establish progressive and serious penalties for unconstitutional behavior by officers. One unlawful stop might lead to retraining, for example, while two could mean a loss of vacation days. The police commissioner could diverge from the guidelines whenever he deemed it appropriate. But establishing minimum discipline standards that set strict penalties would encourage lawful behavior while communicating that the department is committed to addressing misconduct.\n\nSecond, the police must use department-issued smartphones to instantly collect information about investigative activities, and to briefly explain these activities in their notes. We heard many community members describe stops that we know police officers did not report. This reform would ensure that more encounters do get reported, which would give the department a better view of whether officers understand the limits on their authority.\n\nThird, the department must create a citywide community oversight board consisting of those who have been most invested in advancing stop-and-frisk reforms. The board would monitor the department\u2019s fulfillment of changes and provide assistance. For example, it would help to identify penalties to use in the discipline standards. Such sustained and structured community oversight promises more complete and abiding reform. And it\u2019s not unprecedented: Just last month, Chicago agreed to a similar measure.\n\nThe New York Police Department says it wants to improve community relations and build trust. But it\u2019s easier to go on a listening tour than to give the community power over policies. And it\u2019s easier to talk about accountability than to earn trust through action. We can\u2019t let the department choose the easy way out.\n\nOn April 30, a court appointee is to issue a report on the community-input process. Without discipline standards, improved documentation of police activity and a community oversight board, we believe the routine violation of the rights of people of color during police encounters in New York City will go on.

Two-thirds of the state\u2019s retirees receive $36,000 or less a year.\n\nPublic pension shortfalls do occur, chiefly as a result of two factors: the lingering effects of recession and decisions by many states to skip making required contributions into their pension funds, even as workers faithfully paid their fair share.\n\nPolicymakers would do well to look at other measures \u2014 such as rethinking corporate tax breaks and regressive tax systems \u2014 rather than penalizing workers.

The towns have been held by rebels seeking to topple Mr. Assad since the early years of the Syrian war, and the rebels have often shelled Damascus, killing civilians.\n\nThe Syrian government and its allies \u2014 the Russian military and militias backed by Iran \u2014 have surrounded and bombarded the area, killing more than 1,600 people and forcing tens of thousands to flee, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria.\n\nDouma is the last remaining town in the area still controlled by rebels, and the Syrian government has vowed to retake it.\n\nPhoto\n\nA day earlier, after the government began a new offensive against the area, Hussein Mortada, a Lebanese reporter who supports the Syrian government, released a video of himself on a hill near Douma as columns of smoke from government attacks rose in the background.\n\n\u201cThese are appetizers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story is bigger than a ground invasion.

The continued assaults made it hard for rescue workers to look for victims, he said, meaning that it was difficult to establish a comprehensive death toll.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, rescue workers were \u201cgoing into homes and finding people dead,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Syrian Civil Defense and the Syrian American Medical Society, which supports clinics in opposition areas of Syria, said that more than 500 people had gone to medical centers after the assault \u201cwith symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent.\u201d Those symptoms included trouble breathing, foaming at the mouth, burning eyes and the \u201cemission of a chlorine-like odor.\u201d\n\nOne person was dead on arrival at a clinic, six others died after they got there, and rescue workers reported finding more than 42 dead in their homes, the statement said.

To get to the site, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum, you can cross through neighborhoods that are as much as 97 percent black or as much as 93 percent white.\n\nDr. King preached that segregation was harmful not only to black Americans but also to the nation as a whole. He died before the modern environmental movement, but a growing body of research around pollution and health shows that his belief about segregation hurting everyone extends to the environment as well. Many American cities that are more racially divided have higher levels of pollution than less segregated cities. As a result, both whites and minorities who live in less integrated communities are exposed to higher levels of pollution than those who live in more integrated areas.\n\n\u201cThe price that America must pay for the continued oppression of the Negro is the price of its own destruction,\u201d Dr. King wrote in a 1962 address, \u201cAn Analysis of the Ethical Demands of Integration.\u201d In it, he set out the political, ethical and spiritual reasons he believed that segregation was harmful for all. Some historians say his thoughts are applicable to understanding environmental issues today.\n\nResearchers have known since at least the 1980s that black and Hispanic communities have higher levels of pollution and its associated harmful health effects than white communities, even when controlling for income. Studies show that racial discrimination leads governments and companies to place polluting facilities, like landfills, power plants and truck routes, in black and Hispanic communities. Race is not the only factor in environmental inequality \u2014 poorer people experience more pollution than wealthier people. But for blacks, race trumps income.

What are its rules? Do you consider them fair?\u201d Our popular prompt was inspired by this Times article about Lizzy Martinez, 17, a student in Florida who was reprimanded for not wearing a bra.\n\nAnna P from Houston thinks calling the student out was an overreaction by school officials:\n\nThe way the school handled the so-called dress code violation was completely inappropriate. Lizzy was not violating the dress code; requiring girls to wear bras is not even in the handbook. It was not within the administrations rights to call her out... Not only was it not in their rights but it also clearly made Lizzy uncomfortable and violated. Making her walk around the room while they scrutinized her was inappropriate. Lizzy hadn\u2019t even heard anything about her not wearing a bra until she got called into the dean\u2019s office. It obviously was not a problem because she would have seen people staring and laughing at her. There was really no reason for her to be called into the office for something so silly.\n\nCody D from Houston thinks the school\u2019s response draws unnecessary attention to the student:\n\nThe problem I have with this situation is the fact that the dress code does not actually have anything saying female students are required to wear a bra, but she was still forced to bear a cruel and unusual punishment which only drew more attention to her. From what I have seen this school\u2019s dress code is not too strict, but this case was handled very poorly.\n\nMaya M from Concord, North Carolina thinks dress codes everywhere tend to be sexist:\n\nI am entirely shocked by this. Dress code has always been an extreme all over America, as far as I know, and no one can deny it is aimed at girls. Even though it is always brought up that OTHER people, namely men and boys, are distracted. That\u2019s so messed up. We shouldn\u2019t be punishing girls for something that is out of their control. If a man can\u2019t control himself he is no better than an animal, and they should be punished themselves. I completely get there needs to be some set of rules. You can\u2019t come to school wearing basically just underwear, but girls should not be forced to wear bras if they don\u2019t want to! Girls should be able to wear tank tops and shorts when it\u2019s 70+ degrees Fahrenheit outside! The restrictions are wrong and downright humiliating.\n\nAnna from In class thinks the student\u2019s attire is off-base, as is the school\u2019s reaction:\n\nI agree it was inappropriate of Lizzy to go to school without a bra, but the way administration handled the situation was inappropriate and unfair. If the school\u2019s dress code did not specifically state females were required to wear bras, no one had the right to order Lizzy to put a bra on. Lizzy did not break any rule and should have not been reprimanded for something, which was completely justified for her to do. If it had been an boy with \u201cman boobs\u201d would they require him to wear a bra too? I think not. I do not believe the school was intentionally being sexist, but they need to think before they act next time!\n\nBig Ken thinks dress codes have a purpose:\n\nWhen faced with a question such as this, one must first consider what the point of dress codes are. In some areas, such as military institutions, dress codes bring conformity. If you look at successful CEO\u2019s such as Steve Jobs, they wear the same thing over and over. While this may make them appear boring, it enables them to not waste valuable energy and brainpower deciding what to wear. When students do not need to decide what to wear each day, they are able to put more focus and energy into schoolwork. Especially at my school, dress codes aren\u2019t just to be annoying. In addition to allowing students to conserve brainpower, they also remove unnecessary distractions caused by students wearing revealing or distracting clothing.\n\nMadison from Houston sees injustice:\n\nHonestly, I am very disappointed in the way that the school handled the situation. Lizzy clearly was minding her own business, wanted to stay pain-free, and did not want to cause any trouble shown by her previous actions in wearing clothing that would have some flow to it. The administrators, made fun of her and her body, and went to strange and extreme lengths despite that no one around her in class mentioned or was disturbed by her not wearing a bra. They should have maybe found a sweatshirt for Lizzy, not recommend putting band-aids on, plus this situation just feels so dramatized when the handbook did not make a direct statement in the first place.\n\nNick F doesn\u2019t like the way the student was made uncomfortable by the school\u2019s decisions and actions:\n\nLizzy\u2019s so called dress code violation was handled with very poorly. Firstly, the school was very ignorant for not knowing their own Code of Conduct and for forcing Lizzy to do more than what she agreed to in this Code. Secondly, even after Lizzy complied and put on the undershirt, the administration then made her do more because they could still see her nipples at an specific angle. Lizzy was made uncomfortable both physically and emotionally by the school\u2019s administration. It shouldn\u2019t have been considered a violation in the first place because there is nothing clearly stated in the Code of Conduct that makes her have to cover up with a bra. The administrators should have left this entire situation alone because it was never a violation, but then it also called attention to Lizzy not wearing a bra when not that many students or teachers cared or noticed in the first place. To wear a bra is ultimately a decision for the student to do and the school can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t do anything about.\n\nKaylin A from Texas sees a double standard:\n\nLizzie\u2019s only mistake was not putting on enough sunscreen. How can she be expected to wear something so constricting while having a burn on her shoulders? Also, according to their handbook she wasn\u2019t in any violation. It\u2019s not in the administrations place to call her out for it, and the entire situation is incredibly disrespectful to her privacy. Lizzie would have noticed if people we \u201claughing\u201d at her for not wearing a bra, and if no one was, it\u2019s ovbiously not a massive conflict like the principal made it out to be. I\u2019d say dress codes are definitely more discriminatory to girls than guys. We can\u2019t wear leggings or a shirt showing a little bit of shoulder without it being \u201cinnappropiate and distracting\u201d to the male population.\n\nyan H was the first of three to reply to Kaylin:\n\nI think the school and administration handled the situation poorly. The school\u2019s handbook had no policy saying that girls are required to wear bras to school. It was Lizzy\u2019s choice to go to to school with no bra on, so if she was getting any unwanted attention or uncomfortable she could change into a bra if she wanted to. The administration should not have done anything.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Picture Prompt \u201cStandardized Tests\u201d inspired some well-argued anti-test rants, but also garnered comments from a few who feel they are useful.\n\nVanessa Vander Syde from Knoxville, Tenn., thinks the tests are not an accurate indicator of student knowledge or ability:\n\nWell, now days students aren\u2019t taught to be taught. We\u2019re taught to pass the test. If you don\u2019t you re take the test until you pass or you can\u2019t graduate. ( In some states like Texas) my sister had to take the English 1 STAAR every year of high school. Thankfully she passed her senior year. I don\u2019t think her test scores reflected her intelligence at all. Pleanty of children have testing anxiety. They freak out when it comes to taking the tests.In my personal experience I broke my ankle my 6th grade year. I had to go to the orthopedic surgeon the morning of my math STAAR. I was late to the test and my leg was uncomfortable because I had just had a new cast put on. I nearly failed that test. I know it wasn\u2019t my intelligence that brought my score down.Often times the tests are during flu and allergy season. So many kids go to school sick just to take the tests. In fact last year many of my friends and I went to school sick just so we could pass the 9th grade.In short the tests are useless, and inefficient. These test scores don\u2019t reflect us or how smart we really are.\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., agrees, and says standardized tests are also unfair:\n\nStandardized tests do not accurately assess my knowledge and abilities. For the eight years that I have taken them, I have gotten very high scores. Of course, I felt happy, but annoyed at the same time. The company who produces the test, in my case it is the PARCC test, does not know what type of student I am. They have no idea how much I try, or even what my grades are. It is my score on that one day that I see, and just because I am a good test taker, that is all that matters. This year, I must pass the math section of the PARCC in order to graduate high school. Regardless of my grades, if I fail this test than I will not pass middle school. Standardized tests are not fair for kids who are straight A students but bad test takers. Their must be another way to judge progress, rather than a one day test. It should grades of students which are the real focus. They give an accurate picture of who students are. When I take this version of the PARCC test in a few weeks, I will put in my full effort, but all the while knowing that the results will not be showing who I really am academically.\n\nLydia P from Walhalla, S.C., feels tests take up too much valuable classroom time:\n\nStandardized tests are becoming more of a norm for students across the world. It seems like they just keep stacking up to the point where students are forgetting what this particular test is and focusing on just finishing it and not doing their best. Teachers, administrators, and parents do try to encourage students to do well on these test, but I believe that even they fall into the monotency of standardized testing. These test are not a accurate representation of many traits and values that will assist students more in the workforce than a good grade on a test. These tests are also taking valuable classroom time for students who are meant to be learning to prepare them for skills they need to acquire for the future. Students should be able to demonstrate their knowledge and abilities in other ways that actually help them achieve success in their future careers, like a skills workshop that students compete in their proposed career cluster. Standardized testing is somewhat necessary as we do need a way to be able to rank students success and progress, but too much of it is causing good students to underachieve.\n\nMeg Fischer from South Carolina persuasively attacks several points commonly used in favor of testing, and offers up solutions:\n\nStandardized testing was created to make money for organizations who claimed that they would accurately test students on their skills for the lives they were prepared to lead. The teachers don\u2019t like them probably more than the students, as we\u2019re constantly being taken from their classes for \u201cprep\u201d and the tests themselves. Parents worry that their children are being pushed too hard, being made to take six standardized tests within a single year in order to \u201cqualify\u201d for college. What these tests don\u2019t take into account, however, is that the knowledge they\u2019re expecting students to have for their questions haven\u2019t been memorized by all the students taking them. The tests are generalized for the entire student body, with problems from elementary level to AP course level, and not all students have been introduced to the higher level material being tested.To fix this, schools could give a personalized test based on the classes students had taken (i.e everything up to Algebra, everything up to English 2 Honors) at the end of the year that accurately measured the level of command students have over the skills they\u2019d been taught that year, and the years before. This would precisely measure how well they knew the material they\u2019d been taught, rather than test them on the skills they\u2019d never been introduced to.\n\nIsaac from South Carolina says he is motivated to do well on standardized tests, despite not enjoying them:\n\nAlthough I agree standardized testing is necessary in education, there seems to be an inordinate amount of testing, especially for high school juniors. Without a certain amount of standardized tests, it would be extremely challenging to measure basic academic skills and abilities. However, as an AP student, I find it very annoying that I have to miss valuable class periods to take standardized tests that test standards rather than intellectual abilities. I recognize their purpose and function, but I believe that there has to be a more efficient method to assessing student knowledge. A more individualized approach to standardized testing could perhaps allow every student to adequately express their individual skills and abilities.Personally, I do not feel that much pressure from parents and teachers to perform well on tests. I believe that education is my own responsibility and that my scores reflect more on my individual abilities rather than those of my instructors. Granted teacher\u2019s jobs often do depend on student performance, many times pressure from adults stems from a desire to see students do well. The pressure I face on standardized tests often comes from myself, sometimes unnecessarily. I do not enjoy standardized tests, but I do have personal motivation to perform well on them.\n\nAnd Randy Parris from Walhalla, S.C., thinks the tests have their place:\n\nAs an 11th grade high school student, I have been through my fair share of standardized tests. The MAP and PASS tests in elementary school, and they continued into middle school, and now in high school the ACT, PSAT, SAT, WIN, Accuplacer, and the ASVAB. Something notable is what the tests are trying to achieve. Through elementary school and middle school the MAP and the PASS made sure we were meeting our standards. However, in high school, we have exams to track our yearly progression, which opens up more opportunities for tests for future jobs and college placement. All this testing may seem like lots of extra work, but I think it is a necessary evil. If all colleges require one or more of the tests to be taken by an applicant, we might as well take them in high school. That way, if we need to have a do-over we will have plenty of time to do so. Also, tests like the WIN and Accuplacer are preparing us for jobs that could be in our future. I think that the tests in elementary school and middle school are accurate enough to test the standards, but the tests in high school are more important because they can have a large impact on your future. I personally do not feel overly pressured to do well on these tests. I try to do well because I want to do well. All in all, standardized tests are not fun, but they are important.\n\nClaudia Overstreet from Tennessee disagrees, saying:\n\nI believe that there\u2019s too much standardized testing in general, not just at my school. Standardized testing eats up valuable class time and adds unnecessary pressure to an already stressful environment. I personally feel stressed due to standardized testing because the work load during that time always feels more daunting. I do not believe that testing is an accurate way to assess knowledge mostly beacams of the time constraints; some students work slower than others, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are any less smart. By rushing these students, their abilities are not able to shine through.\n\nGena from Wichita, Kan., remembers the youngest test takers, and admires the Finnish educational system:\n\nWe have standardized testing in kindergarten! The 5-year-olds are given a page of size 10 font to read. They don\u2019t usually read like this! It\u2019s overwhelming that your teacher tells you to read so many words without pictures and then hurry up too. All of this is done to start gaging baseline scores for data. The results confuse and make anxious kids and parents alike. Public school kindergarteners should not be used as data points. Cognitive development recognizes that kids do not start learning to read until they are seven. Let the kids be kids and don\u2019t start testing until grade 3 like the Finns!\n\nBrandon M from Caruthers High School is not bothered by standardized tests, and credits his teachers with good preparation:\n\nI think that standardized testing in school is not to much we can handle. Well you have to think about it if you can\u00b4t take it now how are you going to prevail when your an adult. Sometimes I do feel pressured not from my teachers but from myself. I am always thinking \u00a8will I get 100% or fail I really need to do well.\u00a8 This is what I tell myself before every test that come upon me. I\u00b4m not quivering in my own shoes about just nervous. Standardized test do push my knowledge to the test, push my thinking ability harder, and smarter. It really gets your brain worker at it\u00b4s maximum capacity. So standardized testing doesn\u2019t really bother me at all. Also teachers are doing a fantastic job preparing us students to do our best on every test that come our way.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nIn response to the prompt \u201cWhat Musical Piece Would You Nominate for a Pulitzer Prize?,\u201d students reflected on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s award and made their own suggestions for future prizewinners.\n\nBella L from Portland, Ore., says Mr. Lamar\u2019s win was deserved:\n\nIt\u2019s very cool that Kendrick Lamar\u2019s album won the Pulitzer Prize, and I do believe it was well earned. The album is serious and talks about important issues. Lamar should be proud, and it\u2019s a win-win for being the first rapper to win the Pulitzer, and for being the first non-classical or jazz musician. I hope this win will attract many other people to listen to the album, especially those who wouldn\u2019t normally listen to rap music. As the board called the album, it was a \u201cvirtuosic song collection\u201d and had \u201cvernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism.\u201d The album was very popular, and though classical musicians or jazz musicians who usually win may be angry that they didn\u2019t win, hip hop music is something fresh and different among the past Pulitzer winners. His songs and the album have a lot of meaning and I think he deserved the prize.\n\nBrandon Navarrete from Wilmington, N.C., agrees and recommends J. Cole for his own Pulitzer:\n\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018DAMN\u2019 deserved to win the Pulitzer prize, without a doubt. As the jurors had said, the genre of Hip-hop/rap has \u201cvalue on its own terms\u201d especially when it comes to someone like Kendrick, the wordplay and context in his music makes the album that much better. To be able to incorporate modern African american life into an album and make it sound good is what sets this album apart from others, but it is nothing new from Kendrick Lamar since he\u2019s done it before with \u201cTo pimp a butterfly\u201d and \u201cGood kid, M.A.A.D City\u201d but DAMN. Just goes to prove that the influence of Hip-hop on modern culture can\u2019t be ignored anymore. Mr. Hajdu says that in recent years, the people behind the prize have \u201csought to assertively think and listen more expansively, with open ears\u201d since the prize has been awarded primarily to classical artists and later onto Jazz and now in the genre of Hip-hop to Kendrick. Without bias, another hip-hop influence, J. Cole, could easily win a Pulitzer prize in my eyes, his current release KOD is genius and has potential to win if ever nominated but Apart from the fact a classical composer called it \u201cinsulting\u201d, I disagree because DAMN. was worth the win in my opinion, what Kendrick crafted, not many others can do.\n\nGeorge Griffin from NC thinks this event marks a cultural shift in the way people think about rap music:\n\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s album was certainly worthy of the Pulitzer prize. It says alot about the current state of rap music and sheds light on the advanced lyricism and creativity that went into the making of not only \u2018DAMN\u2019 but many other of Kendrick\u2019s previous albums. Kendrick is definitely the most deserving of this award out of all the artists in the hip-hop genre. Along with other hip-hop artists such as J cole, Kanye, and Drake, Kendrick has greatly influenced the culture of this genre. His ability to over come countless obstacles in his child hood to get where he is now speaks volumes. This shows younger artists that its possible to achieve a new level of success in this genre because it is becoming more widely accepted in our society.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents came forth with personal anecdotes, passionate pleas and many questions in response to our Student Opinion prompt \u201cDoes Your School Need More Money?\u201d\n\nANA4D from YC CLIP is shocked by the state of the United States education system:\n\nI can\u2019t believe all of I read. I can\u2019t believe in the United States a country that a lot of people want to come to live here and to get better future, the school conditions are bad. How is possible this happen in this country? What happen with our leaders in each state? Why the relevant authorities ignore the situation of our schools? I was surprised with each descriptions, pictures and that teachers spend their own money from their own pockets for supply materials exceeding these over 1,000 dollars and when they have a low salary. That is impossible to believe. It is irrelevant to say that the government should prioritize spending money on education and they have to create a consistent method to support the majority of our schools, because in the future this will help to get better education for our children, furthermore, teachers will feel more passionate and focus on their students and their vocation and not to worry about books, pencils, school furniture, computers and other things. I think every school should have a significant budget to use for all of materials required every student. If my school had a bigger budget I think it should be spent on create diverse activities such as art, music, buying more books to motivate reading. At the same time, the schools can help parents to be involve in every school activity.\n\nEmilia Cordon from Wilmington, N.C., speaks from personal experience:\n\nMy school can\u2019t afford a lot. Despite teachers\u2019 low salaries, my school still can\u2019t afford basic needs like copies and books. It\u2019s been a while since the textbooks have been replaced, but just this year the school has implemented strict limits on teachers\u2019 copies. Hearing these stories of teachers being on the edge of poverty really makes me angry. They are working in desolate conditions, being forced to pay upward of 1,000 of their own dollars a year on basic things they can\u2019t teach without. My mom is a teacher and thankfully has never suffered any of these extreme situations, but she still is underpaid in my opinion for a teacher with a masters degree and about 15 years of experience. The local governments need to hear these teachers and provide them with the fiscal support they need. I don\u2019t know enough about their budget to suggest a change, but there must be some government program that either is overpaid or just unnecessary. This should be a more discussed issue and at the forefront of local politics.\n\nTanya Bolick from North Carolina says she would gladly give up a new gym and cafeteria at her school so others could have basic necessities:\n\nWow! I knew the education systems all around were struggling but I did not think it was this bad. My school has been fortunate enough to be able to build a second gym, a new cafeteria, and will be replacing damaged floors in some rooms. While I think it absurd that we built a second gym instead of an auditorium or redoing the bathrooms or buying textbooks or anything else, it is evident that the fact we have the money is extraordinary. After reading the article and looking at pictures of water stained ceilings and ducked taped textbooks and bare library shelves it is obvious that schools all around need more funding. I would gladly give up my new gym to give these people furniture for their classrooms and textbooks and renovate their buildings. After reading the article it is clear that years teaching does not influence the amount one is paid; in fact I noticed that some younger teachers were getting paid more than more experienced teachers. I also noticed that the annual out-of-pocket expenses of teachers ranged anywhere from $300 to $2000, that is unacceptable; your job should only make you money not cost you money. David Russell builds bookshelves and paints his classroom, Beth Etzler furnished her whole room herself with her own money; these are all things the government should be doing, not the teachers.\n\nBut Lisa4D from YC CLIP thinks American students should be grateful for what they have in comparison to other countries:\n\nWhen I was primary student in Japan, the Great East Japanese Earthquake occurred in our country. Our classes were broken and we lost almost all furniture and many textbooks at the time. After the happened, many schools had received donation from other parts of Japan or countries for restoration assistance following the Greatest East Japan Earthquake. Even we had received these supports, we had been taking classes without furniture during a year. Students and teachers were sitting down on school yard but we were very happy taking classes with all, even though we didn\u2019t have any textbooks and furniture.15,000 people were killed in the Earthquake and all students of my school was safe. Still now many people are living in temporary housing and some children don\u2019t go to school because the school have not rebuilt yet. I am sad about this article because some schools have bad conditions, but for me there are classes, furniture, and textbooks even though these are dirty and broken, it is fine. At least taking classes in dirty place is better than no place to take classes. They should broaden one\u2019s view.\n\nTati Nadal from Houston responded to Lisa4D:\n\nWhile I agree entirely how America could have it much worse, only 2% of federal tax dollars go towards public education. Intercity schools take the worst hit due to living in an impoverished environment. In addition, living in that circumstance would deter one\u2019s perseverance and ambition. However, I agree with your claim that people should work hard, but it is not a reality most of the time. Once born into poverty, it is difficult to get out of it. Most inner city public schools also don\u2019t set up a path for their students to be able to go to college and get a degree to help them in their desired career path. Children born into poverty have a slim chance of having a professional degree. Instead, they have to settle for vocational or manual labor like construction workers, etc. Given this information, I pose a couple of questions: Why isn\u2019t the government giving more money to public schools? What percentage (if they raised government spending on education) should/ would be taken away from other areas of government spending? Is this morally right? Does medicare, benefits for veterans, and social security deserve less government money? What should it be spent on?\n\nThis comment by Jonathan Wells from Houston, Tex., was easily the most popular \u2014 earning a Readers\u2019 Pick designation and starting off a flurry of responses:\n\nI found this article very interesting, but I think there are two unspoken issues related to this subject. First, teachers having tenure prevents school administrations from firing them for poor performance. This is largely because of teacher unions funding elections and paying politicians for pro-union laws. The other issue is that the government is spending a lot of money things that could be prevented by an excellent education. Well-educated people are less likely to smoke, well-educated people are less likely to drink, well-educated people are less likely to commit crimes. I wonder, could we spend more money in education, so that we would not have to spend so much on welfare?\n\nSo if schools could get more money, where should it all go? Students had some suggestions. Like Melek BenAyed from Wichita, Kan., who says teachers should get a pay raise:\n\nThe money that a school should first go to the teachers. If we look at countries with the best education today, they all share one thing in common, good pay to teachers. In my opinion, schools should add every single teacher\u2019s paycheck a minimum of 10 grand. Teachers are the ones who raised past generations, raising my generation currently, and will raise even more to come. They HAVE to be rewarded.\n\nAndrew Covington from Concord, N.C., wants his county to fix his current school \u2014 not spend millions on building a new one:\n\nOur school, (Concord High), definitely needs more money. Our school doesn\u2019t even compare to Hickory Ridge, Cox Mill, or JM Robinson. There are so many things that need to improve in this school. Half of the school is somewhat new while the other half is nearly 50 years old. This presents problems in multiple ways. The older half is very poorly designed and the flow of students is very bad. We have one of the smallest commons area that I\u2019ve seen leading people to stand in the hallway. Probably the most frustrating thing is that instead of improving our school or other schools in the district like ours, the county decides to build another school. This school will millions in which we could have used to greatly improve our struggling school. Unfortunately the best solution to this problem is to build a new concord high school. However, this probably wont happen for a while, despite the terrible school experience.\n\nAnd Keara Haynes from Concord thinks education dollars should go toward new technology:\n\nEducation is broadening and developing therefore schools need to do so as well. Education is necessary for a person to be able to succeed in life. To get any well paying job, one needs education. New information is being discovered therefore new information needs to be taught and distributed so people and their knowledge can develop with the world that is also developing. Money can be used by schools to do so by purchasing things such as computers, new textbooks, new technology, or virtual accounts to aid in teaching (i.e. khan academy). Personally I think that schools should spend the money on technology such as computers or laptops. The world is turning into a very digital community and most information in online. Purchasing more technology for schools can give students and teachers access to this new and upcoming information. This then allows fro a better quality education for students who need education to succeed in life.\n\nAW from Texas \u2014 and several others who replied to this comment \u2014 wonders if being a teacher is a realistic career aspiration anymore:\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to be a teacher. Now that I am in high school, I face the struggle with choosing if education is the path I should take in college. Almost on the daily, when asked what I want to do after college, and answer become a teacher, the responses I get include \u201cbut they make such little money,\u201d \u201care you sure?\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re going to be poor,\u201d which is discouraging to say the least. I believe that governments should prioritize spending money on education. Getting an education is one of the most important things in a child\u2019s life to help them succeed. Teachers get paid very little even though they are basically shaping children\u2019s lives. With a failing education system, we get children with less or false knowledge who don\u2019t know what is happening in the world now, or what happened in the past. The world and education today is not the same as textbooks from 10 years and beyond teach it is.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Student Opinion prompt, \u201cHow Do You Feel About Being Told to Smile?\u201d hit a nerve with some, and made others, well... smile.\n\nKaplan Aktas from North Carolina thinks people are overreacting when they take offense:\n\n(This may offend some people, read at your own discretion.) Honestly, after reading this article, reading the story that follows it and an article named \u201cStop Telling Women To Smile\u201d, I just don\u2019t see it. People complain over these problems, if you can even call them that, and don\u2019t see a simple solution: Ignore the person if it pains you that much to flex a couple muscles in your face. I think the woman who went a time period without smiling proved a great point whilst also contradicting her 1st argument: It is extremely hard to hold back a smile, or joy, or laughter, it\u2019s simply human nature. This doesn\u2019t only cater to women too, men are told to smile by other men or worse things about their appearance like \u201cOh you look like ____ today what happened?\u201d or what I see as equivalent of telling women to smile, telling a man to shave. Personally when someone asks me too smile, I smile. As a waiter at a family business I happily oblige when some asks or \u201cDemands\u201d that I smile because that tells me i\u2019m not doing my job properly of greeting and waiting on people with hospitality and comfort. Needless to say I understand that there is a \u201cSocial Construct\u201d and some people don\u2019t see it as fit to have this in place but if we didn\u2019t have such things in place then civilization might be in a much worse place than it is now. So like I said in the first paragraph, I hate to be harsh but people need to get over it because we as a civilization have much more pressing issues to get over.\n\nKay from St. Cloud says a smile should be for the person doing the smiling:\n\nIn most pictures, especially in high school portraits, you will notice female students smile while the male students have a blank, relaxed expression. It has become a societal norm in the United States for boys to appear secretive and emotionless and girls to be friendly and kind. Smiling has become a greeting, for example when you pass a stranger in the grocery store. Smiling shows that you are a kind, friendly person, just as girls are expected to be. It brought me no surprise to read the citizens of the United States smile more often than others. In this country there is a popular tendency to hide discontent. Social media influences has created a need for people to smile, and share their \u201cgood times\u201d with the world. People are forcing smiles because that is what you are \u201csupposed\u201d to do. But just like males, women don\u2019t HAVE to smile, or come off as a gentle person. We can be as happy as can be without showing it, and there is no obligation to do so. Smile for yourself because it means something to you and because it\u2019s natural. We do so much in this world by force for the betterment of our future, sacrifice forcing to smile for the betterment of yourself. Maybe one day like Ms. Ko we will smile from true, personal connection.\n\nRuth from 3D YC CLIP loves it when people smile:\n\nFirst, I work in a restaurant and sometimes I have to take orders. I really like to smile, because I like to feel comfortable with the people even though they do not care. A smile can change our day and I have my own experiences when I feel sad and someone smile me I think the people can share their happiness through of smile.\n\nCoral 3D from YC CLIP thinks culture plays a part, and says obligatory smiling is wrong:\n\nI think that smiled is the best way to express our feelings. If you are happy, if you see someone that you know, or because you want smiled is perfect. The problem is when other people tell you that you need smile. Why? Is very uncomfortable do that if you do not want. May be you have a bad day, or you do not feel good or only you do not want. I think that the people smiled more depending on where they worn born. For example, I am from Spain, and in Europe the people think that we are very happies and that always are smiled. Other countries like Italia or France smiled to much, but for example others countries like Germany or Switzerland do no laugh so much, it is usually more serious. This is the way that the people is and each one is as it is. I believe that what is important is to feel good about yourself, no matter what the people are thinking. If you want to laugh perfect, but if is not good to do it by obligation.\n\nRachel from Maine says it\u2019s really all about respect:\n\nI really liked her experiment of not smiling for a day. Like she said, \u201cIf a smile is the appearance of happiness, then to be commanded to smile takes away our right to our own feelings.\u201d Forcing another person to feel happy or just forcing emotions into to other people. We have a right to feel how we feel because people walking by on the street don\u2019t know what is going on in your life. Plus, I think that a lot of people view happy as the \u201cright\u201d feeling but there is no \u201cright\u201d feeling. If you\u2019re sad, you can be sad, and if you\u2019re angry, be angry. People need to respect others people\u2019s business because they don\u2019t know what is going on in their personal life.\n\nScott Pace from San Antonio, Tex., is clear and straightforward in his answer:\n\nI hate when my teachers tell me to smile, because what is the reason for us to smile,well unless were taking a picture together, otherwise no.\n\nAnaly from Saint Cloud does not enjoy being told to show emotions she isn\u2019t feeling:\n\n\u201cYou look pretty when you smile, so smile\u201d. No, I am not going to smile to conform to your standard of beauty. If you go away maybe I\u2019ll smile. However, my face naturally appears annoyed, mad, and gloomy. I will not go out of my way to please you. Concealing my feelings will only have a negative impact on me in the long run.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion question \u201cWhat Advice Do You Have for Teenagers and Their Parents?\u201d brought in all kinds of recommendations for how the relationship can be improved.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., tries to remember that her mom just wants the best for her:\n\nMy mom and I are remarkably close, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I am immune from what Lisa Damour described about wanting nothing more than to separate myself from my parents. My mom is the first person I turn to when I am upset and need someone to lean on and she is also the first person I go to when something amazing happens. She knows me better than anyone, but because she is a parent, a lot of pressure comes from her. Even when she tries not to put pressure on me (because I put enough of it on myself), I am still worried about how she will react if I don\u2019t succeed. I think it is almost an innate want to please your parents no matter how many times they tell you they just want you to be happy. Just because people are parent and child does not make them automatically compatible. Like, Michelle Kuo wrote, some parents will simply have different view points and ideals about how kids should be raised and the decisions they make as adults. However, I completely agree with the other part she said, about loving them no matter how confused and disapproving they might be about your choices because a parent\u2019s love is probably the one truly unconditional love in life and they will always be there, wishing the best for you. Again, even the best parent-child relationships will have ups and downs. Sometimes when somebody knows you so well, it can be frustrating and infuriating. I also know that no matter what, my mom will always be my best friend and the one person I can always rely on.\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., thinks having empathy helps parents and teenagers understand one another:\n\nAll of the rules that Ms. Kuo and Ms. Dampour list can be boiled down to one word: empathy. The basis of any healthy relationship is a common care and respect, one that must be mutual no matter the situation. The same rule applies with parent and teenagers. The parent should think back to when they were young, and imagine what they would do. By doing this, they are putting themselves in the shoes of the teenager;empathizing. The teenager should take a minute, and imagine what it is like to be a parent. This is hard-I am a teenager too-but it will work. There are always two sides to every story, so trying to understand the other point of view will make a consensus much easier to achieve.\n\nMonalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., believes communication is the key to strengthening the parent-child bond:\n\nEveryone has a unique relationship with their parents. Some have an open and honest relationship, where they feel that they can talk to their parent. On the other hand some are not so lucky and the relationship may not always be secure and safe. Their really is no set of advice that you can give to work for everyone. I think a good start is communication. For example, my mom and I are extremely close. I know I can talk to her about anything. I think that a secure relationship at least one parent is crucial. Our lives are constantly changing, with friends coming and going, social media, and the daily dramas of high school. Having some stability even if it\u2019s just at home can be comforting. Personally, coming home to my mom asking \u201cHow was your day love?\u201d is the best part, because even if I\u2019ve had the worst day on the planet talking to her always makes me feel better. In regards to what Ms.Kuo wrote, I definitely can agree with some of the things on her list. Especially with her closing statement stating \u201cThey might not ever see things the way you do and that\u2019s O.K. Show them love as best you can.\u201d That statement was really important to me because no matter what they are your parents the only ones you\u2019ve got. It may not always be a walk in the park but no matter what happens you know they\u2019ll always be there for you.\n\nAvery Miller from Concord, N.C., thinks mutual respect is important \u2014 even in the face of disagreements:\n\ni can heavily relate to this article because of my own personal experiences. i don\u2019t get along with my parents due to our differences of opinion on many things. I\u2019ve grown up and realized i\u2019m different from that and i think deep down they know, but they won\u2019t admit it. The advice Kuo gives was very helpful. He explains to still love your children and accept differences.Ms. Kuo makes a list on ways she disappointed her parents and i can add to that my political views and the people i choose to date and the amount of fun i like to have. my parent are too upright and they worry too much about what other people think when they should not. i am very different from them and will have a different identity from them, but i never disrespect them so i disagree with Ms. damours opinion.\n\nJaya Lloyd from North Carolina suggests parents give their children space to discover themselves:\n\nI believe that parents should become more open-minded when it comes to their kids and the decision they decide to make. I think every parents wants the best for their kids but sometimes the way they present that information/ideas is not the most helpful. The advice that Kuo gives really put things into perspecrtive by trying to get us as teenagers to look at things from a parents view. I think that being a teenager we struggle with a lot of identity issues, many of us are still trying to figure out what we like or what we want to do with our lives. My opinion would be for the parents to present us with a little more room to breathe, because we all know our parents were in the position we were in at once and instead of trying to find our paths for us all us to do that on our own with the support from a distance.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Picture Prompt \u201cMan at Desk\u201d elicited a variety of explanations for what this illustration might mean.\n\nMaggie Yang from King of Prussia thinks it represents creativity:\n\nWhen I see this image, I think of the creativity that flows through a writer. This is person is able to take the points of many different views and piece it together to make something original. All of the writer\u2019s different characters were kept in mind as he writes.\n\nTucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., says it\u2019s about memory:\n\nThis picture seems to represent the idea of what makes writing: experience. At first I assumed that this was the burden of people who he carries with him, but that comes from my own pessimistic personality. I can see how with every person who grasps onto him holds their own pencil, as if they all have a story to tell. That feels like he is writing from his past, with every form of him that built up to who he is now. I can get that same way when I just write with no intention, where the pages start to flood with memories of me torturing myself with math homework or how I felt when I turned an enemy into a friend. Memories are different entities all together, and each piece is still floating around somewhere, no matter how we change.\n\nDanielle Filandino from Pennsylvania interprets it as a depiction of the writing process itself:\n\nWhen I see this image, I think of what happens when you write a story. You come up with these fictional characters, humans that are not actually human. You write out lives for people you will never meet. Sometimes you get so involved you know where a characters great great grandmother was born. For me, I can spend hours developing one character before I even start the story. When I do finally get to my story, my characters help me write. That\u2019s what the floating silhouettes represent. Their appearance affects the way the world is described in their eyes. Their personality affects the way they react to trauma and other emotions. What they see is totally different to the way another character sees something. This is what this picture says to me.\n\nAnd Mariana Alvarado from St. Cloud relates it to her own experience of writing poetry:\n\nWriting portrays deep thought and emotion of the person composing. I often take the time to write poetry. In my opinion, this picture depicts all the different influences that often affect someone when they put words on paper. It also portrays all the different emotions that comes with it. Writing is so much more than just the influence of a single person. I often find myself writing in the perspective of other people, in order to generalize and encompass a larger group of people, rather than just those who can relate to me.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter two black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks earlier this month, students weighed in with their thoughts via our related writing prompt \u201cShould All Companies Offer Anti-Bias Training?\u201d\n\nXander Kruvczuk from United States of America is shocked that this kind of discrimination still exists today:\n\nI myself live in the Philly area. However, I have not really seen or heard discrepancy against anybody of any race, gender, age, or sexual orientation. I think it is because of the fact that I\u2019m usually trapped in my own head while walking down the street, or playing outside with my siblings. I have, however, seen discrimination of every kind online, whether it be chat rooms, video game chats, or social media. I hadn\u2019t really been made aware that it happened so much outside of the internet until about last year, when stories started showing up in my news feed. This happens to be one of the stories that crossed my feed. I\u2019m am sickened by that fact that is kind of treatment still exists today in our society. I think that Starbucks is making the right decision by giving its employees anti-bias training. Lots of people today are very biased against others, and this can lead to problems for everyone. I think that companies should offer anti-bias training, but not make it mandatory. I don\u2019t think it should be mandatory, just because there are some people who have respect for those who are different from them. Forcing them to re-learn something that they already know would be rather pointless.\n\nAnd Avery Miller from Concord, N.C., is all too familiar with these kinds of stories:\n\nmy opinion of this article is that what happened in Starbucks was horrible and how it was handled needs to change because this continues to happen everyday. The way starbucks handled it, by having anti-bias training for their employees was a good idea. IN my opinion all companies need to do this until the problem is solved. I\u2019m tired of hearing stories about innocent black people getting accused of things, killed, discriminated against, and etc. All people should be treated the same no matter what. i would be scared and very frustrated if i were a black person living in Philadelphia or in any place where i get followed by police officers.\n\nBut Collin from Lawrence doesn\u2019t see the event as an act of racial prejudice:\n\nSituations like this pop up in the news when everything goes wrong. The situation begins when two guys walk into a Starbucks and sit down. I was unaware that loitering is such a big issue but, it is. Let me say that, I don\u2019t think that this is race issue. The manager just wanted them to leave because they were not buying anything, even thought they said that they were waiting for someone. I honestly don\u2019t understand why the manager couldn\u2019t take their word on it. I think that calling the police was completely unnecessary considering the situation, but it happened. Although the situation ended so poorly, I must commemorate the police officers. There job is to keep the peace and solve civil issues. They resolved the issue as peaceful as possible. Do I think that the two men should have been arrested? No. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the police did a bad job. Although it isn\u2019t mentioned in the article, I read that the men sat down and talked with the Starbucks CEO. I don\u2019t think that companies should have to implement anti bias training. At this stage in life, your employees should be able to respect other people regardless of their background. If this is not the case, then get rid of them. My Mom had to take a similar training course for her job and she didn\u2019t learn anything.\n\nRegardless, Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., thinks all companies could benefit from anti-bias training:\n\nOther companies should follow in Starbucks steps. If every company offers anti bias training, it will help to eliminate prejudice throughout the whole work force. Everybody is entitled to a hate free work environment, and companies must ensure that all employees feel comfortable. Kudos for Starbucks for recognizing that there is a problem, and for implementing appropriate measures.\n\nMadison from Portland, Ore., agrees that it could be an effective and cost-efficient way to begin changing deeply ingrained intolerance:\n\nIn my opinion, the incident was handled very poorly by the policeman because they took unnecessary action and they were aided by the Starbucks employees. However, it should be up to the cops to make an overall decision whether the tip needed to be followed through, which I don\u2019t believe it did. There is no reason these men should have gotten arrested because they were not being a bother to anyone inside the cafe. It could have been dealt with differently, perhaps by talking to them or addressing that they need to buy something in order to use the facilities, but it is unreasonable that they were handcuffed. Knowing the history, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that the decision made by police was racially biased because there have other incidents in this neighborhood where people have been targeted for irrational reasons. I think it is important for employees and schools to take a training class in making anti-bias decisions because it would stop incidents like this from happening, help people ignore stereotypes and single stories and it would be a cost-efficient way to address an everyday issue.\n\nSumiayah Goggans from Philadelphia is disheartened by the stories of other black residents in the city, but remains hopeful:\n\nAlthough I am a black female who resides in Philadelphia, the color of my skin doesn\u2019t change my opinion on the incident that occurred earlier this week at Starbucks. What those men went through sent a feeling of heartache through me. I believe that the police officers and Starbucks\u2019 employees could have been more solution-oriented and payed more attention to what the men were saying. I believe that this situation portrayed the racial bias that many people hold in that area because of the rash and thoughtless way the men were handled. Starbucks\u2019 decision to close its stores sets a great example to other stores that have had similar instances occur. Reading about other\u2019s experiences opened my eyes to how close incidents like this happen around me. Even though steps are being taken to eliminating racism for good, for every step we take forward, we always take three steps backwards, I hope that one day African Americans can stand near police officers without fearing being irrationally arrested.\n\n_________", "title": "Dress Codes, Anti-Bias Training, Standardized Tests and Smiles: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

In some instances, several agency officials said, pushback by the officials prevailed.\n\nFor instance, in a conversation with one of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s closest aides, Mr. Chmielewski sharply objected to a proposal to buy a $100,000-a-month charter aircraft membership that would have allowed Mr. Pruitt to take unlimited private jet trips for official business, according to two administration officials. The membership was not purchased.\n\nMr. Chmielewski also objected to a proposal to spend about $70,000 to replace two desks in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office suite, including his personal desk and one at a security station outside his office. Asked about the proposed desk purchases, Mr. Wilcox, the E.P.A. spokesman, said that \u201cthe administrator never considered the proposal.\u201d Pasquale Perrotta, who became head of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s security detail after Mr. Weese was removed, insisted that the security desk be upgraded to a bulletproof model, according to current and former E.P.A. employees with direct knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe bulletproof security desk was not purchased, but two new desks were ordered for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s personal office: a brown maple wood stand-up desk, with brass locks, that was purchased from a craftsman and an oversize desk with ornate woodworking that had been in a federal government warehouse in Virginia and was refurbished for Mr. Pruitt at a cost of $2,075. E.P.A. employees gawked at the size and grandeur of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s refurbished desk, with some comparing it to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, officials said in interviews.\n\nStill, Mr. Pruitt and his team obtained many of the perks he wanted. Staff members questioned, but nonetheless approved, frequent trips that routed Mr. Pruitt through hub airports that allowed him to spend weekends at his home in Oklahoma.

But the administration\u2019s draft proposal argues that California cannot use this waiver to set standards on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles because that would be tantamount to regulating fuel economy, which states are forbidden from doing under a 1975 law.\n\nThe auto industry has previously tried to challenge California\u2019s greenhouse gas standards for vehicles on these grounds, but federal courts have so far rejected their arguments. Legal experts have said that, as long as California is regulating the pollutants that come out of tailpipes and not directly determining fuel economy standards, the state is on solid legal ground.\n\nThe Trump administration has also signaled that it would consider rescinding California\u2019s waiver altogether, although the draft proposal does not mention this. On Thursday, Mr. Pruitt told Congress that the agency was still in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with California and had no plans at the present to revoke the waiver.\n\nIn recent months, automakers have become increasingly nervous about the Trump administration\u2019s collision course with California.

It is death by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\nHe added that ESPN did not have a long history of new product launches, besides new channels, because it hasn\u2019t had to. \u201cIt has been a really simple business to run for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has gotten complicated recently, so they are trying some new things.\u201d\n\nThe current ESPN app prioritizes scores, news and highlights, and also has a tab for cable television subscribers to watch ESPN.\n\nThe new app will essentially contain three better integrated parts: news and scores, live events and shows that are on ESPN\u2019s television channels, and ESPN+. \u201cThis is essentially a three-in-one service,\u201d Pitaro said.\n\nThe ESPN app has been downloaded 70 million times and has two million daily active users, according to Apptopia, an app analytics company. It regularly ranks as the most downloaded sports app.\n\nESPN wants to use the integrated app to drive ESPN+ subscriptions. If you are browsing Yankees scores in the app and a Yankees game is live on an ESPN channel or ESPN+, a banner will alert you that the game is available to watch. If you have entered your cable subscription information or subscribed to ESPN+, you will go straight to the game. If not, you will be prompted to enter your information or to subscribe to ESPN+.\n\nThe app was built by both BamTech, the Major League Baseball Advanced Media spinoff that Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, bought a 75 percent stake in for $2.58 billion in 2017, and ESPN\u2019s core technology team in Bristol.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt $4.99, ESPN+ is cheaper than other streaming services, but has one enormous drawback: It won\u2019t show anything available on ESPN\u2019s television channels.

And exactly how we\u2019re going to have carbon-neutral air travel is still, well, up in the air.\n\nBut there is no longer any reason to believe that it would be hard to drastically \u201cdecarbonize\u201d the economy. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that doing so would impose any significant economic cost. The realistic debate is about how hard it will be to get from 80 to 100 percent decarbonization.\n\nFor now, however, the problem isn\u2019t technology \u2014 it\u2019s politics.\n\nThe fossil fuel sector may represent a technological dead end, but it still has a lot of money and power. Lately it has been putting almost all of that money and power behind Republicans. For example, in the 2016 election cycle the coal mining industry gave 97 percent (!) of its contributions to G.O.P. candidates.\n\nWhat the industry got in return for that money wasn\u2019t just a president who talks nonsense about bringing back coal jobs and an administration that rejects the science of climate change. It got an Environmental Protection Agency head who\u2019s trying to suppress evidence on the damage pollution causes, and a secretary of energy who tried, unsuccessfully so far, to force natural gas and renewables to subsidize coal and nuclear plants.\n\nIn the long run, these tactics probably won\u2019t stop the transition to renewable energy, and even the villains of this story probably realize that.

One stunning find: Wealthier, more educated black women in New York City are also dying or almost dying in childbirth at a far higher rate than their white neighbors. One city study found that black college-educated women were more than twice as likely to experience severe complications from childbirth as white women without a high school diploma.\n\nLatinas and Asian women also experience higher rates of severe and potentially life-threatening complications. But some researchers and city officials believe that the higher rates of death and complications among black women are caused only partly by longstanding disparities in poverty, obesity and lack of access to top-rate health care.

The dish is a mainstay at the restaurants, and the recipe is in his book.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo is his take on pork roast, a Southern Sunday supper staple. A pork loin with a little cap of fat is rubbed with onion and garlic, both in granulated form, then roasted fast in a very hot oven whose residual heat is used to roast a couple of jalape\u00f1os. The chopped peppers are then folded into gravy made from a classic French roux and homemade stock.\n\nThe result is a decidedly Southern dish, punched up with the flavors he grew up eating in his hometown, Monterrey.

If so, is it possible to save the edited images back to the computer later so I don\u2019t have to take a laptop with me on my trip?\n\nA. If your camera uses a RAW format supported by Apple\u2019s iOS system on the iPad and you have a photo-editing app that works with RAW files, you should be able to import, edit and save your photos as you go. When you are done, you can transfer the edited images to the computer back home in a few different ways. (For those unfamiliar with the file type, RAW photos are uncompressed image files that retain much more visual data in the picture than do files saved in the compressed JPG format. RAW files give photographers more to edit.)\n\nWhen you are ready to edit photos, you first need to get the picture files from the camera to the tablet. You can do this in a few ways, including using one of Apple\u2019s camera-card adapters plugged into the iPad to download the original RAW files, or beaming the photos wirelessly from camera to tablet with a camera memory card enabled for Wi-Fi.\n\nOnce you have imported the images to the iPad\u2019s camera roll, you can pull them into an app that supports RAW editing and make your adjustments. The $20 Affinity for iPad, the freemium RAW Power and the older (but free) Snapseed are among the apps that can edit RAW files on the tablet. The free Adobe Lightroom CC for iOS added RAW editing in 2016 and can sync edited files back to the companion Adobe Lightroom CC app on a Mac or Windows PC \u2014 with a paid subscription.", "title": "Editing RAW Images on an iPad", "authors": []}

At the center of its sprawling story are Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a vice-squad detective scarred by his experiences in World War I, and Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries), a typist and sometime prostitute who wants desperately to join the all-male police force.

From one angle, the conflict appeared to pit xenophobic yokels against a vulnerable religious minority; from another, it appeared that a sex cult was terrorizing a quiet community of working-class retirees. And that was before things in Rajneeshpuram got really weird. The documentary series \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d uses archival footage and startlingly frank interviews with the former leaders of the community and their adversaries in Antelope to raise big questions about spirituality, democracy and the ethics of self-defense.\n\n0\n\nCarey Mulligan and Nathaniel Martello-White in \u201cCollateral.\u201d Liam Daniel/Netflix TV Show Collateral Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like After appearing in one of last year\u2019s best Netflix original films, \u201cMudbound,\u201d Carey Mulligan returns to the streaming service with another stirring performance. \u201cCollateral\u201d casts her as Kip Glaspie, an ambitious detective inspector whose investigation into the murder of a pizza delivery man leads her to a far more complicated mystery.

She spent her early years watching Dust Bowl storms scour the prairie.\n\nWhen she was 4, Elizabeth\u2019s impoverished family, chasing work, spent one summer in a three-sided tent attached to their car. Though her parents, John and Alma, worked odd jobs over the years, they were primarily small farmers, raising wheat and cattle.\n\nMs. Ebert attended Thunder Hawk High School, receiving her diploma as the valedictorian of a class of four. At 16, she enrolled at the Black Hills Secretarial School in Rapid City, S.D. She worked briefly as a bookkeeper for a bank in Lemmon, about 10 miles west of Thunder Hawk, before following a friend to Washington, where she spent a summer waiting tables.\n\nMiserable in the city, she returned to South Dakota. At 18, yearning to be a novelist, she moved to Minneapolis and spent a year at the University of Minnesota studying journalism and English and imagining a writer\u2019s life, like that of Dorothy Parker.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I admired Parker\u2019s long cigarette holder and wished to go to New York and hobnob with the literati,\u201d she said. \u201cOne summer in secretary school, one year at the University of Minnesota, and a summer in Washington, D.C., cured me of that notion, and all I wanted was a piece of prairie that I could call my own and lot fewer people around.\u201d\n\nShe met S.J. \u2014 a \u201ccute\u201d and \u201ccapable\u201d World War II veteran, in her words \u2014 at a dance hall in Morristown, S.D., in November 1945. They married four months later, put money down on some farmland and spent their first 15 years together in a fixed-up homestead shack, upgrading to a newer farmhouse up the road in 1962. They raised three children on the farm.\n\nMs. Ebert said the best years of her life were spent with S.J. after their retirement, when they took the scenic routes to her poetry gatherings around the country.

Sherman, the former top State Department official who negotiated the Iran deal for Mr. Obama. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Macron will say how important staying in the deal is to a strong trans-Atlantic relationship in all things, particularly security. I think Merkel will deliver the same message on Friday.\u201d\n\nEven so, the White House signaled Monday that Mr. Trump enters the talks with one set impression. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s a bad deal \u2014 that certainly has not changed,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.\n\nThe fate of the Iran agreement could influence the president\u2019s forthcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who already has a small nuclear arsenal. Whatever its flaws, American officials understand that canceling the Iran deal days or weeks before that meeting might complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of making an agreement with Mr. Kim.\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, implicitly made that point Monday by noting that the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers involved give and take by all sides.\n\n\u201cAnd now the United States is saying, \u2018What\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s yours is negotiable. But whatever I gave you, now I want it back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zarif said in an interview with The National Interest, a Washington policy magazine. \u201cWho would, in their right mind, deal with the U.S. anymore?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump faces conflicting positions among his own advisers as he reconstitutes his national security team. John R. Bolton, his new national security adviser, has long advocated simply ending the Iran deal, while Mike Pompeo, set to become secretary of state, is open to keeping it if strong new provisions can be negotiated.\n\nMr. Macron arrived in Washington to a festive welcome. American and French flags flew on Pennsylvania Avenue as he and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were greeted at the White House by Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Macron reached in for a hug and kissed Mr. Trump on both cheeks, French-style, a sign of their warm ties. The two couples headed inside for a few minutes and then out to the South Lawn, smiling and chatting casually as cameras recorded the moment.\n\nPhoto\n\nWielding shovels, the two presidents moved some dirt around where a tree was to be planted, a gift from the Macrons. The tree, a European sessile oak, came from Belleau Wood, where, during World War I, nearly 10,000 American Marines were killed or injured in battle in June 1918. From there, the two couples flew by helicopter to George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate for dinner.\n\nThe Macrons will return to the White House on Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, complete with members of all five branches of the military in formal uniforms. The two presidents will hold meetings and conduct a joint news conference. In the evening, the Trumps will host their first state dinner, featuring rack of spring lamb and Carolina gold rice jambalaya cooked New Orleans style.\n\nMr. Trump, 71, and Mr. Macron, 40, have forged an unlikely friendship, despite their political differences over the Iran deal, international trade, climate change and other issues. But while Europeans consider Mr. Macron their envoy to Mr. Trump, he has had mixed success influencing the president. The two leaders teamed up to launch airstrikes against Syria this month in retaliation for a suspected chemical attack, but when Mr. Macron publicly said he had persuaded Mr. Trump to keep American troops in the country \u201cfor the long term,\u201d the White House quickly disputed him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

No,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cBut for nuclear, what do you have as a better option? I don\u2019t see it. What is the what-if scenario or your Plan B? I don\u2019t have any Plan B for nuclear against Iran.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron added that he supported modifications to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. \u201cMy point is to say, don\u2019t leave now to J.C.P.O.A. as long as you don\u2019t have a better option for nuclear, and let\u2019s complete it with ballistic missile and a regional containment,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\nMr. Zarif picked up on that on Monday. \u201cPresident Macron is correct in saying there\u2019s no \u2018Plan B\u2019 on JCPOA,\u201d Mr. Zarif wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s either all or nothing. European leaders should encourage President Trump not just to stay in the nuclear deal, but more importantly to begin implementing his part of the bargain in good faith.\u201d\n\nThe negotiations with European officials, led by Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning, have found some common ground, according to people briefed on the talks. Negotiators are developing two annexes, or side agreements, to the original deal, one intended to constrain Iran\u2019s missile program and the other to confront its aggressions in the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNegotiators have agreed on strong measures to impose sanctions on Iran if it tests long-range missiles and are debating a framework document to respond to testing of short- and medium-range missiles. They have agreed that Iran would be sanctioned if it blocks international nuclear inspectors from any site, including military sites. And they have made progress in defining a trigger for reimposing sanctions lifted as part of the 2015 deal \u2014 if Iran were found to have expanded its nuclear program enough to allow it to develop a weapon in less than a year.\n\nBut negotiators are divided over what would happen then. The Trump administration insists that sanctions be reimposed automatically if Iran trips that one-year wire, while the Europeans want the trigger to be a determination that Iran\u2019s expansion is inconsistent with its civilian nuclear program. If the Americans and Europeans ultimately agree, that would effectively end the expiration provisions known as \u201csunsets\u201d by making the one-year limit permanent.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans have moved very far in a few months, and I think this should be bridgeable, but of course it really depends on Macron and Trump,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIt sounds narrow, but it\u2019s actually pretty fundamental. It\u2019s entirely possible that the thing breaks down on that basis.\u201d\n\nThe Germans are the most resistant among the Europeans, arguing that renegotiating without Iran or the other parties to the deal, Russia and China, amounts to bad faith and ultimately will cause the original agreement to collapse. If no side agreements are reached, the Trump administration is also preparing contingency plans for Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran deal altogether and what the United States would then do to counter Iran.\n\nRussia and China have resisted any changes. \u201cWe will obstruct attempts to sabotage these agreements, which were enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said Monday after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing.\n\nBut critics of the deal pressed Mr. Trump to remain strong. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday again condemned the agreement. The deal \u201cgives Iran a clear path to a nuclear arsenal\u201d and \u201cdoes not deal with the ballistic missiles that can deliver this weapon to many, many countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why this deal has to be either fully fixed or fully nixed.\u201d", "title": "Emmanuel Macron to Press Trump to Keep Iran Nuclear Deal", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Julie Hirschfeld Davis"]}

The shrapnel punctured a window in the plane, and a woman seated by it was partially sucked out.

The agency appears to have been prompted to act after another Southwest 737 engine came apart in 2016, sending debris into the plane\u2019s fuselage, wing and tail. The investigation into that incident is ongoing.\n\nLate Wednesday, the F.A.A. said it was ordering those ultrasonic inspections. The engines on both Southwest planes, were manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran of France.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the inspections were insufficient to detect flaws in the disk of a CF-6 engine on an American Airlines Boeing 767 in late 2016. The plane was gaining speed on the runway in Chicago when the engine broke apart, sending metal fragments into the fuel tank and igniting a fire. The engine was manufactured by General Electric.\n\nThe chairman of the transportation safety board, Robert L. Sumwalt, said on Wednesday that the problems with the Southwest engine were worrisome because the agency had already discovered in the Chicago incident that some engine flaws were undetectable. \u201cWe are concerned about it,\u201d Mr. Sumwalt said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInspections have also been ordered for the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines that power a quarter of Boeing\u2019s newest wide-body, the 787 Dreamliner, after cracks were found on rotor blades.

On extended flights over water, an airline could schedule flights on routes of up to five hours flying time from an emergency airport.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmerican and European regulators now say that cannot be safely accomplished.

But watching from a safe distance as China and the United States argue is not an option for Europe. Its economy is too deeply entwined with both.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat can they do in terms of staying out of the crossfire?\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics in Britain. \u201cNot a lot.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump\u2019s threats are aimed at China, Europe is certain to suffer collateral damage if the president follows through. A spiraling war of tariffs and counter-tariffs would interfere with the global flow of raw materials and components for manufactured goods, disrupting the European economy. And some European companies, like the German carmaker BMW, manufacture in the United States and export to China. Such companies would see their sales suffer if China were to slap tariffs on American goods.\n\nThe mere threat of a trade war has already unsettled financial markets and made it more difficult for companies to raise money, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said Friday. \u201cNone of this supports growth and employment,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said at a conference in Cernobbio, Italy.\n\nThe disruption to world trade comes at an unfortunate time for Europe. Recent economic indicators suggest that the Continent\u2019s recovery, after a decade of crisis, is losing momentum. Industrial production in Germany shrank 1.6 percent in February, according to official data published last week.\n\nBut European leaders\u2019 biggest fear may be that Mr. Trump\u2019s belligerent approach to trade will destroy the postwar system for resolving conflicts, which involved getting all the parties together in one room. Mr. Trump has already succeeded in forcing countries to beg for individual exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs, bypassing the World Trade Organization, the usual forum for trade disputes.\n\n\u201cHe has created an environment to divide countries,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Sapir, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cMaybe we will remember that 2017 was the last year of the functioning of the multilateral system.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s possible Europe might enjoy a few short-term benefits as China and the United States duke it out. If, for example, China were to raise tariffs on Boeing airliners, Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus, could take advantage. But positive effects of that sort are not likely to outweigh the risks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEuropean companies have invested far more in the United States over the years than they have in China. But increasingly, China is where the action is. Germany\u2019s total trade with China, exports and imports together, is already bigger than it is with the United States. And China is the biggest single market for companies like Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest carmaker.\n\nChina is also where more German companies are putting their money.\n\nIn a poll published Thursday, 39 percent of German companies questioned said they planned to invest in China this year, up from 37 percent in 2017. The number that said they planned to invest in North America dropped to 35 percent, from 37 percent, according to a survey, by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\nEven so, Europe remains wary of China\u2019s intentions. Though European leaders use tamer language, they share some of Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about unfair competition from Chinese companies that receive government subsidies. They worry that Chinese companies are stealing European technology, and accumulating too much economic power.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese investors have snapped up European assets including Greek ports, German machinery companies and a 10 percent stake in the automaker Daimler. The Chinese government\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d campaign, a plan to dominate cutting-edge industry, is a threat to German companies that supply precision machinery that the Chinese companies are not yet able to manufacture themselves.\n\nLeaders in Brussels, Berlin and Paris have called for tighter scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions in Europe, though it is unclear how tough they will be.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Wake Up With The Times, Anywhere in the World.

And European and American historical and cultural ties go back centuries.\n\nStill, a trade war could push Europe closer to China.\n\nEurope\u2019s most immediate preoccupation is to resolve its own trade disputes with Mr. Trump. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, is negotiating with Wilbur Ross, the United States commerce secretary, about winning a permanent exemption from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. A temporary exemption to the tariffs expires May 1.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Malmstrom and other European leaders have also made plain their unhappiness with what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade to undermine the World Trade Organization as the arbiter of trade conflicts.

There are few other good options.\n\nMr. Sapir of Bruegel argues that, longer term, Europe should push for reforms of the trade body to respond to American criticism that the organization is too slow moving, and has failed to curb unfair competition by China. Mr. Trump is unlikely to take much interest in fixing the global trade regime rather than ignoring it, Mr. Sapir said, but it\u2019s still worth a try.\n\n\u201cThat is the only structural solution,\u201d Mr. Sapir said. \u201cOtherwise, we will always be caught in between.\u201d", "title": "Europe Caught in the Middle as Trump Threatens China", "authors": ["Jack Ewing"]}

However, by taking the threat that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon off the table, the pact has effectively limited that country\u2019s means to carry out its destabilizing activities.\n\nThose are the reasons that France, Germany and Britain, which form the E3 group, continue to support the agreement and are calling on President Trump to make good on the commitment we took, together with the United States, on July 14, 2015, in Vienna. Now we, members of parliaments in the E3, have decided to raise our voices to tell the United States Congress that we stand by our trans-Atlantic commitments and to warn of the disastrous consequences of an American withdrawal from the Vienna agreement.\n\nTo that end, we have written a letter being published Thursday and Friday by leading newspapers in France, Germany and Britain calling on the members of Congress to bring their full backing to the nuclear deal and prevent their government from pulling out of this major diplomatic achievement. The letter has been signed by more than 500 members of France\u2019s National Assembly, Germany\u2019s Bundestag and Britain\u2019s House of Commons.

As Europeans, we are undertaking this cross-European, cross-parliamentary initiative to show the international community that Europe\u2019s democracies will rise in solidarity on critical international problems.\n\nWe are pleading to the men and women of Congress to play their part in keeping the nuclear deal alive. We know that the citizens we represent are the people who make the formulas of our shared values come alive every day.

Ryan and Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman, have given no indication of how they would proceed, and aides say privately that Republican leaders view the possibility of Mr. Mueller\u2019s firing as too improbable to warrant hypothetical discussions.\n\nShort of that, there are other options. Congress could pass a law reinstating an independent investigator in the executive or legislative branch, though Mr. Trump would have to sign it. Lawmakers could demand that Mr. Mueller\u2019s evidence be turned over to Congress. They could press to censure the president. Or they could make his fate a political issue and let the voters decide in November.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats do agree on one thing: Should the special counsel be ousted, the business of Congress \u2014 hearings, nominations and legislation \u2014 would screech to a stop, replaced by a painful, consequential debate over the most serious constitutional challenge in a generation.\n\n\u201cThe rule of law is very dear to many of us,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be too creative to understand how damaging that would be.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has made no secret of his contempt for Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation into potential ties between his campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and into possible obstruction of justice by the president himself.

Congress could leverage its control of the Justice Department\u2019s nominees and purse strings to ensure its safekeeping while other matters were sorted out. Relevant committees could then call for Mr. Mueller to testify, as they weighed a path forward legislatively.\n\nBut Mr. Mueller would have to be willing to share his knowledge. If he were inclined to disclose details of his investigation to Congress, many of which are not protected by grand jury secrecy, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for Mr. Trump to stop him, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cIf Mueller or members of his team are subpoenaed by Congress, and they\u2019re willing to tell their story, then I think there\u2019s a strong likelihood that the story gets told,\u201d said Ross H. Garber, an expert in impeachment law who has represented several politicians in high-profile investigations.\n\nThe spectacle of a fired special counsel \u2014 and former F.B.I. director \u2014 publicly divulging the results of his investigation would raise parallels to the Watergate hearings and raise pressure on Republicans to break rank. On top of that, a potential subpoena fight over Mr. Mueller\u2019s records would add a nasty sideshow that would sap Mr. Trump\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\u201cWe have to expect that all the information that Mueller and his team have discovered will ultimately be made public one way or another,\u201d Mr. Garber said.\n\nDemocrats say they also fear a less dramatic outcome: In lieu of demanding the firing of Mr. Mueller, the president could replace Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein as part of what has become regular turnover in a tumultuous administration. A new attorney general could then declare that further investigation was unnecessary and dismiss Mr. Mueller on his or her own. The end result would be the same, but it could give the White House the argument that the Justice Department made the decision independently of the president, making it harder to build support for Congress to act.\n\nWithout support for impeachment, Democrats say the most realistic path toward Republican cooperation would be an effort to get Mr. Mueller, or another investigator, reinstated. Options under discussion include hiring Mr. Mueller as a special congressional investigator, passing a new independent counsel law that would restore him or another trusted law enforcement figure as an executive branch employee with explicit protections from Mr. Trump, or enacting legislation that would allow Mr. Mueller to appeal his firing to a panel of judges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNone of those options are a sure thing.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mess,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, a moderate Democrat from Delaware who has all but pleaded with colleagues to support a measure he has drafted with Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, giving Mr. Mueller the right to appeal his dismissal.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that they would want to do the least effective thing, which is send the president a resolution of reprimand or censure, urge him to reconsider and then just sort of go sideways for a week or two,\u201d Mr. Coons added.\n\nEven if Congress passed legislation reinstating a special counsel in some fashion, it is unclear whether such a law would have teeth, and many legal experts said the legislation could almost certainly prompt a legal challenge from the White House.\n\n\u201cThe more likely outcome is that the executive branch would ignore Congress,\u201d said Mr. Garber, the lawyer. And hiring Mr. Mueller as a congressional investigator would not be the same as maintaining him as a special counsel, with the F.B.I. and a grand jury at his disposal.\n\n\u201cIf he has no resources, and no ability to get resources, then it doesn\u2019t seem like he can do very much,\u201d Mr. Garber said.\n\nThe voters, however, would eventually have a say. Democrats have signaled that they would take a much more aggressive posture if they take the majority. Liberals say they already feel that their political base favors removing the president.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who stands to inherit the chairmanship under Democratic control, has resisted telegraphing what steps he would take if his party were to retake the House. But he has made clear he would not stand by idly.\n\n\u201cShould a red line be crossed, and firing the special counsel or throttling his investigation are red lines, then there would be a total sea change in the political landscape of the country,\u201d he said at a recent news conference. \u201cAnd at that point, all options would be on the table.\u201d", "title": "Even Republicans Have Used the \u2018I\u2019 Word, but Would Firing Mueller Get Trump Impeached?", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"]}

Those materials included information about A.M.I. and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.\n\nThe suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks between A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer at the time, Keith M. Davidson \u2014 who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Davidson has said the lawyer \u201cfulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.\n\nMr. Stris said that before reaching the settlement, he was prepared to answer A.M.I.\u2019s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal\u2019s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery. The move, compelling both sides to share emails and other records, could have provided information that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. An A.M.I. lawyer, Cameron Stracher, said that he doubted the request would have succeeded, and that avoiding discovery was not a motivating factor in the settlement.\n\nThe agreement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal\u2019s civil case against A.M.I., though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they needed to fully vet the process behind the deal. \u201cI have tremendous confidence in the men and women of the Southern District of New York,\u201d he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.\n\nMr. Stris said he did not rule out taking legal action if more came to light about potentially inappropriate contact between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson during the course of negotiating her deal. The settlement does not bar Ms. McDougal from claims against either of the men in the future. For now, Ms. McDougal said, \u201cI need to relax and get my life back and de-stress.\u201d\n\nThe initial deal prohibited Ms. McDougal from speaking about her alleged affair, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer \u201clegitimate press inquiries,\u201d in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent months, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.\n\nSeparate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure.

For hours on Saturday, in a tense standoff, his ardent supporters had physically blocked his surrender, before finally allowing him to leave.\n\nThe prosecution, Mr. da Silva charged, was an effort to thwart his vision of a country in which ever more poor people could enroll in universities, go on vacation and buy cars and homes.\n\n\u201cIf that was the crime I committed, I want to say that I will continue being a criminal because we\u2019re going to accomplish much more,\u201d Mr. da Silva shouted to a crowd that had spent much of the morning chanting that he should not surrender.\n\nDuring his last hours of freedom, Mr. da Silva appeared to acknowledge that his political career is over \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou will have to transform yourselves,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cThey must know that the death of a combatant doesn\u2019t end a revolution.\u201d\n\nMonths away from Election Day, Brazil\u2019s political left now finds itself without an obvious standard-bearer.\n\nMr. da Silva did not anoint a successor to take his place on the ballot, suggesting that Workers\u2019 Party leaders have yet to decide who stands the best chance of filling the void.\n\nBut, notably, he did single out for compliments two leftist presidential hopefuls from other parties who were with him on stage, Manuela d\u2019\u00c1vila and Guilherme Boulos.\n\nOther candidates who remain in the race include Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker who has campaigned on a promise of resorting to harsh tactics to restore security in areas plagued by violence; and a former environmental minister, Marina Silva, who supports the judiciary\u2019s crackdown on corruption and an overhaul of the political system.\n\nBut by ending the presidential candidacy of a leader who remains beloved across much of the country, the move by judicial authorities may have called into question the fairness of the October election.\n\nPhoto\n\nDaniel Aar\u00e3o Reis, a professor of contemporary history at Federal Fluminense University, said that while Mr. da Silva\u2019s prosecution was procedurally sound, it is likely to further shake Brazilians\u2019 faith in democracy, particularly if political rivals who also stand accused of wrongdoing, manage to escape accountability.\n\n\u201cIt worries me because, whether or not the people who provoked this situation meant it, it\u2019s a blow to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is living a moment of very little prestige.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNo citizen is above the law, and no one, regardless of how important a leader he may have been, or what position he once held, is entitled to make a mockery of justice,\u201d Brazil\u2019s National Association of Prosecutors said in a statement issued Saturday night. \u201cInstitutions are the pillars of democracy.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was found guilty last July of accepting a seaside apartment in return for contracts awarded to the construction company O.A.S.\n\nAfter a three-judge panel upheld the conviction in January, Mr. da Silva asked the country\u2019s two top courts to allow him to remain free while other appeals were considered, but his petitions were rejected.\n\nMr. da Silva is slated to start serving the sentence in a specially configured cell at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba, a building he was on hand to inaugurate as president in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. da Silva\u2019s legal team said Saturday night that he would continue to appeal his conviction before Brazil\u2019s top courts.

Yanukovych, the pro-Russia former president of Ukraine, from international criticism over the prosecution and imprisonment of a political rival.\n\nMr. Manafort and Mr. Gates have been charged with money laundering and other financial crimes related to their work as consultants in Ukraine.

Mr. Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty, is arguing that the special counsel overstepped his authority by delving into his payments from Ukraine.\n\nBut a newly released memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein last summer shows that he specifically authorized the special counsel to investigate any crimes related to payments to Mr. Manafort from the Ukrainian government as well as allegations that he conspired with the Russian government to interfere in the election.

Mr. van der Zwaan acknowledged that Mr. Gates had told him that Mr. Kilimnik was a former Russian intelligence officer. But he claimed that he had had no substantive conversations with either man in 2016.\n\nIn fact, he has now admitted, he had had a series of phone calls with both men about potential criminal charges related to payments from the Ukrainian government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat information indicated that Mr. Gates and Mr. Kilimnik were in direct touch with each other as the presidential campaign drew to a close in September and October of 2016, a fact Mr. Weissman argued in court papers \u201cwas pertinent to the investigation.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Mr. van der Zwaan not only deceived federal agents, but also concealed information from his own law firm, which has since fired him.\n\nWhile the lead prosecutor on the case, Andrew Weissmann, did not explicitly ask for a prison sentence, he insisted that Mr. van der Zwaan told the truth only after he \u201cwas caught red-handed\u201d in various falsehoods and had been handed a grand jury subpoena.\n\nDuring his second meeting with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, Mr. van der Zwaan voluntarily turned over the very evidence that resulted in his felony charge, including notes, recordings, laptops and cellphones, his defense lawyer, William J. Schwartz, argued. But Mr. Weissman denied that any of that was crucial, telling the judge that \u201cthe case was already made.\u201d\n\nJudge Jackson said Mr. van der Zwaan was guilty of not simply a single lapse in judgment, but a broader pattern of concealment because of \u201ca mix of motives\u201d that she did not clearly understand.\n\nShe was unmoved, she said, by his argument that he had been stranded alone in a hotel in the United States since December. She dismissed his brief statement of contrition as \u201clip service.\u201d While others had written letters to her asking her to be merciful to Mr. van der Zwaan, she said, \u201cthe accomplished lawyer did not write one himself.\u201d\n\nThe crime of false statements to federal authorities carries up to a five-year prison term. But sentencing guidelines suggested that Mr. van der Zwaan, who has no prior criminal record, receive at most six months.\n\nHe agreed to turn himself in voluntarily. It is unclear where he will serve his 30-day term; the judge said he might wind up in the District of Columbia jail.

But for many longtime television watchers it\u2019s a blast from the past.\n\nThe original version of \u201cLost in Space,\u201d which aired on CBS from 1965 to 1968, is one of the foundational texts of a certain kind of disposable television. Created by Irwin Allen at the apogee of the space race, what began as a \u201cSwiss Family Robinson\u201d for the rocket age soon evolved into an intergalactic \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island.\u201d It was predictable, it was repetitive, and let\u2019s face it, it was often incredibly stupid. But if you watched its original run (or if you\u2019ve seen it in reruns), you know it to be one of the more delightful, candy-coated morsels of classic American TV.\n\nMoreover, for viewers who first experienced the show as kids, there was nothing funnier than hearing Dr. Smith call a Michelin Man crossed with a gumball machine a \u201cbubble-headed boobie!\u201d If you want to reminisce or prime yourself for the reboot, all 84 episodes are streaming on Hulu. But to borrow from the Robot: \u201cWarning! An end-to-end binge does not compute!\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nFrom left, Angela Cartwright, Bill Mumy and Marta Kristen in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\nWho\u2019s Who on the Jupiter 2?\n\nThe lasting influence of \u201cLost in Space\u201d is partially due to its production design \u2014 alien costumes, ray guns and a remarkable number of earthquakes \u2014 but also its endearing characters.\n\nProfessor John Robinson (the \u201cZorro\u201d star, Guy Williams) and Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart from \u201cLassie\u201d) were strong Great Society stand-ins. With them was their eldest daughter, Judy (the Norwegian actress Marta Kristen, best known for playing a mermaid in \u201cBeach Blanket Bingo\u201d); their middle child, Penny (Angela Cartwright, recognizable from \u201cThe Danny Thomas Show\u201d and \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d); and the kid genius, Will (Billy Mumy, whose later endeavors include forming the band Barnes & Barnes and recording the novelty hit \u201cFish Heads\u201d).\n\nThe Robinsons left earth aboard their circular ship, The Jupiter 2, in a fictional 1997, in hopes of becoming the first family to colonize another planet. (They were headed to Alpha Centauri, which is a star and not a planet, but let\u2019s not get into that now.) The Jupiter 2 featured light speed capability but also the galaxy\u2019s slowest elevator. It was piloted by Major Don West (Mark Goddard), an underdeveloped love interest for Judy. He wore a white T-shirt a lot for someone in outer space.\n\n0\n\nJonathan Harris in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\nNever Fear, Smith Is Here!\n\nAccording to cast interviews, the mincing, bullheaded, cowardly Dr. Smith was meant to be written out after the initial episodes. But as Jonathan Harris, the actor who played him, has said, he soon began reworking the character, adding more zest to his already flamboyant line readings. Allen, the show\u2019s creator, apparently liked the changes. By the middle of Season 1, \u201cLost in Space\u201d aired opposite the campy Adam West-led \u201cBatman\u201d on Wednesdays at 7:30. Our interstellar explorers found their groove once the lovably annoying Dr. Smith started screeching at his mechanized, stentorian straight man, the Model B-9 Environmental Robot \u2014 usually referred to as simply the Robot.\n\nIn the first episode (\u201cThe Reluctant Stowaway\u201d) Dr. Smith is an evil foreign saboteur. We never do discover whom he is working for, but we do learn that he is a bit of a klutz. His bumbling gets him (forgive me) lost in space with the Robinsons and Major West, alongside the Robot. Even though the beginning episodes show Smith trying actively to murder everyone else, he still somehow became the heart of the show. (Hulu lists \u201cThe Reluctant Stowaway\u201d as Episode 2 because of the series pilot, which did not originally air. Season 1 episode numbers will be identified here according to Hulu\u2019s practice.)\n\nFrom left, June Lockhart, Jonathan Harris, Angela Cartwright and Marta Kristen in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\nNickel-Plated Nincompoop!\n\nThe early dialogue with the Robot has a call-and-response rhythm that isn\u2019t far removed from telling Alexa to dim the lights. But Harris rewrote his own scenes, and his alliterative barbs against the deadpan, baritone Robot (voiced by Dick Tufeld) harmonized beautifully with the optimism of the Robinson kids.\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s insults ranged from \u201caddlepated armorer\u201d to \u201cwobbling weakling,\u201d and at first the Robot merely blurted, \u201cDanger!\u201d or \u201cWarning!\u201d in response. His comeback zings started subtly \u2014 \u201cWhat do you want from me, blood?\u201d is a breakthrough moment from \u201cA Change of Space\u201d in Season 1 \u2014 and by Season 2, it is an all-out volley of invective. \u201cAsk me no questions, and I\u2019ll tell you no lies, Earth creature!\u201d the Robot sasses in \u201cThe Ghost Planet\u201d (Season 2), inasmuch as an affectless \u201ctintinnabulating tin can\u201d can sass.\n\nThe most famous catchphrase of the series, \u201cDanger, Will Robinson,\u201d is something of a misremembered phenomenon, like Rick Blaine\u2019s \u201cPlay it again, Sam\u201d from \u201cCasablanca\u201d (he never said it) or Captain Kirk\u2019s \u201cBeam me up, Scotty\u201d from \u201cStar Trek\u201d (he came close). The robot often shouted \u201cDanger!\u201d and addressed the youngest Robinson rather formally, but the actual phrase is heard only in the episode \u201cDeadliest of the Species\u201d (Season 3), and the robot is comparatively mellow when he says it: He is merely suggesting they use caution as they investigate a fallen meteorite.\n\nAngela Cartwright and John Carradine in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\nThis Week\u2019s Guest\n\nNotable faces included a young Kurt Russell as an alien boy whose behavior mirrors thinly understood Native American customs (\u201cThe Challenge,\u201d Season 1); Warren Oates as space cowboy (\u201cWelcome Stranger,\u201d Season 1); and John Carradine as a bald, purple shape-shifter, pursued by a band of villainous creatures (\u201cThe Galaxy Gift,\u201d Season 2).\n\nMost of the weekly guests were character actors or old vaudevillians, among them Fritz Feld as the proprietor of a pan-dimensional department store (\u201cThe Android Machine\u201d), whose trademark schtick of popping his lips is generously exploited. Such grace notes seem unlikely in Netflix\u2019s reboot. (They were certainly missing from the joyless 1998 film starring William Hurt and Gary Oldman.)\n\nJonathan Harris in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\nHow to Watch: Top 10 Episodes\n\nTo repeat: This is not one to binge. The show gets more repetitive than a low Earth orbit, and there is rarely a true narrative thread connecting each episode. But it\u2019s good fun to skip around.\n\nSeason 1\n\nThe first season of \u201cLost in Space\u201d begins rich in nutritious Space Race-era exceptionalism and with some genuine \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-style spooks before it goes full goofy. \u201cThe Reluctant Stowaway\u201d (Episode 2 on Hulu) gives the series escape velocity, so it is worth checking out. \u201cThe Magic Mirror\u201d (Episode 22) is a Penny-focused episode (both Cartwright and Mumy were gifted child actors), in which she is trapped in a pocket universe with a creepy a lonely, stalker-ish boy played by Michael J. Pollard (\u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d). This episode also features her pet, Debbie the bloop, which was bascially a chimpanzee with giant, fuzzy ears.\n\n0\n\nThe Season 1 finale, \u201cFollow the Leader\u201d (Episode 30) is a bit of an anomaly because of its seriousness. Professor Robinson becomes possessed by an ancient spirit and only Will\u2019s love can conquer it.\n\nSeason 2\n\nThe second season brought color and velour costumes. \u201cThe Ghost Planet\u201d (Episode 3) visits a robot-run world and shows that Dr. Smith is still willing to sell out his comrades for wealth. Although the Robinsons always forgive Dr. Smith, Major West once again volunteers to drop the stowaway off on the nearest rock. \u201cThe Android Machine\u201d (Episode 7) introduces a female android who imprints herself on Dr. Smith and ruffles the Robot\u2019s circuits. (Even robots can have their feelings hurt.) \u201cThe Dream Monster\u201d (Episode 14) features an alien who, with the aid of Dr. Smith and a weird Polaroid-type device, steals emotions from the Robinsons, leaving them drained of personality.\n\n\u201cThe Golden Man\u201d (Episode 15) is possibly a Vietnam parable, as the Robinsons decide whether to get involved in a fight between a frog-headed alien and a charming man who offers Dr. Smith caviar.\n\nSeason 3\n\nThe third and final season zooms at faster-than-light speed to some of television\u2019s silliest hours. \u201cVisit to a Hostile Planet\u201d (Episode 2) gets the Jupiter 2 back to Earth, but through a time warp. (Yes, \u201cStar Trek\u201d did the same thing.)

The warning also noted that the implant can travel into the abdomen and pelvic cavity, causing pain and possibly requiring surgical removal.\n\nConsisting of two small coils, made of a nickel alloy and a polyester-like fiber, the device is placed in the fallopian tubes through the vagina, and is designed to create an inflammatory response that causes scar tissue to form and block the tubes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe F.D.A. said on Monday that from Nov. 4, 2002, when Essure was approved, through December of last year, the agency had received 26,773 reports of adverse events related to the device, although some might be duplicates.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe most frequently reported problems, the F.D.A. said, were pain, menstrual irregularities and headache.

O.F.C.\u2019s longtime secretary general, Tai Nicholas, suddenly quit in December, also citing personal reasons.\n\nThe audit found that Chung and Nicholas, without issuing a tender, had hired a company with no experience of the work required for the design of the project, which involved building offices, two soccer fields and other facilities in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nInvestigators then found a series of close relationships between companies advising the O.F.C. on the project and picked to complete the project. All the companies were set up shortly before being awarded contracts, \u201cwith no track record of experience, and subcontracted their works to other companies,\u201d an executive summary of the PwC report stated. It found that a separate company set up by Chung might have had links to one hired to work on the project.\n\nThe accountants suggested FIFA go to court to find out more. \u201cDue the limitations in assessing the financial records of the external parties it is recommended to commence civil proceedings in New Zealand in order to get access to these records, substantiate or refute the concerns with regards to bribery and corruption this review has raised, and ultimately attempt to recover any potential losses from the third parties,\u201d the report, code-named Project Gunemba, concluded.\n\nDetails of the investigation\u2019s findings were sent to members of the O.F.C. executive board, leading the president of Tahiti\u2019s soccer federation, Thierry Ariiotima, to email Chung last week to explain that he expected FIFA would \u201csuspend you very shortly.\u201d", "title": "FIFA Vice President Quits After Audit Raises Questions", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "During his campaign for the presidency of FIFA, Infantino promised fourfold increases in financing for soccer development to member nations. The $25 billion would provide Infantino with enough money to follow through on that commitment ahead of his bid for re-election next year.\n\nOpposition from powerful European soccer officials and some of the continent\u2019s biggest clubs remains strong. Creating the event without the agreement of the world\u2019s best clubs, employers of the top players required to make the events a success, is likely to lead to a protracted conflict in a sport that has been a battleground for primacy between national teams, which are governed by FIFA, and club soccer, which is overseen by the six regional confederations and their members.\n\nTo win support, Infantino recently met with a handful of executives from the biggest clubs, including Germany\u2019s Bayern Munich and Chinese-owned Inter Milan, according to people familiar with the situation. The discussion took place without the knowledge of the European Club Association, an umbrella group for about 200 teams from across a continent, which includes the vast majority of the world\u2019s richest clubs. A spokesman for the E.C.A. said it had not been informed about the extraordinary FIFA Council meeting.\n\nIn a briefing document sent to FIFA Council members before the Bogot\u00e1 meeting, and seen by The New York Times, FIFA said it favored a 24-team global club championship, with half the participants drawn from Europe. That group would include the finalists from the four prior editions of the Champions League, soccer\u2019s richest club event.\n\nFIFA estimated each edition of its proposed club competition could generate a maximum of $1 billion; the investment group is offering $3 billion for each tournament, with the remainder offered for a proposed nations league.\n\nEuropean soccer\u2019s governing body UEFA is largely opposed to the proposal. Both competitions proposed by FIFA would cause upheaval to its events, including the creation of a significant competitor to the Champions League, which generates billions of dollars in advertising and broadcast revenue. The global nations league also would usurp UEFA\u2019s own version of a similar competition, which begins its first edition later this year.\n\nConfederations in Asia and the Americas appear to be largely supportive of the idea, which would guarantee more games against top European sides for their best clubs. But a German member of the FIFA Council, Reinhard Grindel, a critic of Infantino\u2019s management style, told Infantino the organization should focus on national team soccer and not meddle in club affairs.\n\nIn its most recent letter to members, FIFA explained that the money from the proposed deal would directly benefit its 211 member federations, the group that will vote in next year\u2019s presidential election.", "title": "FIFA\u2019s Infantino Calls for Rare Emergency Meeting Amid $25 Billion Offer", "authors": []}

They also reduced the size of the onscreen graphics, which were originally designed for cellphone screens.\n\nOf the big four professionals sports leagues in the United States, M.L.B. has the audience that skews the oldest. A study by Magna Global, a marketing research company, found that the average age of television viewers of M.L.B. in 2016 was 57.\n\nSchulman considers himself to be part of the target audience for M.L.B.; he is 30 years old and a die-hard fan of the Mets. His television wasn\u2019t compatible with the Facebook app, but he figured out how to use a different streaming device.\n\nAlthough he and his 60-year-old father are Facebook users, Schulman said his father struggled to load the game, so he had to walk him through directions on the phone during the game. \u201cFor me it was fine, but for an older man or woman who is not as tech savvy, might be more difficult,\u201d Schulman said.\n\nNearly 69,000 comments streamed across the bar on the side of the viewing screen.

Tech,\u201d a critical examination of how social media is influencing society, and \u201cChaos Monkeys,\u201d a memoir by a former Facebook executive.\n\nMr. Collins\u2019 profile has grown along with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. His committee questioned the company\u2019s chief executive, Alexander Nix, weeks before news broke about its practices. The panel has published audio records in which an executive tied to Cambridge Analytica discusses how the Trump campaign used techniques used by the Nazis to target voters. A webcast of the committee\u2019s hearing with the former Cambridge Analytica researcher Christopher Wylie was so popular it nearly took down Parliament\u2019s website, Mr. Collins said.\n\nBetween television interviews this week, Mr. Collins sat with staff watching a small set as a Canadian parliamentary committee questioned an executive from an online advertising company, Aggregate IQ, that had been involved in the Brexit referendum. When Mr. Collins heard a discrepancy in the testimony, he messaged a member of the Canadian panel. \u201cHe read out my text during the hearing,\u201d Mr. Collins laughed.\n\nAware that he doesn\u2019t have the same financial resources as Facebook and other global tech firms, or even as much as his counterparts across the Atlantic, Mr. Collins has been coordinating his investigation with others around the world.

Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBut the effort by Ms. Mercer\u2019s friend to help mend fences with Facebook hints at both Cambridge\u2019s importance to her family\u2019s political ambitions and the perils posed by Facebook\u2019s ban.\n\nAlthough a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer\u2019s role at the company \u2014 saying she had a \u201cbroad business oversight\u201d role and no involvement in its daily operations \u2014 she serves on the company\u2019s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm. Former Cambridge employees said she was close to Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s chief executive, who was suspended last month after reports on Cambridge\u2019s harvesting of Facebook data.\n\nMs. Mercer\u2019s intermediary with Facebook was Matthew Michelsen, a tech entrepreneur and investor based in San Diego, who lists his employer as GothamAlpha, a consulting firm. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has also advised major Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook and Palantir, a data-mining firm and intelligence contractor.\n\nMr. Michelsen\u2019s meeting came on March 20, the day after Facebook announced that Cambridge had agreed to let it audit the firm\u2019s computer servers. Mr. Michelsen met informally with a Facebook acquaintance who was accompanied by a Facebook lawyer, according to a person briefed on the meeting, and both Cambridge Analytica and the Mercers were discussed. The person discussed the meeting on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it publicly. No immediate actions were taken as a result of Mr. Michelsen\u2019s outreach.\n\nMr. Michelsen acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that he visited the company but he would not discuss the purpose of the trip, citing nondisclosure agreements Facebook required him to sign. Ms. Mercer declined to say whether she and Mr. Michelsen had discussed the purpose of the meeting or whether he had briefed her on it afterward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCambridge also mounted a more formal effort to assuage Facebook, the person said, sending its own lawyers to meet with Facebook on the same day Mr. Michelsen was there. The Cambridge lawyers asked Facebook officials whether the firm could be reinstated on the platform. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that meeting in an interview with The Times last month, saying that his company had not decided whether to lift the ban.\n\nA Cambridge spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. In a lengthy public statement on Monday, the company stated that \u201cthe vast majority of our business is commercial rather than political, contrary to the way some of the media has portrayed us.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent years, the Mercers have become among the most prominent and highly scrutinized political donors in the United States. In the early years of the Obama administration, they began doling out tens of millions of dollars to an eclectic array of conservative groups \u2014 many of them outside Washington\u2019s mainline Republican establishment. Mr. Mercer invested $10 million in Breitbart News, the nationalist website, bringing on Mr. Bannon as chairman, while Ms. Mercer joined the boards of leading conservative think tanks.\n\nThe Mercers were critical of the Republican Party\u2019s existing data apparatus, which was controlled by the party officials and consultants they hoped to disempower. Mr. Mercer bankrolled Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and Ms. Mercer encouraged candidates and PACs that took the family\u2019s money to also hire the family\u2019s data firm. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Mercers backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, putting millions of dollars \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica \u2014 behind him.\n\nBut after Mr. Trump prevailed in the primaries, the Mercers switched candidates. In summer 2016, Ms. Mercer helped orchestrate a shake-up that put Mr. Bannon at the head of the Trump campaign. After Mr. Trump won the presidential election, he attended a costume ball at the Mercer estate on Long Island.\n\nMs. Mercer secured a slot on his transition team and prime seats at his inauguration. As Mr. Trump took office, she sought to take a leading role in America First Policies, a nonprofit formed to back the president\u2019s agenda. Last spring, Ms. Mercer and her father attended the Time 100 black-tie gala, where she was feted as one of the country\u2019s most influential people.\n\nBut her insistence on using Cambridge to provide the Trump group with voter data, and other clashes over strategy, alienated other donors and Trump allies, according to other Republicans. Ms. Mercer formed her own group, Making America Great, and hired Emily Cornell, a Cambridge executive, to run it.\n\nYet after an initial splash of spending in 2017 to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on environmental deregulation and other issues, Making America Great appears to have gone quiet. Ms. Cornell said she was no longer affiliated with Making America Great and could not comment on the group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn November, Mr. Mercer stepped down from the helm of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds, as some investors began expressing dismay over his alliance with Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe family is likely to retain significant influence in broader conservative circles thanks to its vast fortune, which finances donations that many political organizations and candidates are eager to accept. The family foundation handed out about $20 million to more than two dozen conservative think tanks, charter school groups, watchdog outfits and other nonprofit organizations in 2016, according to its most recent tax return.\n\nMs. Mercer remains a trustee of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington think tank that has provided the Trump administration with grist for a range of initiatives. The foreign policy hawk John R. Bolton, whose super PAC the Mercers lavished with cash and whom Ms. Mercer once lobbied the White House to make secretary of state, was recently tapped to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nThe family has also donated $4.5 million to Republican candidates and super PACs during the 2018 election cycle, putting the Mercers among the top 20 donors in the country. And the father-daughter duo still inspire fear: Virtually no Republicans were willing to speak on the record about the family\u2019s troubles.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But their contributions to ideological nonprofit groups like the Heartland Institute, which disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, may become less visible in the future. In 2016, when the Mercers\u2019 backing of Mr. Trump subjected the family to intense public scrutiny, the Mercer foundation\u2019s largest contribution was to DonorsTrust, an advisory group for conservative givers.\n\nThat grant, the Mercer foundation\u2019s first recorded contribution to DonorsTrust, could herald a shift in the family\u2019s philanthropic strategy. DonorsTrust helps wealthy conservatives obtain charitable tax benefits while \u2014 if so desired \u2014 shielding their giving from public view. The donor records a contribution to DonorsTrust and recommends potential recipients, while grantees receive a donation from DonorsTrust charitable vehicles. In 2016, DonorsTrust disbursed more than $66 million worth of such grants.\n\n\u201cDonor-advised funds offer you any level of privacy you\u2019d like from the receiving organization,\u201d states a promotional pamphlet available from the DonorsTrust website. \u201cA donor can ask the fund provider to share their full name with one favored grantee and keep their identity private from other.\u201d Such privacy can be useful to donors who \u201cmay be supporting a sensitive or personal cause that could endanger familial or professional harmony,\u201d according to the pamphlet.\n\nPhoto\n\nSuch mechanisms, which are legal, are used by many donors on the right and the left. Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about whether she intended to shift more of her family\u2019s future political philanthropy into intermediaries like DonorsTrust. A 2017 tax return for the Mercer foundation is not yet publicly available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMs. Mercer is a private person,\u201d her spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAnd she does not intend to discuss with the media either the conversations she has with her close friends or her philanthropic and charitable giving.\u201d\n\nLawson Bader, the president of DonorsTrust, referred questions to the Mercers. \u201cI do not discuss DonorsTrust accounts real or imagined,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe Facebook scandal has hit just as the Mercers appear to be expanding their business in the world of big data. Public records show that Ms. Mercer, her sister Jennifer and Mr. Nix serve as directors of Emerdata, a British data company formed in August by top executives at Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Group, according to British corporate records.\n\nIncorporation documents state that Emerdata specializes in \u201cdata processing, hosting and related activities.\u201d An SCL official told Channel 4, a British television station, that Emerdata was established last year to combine SCL and Cambridge under one corporate entity.\n\nExactly what ambitions the Mercers, who joined the Emerdata board last month, have for the company is unclear. Another Emerdata director, Johnson Ko Chun Shun, is a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince \u2014 the brother of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater. Mr. Ko, who declined to comment, is a substantial shareholder and deputy chairman in Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company, Frontier Services Group.\n\nMr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Another major Frontier investor is Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families.\n\nEmerdata has a second Hong Kong-based director, Peng Cheng. Little public information about Ms. Peng, a British citizen, is available. But a woman with the same name is the chief executive of a publishing and online game company located in the same Hong Kong office tower as Frontier Services. In 2016, Mr. Ko\u2019s brokerage company said it would buy a stake in Ms. Peng\u2019s company, Culturecom.\n\nWhile in Hong Kong in September to speak at a conference, Mr. Nix told Bloomberg that Cambridge Analytica was looking into China for commercial ventures. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scoping this market for about a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see huge opportunity to bring some of these technologies to advertising and marketing space brands.\u201d", "title": "Facebook Fallout Deals Blow to Mercers\u2019 Political Clout", "authors": ["Nicholas Confessore", "David Gelles"]}

(They should note, though, that Facebook has already limited the data available to outside companies, so this would not necessarily have the intended effect.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongress could address the issue of data collection by adopting European-style data protection policies, requiring stronger user controls for personal information or requiring social networks to delete certain types of user data automatically after a given time.\n\nIf it wanted to, Congress could address the issue of hateful content by adopting strict hate speech laws like the ones that exist in Germany, which make social platforms liable if they fail to remove hate speech in a timely manner.\n\nIt could address the problem of transparency in political ads by passing the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would subject online political ads to similar disclosure standards as TV and radio political ads. (Mr. Zuckerberg has already indicated that he supports the measure, so this should be an easy one.)\n\nOr, if it decides that Facebook is just too darn big, Congress could spearhead an effort to break it up.\n\nAll of these are theoretically possible outcomes, depending on which of Facebook\u2019s many issues lawmakers decide to address. Lawmakers do not need to be computer scientists, or to come up with an omnibus bill to address all of Facebook\u2019s flaws in one fell swoop.

And it needs to demonstrate that it has the political resolve to push these changes through, even as the tech industry furiously lobbies against them, as it undoubtedly will.\n\nPerhaps the most dispiriting exchange all week was when Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebook\u2019s market power, and the notion that it is too dominant for any other social network to compete with.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook in the private sector?\u201d Mr. Graham asked.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg dodged the question, saying that people use lots of apps to communicate.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you have a monopoly?\u201d Mr. Graham wondered.\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way to me,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\nBy raising the issue of Facebook\u2019s lack of competition, Mr. Graham was circling around an important point. Facebook has, indeed, taken steps to acquire or crush multiple apps that have posed a competitive threat.

The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.\n\nWhat is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow\u2019s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.\n\nBut the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers \u2014 including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg noted that this data is what makes Facebook valuable for its advertisers and its users, enabling the network to offer them only relevant ads. But it also gives it inordinate power over people\u2019s lives. It wouldn\u2019t be impossible, for instance, to use Facebook\u2019s sophisticated models to send a deluge of ads for weight-loss pills to overweight teenagers with a fragile self-image. We know that Facebook can determine, and manipulate, its users\u2019 emotional states.\n\nPhoto\n\nData can also be deployed for virtual redlining. And what about price discrimination? Amazon and others have already experimented with mining our data to charge \u201cpersonalized\u201d prices for a given item \u2014 the maximum price each of us is willing to pay \u2014 a practice that can leave many consumers worse off.\n\nBut policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don\u2019t like it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data \u2014 leading scholars to coin the term \u201cprivacy paradox.\u201d As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, \u201cLots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For instance, research found that privacy rules introduced by the European Union in the 1990s reduced the effectiveness of online advertising. What, then, is the social cost?\n\nMr. Nakamura and two colleagues at the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculated how much of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product came from the \u201cfree\u201d digital economy powered by advertising that drives Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s business. From 1995 to 2005, they found, it added 0.07 percentage points to the economy\u2019s annual growth rate. From 2005 to 2015, it added 0.11 percentage points.\n\nBut this must understate the data economy\u2019s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.\n\nFacebook\u2019s advertising tools \u2014 the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn \u2014 provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of \u201cfree\u201d music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus \u2014 the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it \u2014 is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.\n\nAnd yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.\n\nRegulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths \u2014 say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future \u2014 make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThe idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.\u201d\n\nSummoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.", "title": "Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.", "authors": ["Eduardo Porter", "Economic Scene"]}
{"date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "There\u2019s no need to start from scratch. In 2012, President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights that included many ideas for giving people more control over their information, making data collection more transparent and putting limits on what business can do with the information they collect. The bill of rights fizzled out when Congress showed little appetite for it. But the European Union has used a similar approach in developing its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect on May 25.\n\nThe new European rules are not perfect \u2014 they include the so-called right to be forgotten, which allows people to ask companies to delete personal information that they no longer wish to share. That could be implemented in ways that limit free speech. But the Europeans have made progress toward addressing some of the problems that have recently been highlighted in the United States. For instance, their laws require companies to seek consent before collecting sensitive personal information, to make the request understandable, and to give users an easy way to opt in to sharing such data, rather than forcing them to opt out if they don\u2019t want to be tracked. Further, companies that want to collect data about Europeans will have to be upfront about how they use personal data, and they cannot collect more information than they need to provide the services they are offering. The Obama bill of rights included a similar concept, saying that personal information should only be used in \u201cways that are consistent with the context in which consumers provide the data.\u201d\n\nToday, it is standard procedure for many companies to vacuum up as much data as they can by getting users to agree to long, impenetrable terms of service. Companies might not even know how they will use the information being collected but collect it anyway, in case they later develop a specific use for it. Recently, some Facebook users discovered that the company\u2019s Android app had been logging metadata from every incoming and outgoing phone call and text message, in some cases for years. The company said that users had consented to sharing this information and that doing so \u201chelps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook.\u201d That statement is positively Orwellian. It\u2019s hard to believe that many people would have given the company access to so much personal data if they actually understood what they were agreeing to.\n\nThe new European regulation will also let people access their own data, transfer their information from one business to others that provide a similar service and delete it altogether under certain circumstances. Companies will have to notify customers within 72 hours if they become aware of a breach of personal information.\n\nMany businesses will struggle to comply with the European Union\u2019s new rules, and officials in member countries will have a hard time enforcing it consistently. \u201cWe will have a learning curve,\u201d said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France\u2019s privacy regulator, the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s. \u201cWe will have to adjust.\u201d\n\nBut it is increasingly clear that businesses will figure out how to live with and make money under tougher privacy rules. Some companies are also planning to apply some or all of the data protection requirements to all of their customers, not just Europeans. And other countries have or are considering adopting similar rules. Throughout history, meatpackers, credit card companies, automakers and other businesses resisted regulations, arguing they would be ruined by them. Yet, regulations have actually benefited many industries by boosting demand for products that consumers know meet certain standards.", "title": "Opinion | Facebook Is Not the Problem.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "NEW HAVEN \u2014 Tuesday was a huge day for online speech. Facebook finally released the internal rules that its moderators use to decide what kinds of user content to remove from the site, including once-mysterious details on what counts as \u201cgraphic violence,\u201d \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cchild exploitation.\u201d It also announced the introduction of an appeals process for users who want to challenge the removal of their posts.\n\nThese developments represent a big step toward due process, which is essential on a site where so much of our speech now takes place. But an entity with such enormous power over online expression should do even more to listen to its users about what kinds of expression are allowed, and its users should be ready to be heard. Ideally, Facebook will eventually create a more robust system to respond to those who believe their posts were taken down in error, and to give its users the opportunity to weigh in on its policies.\n\nOver the past decade, Facebook has decided how and when to take down posts using two sets of rules: one public and one private. The public rules are the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d that very generally describe bans on certain types of content \u2014 like \u201cno graphic violence\u201d or \u201cno sexually explicit content.\u201d The second set of rules, used to guide moderators deciding whether to take down flagged material, remained secret, although training slides leaked in 2017 gave some insight into what they were.\n\nThanks in part to some high-profile controversies over Facebook\u2019s removal of material \u2014 or its failure to delete certain content fast enough \u2014 awareness has spread that the company constantly makes choices about which kind of user speech is acceptable. For example, it was criticized for its removal of a famous photo of a girl running naked on a road after a napalm attack on her village in Vietnam.

As for Mr. Albright\u2019s analysis, Mr. Steinfeld said, \u201cThe CrowdTangle data that this researcher\u2019s analysis relied upon did not account for any people who followed more than one page. Our submitted figures removed this duplication.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s method would arrive at a lower total than counting the followers of each page.\n\nIts total also did not include the followers the Internet Research Agency gained on Instagram, which is part of Facebook. Nearly 170 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency made posts on Instagram. Twenty-seven of these accounts had nearly 2.2 million followers, Mr. Albright estimated, an analysis that Wired magazine reported in March.\n\nMr. Steinfeld said in the email: \u201cWe provided our best estimate for the number of people reached on Facebook or Instagram. We did not calculate the volume of people who followed at least one Instagram account associated with the Internet Research Agency.\u201d\n\nAnalysts who are skeptical of the claim the Russia-linked pages had significant reach have asked whether many of their followers were authentic Facebook users or whether a large number were Russian-linked users who followed the pages merely to make them look more popular.

Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent letters to Mr. Pichai and Mr. Dorsey with 14 questions. In his letter to Google, Mr. Grassley wanted to \u201cunderstand how Google manages and monitors user privacy for the significant amounts of data which it collects.\u201d\n\n[2 days, 10 hours, 600 questions: Read about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg went to Washington.]\n\nThe companies have until April 25 to respond.

They don\u2019t want to try to trip any alarms.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLike Facebook, Google collects vast amount of data on users \u2014 including their YouTube choices, internet searches and location history \u2014 to target advertisements. Facebook has more than two billion users globally, but Google has seven products, including YouTube, Gmail and its Android software, with more than a billion users each.\n\nOn Wednesday, when Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, questioned Facebook\u2019s tracking of logged-off users, Mr. Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Google and \u201cthe rest of the industry\u201d employed similar tactics. It was one of the few times Google\u2019s data practices were mentioned in the two days of hearings.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg did not get a chance to say much more about Facebook\u2019s industry peers this week. Over two days of hearings, Google was referenced 11 times by lawmakers. Twitter was mentioned 10 times and Amazon once. Apple was mentioned three times, mostly in passing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle employees said they had not received explicit orders from management to keep a low profile because most already understood the risk. One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because workers were not allowed to speak publicly on the issue, said there was an understanding inside Google that the company was the obvious next target.\n\nIn a statement, Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201ccompletely focused on protecting our users\u2019 data\u201d and \u201cwill take action\u201d if it found evidence of \u201cdeceptive behavior or misuse of personal data.\u201d\n\nGoogle has been criticized \u2014 even fined \u2014 for its privacy practices over the years. It paid a $17 million fine to settle a case when it bypassed privacy settings in Apple\u2019s Safari browser to track users and show them advertisements in 2011 and 2012. It also got dinged for scooping up people\u2019s passwords, email and other personal information during its Street View mapping project.\n\nPrivacy advocates also criticized a Google social network, called Buzz, in 2010 for automatically including users\u2019 email contact.

Four days before Mr. Zuckerberg was set to testify, Facebook surprised many in Washington when it endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill that would require more transparency and stricter rules for political ads on the internet. Facebook\u2019s endorsement was a reversal from its previous opposition, said a spokeswoman for one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.\n\nMr. Warner and another co-sponsor, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, called on Twitter and Google to also back the bill. Twitter quickly responded with an endorsement. Google has not taken a public position.\n\nSimilarly, Facebook and Google had donated $200,000 each to a group opposing a California ballot initiative that proposes enabling Californians to sue companies for data breaches, among other things. Facebook this week dropped its opposition to the initiative, which organizers said was on track to appear on the November ballot in California.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes, which were photographed during the testimony, also contained a prepared response if lawmakers echoed criticism from Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, who has chided Facebook and other companies for collecting gobs of personal information about their users.\n\n\u201cLots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\u201d said the document. \u201cImportant you hold everyone to the same standard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentatives for Facebook and Apple declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s notes.\n\nApple has long campaigned to draw a distinction between the way it operates and the way Facebook and Google do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life. I think it\u2019s an invasion of privacy,\u201d Mr. Cook told MSNBC. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic.\u201d\n\nAfter users download Apple\u2019s most recent software update for iPhones and iPads, released on March 29, their devices prominently display a message that said \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said the update, which has been in the works for months, was intended to better inform users on its data practices and comply with Europe\u2019s new data-privacy rules that take effect May 25 \u2014 not taunt Facebook.\n\nWhen asked if it was worried about regulations for the industry stemming from new scrutiny of Facebook, Apple referred to recent comments Mr. Cook made to MSNBC. He said he typically believed \u201cthe best regulation is no regulation\u201d but \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that here.\u201d\n\nAmazon, for its part, has mirrored Google\u2019s approach, staying silent despite the frequent attacks President Trump has made against the company on Twitter.

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "Violence, or its absence, has long been at the center of debates among privacy advocates. When the privacy scholar Daniel Solove, for example, published a taxonomy of privacy infringement in 2006, a fellow law professor, Ann Bartow, was unimpressed. Though she agreed with his overall argument, she felt that the paper \u201cframes privacy harms in dry, analytical terms that fail to sufficiently identify and animate the compelling ways that privacy violations can negatively impact the lives of living, breathing human beings beyond simply provoking feelings of unease\u201d; his taxonomy, she complained, lacked \u201cenough dead bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost privacy problems,\u201d Solove argued dryly in response, \u201clack dead bodies.\u201d They also lack most of the other egregious consequences that people tend to emphasize when they want to up privacy\u2019s perceived stakes. Elsewhere, Solove has pointed out that such arguments are more often than not made with reference to the dire intrusions of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d a convenient shorthand for the crises of authoritarian omnipotence. The villain invoked is the rapacious watcher \u2014 the bilateral, panoptic \u201ctelescreen\u201d in Winston\u2019s home \u2014 backed by ruthless violence. \u201cUnder this paradigm,\u201d Solove wrote, \u201cprivacy is invaded by uncovering one\u2019s hidden world, by surveillance and by the disclosure of concealed information.\u201d Durbin himself is a lawyer, as he reminded Zuckerberg, and implicit in his prosecution was the basic distinction of privacy law as conceived in the late 19th century: There is information that is private and information that is public, and the transgression of that boundary is a slippery slope to murder.\n\nWhat Durbin discovered is that Zuckerberg was delighted to argue on that terrain. Facebook has no trouble endorsing an argument for privacy in the terms of revelation \u2014 the revelation of location information that might be seen by a knife-wielding antagonist, at an extreme, or simply the drunken photos that might be seen by your boss. Our company, he said countless times over the course of his own interrogation, has menus upon menus of options to restrict the information other people might see and has limited third-party access since 2015. Besides, most users believe that they know what they are and aren\u2019t broadcasting: If despised billionaires don\u2019t post their hotel information, they won\u2019t be killed, and if everybody else doesn\u2019t post drunken photos, they won\u2019t lose their jobs. All of this creates the impression that the adverse consequences of Facebook usage are only matters of disclosure, and that any breaches over the past few years are probably the user\u2019s own fault.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSolove proposed we relinquish our \u201c1984\u201d fixation and find metaphorical support in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d: \u201ca more thoughtless process of bureaucratic indifference, arbitrary errors and dehumanization, a world where people feel powerless and vulnerable, without any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their information.\u201d In part this is about the difference between state and corporate power, but it\u2019s also about effects subtler and further-reaching than the simple surveillance of what we mutter in bed.\n\nPhoto\n\nWe ought to worry, on his view, much less about the Thought Police and much more about how our informational profiles harden into the invisible architecture of our everyday lives. It\u2019s not that we might be observed or killed in our sleep, but rather that the availability of loans or jobs or romantic partners or upscale hotel rooms are already being silently and automatically withdrawn from \u201cpeople like us\u201d \u2014 people with our politics, people of our skin color, people with certain friends or predispositions, people without the wealth and power of Mark Zuckerberg. Or, in the case of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it\u2019s that our political affiliations are being arranged on the basis of our greatest vulnerabilities. Zuckerberg is more than happy to grant Durbin a victory that leaves all of this potential intact.\n\nThe best recent definition of privacy doesn\u2019t require hotel-room carnage to make a case for why we should still pay attention to our persistent feelings of unease. The philosopher Helen Nissenbaum defines privacy not as one right to be balanced with others but as the condition of what she calls \u201ccontextual integrity.\u201d When we talk about privacy, she says, we\u2019re not talking about the difference between the intimacy of the bedroom and the scrutiny of the park, but rather the specific norms and expectations that govern communication among various parties at different times and places. The old public-private distinction, she writes, postulates \u201conly two contexts with distinct sets of informational norms for each \u2014 privacy constraints in the private, anything goes in the public. The framework of contextual integrity, by contrast, postulates a multiplicity of social contexts, each with a distinctive set of rules governing information flows.\u201d There are things we discuss with lovers that we don\u2019t discuss with bosses, and things we discuss with doctors that we might not discuss with lawyers, and so on.\n\nThere are a variety of possible policy implications \u2014 beginning with the idea that a one-size-fits-all legal-consent model, where clicking \u201cI agree\u201d signs all your data away, should be regarded as nonsense. But the idea of contextual integrity is most immediately useful as a diagnostic aid in the absence of dead bodies, a way to render precise our otherwise vague sense of agitation. It does a lot, for example, to explain exactly what\u2019s so unsettling about the Cambridge Analytica issue, and why the congressional hearings were so unsatisfying. Many of the questions from our elected officials seemed to turn on the epiphany that what seemed like a service to connect friends was actually a service to sell ads, but most Facebook users are neither that stupid nor that na\u00efve; everybody knows at this point that if you\u2019re not paying for something, you\u2019re the product being sold. Yes, that omnipresent shoe ad might be creepy, but as autonomous subjects we feel more than capable of simply not buying the shoes. Our decision to purchase one shoe over another doesn\u2019t seem to have broad social consequences.\n\nUntil all of a sudden we weren\u2019t talking about shoe ads anymore, and we weren\u2019t talking about minor personal decisions that could easily be reversed. It turned out we had been prepared to accept some intermingling of the norms of personal communication with the norms of the commercial marketplace, but even the most cynical among us didn\u2019t quite realize the implications of letting all that bleed into the political. There was at last clear evidence to support a notion of privacy as a social good rather than an individual right \u2014 and, finally, a way to talk about why privacy matters without recourse to sensationalism. The \u201cdead bodies\u201d of the privacy debate might finally be laid to rest.", "title": "Facebook and the \u2018Dead Body\u2019 Problem", "authors": ["Gideon Lewis-Kraus", "On Technology"]}

He said this verification was meant to prevent foreign interference in elections, like the ads and posts from so-called Russian trolls before and after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg added that he supported a Senate bill, the Honest Ads Act, that would bring political advertising on the internet more in line with what is required on broadcast television.

Why?\u201d She added the hashtag #DeleteMyData.\n\nMr. Gilbreath explained that Ahalogy, like many marketers, often buys data from outside firms for campaigns so that it can direct ads to certain groups of people \u2014 say, Walmart shoppers \u2014 but that the company doesn\u2019t store that material and can\u2019t see personal information like email addresses.\n\nWhile marketers may be frustrated right now, few have actually left Facebook. The company is the second-biggest seller of digital ads with more than $40 billion in annual revenue. Last week, Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions, said at a conference that the company did not expect \u201cmajor changes to our overall revenue and business model.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Everson and her team, which works with agencies and the biggest global advertisers, have been in overdrive in recent weeks. She has sent frequent emails to agency leaders, held calls with Facebook\u2019s council of top marketers and joined a discussion with the Association of National Advertisers. She noted in an interview that she \u201cwould much rather err on the side of over-communication right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJohn Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at WPP\u2019s GroupM, said that while he was dismayed by the initial \u201cpocket of silence\u201d from Facebook in the wake of the revelations, the company has since been candid. He said he appreciated the email updates sent by Ms. Everson every other day.\n\nOne of the points of concern seems to be apps that companies made years ago at the behest of Facebook. The tech company recently declared that it would conduct a full investigation of apps that obtained access to a large amount of user information before Facebook changed its platform policies. Between 2010 and the change in 2014, Facebook encouraged brands from insurers to entertainment companies to make games and other apps for the site, according to one agency executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These categories enable advertisers to direct ads to people based on data collected by outside companies, including their purchasing habits in physical stores and profiles like \u201cbig-city moms.\u201d\n\nFacebook said that the change would improve user privacy. But it has also resulted in a perhaps counterintuitive lesson for marketers: Several are devising new ways to build up their own customer data lists out of concern that they were too reliant on Facebook for such information.\n\nOne executive gave a hypothetical example of a jam brand that had been targeting ads on Facebook through shopping habits based on outside company data. That company might now set up a recipe site and create a newsletter to distribute great recipes every week. It could also make a loyalty program with peanut butter and jelly points, a children\u2019s site and an iJam app, collecting customer data from each.\n\nMr. Montgomery said that he did not expect people to migrate from Facebook en masse.\n\n\u201cThe major question we\u2019ve asked together of ourselves and our clients is will this affect user engagement on the platform, and we haven\u2019t seen any of that yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, what really counts is whether the users will value the utility of Facebook over the privacy missteps.\u201d\n\nIf people stop using Facebook in significant numbers, it will test the patience of advertisers, which have had a fraught relationship with the social network. The main points of contention have been the amount of data that advertisers can access on the platform and issues around how ad performance is measured. Facebook is aiming to soothe them while it sorts through a very public problem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere may have been sellers in media that maybe got the benefit of doubt when something went wrong \u2014 when you get discretion, relationships matter, perceptions of the media brand matter,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cBut with Facebook, I feel like a common refrain I\u2019ve heard is that user trends go down, that\u2019s going to have ramifications.\u201d\n\nYet Ms. Everson has received many public messages of support and praise for her leadership on Twitter and on her Facebook page from agency executives and chief marketing officers, including those at General Electric and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.\n\nIn one of her emails to advertisers last month, which a recipient shared with The New York Times, Ms. Everson said it was important to remember that Facebook\u2019s mission was unchanged. It is still the same company, she said, that is \u201cbringing connectivity to remote areas of the world\u201d and that \u201cgives people a voice and enables the movements that are changing the world.\u201d She concluded by saying, \u201cThank you so very much for your continued partnership.\u201d", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Current Status With Advertisers?

But as Facebook flails in the public eye over its data and privacy issues, some power users are seizing on a moment of vulnerability to push for change.\n\nFacebook appears to be listening. In recent weeks, the company has invited groups of influencers to meetings at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. Topics discussed at the meetings included improving reach for creators, branded content policies and better lines of communication with company leadership, according to a person with knowledge of the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential.\n\nPhoto\n\nArguments about monetization, as the practice of letting creators share directly in advertising proceeds is called, are as old as the system itself. YouTube, which opened a revenue-sharing program more than a decade ago, has long been accused by angry creators of demonetizing videos for arbitrary and inscrutable reasons.\n\nThose complaints gave rise to violence last week, when Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a YouTube creator who had been angered by the platform\u2019s revenue-sharing policies, shot and injured three employees at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., and then killed herself.\n\nInstagram, the Facebook-owned photo and video app, has long hosted a thriving community of influencers. But Facebook itself, which was seen by some creators as old and uncool, has had a harder time attracting them. It has been trying to steal attention from YouTube in recent years by courting popular creators, and promising them access to the platform\u2019s gargantuan user base. In 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg proclaimed a \u201cnew golden age of video,\u201d and the company spent millions of dollars enticing media organizations and celebrities to create videos on Facebook.\n\nIn 2015, the social network began testing a revenue-sharing program with a limited group of creators, and last November, it rolled out Facebook Creator, a special app designed for professional users. Recently, the social network announced that it was testing some additional tools for creators, including a way for users to purchase monthly subscriptions to their favorite creators\u2019 pages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut some of these features are still not widely available, and many influencers say that Facebook\u2019s charm campaign amounts to too little, too late.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt feels like they\u2019ve pulled the biggest bait-and-switch of all time,\u201d said Dan Shaba, a co-founder of The Pun Guys, a Facebook page with 1.2 million followers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been promising monetization from the moment we got in.\u201d\n\nMr. Hamilton, he of the hot-pepper thong video, said, \u201cI did 1.8 billion views last year. I made no money from Facebook. Not even a dollar.\u201d\n\nMany of the influencers I spoke with recognized that Facebook had given them large audiences in the first place, and that it was the company\u2019s right to change its policies at will. Several also acknowledged that some of their videos represented the kind of cheap entertainment that Facebook has consciously chosen to de-emphasize, as it tries to prioritize high-quality and local news. (In January, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company had \u201cmade changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people\u2019s time is well spent.\u201d)\n\nStill, the influencers said, the company owes its most popular creators something. And they warned that by making it harder for users to see viral videos, Facebook may be jeopardizing its own business, which relies on users spending lots of time on the platform.\n\n\u201cI understand where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d said Mr. Shaba. \u201cFacebook was turning into a viral media dumpster, and they wanted to eliminate that. Still, I\u2019d still prefer that over seeing a million wedding pictures.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRick Lax, a magician whose videos garner more than a billion views per month, said that while he largely agreed with Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s position, he disagreed with the idea that viral videos couldn\u2019t be worthwhile.\n\n\u201cA good video can be the catalyst for a meaningful connection,\u201d Mr. Lax said. \u201cThink of a good Facebook video like a Mother\u2019s Day card. It doesn\u2019t stop someone from sharing her feelings with her mom \u2014 it gives her a jumping-off point.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile waiting for Facebook to invite them into a revenue-sharing program, some influencers struck deals with viral publishers such as Diply and LittleThings, which paid the creators to share links on their pages. Those publishers paid top influencers around $500 per link, often with multiple links being posted per day, according to a person who reached such deals.\n\nIn January, Facebook threw a wrench into that media economy by changing its branded content policy to prohibit creators from accepting money for such link-sharing deals, and re-engineering its News Feed algorithms. Traffic to many viral publishers plummeted overnight. LittleThings, a female-focused digital publisher that had amassed more than 12 million Facebook followers, announced that it was shutting down and blamed Facebook\u2019s News Feed changes for cratering its organic traffic.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying that their feeds are getting stale, and they\u2019re missing the diversity of content they felt they had selected,\u201d Gretchen Tibbits, the president of LittleThings, told me. \u201cPeople carefully curated their feeds, and Facebook took that away.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Facebook is attempting to clean up its platform, and some creators did clutter the site with clickbait and spammy links. But all of this jockeying raises a larger question about how well Facebook truly knows its users, and how much it can steer their media preferences without veering into paternalism.\n\nRight now, the social network is working to improve what Mr. Zuckerberg has called the \u201clong-term well-being\u201d of its users.

Tinder, the dating app, discovered that its users were no longer able to log into the app using their Facebook accounts. Pod, a calendar syncing app, found that its users could no longer see Facebook events within their calendars. And Job Fusion, a jobs app that allowed users to see where their Facebook friends worked, announced that it was not longer able to offer its services within Facebook.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe fallout has cast a shadow over Facebook\u2019s annual meeting with developers, which was scheduled to start on Tuesday in San Jose, Calif. The event, which includes a speech from Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is typically a major attraction for developers. But this year, half a dozen developers who had previously attended the conference told The Times that they did not plan to go because they objected to Facebook\u2019s policy changes. Others who planned to be there said they intended to challenge Facebook\u2019s leaders over the changes.\n\nFacebook said it expected roughly 5,000 people \u2014 a record high \u2014 to be at the developer conference, which is known as F8. But the company also said it has tweaked the event with an eye toward data privacy. For example, the social network canceled the announcement of a Facebook smart home speaker to challenge Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home amid worries that the device would raise more questions about the amount of data the company collects.\n\n(At the event, Mr. Zuckerberg may also have to address the departure of Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging service WhatsApp and a member of the Facebook board, who said on Monday that he was leaving the company.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIme Archibong, Facebook\u2019s vice president of product partnerships, said developers are \u201cincredible partners\u201d for the company, but also added that it must \u201cstrike the right balance between creating compelling social experiences, protecting people\u2019s data, and supporting an innovative developer ecosystem.\"\n\nBhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Facebook had to walk a fine line. \u201cThey have taken a blunt instrument approach, which is the right thing to do from a public relations standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now they need to reach out to developers and smooth things over.\u201d\n\nFor much of its history, Facebook has had a rocky relationship with developers. It has sometimes adopted policies to attract developers, including by opening access to its vast troves of user data. Developers, in turn, created apps that became emblematic of the Facebook experience \u2014 apps such as Farmville, a farming simulation game played with friends on the social network, which was made by the gaming company Zynga.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

When Facebook clamped down on viral apps several years ago, it became harder for companies like Zynga to spread their games across the social media site. Zynga has since turned toward making mobile games and its fortunes have plummeted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFacebook announced a series of privacy changes in early April. Under the new measures, developers can only see a Facebook user\u2019s name, profile photo and email address; previously, the could see more information, like users\u2019 Facebook posts. Facebook is also cutting off developers\u2019 access to user accounts if someone has not used their apps for three months or longer. That policy is intended to prevent developers from collecting information in the background for months or years after people stop using their apps.\n\nFacebook also announced that it was investigating apps that had gained access to large amounts of its data in the past, and said it was conducting an audit of any company that it believed has shown suspicious activity.\n\nCubeyou got caught up in the dragnet in early April. At the time, CNBC reported that the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., had collected users\u2019 Facebook information for academic purposes and then sold the data to commercial firms without informing users. Facebook said it was conducting an audit of Cubeyou to determine if there was any wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Treu said Cubeyou fully complies with Facebook\u2019s requirements of disclosing the data it collects and what that data is used for. He added that Cubeyou strips out any personally identifiable information that it gets from Facebook. Cubeyou is simply being singled out as part of \u201ca witch hunt\u201d by Facebook, he said.\n\n\u201cWe did everything by the rules, and we are ready to prove that,\u201d said Mr. Treu, who said his company has repeatedly reached out to Facebook to talk. \u201cThere is no way to talk to them, to find out anything.\u201d", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Privacy Changes Leave Developers Steaming", "authors": ["Sheera Frenkel"]}

While stories are presented in chronological order by publication date, the recurring themes become so visible that they create a form for this collection and denote Coover\u2019s literary trajectory.\n\nImage\n\nCoover\u2019s most anthologized story, \u201cThe Babysitter,\u201d is composed of more than 100 paragraphs, separated by dots, to elaborate a scenario: A father lusts after his teenage babysitter, alone with her young charges, while her boyfriend and his buddy make plans to rape her that night. The story proceeds not in linear time but around the architecture of time. In baroque prose, Coover subtly criticizes the zeitgeist, loose morals, juvenile delinquency and parental negligence.\n\nFairy tales, adapted and reversed, have long recurred in Coover\u2019s work. \u201cThe Gingerbread House\u201d and \u201cThe Magic Poker,\u201d dark riffs on \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d and \u201cThe Frog King,\u201d are filled with sex, violence and incest. In \u201cThe Dead Queen,\u201d Prince Charming finds Snow White in bed with all seven dwarves and vows, \u201cWhatever those freaks could do, I could do better!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Brother\u201d and \u201cThe Wayfarer,\u201d from a series dedicated to Cervantes, are stories that play with narrative frame and voice. The most Cervantean story is \u201cGoing for a Beer,\u201d a picaresque about a modern drunk who is easily captivated by random women in bars. Abandoned by his wife and teased by her lover, he refuses to change even though \u201che has had enough trouble for one lifetime.\u201d The story, which ends when his life does, presents the narrative through his blurry mind and blinded view; his sense of time is only tangential.\n\nThroughout, there is Coover\u2019s customary humor. Fixated on becoming a writer, Adam forgets about Eve and the kids and the boiling coffee on the stove, and he invents \u201ca story with several narrators, each quoting the next, the last quoting the first and telling the story being told.\u201d Similarly, a film projectionist in one story cuts and pastes his own reels, using \u201cmultiple projectors to produce a flow of improbable dissolves, startling sequences of abrupt cuts and freeze frames like the stopping of a heart, disturbing juxtapositions of slow and fast speeds, fades in and out like labored breathing.\u201d This mirrors Coover\u2019s technique, with its cinematic swerves and pop sensibilities (as when he imagines what goes on offscreen between Rick and Ilsa in \u201cCasablanca\u201d).", "title": "Familiar Tales Remixed, at the Hands of a Postmodern Master", "authors": []}

Mr. Powell echoed those sentiments at a news conference after the meeting.\n\nThe minutes suggest that decision on interest rates generated little controversy: \u201cAll participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,\u201d and that they expected the annual inflation rate to rise in the months to come.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the minutes say that a \u201ccouple of participants\u201d suggested the Fed would benefit from holding off until a future meeting to raise rates, in order to wait for more data to confirm evidence that the rate of inflation was approaching the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent annual growth.\n\nOfficials also debated the benefits of the economy\u2019s running hot \u2014 with unemployment very low and growth above forecast trends \u2014 for a prolonged period of time, weighing the potential for drawing more workers back to the labor force against the risk of financial instability and \u201csignificant\u201d inflation growth.\n\nOfficials seemed to shrug off the increase in stock market volatility in February, attributing it in part to Labor Department reports that the suggested growth in wages \u2014 and, with it, inflation \u2014 was gaining steam, which could force the Fed to raise rates faster than expected. \u201cMany participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month\u2019s turbulence in stride,\u201d the minutes read.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Powell acknowledged those concerns at his news conference, saying that trade policy had begun to worry business leaders who speak with Fed officials. Still, he played down any immediate threat to growth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said at the news conference, adding that could change if a global trade dispute escalated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a speech in Chicago last week, Mr. Powell elaborated on the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s concerns during a question-and-answer session.\n\n\u201cThe discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people really don\u2019t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.\u201d\n\nAny negative effects from tariffs could put the Fed in a bind, forcing policymakers to break what Mr. Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly characterized as a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and job creation, and holding inflation to the target growth rate. Economists generally view tariff fallout as stagflationary, meaning it hurts growth and also feeds inflation. Taxes on imported goods raise prices for businesses and consumers, pushing up the inflation rate, while also dampening consumption and economic growth.\n\nThe minutes suggest that Fed officials are worrying more about that possibility than they have acknowledged publicly: \u201cMost participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk,\u201d the minutes say.", "title": "Fed Officials Have Concerns About Trade, March Meeting Minutes Show", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley"]}

The unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the lowest level recorded in a half-century, and it is below what Fed officials judge to be the sustainable long-term unemployment rate. Forecasters expect the recent injection of fiscal stimulus, from tax cuts and increased federal spending, to drive that rate down even further.\n\nInflation expectations are rising in financial markets, as measured, in part, by how much the government must pay investors to borrow money. Stock values remain high by historical standards, even with the recent dips in the market.\n\nIn similar periods in American economic history, \u201cthere have been heightened risks either of inflation, in earlier decades, or of financial imbalances more recently,\u201d Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech last week.\n\nMany Fed officials worry that by raising rates too slowly, they risk having to move quickly in the event of an inflation spike or financial turmoil. Such abrupt action, they fear, could snuff growth and plunge the economy into a recession. Other officials, such as James Bullard of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Neel Kashkari of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, say officials should keep to the current course of rate increases, particularly because inflation remains below the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent annual growth.\n\nPolling and interviews suggest that American workers are worried about rising prices but far more concerned about job and wage growth. In polling in March for The New York Times by the research firm SurveyMonkey, 62 percent of respondents said consumer prices had risen faster than wages over the preceding year. Only 4 percent said inflation was the largest economic problem facing the country. Twenty-five percent named the cost of health care as the largest economic problem, 21 percent said the gap between the rich and everyone else, and 10 percent named stagnant wages and benefits.\n\nConstance Bevitt, who does freelance work in Montgomery County, Md., said Fed officials were wrong to be worried about overheating.", "title": "Fed Officials Worry the Economy Is Too Good.

The report found that department officials had failed to establish procedures to protect the unaccompanied minors, such as conducting sufficient background checks on potential sponsors and following up with sponsors. As a result, the children were turned over to the people who contracted them out to the egg farm.\n\nTo prevent similar episodes, the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services Departments signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016, and agreed to establish joint procedures within one year for dealing with unaccompanied migrant children.\n\nMore than a year after the new guidelines were due, the two agencies have not completed them, Mr. Portman said.\n\nChildren who show up at the border by themselves are usually apprehended by Border Patrol agents or turn themselves in to customs officers at the Department of Homeland Security. Once they are processed, they are turned over to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 refugee office. The office runs more than 100 shelters around the country where it houses children and provides care until they can be turned over to a sponsor while awaiting their immigration hearings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sponsors are usually parents or family members already residing in the United States. The sponsors are supposed to undergo a detailed background check.\n\nAfter the children have been placed with sponsors, workers at the department follow up with calls to ensure that the minors continue to live with the sponsors, are enrolled in school and are aware of their court dates.\n\nBut several immigration advocates who work with unaccompanied children said the department did little follow-up. Allison E. Herre, a lawyer with Catholic Charities of Southwestern Ohio, said she had seen sponsors who forced the children to work instead of attending school and who failed to ensure that the children attended their court proceedings.\n\nSince 2016, health and human services officials said they have started calling sponsors to check on children 30 days after placement. But the agency said it was not legally responsible for children after they had been released from its refugee office.\n\nMr. Wagner said the agency was re-examining its interpretation of existing laws to make sure that migrant children were not turned over to smugglers or human traffickers.", "title": "Federal Agencies Lost Track of Nearly 1,500 Migrant Children Placed With Sponsors", "authors": ["Ron Nixon"]}

In fact, the researchers found a stronger relationship between satisfaction and buying time among lower-income groups.\n\nBut just to be sure that buying time tends to cause greater life satisfaction, the researchers conducted a randomized experiment. Participants in the trial were given $40 on each of two consecutive weekends. On one of those weekends, they were randomly assigned to spend the money on something that would save them time (like going out to eat instead of cooking). On the other weekend, they could make only a material purchase that would not save time (like buying a new shirt).\n\n\u201cWhen people spent the $40 to save time, they reported being in a more positive mood and feeling less stressed,\u201d said Ashley Whillans, lead author of both the National Academy of Sciences study and the working paper about couples, and an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cBut it is important to note that even if spending a little to buy time increases well-being, spending a lot may not.\u201d\n\nIn other words, you can also overdo it. Ms. Whillans and colleagues found that spending $100 to $200 per month on timesaving services maximized satisfaction, but spending more started to reduce it.\n\nThis could be because outsourcing may cause you to feel as if you can\u2019t do anything yourself.

(I wrote about him, too.)\n\nSo I decided to explore.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome photographers shared secret fishing holes. Others tagged anglers with whom they seemed to have struck up friendships. The rest, well, bragged about their latest catch.\n\nThe genre had all the hallmarks of a mature social media phenomenon. A lot of people were promoting brands. So much so, one Twitter commenter asked if the fishing industry now had \u201cinfluencers.\u201d Noelle Coley of Colorado said she worked with a number of companies, receiving free fishing equipment or apparel in exchange for social media mentions. (Some outlets, like Orvis, a maker of fly fishing equipment, are seeking to increase the number of women in the sport. That\u2019s no surprise, given that recreational fishing is on the rise in the United States and women are an untapped market.)\n\nWhat was most striking, though, were the photographs themselves, which were colorful, immediate and engaging. I reached out to a number of the featured men and women from across the country and asked them to tell me their back stories.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile much of America is divided between red and blue states, these anglers recounted experiences that transcend geography and politics. They said they had friends on both coasts, as well as in the middle of the country.\n\nCould fishing be the great uniter?

I posted a screenshot of the article I wrote, \u201cLots of Fish on the Screen,\u201d on my own Instagram account, with some of the more popular hashtags the fishing crowd uses. Right away a number of fishing accounts liked it or posted comments. I got an email from the wife of a fisherman I know in Santa Cruz, Calif. More emails like that followed. One of the men I interviewed posted an excerpt from the story on his Instagram account. Another one told his followers to read it.\n\nI even heard from Fishbrain, an app maker based in Stockholm, Sweden, which bills itself as the Facebook of fishing.

Even on weekends, Ari\u2019s hot spots have free seats and ample breathing room \u2014 a rarity in bustling Bangkok.\n\nPaper Butter and the Burger\n\nWith its outdoor seating, picnic tables, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll music and constant smoke from grilling meats, this beer-and-burgers haven feels more like a backyard barbecue than a restaurant. Created by the Thai-British cook Patrick Stall \u2014 who studied hospitality management in Perth, Australia \u2014 and his Thai girlfriend, Parichart Payungwong, the laid-back hangout serves everything from Japanese-style chicken wings in ginger-garlic sauce to the signature Chiang Mai Spicy burger, a patty of shredded pork with Cheddar cheese and Thai herbs. If such combinations sound like a recipe for indigestion, request the house-made black hamburger buns. The color comes from activated charcoal \u2014 a digestive aid.\n\n51 Phahonyothin Soi 5, facebook.com/PaperButter.", "title": "Five Places to Go in Bangkok", "authors": []}

While that may be true for some cruises, Mr. Prothero said it\u2019s not the case all-around, and shared some tips to enjoy an enlightening cultural experience by boat.\n\nPick Itineraries with Longer Stays at Ports\n\nMost cruise ships stop at a port in the morning and depart by late afternoon, but several cruise lines have itineraries where boats spend multiple days at a port, offering cruise-goers the opportunity to spend more time in port and to plan day-trips and other longer activities. They give travelers extra time to explore the destination and seek out its culture, whether it\u2019s the local museums, bars and restaurants or other public spaces.\n\nCruise on a Smaller Ship\n\nSmaller boats and river cruises can often access ports that bigger cruise ships cannot, which allows them to visit more unusual and off-the-beaten path landmarks, Mr. Prothero said. These intimately sized ships also give guests the opportunity to create bespoke, culture-focused itineraries, and many don\u2019t skimp on sleeping quarters or other onboard luxuries just because they\u2019re smaller. \u201cGenerally, the bigger the boat, the less flexibility you have in making your trip all about culture because big ships have to manage the needs of many more passengers,\u201d Mr. Prothero said.\n\nLook to Local Educational and Cultural Institutions\n\nAcademic and cultural centers often host their own cruises that offer itineraries brimming with cultural activities. Many include onboard lectures and seminars from professors and historians about the destinations you\u2019ll visit, and walking tours at ports when you arrive.", "title": "Five Ways to Get Some Culture on Your Next Cruise", "authors": []}

Instead of defending the regulation in court, the Trump administration has decided, come June, to scrap it to advance its \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d agenda. Although there is nothing official yet, once the regulatory process is completed, the government may stop handing out new authorizations or renewing existing ones when they expire.\n\nRestrictionists assume a zero-sum math for workers: A job gain for a foreigner is a job loss for an American. By that logic every college graduate who enters the job market would be cause for mourning. But that\u2019s backward, given that skilled individuals create, not take away, jobs, and no economy succeeds by shackling qualified people.\n\nThese women are qualified because educated people tend to marry other educated people. The majority of H-4 women have college degrees, according to a 2014 survey by the blogger Rashi Bhatnagar, herself an H-4 visa holder. They also happen to be between the ages of 26 and 35 \u2014 peak productive years. It would be far better for the economy to accommodate their ambitions and turn them into productive, taxpaying individuals.\n\nNot letting them do so is a personal tragedy for them. But it also turns the restrictionist worry that immigrants today prefer to live transnational lives rather than assimilate into a self-fulfilling prophecy. A job is not just income. It is also an assimilation program because it offers an entry into a new culture and a chance to form new friendships.\n\nBecause getting a green card took only a few years when I came, I, like many other spouses in my situation, used that time to obtain a graduate degree and build skills in preparation for entering the job market. However, what would be the point of investing that kind of time and effort in an advanced degree if there is so little certainty that it would actually offer a return one day? Many H-4 wives I know end up staying at home, Skyping with friends and family back home to escape the boredom and isolation of being confined to a \u201cgilded cage\u201d \u2014 their description of their life in America.\n\nI remember feeling an exhilarating world of opportunities open up before me when I got my green card.

The Working Families Party strongly considered Ms. Teachout before reluctantly backing Mr. Cuomo.\n\nThis time around, with Working Families leaders hinting of a Nixon endorsement, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s emissaries struck first. Some of the party\u2019s top members were summoned to a meeting with labor leaders on Friday at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers.\n\nMichael Mulgrew, president of the teachers\u2019 union, said he urged the advocacy groups on Friday to have the Working Families Party remain neutral until after the Democratic primary.\n\nIf the group endorses Ms. Nixon and she loses the Democratic primary to Mr. Cuomo, she could remain on the ballot through November competing for votes, potentially to the benefit of the Republican nominee.\n\n\u201cMy only concern is some reckless behavior that will have an unintended consequence of us ending up with a Republican governor,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said. \u201cWhen these elections are over, we will judge any decision we have to make off your behavior if you caused bad things to happen \u2014 even though it was not your intent you are responsible for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe declined to comment on whether Mr. Cuomo had asked him to defund community groups backing Ms. Nixon, saying he has \u201crequests on all sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to divulge personal conversations,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party, said that he had attended a meeting earlier this week in which the governor had said, \u201cIf unions or anyone give money to any of these groups, they can lose my number.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Lipton added that the groups in question \u2014 Citizen Action, New York Communities for Change and Make the Road Action \u2014 had been critical to efforts to raise minimum wage and criminal justice reform, among others.\n\n\u201cW.F.P. has always fought for the rights of unions and for all working families, and that will never change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur friends in labor are in a tight spot and we respect their decision.\u201d\n\nSome labor leaders disputed Mr. Lipton\u2019s account of the governor\u2019s comment, while Mr. Mulgrew called Mr. Lipton \u201cmisguided and delusional,\u201d likening him to a temperamental child.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

District 1, confirmed their unions\u2019 withdrawal from the Working Families Party, saying in a joint statement that they \u201cfundamentally believe that endorsing Governor Cuomo is the most effective way to put the interest of working families first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latest developments show that the current leadership of the W.F.P. disagrees with that approach, and we have been unable to convince them otherwise,\u201d they said, adding, \u201cWe are not attending tomorrow\u2019s state committee meeting and will be pulling out of the New York State Working Families Party.\u201d\n\nThe pressure in labor ranks comes as the W.F.P. is expected to meet in Albany on Saturday to consider endorsing Ms. Nixon, an educational advocate and actress who is making her first run for public office.\n\n\u201cThis shows Cuomo will do absolutely anything to win except become a progressive,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a top adviser to Ms. Nixon.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo had appeared at a rally with a variety of labor leaders to present himself as their champion, and they as his ardent supporters.\n\n\u201cIt is the union family,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cWhen one of us is in trouble, we\u2019re all in trouble.
