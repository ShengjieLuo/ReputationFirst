As a product manager, you have to own the four P\u2019s of marketing \u2014 product, placement, pricing and promotion. If you own the product, it\u2019s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn\u2019t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods, but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq.\n\nYou joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then?\n\nThere were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done.\n\nWhen I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be gone for three months, and you\u2019ll come back.\u201d He really just didn\u2019t even factor it into his decision making.\n\n\u201cNo more mousy voice.

I had this one woman that worked for me, and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside, and I said: \u201cSpeak up. You are really, really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else, and I can assure you your voice will be heard.\u201d\n\nNext time she had an opinion, she spoke up, and everyone was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d Then she was empowered to do it again and again.\n\nAnd still, some women may face discrimination. What then?\n\nIf you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re getting the opportunities that you should be getting, maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then, of course, if you really feel like you\u2019re not being treated properly, as a person, there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern, to H.R., to legal.\n\nWhen you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group, you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O.

When the boss caught wind of her plans, she was fired. \u201cIt felt like hopelessness,\u201d she said later. \u201cIt felt like this is not going to change. Especially with what\u2019s going on in the media and all the celebrities, and this still happens.\u201d\n\nWomen with wider influence share those anxieties. When Tina Tchen, a lawyer and former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, left the White House, she thought she would quietly restart her legal career focusing on workplace issues. Now she is helping to guide the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, an initiative that sprang up virtually overnight, spearheaded by women in entertainment, and that faces a critical question: whether the more than $20 million donated so far can fund both immediate legal help for low-income workers like Ms. Parra and a longer-term strategy of filing potential landmark cases.\n\nMs. Tchen has also been working with organizations that have faced harassment allegations: the Service Employees International Union, which was particularly embarrassed given its mission of protecting workers; and Pixar Animation, where John Lasseter, perhaps the most revered animator since Walt Disney, recently took a leave of absence.\n\nAcross industries, Ms. Tchen says she sees plenty of resolve for fighting harassment, but a lack of proven mechanisms. \u201cThe tool kit is a little bit bare,\u201d she said, explaining that there is no consensus on how to report a repeat offender who goes from job to job, or address more minor infractions with measures short of suspension or firing.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut among some major corporations, a fear-driven shift has begun: Harassment is now considered not just a legal liability, but also a serious reputational and business risk. Executives and boards are beginning to look at harassment \u201cthe same way you think about other risks to your organization\u201d like security or hacking, said Kaye Foster-Cheek, former head of human resources for Johnson & Johnson and a member of three boards.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell how many workplaces are increasing their efforts. Many do not want to discuss it publicly, for fear of implying that they didn\u2019t do enough in the past. But Microsoft made a bold move in December, eliminating forced confidential arbitration for employees who make sexual harassment claims, saying it didn\u2019t want to pressure those women to stay silent. For the first time, the Screen Actors Guild has introduced a clear code of conduct on harassment, detailing prohibited behavior and vowing to protect members. Facebook recently made public its sexual harassment policy, staking the company to those guidelines. New York University banned romantic relationships between faculty members and undergraduates or anyone over whom they exercise \u201csupervisory authority,\u201d a move that was already under consideration but that passed after the Weinstein allegations. And Seattle enacted new city rules and procedures to ensure respectful behavior on construction sites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor the first time I\u2019m seeing a discussion about, \u2018Even if this behavior doesn\u2019t rise to the level of legal sexual harassment, we won\u2019t tolerate it,\u2019\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president of the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nIn the past, the burden for uncovering misconduct was almost always on victims, but now some companies are assuming a fact-finding role. More are turning to anonymous but detailed employee surveys with questions like \u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d and \u201cHave you experienced harassment?\u201d If workers say yes, the company won\u2019t know the particulars, but it can initiate investigations or increase training.\n\nIn recent months, Katharine Zaleski, an entrepreneur in New York, has been contacted by two powerful institutional investors, Invesco and Cambridge Associates, that were vetting male venture capitalists whom they were considering funding. They wanted to make sure these men had not behaved problematically, she said. (Invesco declined to comment; Cambridge Associates declined to address specifics, but a spokeswoman said in an email, \u201cWe take culture, policies and conduct very seriously when we consider managers for our clients\u2019 investments.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nMore companies are now accepting that \u201ccomplaint and reporting procedures have failed,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, who helped establish the field of sexual harassment training and, as an investor, has helped push through changes at Uber and other companies.\n\nEntrepreneurs are developing new systems for women to report their experiences \u2014 and for businesses to understand what is transpiring. TEQuitable, a platform created by Lisa Gelobter and Heidi Williams, connects workers with real-world support and can send companies anonymized alerts about complaints. Callisto, which is used on campuses to report sexual assaults, is being adapted for workplace use, said Jess Ladd, the founder. Vault, created by Neta Meidav, helps women save evidence and, like Callisto, shows users if others have named the same offender.\n\nMore traditional strategies, like sexual harassment training, are also booming. \u201cI could be booked between now and 10 years from now and still not fulfill the degree of demand,\u201d said Stephen Paskoff, a longtime trainer whose clients include Coca-Cola and Verizon Wireless.\n\nBut the record on workplace harassment training is mixed. California, Connecticut and Maine have required it for years (New York City may soon join them). Those requirements led to a surge in cheap, off-the-shelf training videos and software that could insulate companies from lawsuits, by demonstrating that they had taken measures to prevent harassment, while actually helping perpetuate the problem, because the tutorials were superficial. After harassment allegations surfaced last fall in the Texas Legislature, leaders promised training and then distributed a rote-sounding video and quiz that drew derision.\n\nThe most effective training is expensive, requiring small-group sessions, deep looks at organizational culture and frequent follow-up. But even those who deliver it warn that it is not a complete solution. \u201cDo you think if Harvey Weinstein went to a harassment training class it would have prohibited his behavior?\u201d Mr. Paskoff asked.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd in some cases, the public pressure on companies just means that more quiet financial force is being used. Several employment lawyers say that settlement amounts have been rising. \u201cCases are settling for premium dollars very quickly,\u201d said Debra Katz, a lawyer in Washington, who added that she had settled three cases against chief executives in recent months. Employers are \u201cpaying to avoid the public black eye, being outed as harassers,\u201d she said. (New Jersey and other states are considering bans or limits on secret settlements, setting up what is likely to be a fight between those who argue that the agreements enable harassment by burying the problem and those who stress that they are often a woman\u2019s best recourse.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn industries like food service and cleaning that have typically offered workers fewer protections, the momentum that has picked up in recent months has no clear outlet. Organizers who work with female janitors, fast food workers, hotel housekeepers, nannies and eldercare providers say that women in those fields have become more willing to speak up. But it\u2019s not clear whom they should tell.\n\nEtelbina Hauser, a Honduran immigrant who cleans houses in Seattle, said she felt bolstered by the Hollywood women who spoke out about harassment. \u201cIt makes me feel powerful because I feel like all women are joining together,\u201d she said in Spanish. Two men have exposed themselves to Ms. Hauser while she was cleaning their homes. A third propositioned her for sex. In each case she fled, gave up the job and essentially kept the experience to herself.\n\nSelf-employed workers like Ms. Hauser have no colleagues, no human resources department, no concrete employment policies. \u201cIn many cases no one knows this woman is working there,\u201d said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.\n\nWhen The New York Times asked a number of low-wage employers if they had taken new steps in recent months to prevent harassment, almost none said yes. Some would not comment; others, including Walmart, Target, Sears Holdings, Subway, Costco, Aramark and ABM Industries, said they already had the right policies and procedures in place.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Gender Letter A weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.

Few of the cases that shocked the court of public opinion in recent months would have been likely to prevail in a real court. The law covers only workplaces with 15 or more employees. The federal statute of limitations for filing a suit can be as short as 180 days. Even when a woman wins her case, damages can be capped at $300,000 \u2014 less if she works at a small company. This month, a jury awarded Rosanna Mayo-Coleman, a sugar refinery worker in New York, $13.4 million in a lawsuit against Domino Sugar\u2019s parent company, but because of the cap she is likely to collect only a fraction of that.\n\nCalifornia legislators are working on what activists hope will be a model for the rest of the country: building up state-level protections for victims of sexual harassment to patch the gaps in the federal rules. One proposed state law extends the statute of limitations. Another specifically defines the business roles it addresses: not just \u201cemployer,\u201d but also producer, director, investor. Another would make supervisors personally liable for any retaliation. \u201cThese are wholesale changes in the law; they are new rights,\u201d said Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, an anti-discrimination group helping to push the California bills.\n\nJust this week, Washington State enacted laws to make it easier for women to come forward about harassment, including by prohibiting nondisclosure agreements that prevent them from describing their experiences.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ultimate solution to sexual harassment, many believe, is having more women in positions of power. Until more women are owners, chief executives and bosses, the dynamic may always be the same: a man calling the shots, and a more junior woman afraid to resist or report. (As Time\u2019s Up grows, this will be its central focus, a leader of the group said; offshoots in advertising and journalism have been announced, and others in sports, technology and venture capital are forming.)\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Renee LaChance, a general contractor in Portland, Ore., was discussing a renovation with a male electrician when he unleashed a stream of explicit comments about her breasts.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention?\u201d she asked him, flabbergasted that all the recent news about harassment had not deterred him.\n\nHer solution was simple. \u201cI\u2019m the person in power in the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI fired him on the spot.\u201d", "title": "#MeToo Called for an Overhaul.

But what if I\u2019ve been looking for the wrong thing? What if the crux of the moment \u2014 really since 2008 \u2014 is a matter of selfhood and representation and political correctives? This isn\u2019t shocking. But it is worth noting.\n\nIn almost any other year, \u201cDunkirk\u201d or \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d or \u201cThe Post\u201d would have been slam-dunk best picture winners. These are movies by white men starring mostly most white men (and Meryl Streep), and they fell out of a lot of the serious forecasts for the major categories despite, in at least the cases of \u201cDunkirk\u201d and \u201cThe Post,\u201d being nearly perfectly made. The energies were around \u201cGet Out\u201c and \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d two very different films about America right now. (Although with \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d I should say \u201cabout America.\u201d)\n\nDARGIS I\u2019ve started to think that the academy members are trying to correct their own industry\u2019s flaws by voting for movies that don\u2019t fit the old ideas about best picture. Some of these recent wins surely reflect the increased diversity of the membership, but some of this may also be an earnest self-conscious corrective.\n\nAs to the underbelly that Tony mentioned \u2014 we caught a flash of it every so often. We saw it most directly when Ms. Sciorra \u2014 her voice at times faltering \u2014 addressed the room while she helped present what was termed new (activist, change-minded) voices. \u201cHi, it\u2019s nice to see you all again, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d She was warmly greeted \u2014 someone yelled, \u201cLove you!\u201d \u2014 and the applause sounded sincere, at least on my TV. At the same time, how many in that very same room, even some who were applauding, have been complicit in all the ugliness that continues to be exhumed? And I don\u2019t mean only those who did business with Mr. Weinstein while knowing or at least guessing the truth about him.\n\nI mean everyone else in that room who has never hired a woman to do anything except look beautiful or prop up the male hero, everyone who never casts Asians or Latinos or African-Americans except as tokens even while (occasionally) publicly fawning over their famous black best friends? I\u2019m very hopeful about some of the righteous activism that has emerged in the wake of the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, and it was a relief not to see him last night. But of course he\u2019s just part of the industry\u2019s larger, systemic problems. And, as we\u2019ve discussed before (repeatedly!), the Oscars are not the movie industry. They are simply its public dolled-up face.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

That\u2019s where the action is, where the money is, where the power is.\n\nSCOTT Those shareholders will be basking in the afterglow of \u2014 and cashing dividend checks fattened by \u2014 \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d \u201cCoco\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d and possibly also \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Those movies show diversity taking hold at the tentpole level, which is the strongest evidence that it\u2019s a matter of economic calculation as well as social consciousness. And why shouldn\u2019t it be? White men have held a near-monopoly on movie storytelling for the last 90 years, and as Kumail Nanjiani suggested on Sunday night, there\u2019s nothing threatening about everyone else getting a turn.\n\nBut there\u2019s never progress without backlash, so we can expect a certain amount of grumbling about Hollywood liberals and social justice warriors, and about how a white man just can\u2019t catch a break anymore. And nothing is easier than pointing out the hypocrisy of the entertainment industry. Except maybe remarking on how long and boring the Oscar broadcast is. A lot of good movies were recognized, though, including a bunch that might have seemed too small, too genre or too niche in past years. I wish \u201cLady Bird\u201d had gotten something, that \u201cGet Out\u201d had gotten more and that \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d had been more of a presence. Still, I\u2019m not mad that \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d won, and kind of astonished that it almost looks like the safe, mainstream choice for best picture.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMORRIS Yes, Tony, it feels meaningful that the best picture winner wasn\u2019t about World War II or journalism (during the Vietnam War!) but about a woman whose soul mate and lover is an amphibian and that it was made by a Mexican man. I don\u2019t think \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is a great movie. But I do like it. And I don\u2019t know how it won, but somehow it did. And, after \u201cMoonlight\u201d last year (ultimately, a love story between two black men), that feels like a rejection and an embrace.\n\nDARGIS Oh, I wish many things, including that another movie had won best picture and other performers had carted off the best supporting statuettes. Guillermo del Toro seems like a nice man. And both Sam Rockwell and Allison Janney are exceptionally fine actors. I\u2019m looking forward to whatever all three do next. (I\u2019ll just pretend Mr. Rockwell won for \u201cMoon\u201d and Ms. Janney won for anything but \u201cI, Tonya.\u201d) Honestly, other than the sight of all those great women last night, I am most pleased that \u201cThree Billboards\u201d didn\u2019t win best picture or anything else, really. The love for it is baffling, though it does suggest that \u2014 with the lack of love for \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d \u2014 class is the industry\u2019s biggest blind spot.\n\nI look forward to tweeting next year that Raoul Peck\u2019s \u201cThe Young Karl Marx\u201d was robbed.", "title": "#MeToo, Harvey Weinstein and Awkward TV: Our Critics Talk Oscars", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "A.O.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Let\u2019s look at an example, 49A: \u201c\u2018I need everyone\u2019s help!\u2019\u201d. If you\u2019re on a ship, or even just in an office where people try to sound dramatic, this is a call for ALL HANDS ON DECK. But this answer doesn\u2019t fit; you need to enter ALL H + S ON DECK, and the H + S (or HANDS, or HS) needs to squeeze into the fourth square across.\n\nMeanwhile, at 31D, you\u2019ve got a six-letter word for \u201cReddish-purple.\u201d I couldn\u2019t find any colors that fit, and the strange \u201cH+S\u201d at the fourth spot is an indication for the color FUCHSIA.\n\nA few of the across-themed clues are nostalgic but not terribly obscure (one was an excellent debut and one-off, A FISH CALLED WANDA), and Mr. Ezersky nonchalantly pulls references from the 1730s and the 1970s, among other eras. I suppose when one is the age of Mr. Ezersky everything that\u2019s not on Snapchat counts as nostalgia. As is mentioned in his notes, today marks the first Ezersky Sunday puzzle, which means he\u2019s now constructed grids for all seven days, surely the first of many, many times he will \u201chit for the cycle.\u201d Mr. Ezersky, please stay away from steroids, as we\u2019d hate to have to put an asterisk next to your name in the 2050 record books.\n\nTricky Clues\n\n22A: This is a new clue for an age-old entry, AVE MARIA. It\u2019s often nice to be reminded of wonderful things from the past, in this case \u201cFantasia.\u201d There\u2019s an interesting history to this movie; it had an enormous creative army behind it and the first stereophonic movie soundtrack, but it was initially such a failure that it nearly drove Disney out of business.\n\nNowadays, even though it feels like we are inundated with streaming content, I wonder how someone would watch a movie like this, unless they still had a DVD or VHS player and could either buy a recording or rent it from their library. Disney is planning a streaming service in a year but it\u2019s a good example of an incontrovertible classic that isn\u2019t at our fingertips.\n\n32A: Not sure if this tripped people up, but a cute variety of misdirection. What do you hope people have when they leave? If I\u2019m the people, then it\u2019s a) keys, b) wallet with MetroCard, c) laptop for work, d) phone, e) headphones and f) head, which I would forget if it weren\u2019t screwed on. Here, though, it\u2019s NICE DAY, which is a nice thing to say to someone when you\u2019re parting ways (nicer than \u201chave a nice life!\u201d \u2014 which has unpleasant undertones).\n\n56A: Any cereal I was given as a child came with fiber and umlauts, but no toys. Any freebie from one of the boxes I got would have been either educational or utilitarian; conservation flash cards or carrot seeds, maybe. Not till today did I realize the toys and the cereal could be a TIE-IN to something else, like a movie or a TV show. I didn\u2019t even get to go down that aisle; we stayed on the supermarket perimeter and now I have no shut-off valve and lose it to an embarrassing degree when exposed to sweets (see 23A, although I\u2019m certainly not a kid).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n108A: This clue sent me to my mental spice drawer, as that\u2019s what I initially thought of as \u201cused in a pinch.\u201d That was wrong, but even though I had heard the term \u201cpinch of snuff\u201d many times, for some weird reason I\u2019d always thought that snuff was opium. I imagined the founding fathers inhaling ample amounts of opium while they devised our nation\u2019s blueprint, and for some reason a spittoon was involved. Not true! Snuff is just TOBACCO. In my highbrow research endeavors I uncovered a really cute fable about a \u201cpinch of snuff,\u201d if you feel like reading a mash-up of O. Henry and Judaica.\n\n120A: A mass\u00e9 is a trick shot in pool, from the Old French for sledgehammer. The move is more delicate than you\u2019d think, given that fact; it\u2019s also known as a SPIN SHOT. I suppose that not all spin shots are mass\u00e9s, but I think all mass\u00e9s are spin shots, since the spin is what lets the ball move so precisely. On another note, if any one of you happens to watch the below video and become a professional pool player because of it, please let the Wordplay team know, so that we can provide you with a snazzy sponsorship patch for your vest.\n\n41D: \u201cReaches\u201d seemed to be a good entry here for \u201cMakes a connection,\u201d meaning a meeting of the minds between two people. The meaning implied by the right answer, LIAISES, is a little bit different, indicating the use of a go-between or some form of collaboration. This is a useful puzzle entry with all those vowels, I\u2019m sure.\n\n51D: Unless you knew TV-MA was the entry at 61A (a red herring for me for a while, since the numbers in the title of this puzzle led me to \u201cNC-17\u201d), then LEMMESEE might have been a tough one to figure out here. It\u2019s a debut; the stodgier \u201cLet me see\u201d appears pretty often.\n\n95D: Back in the clackety 20th century we would create TABSETS to format manuscripts and letters, typed on a manual or electric typewriter. They still exist in word programs, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re referred to often; you could also use the term for the dozens of tabbed pages you have open in a browser after you look online at, well, anything these days.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nNo April fooling; one week after my A.C.P.T. playoff puzzle, I actually have a Sunday publication in The Times! This achievement has eluded me for years, so I\u2019m super stoked to finally \u201chit for the cycle\u201d on being published throughout the week. Funny enough, I originally built the 15 X 16 grid here, intending the puzzle for a Thursday. I didn\u2019t want a single rebus-ized letter to be repeated anywhere else, and figured the special squares should always appear at the ends of answers. My only hitch was whether or not the last example, THERE\u2019S NOT A LOT I CAN DO, was an unfair inconsistency or a fun final twist. When I showed it all to Joel on a subway ride, he not only thought the former was true, but that my other restrictions were unnecessary. He wondered if the idea would be best in Sunday form altogether, and it took me maybe a half-second to excitedly agree. If I may say, I\u2019m super thrilled with how this thing turned out. These theme answers seem like a fun set in themselves, and I\u2019m glad to have worked in four sets of triple-stacked 8s as well as fun bonuses in YEAH MAN, BAR SOAP and NICE DAY. The clues for TOBACCO and OLES feel like some of my best work, and even the angles for OMAN, ALABAMA and AVE MARIA have a fresh feel. Did anyone catch the \u201cIt\u2019s lit\u201d and \u201cTotally, bro\u201d one-two punch? That was \u2014 *sigh* \u2014 very intentional. Curious to see how people feel about RIGHT FIT. I could\u2019ve easily made this RIGHTFUL, but I thought the former was an interesting, lexical phrase. You hope that a new setting is the right fit for someone, no? Or, as I clued it, that your clothing has the right fit on you? Two certain people that I work with closely seem to feel otherwise \u2026 so I guess I should brace myself for an earful in the comments :) Happy solving, and may this puzzle not fool you as much as yesterday\u2019s early surprise!\n\nThe Sunday Sherpa\n\nDoes something still not compute?

Sunstein\u2019s topic has obvious contemporary resonance, as Andrew Sullivan notes in his review, and though this short book does not take up the Trump presidency directly it does tease out \u201cvarious hypotheticals with some similarities to our current concerns,\u201d concluding that \u201ceach of these is an impeachable offense.\u201d Yet Sunstein also cautions that the Constitution was written to ensure that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. \u201cThis is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times,\u201d Sullivan writes, \u201cand never actually pursued to conviction.\u201d\n\nTHE TEMPTATION OF FORGIVENESS, by Donna Leon.

This latest novel from the two-time Booker Prize-winning author of \u201cTrue History of the Kelly Gang\u201d and \u201cOscar and Lucinda\u201d follows a married couple and their bachelor neighbor on a bumptious 10,000-mile auto race in 1950s Australia, grappling along the way with the country\u2019s historical treatment of its Aboriginal population. \u201cWith all its inventive momentum, all its pleasurable beats, the fast pace of the race, the scenery unfurling, the novel ends up far from where it started, in a place of historical reckoning and colonial guilt,\u201d Craig Taylor writes in his review. \u201cCarey\u2019s longtime readers will appreciate his arrival here. \u2026 Using a wild road race, he\u2019s found a journey into Australia\u2019s broken past.\u201d\n\nMY FATHER\u2019S WAKE: How the Irish Teach Us How to Live, Love and Die, by Kevin Toolis. (Da Capo, $26.) The hospital death of Toolis\u2019s brother, followed by his father\u2019s death in small-town Ireland, led him to examine death rituals around the world. The Irish wake, he concludes, is \u201cthe best guide to life you could ever have.\u201d In her review, Ann Neumann says that the author\u2019s \u201cfine skill at showing the means and aftermath of death\u201d most animates the book: \u201cToolis\u2019s writing is so visceral and profound when he is near dying bodies that the lessons of such experiences become evident.\u201d\n\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD, by Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Edith Grossman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Written telenova-style, with chapters alternating among various characters, the Nobel laureate Vargas Llosa\u2019s new novel is an edgy sendup of life in Peru before the downfall of Alberto Fujimori. Wealthy friends find themselves in a difficult situation when one is blackmailed by a tabloid editor and the other, a lawyer, tries to help. \u201cIn a diseased body politic \u2026 no one is exempt from infection, and the sanity of every citizen is dependent upon that of his neighbor,\u201d Michael Greenberg writes in his review, speculating that \u201cthe book\u2019s \u2018happy\u2019 ending reflects its author\u2019s belief, perhaps, in the power of individual morality and will.\u201d\n\nVICTORIANS UNDONE: Tales of the Flesh in the Age of Decorum, by Kathryn Hughes. (Johns Hopkins University, $29.95.) Hughes\u2019s detailed account of five notable 19th-century body parts topples great figures from their pedestals. From baby bumps to facial hair, the book asks what we can learn about a culture by studying the human bodies it produces. \u201cWhile microhistorians have long zoomed in on individual case studies, Hughes pinpoints her subjects even more narrowly,\u201d our reviewer, Leah Price, writes. \u201cHer ultimate question, though, is a broad one: How did the Victorians understand the interplay between mind and body?\u201d\n\nTHE WHICH WAY TREE, by Elizabeth Crook. (Little, Brown, $26.) Crook\u2019s western-inflected novel follows a pair of siblings on their hunt for the wild panther that upended their lives. The teenage narrator \u201cunspools his tale of Civil War-era Texas in a first-person voice that is utterly convincing, consistent and believable,\u201d Paulette Jiles says, in a review that finds echoes of \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d in the siblings\u2019 quest. (\u201cThink Ahab in the Texas Hill Country.\u201d) The book\u2019s voice, Jiles adds, \u201cswings between the rhythms of the Southern hills and the lofty, elevated tone encountered in Twain and contemporary westerns (which ultimately comes from an acquaintance with the King James Bible).\u201d", "title": "10 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Igor Stravinsky commented that he \u201cwas struck by the way in which the extraordinary qualities of this pianism had directed the thought of Debussy the composer.\u201d Debussy\u2019s discovery of new sounds at the piano is directly related to the physiology of hands on keyboard. It is impossible to conceive of most of Debussy\u2019s piano music being written at a desk, or outdoors, despite his frequent use of \u201cen plein air\u201d titles.\n\nA Pianist\u2019s Favorite Debussy Recordings\n\nNo, this is music made as molded by playing, as dough is folded with yeast to create bread. As the fingers reach the keys, sound and touch seem to fuse into one. The keyboard has ceased to be a mere function for hammers to strike strings, and has become a precious horizontal artifact to caress. This is music of the piano as much as for the piano. The poet L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue, having watched Debussy play, wrote that he \u201cwould start by brushing the keys, prodding the odd one here and there, making a pass over them and then he would sink into velvet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave the impression of delivering the piano of its song,\u201d Fargue added, \u201clike a mother of her child.\u201d\n\nDebussy\u2019s piano music is perfectly conceived for the instrument. But it isn\u2019t just that it fits beautifully under the hand or sounds wonderful as the vibrations leave the soundboard and enter the ear. To play the opening of \u201cReflets dans l\u2019Eau\u201d (from \u201cImages,\u201d Book One) feels as if the composer has transplanted his fingerprints onto the pads of your digits. The way the chords are placed on the keys (flat-fingered on the black notes) is not so much a vision of reflections, whether trees, clouds or water lilies. It is as if each three-padded triad is an actual laying of a flower onto the water\u2019s surface.\n\nLater in the piece, as the waters become more agitated, the cascading arpeggios are like liquid running through the fingers, all shimmer and sparkle. In \u201cPoissons d\u2019Or\u201d (from \u201cImages,\u201d Book Two), the opening motive, a darting duplet of double thirds, is like trying to catch a fish\u2019s flip as it slips out of the finger\u2019s grasp. And in the central section, the slinky tune slithers with grace notes as the hand has to slide off the key as if off the scales of a freshly caught trout. In the first piece of this set, \u201cCloches \u00e0 Travers les Feuilles,\u201d the fingers are required to tap the keys (pedal held down, fingers pulled up) as if mallets against a bell.\n\nNo other composer feels to me more improvised, more free-flowing. But then the player is conscious of a contradiction as the score is studied more closely: Music that sounds created in the moment is loaded with instructions on how to achieve this. The first measure of \u201cCloches \u00e0 Travers les Feuilles\u201d is marked pianissimo and contains just eight notes, each of which carries a staccato dot. But the first is also coupled with a strong-accented whole note; the fifth has an additional dash; all the notes are covered with a slur; and, if that were not enough, Debussy instructs the pianist to play \u201cdoucement sonore\u201d (\u201csweetly resonant\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis suite \u201cChildren\u2019s Corner\u201d may be like so many toys in his daughter\u2019s nursery, but the workmanship behind every join and seam is of the highest fastidiousness. All of his pieces sound spontaneous, but every stitch (every dot, dash, hairpin or slur) is specific. This is not mood music, pretty sounds assembled at a dilettante\u2019s whim. Behind the bells and the water and all the poetic imagery is an abstract musical mind of the utmost intellectual rigor \u2014 an architect of genius, despite the small scale of the buildings.\n\nIf most of his piano music has a feel of improvisation about it, the two books of \u201cPr\u00e9ludes\u201d celebrate this in a special way. Until well into the 20th century, a pianist would rarely begin to play a piece cold. A few chords, an arpeggio or two, served as a warm-up as well as allowing the audience to settle down. This was known as \u201cpreluding,\u201d and Liszt spoke of it as a technique to be learned by any aspiring pianist. Debussy\u2019s \u201cPr\u00e9ludes\u201d are perfectly crafted jewels, conveying more in their few minutes\u2019 duration than many an opera, yet they can also seem as intangible as mist \u2014 with titles, tacked on with ellipses at the end of each piece, like mere trails of perfume in the air.\n\nPhoto\n\nDebussy began piano lessons at the age of 7 in Cannes as an evacuee from Paris at the start of the Franco-Prussian War, and he died during the final year of World War I, unable to have a public funeral because of the aerial bombing of the French capital. The circumstances of his life, framed by his country\u2019s enmity with Germany, seem an apt symbol for his music\u2019s rejection of a kind of German aesthetic.\n\nHis instinct to steer clear of classical structures; his elevation and celebration of small, ephemeral forms; and his delight in the atmosphere of beautiful chords for their own sake, with no desire to find a specific function for them, was an audacious challenge to some more self-consciously serious German intellectual fashions of the time. Indeed, the \u201cGolliwog\u2019s Cakewalk\u201d (from \u201cChildren\u2019s Corner\u201d) is a direct hit, with its cheerful celebration of popular culture and the cheeky quote from Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde,\u201d followed by the minstrel\u2019s scoffing sniggers.\n\nWhen assessing a composer\u2019s place in history, there\u2019s always the question as to whether he or she leans backward or forward. But despite the opinion of Elliott Carter that Debussy \u201csettled the technical direction of contemporary music,\u201d and despite the impossibility of the existence of the piano music of modernists such as Messiaen or Ligeti without him, I think the secret to playing Debussy\u2019s music lies in its Chopinist roots \u2014 he edited the Polish composer\u2019s works for Durand \u2014 and in his ties to his older, old-fashioned compatriots Massenet, Delibes and others.\n\nHe may have stretched harmony and form into new shapes, but it seems to me that it is in a Parisian cafe, a Gauloise in hand and coffee at his side, that we glimpse something essential about the spirit of Debussy. For all his sophistication, he could never resist the lilt and leer of a corny cabaret song \u2014 not just overtly, like in \u201cLa Plus que Lente\u201d (1910), but tucked away inside more experimental pieces such as \u201cLes Collines d\u2019Anacapri,\u201d \u201cReflets dans l\u2019Eau,\u201d and \u201cPoissons d\u2019Or.\u201d He never left behind completely the romantic sentimentality of early piano pieces like \u201cClair de Lune\u201d and the \u201cDeux Arabesques.\u201d\n\nAlthough his taste for popular styles found expression in ragtime takeoffs such as \u201cMinstrels\u201d and the \u201cGolliwog\u2019s Cakewalk,\u201d it was his more serious music that later had an immense influence on jazz composers like Gershwin, Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett and Fred Hersch. And not just because of a shared sense of improvisation: The repeated patterns, the piling up of sonorities and the way Debussy would crack open a chord, finding creativity in the very color of its vibrations, found its way into their very DNA.\n\nAnd if the ghost of this Parisian ended up haunting every American jazz bar, it also found its way east, too. Debussy may have discovered his own pianistic voice after hearing the gamelan, but by the end of the 20th century the inspiration had reversed direction and his impact on Asian piano music is incalculable. Toro Takemitsu, American Minimalists and New Age Muzak \u2014 they all owe Debussy virtual royalties.

That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.\n\n\u2014\n\nMichael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection\n\n\u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nOnce upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.\n\n\u2018Caddyshack\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures\n\n\u2018Cool Runnings\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nJohn Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central\n\n\u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\n\u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nKazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.\n\n\u2014\n\nMorgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection\n\n\u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nRemoving this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.\n\n\u2014\n\nDavid Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures\n\n\u2018The Prestige\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 21\n\nApril 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBetween his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.\n\n\u2014\n\nBanksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures\n\n\u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 22\n\nApril 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.\n\n\u2014\n\nMark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company\n\n\u2018Begin Again\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: April 27\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.\n\n\u2014", "title": "11 Great Titles Expiring From Netflix in April", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

Two friends, Pickle and Belly Button, spend their nights in compulsive voyeurism, watching and listening to dashcam recordings of Pickle\u2019s boss, a big shot named Kevin, as he drives around in his Mercedes looking for (and sometimes having) sex with a series of women. Pickle and Belly Button are envious, aroused and appalled by the amorality of the rich, and the viewer is at once dismayed by the cruelty of this society and seduced by Mr. Huang\u2019s smooth and witty style. (A.O.S.)\n\n\u2018The Guilty\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nThe most commercial movie playing in the festival\u2019s first week, this tight, showy thriller gives it a much welcome blast of genre filmmaking. Seated in an arid Danish call center and flanked by colleagues he barely speaks with, a cop named Asger (Jakob Cedergren) is having what is clearly another bad day among many. He\u2019s tethered to a phone in a harshly lit room, fielding calls from a citizenry he scarcely tolerates. His bad attitude rapidly shifts when he takes a call from a frantic woman, who says she\u2019s been kidnapped, setting off a classic race-against-the-clock rescue. The director Gustav M\u00f6ller doesn\u2019t dig deep, but he skims the surface with entertaining wit and finesse. (M.D.)\n\n\u2018Hale County This Morning, This Evening\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nThe closing-night film of the festival poses a quietly radical challenge to assumptions about race, class and the aesthetics of filmmaking. The director, RaMell Ross (also credited as writer, producer, editor, cinematographer and sound recorder), chronicles several years in the lives of two young African-American men and their families. Mr. Ross focuses on work, school, parenthood and other ordinary experiences, but his method is the opposite of prosaic. He glimpses arresting, at times almost hallucinatory beauty in the rural Alabama landscape, and finds nuances of emotion that grow in intensity over 75 heady minutes. The movie is framed by a bluntly political question \u2014 as the film\u2019s website puts it, \u201cHow does one express the reality of individuals whose public image, lives and humanity originate in exploitation?\u201d \u2014 that yields pure cinematic poetry. (A.O.S.)\n\n\u2018The Nothing Factory\u2019 and \u2018Djon \u00c1frica\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent years, Portugal has emerged as a laboratory for cinematic experimentation, yielding fascinating and ambitious hybrids of documentary and fiction that tackle the country\u2019s colonial legacy, its cultural traditions, the state of its working class and much more. \u201cThe Nothing Factory,\u201d an astonishing film by Pedro Pinho, extends this tradition. It\u2019s an almost clinical study of working conditions and labor discontent, set at an elevator factory whose employees are in conflict with management. It\u2019s also a musical. Mr. Pinho, shooting in 16-millimeter film, fuses nostalgia with a militant sense of novelty.\n\nJo\u00e3o Miller Guerra and Filipa Reis\u2019s \u201cDjon \u00c1frica,\u201d which was written by Mr. Pinho, achieves a different kind of fusion. A road movie (involving a quest for a lost father) that passes through the thickets of Portugal\u2019s imperialist past and present-day Cape Verde, it mixes longing with exuberance, and finds an anarchic sense of possibility in a world of pain and injustice. (A.O.S.)\n\n\u2018Our House\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nThe conceit suggests a horror movie. A house in a small town on Japan\u2019s coast has two sets of occupants \u2014 a single mother and her adolescent daughter; a single woman and a stranger afflicted with amnesia \u2014 who are unaware of each other\u2019s existence. Are they ghosts? Inhabitants of different dimensions? It\u2019s never made clear, and while the film, the feature debut of Yui Kiyohara, is haunting, it\u2019s more disquieting than terrifying. Its texture is delicately emotional and boldly, eccentrically philosophical. How do we recognize the reality of other people? How can we be sure that we ourselves are real? (A.O.S.)\n\n\u2018Scary Mother\u2019\n\nLess scary than driven and dyspeptically funny, the title character of this mordant comedy is on a mission. It takes a while to figure out what that is, though clues are scribbled in pen across Manana\u2019s arm and etched into her feverish face. She\u2019s writing a novel, a labor of (perhaps) love that her editor, a humble stationery store owner, believes is a masterpiece. Whether both writer and editor are fantasists or not, the novel has become their shared passion and her life\u2019s blood. It sustains Manana even as her loving if unsupportive husband and children conspire against her literary ambitions (especially after they discover her subject). With her terrific star, Nato Murvanidze, the Georgian director Ana Urushadze opens up one woman\u2019s life with dark laughter, great feeling and truth.

Women in science: \u201cA Lab of One\u2019s Own,\u201d by Patricia Fara. Women in business: \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d by Joanne Lipman. Women in television: both \u201cJust the Funny Parts,\u201d by the comedy writer Nell Scovell, and \u201cStealing the Show,\u201d by the TV reporter Joy Press, who has just signed on as a Vanity Fair correspondent. (Yes, her book discusses \u201cRoseanne,\u201d and much else besides.) There\u2019s also a novel and a story collection, a book of essays about being black and female in white male society, and a graphic novelist\u2019s celebration of rebellious women in history. Changing course \u2014 you\u2019ll get the bad joke in a second \u2014 we also recommend a new translation of the Bhagavad Gita, a deeply reported profile of a Chinese immigrant to New York City and a biography of Tiger Woods. I warned you \u201cchanging course\u201d was bad.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nTIGER WOODS, by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian. (Simon & Schuster, $30.) There have been many books about Tiger Woods, but this new biography by Benedict and Keteyian \u2014 which arrives just as the golfer is rounding into form again on the course \u2014 draws on previous sources and new interviews with more than 250 people to bring grainy new detail to almost every aspect of Woods\u2019s life. \u201cIt\u2019s a confident and substantial book that\u2019s nearly as sleek as a Christopher Nolan movie. It makes a sweet sound, like a well-struck golf ball,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \u201cI found it exhilarating, depressing, tawdry and moving in almost equal measure. It\u2019s a big American story that rolls across barbered lawns and then leaves you stranded in some all-night Sam\u2019s Club of the soul.\u201d\n\nGODSONG: A Verse Translation of the Bhagavad Gita, With Commentary, by Amit Majmudar. (Knopf, $25.) \u201cGodsong\u201d is the poet Amit Majmudar\u2019s translation of the Bhagavad Gita, the enigmatic religious text composed between 400 B.C. and A.D. 200. Majmudar, who is a radiologist as well as a writer, embarked on a crash course in Sanskrit to write it. \u201cEach word became its own research project, the radiologist turned translator peering past the surface of language in search of the inner workings of the text,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cThe translation is ravishing and faithful, marked by what Nabokov once called \u2018the precision of a poet and the imagination of a scientist.\u2019\u201d\n\nPATRIOT NUMBER ONE: American Dreams in Chinatown, by Lauren Hilgers. (Crown, $27.) Hilgers, a New York-based journalist who lived in Shanghai for six years, has written a rich and absorbing profile of a Chinese activist and immigrant named Zhuang Liehong. In addition to being a character study of Zhuang, our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, the book also serves as \u201can indelible portrait of his wife and their marriage; a canny depiction of Flushing, Queens; a lucid anatomy of Chinese politics and America\u2019s immigration system. Such a comprehensive project could have easily sprawled across a book twice as long, but \u2018Patriot Number One\u2019 stays close to the people it follows, in a narrative as evocative and engrossing as a novel.\u201d", "title": "12 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

There\u2019s something oddly potent about Mr. Burnett\u2019s tenor saxophone sound, a tightly channeled and searing thing that cuts a trench in your mind without giving you a whole lot of graspable melodic information. Is he completely in control of this strange sonic language, or is the instrument having its way with him? Mr. Burnett will present \u201cNew Spectrums in Electronic Acoustics,\u201d a suite in which he will augment his saxophone with a range of electronic effects and processors. The work is meant as an interrogation into the relationship between ubiquitous technology, financial capital and human experience. His band, Big Machine, includes Carlos Homs on piano, Nick Jozwiak on bass and Kush Abadey on drums.\n\n917-267-0368, roulette.org\n\nKURT ELLING at Birdland (March 14-17, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). With his earnest and elastic baritone, Mr. Elling is among the most highly regarded jazz crooners of the past quarter century. He\u2019s about to release \u201cThe Questions,\u201d a literary-minded album that collects songs from across the American canon. At various moments in the recording, Mr. Elling grafts the poetry of Rumi or Sara Teasdale onto modern jazz melodies by the likes of Carla Bley and Jaco Pastorius. He celebrates the album\u2019s release with a four-night run featuring Marquis Hill on trumpet, Stu Mindeman on piano and Hammond B3, John McLean on guitar, Clark Sommers on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums.\n\n212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com\n\nLEDISI PRESENTS \u2018NINA AND ME\u2019 at the Apollo Theater (March 9, 8 p.m.). On her latest album, \u201cLet Love Rule,\u201d the vocalist Ledisi refuses to sit still. She moves from snakily grooving songs of uplift to romantic entreaties to reggae-tinged protest anthems. Altogether, the album seems to suggest a liberated neo-soul concept, constantly reimagining what a groove can feel like and how a voice can be woven into an ensemble sound. In the depth of her convictions and the proud intimacy of her reveal, Ledisi has some things in common with Nina Simone. At this concert, she will perform classics from Simone\u2019s repertoire, as well as her own tunes. Her strong backing band includes the esteemed pianist and vocalist Patrice Rushen.\n\n212-531-5305, apollotheater.org\n\nARTURO O\u2019FARRILL QUINTET at Minton\u2019s Playhouse (March 15, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The pianist Mr. O\u2019Farrill is an irrepressible synthesizer and a conceptual long-distance runner. With his Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, he presents original works that tangle up Cuban folklore with modernism and experimental jazz. With smaller ensembles, his commanding pianism \u2014 equal parts Thelonious Monk, Chucho Vald\u00e9s and Bill Evans \u2014 bursts to the fore. This concert is part of the Minton\u2019s Jazz Legends Series, celebrating the 80th anniversary of the landmark club\u2019s founding.\n\n212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com\n\n\u2018UPTOWN NIGHTS: MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENTS\u2019 at Harlem Stage (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). When his career was first taking flight, Marc Cary spent roughly a dozen years as the pianist in Abbey Lincoln\u2019s band, internalizing the musical philosophy, poetics and loose rhythmic phrasing of that venerated vocalist and composer. Now almost 50, Mr. Cary has recently been embracing his own role as a mentor to some of New York\u2019s brightest young improvisers. Here, he presents a reimagining of \u201cWe Insist! The Freedom Now Suite,\u201d which Ms. Lincoln recorded in 1960 with the drummer Max Roach. Mr. Cary\u2019s excellent band includes the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and the bassist Reggie Workman.

These three expert musicians all boast a lightness of touch and a keen sense of suspenseful development. Mr. Hersch, a pianist, has played separately with the bassist Mr. Gress and the drummer Mr. Hart, but they haven\u2019t performed as a trio in more than a decade. This week provides a chance to hear three elder musicians whose creative drive remains undiminished, exploring a fresh scenario.\n\n212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com\n\nMIMI JONES at Lehman College (March 3, 7:30 p.m.). Ms. Jones vests her bass with hearty power; she often sings as well, adding a spirit of gentle reassurance. She\u2019s an ambitious composer, too, writing music that mingles jazz with funk, rock and American folk influences. Here she presents \u201cThe Black Madonna,\u201d a new series of compositions inspired by images of an African Mary. Her band includes Leonor Falcon on viola, Nir Felder on guitar and Darrian Douglas on drums.\n\n718-601-7399, bronxartsensemble.org\n\nCHARLES MCPHERSON at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola (through March 4, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). In the 1960s, after the alto saxophonist Eric Dolphy departed from Charles Mingus\u2019s band, Mr. McPherson stepped in. He stayed with Mingus through the mid-1970s, and his ardent, chirruping attack \u2014 heavily influenced by Charlie Parker and Sonny Stitt \u2014 became a defining component of the ensemble. In the years since, Mr. McPherson has hardly strayed from the path of bebop conservationism. He will perform in a stalwart quintet with the guitarist Yotam Silberstein, the pianist Jeb Patton, the bassist Todd Coolman and the drummer Jonathan Blake.\n\n212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys\n\nBOBBY PREVITE at Roulette (March 2, 8 p.m.). Mr. Previte, a drummer, composed \u201cRhapsody\u201d \u2014 a long-form suite, designed for an unorthodox instrumentation \u2014 with migration and intermingling in mind. The work, which bears the subtitle \u201cTerminals Part II: In Transit,\u201d unfolds with dizzying intensity and convulsing complexity, often employing abstraction to evoke the dislocation of travel. Mr. Previte just released the music on CD, MP3 and vinyl, and he performs it here with four of the five musicians who appear on the album. It\u2019s a stalwart crew: the vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Jen Shyu, the guitarist Nels Cline, the pianist John Medeski and the harpist Zeena Parkins.\n\n917-267-0368, roulette.org\n\nMIGUEL ZEN\u00d3N at Hunter College (March 3, 8 p.m.). Mr. Zen\u00f3n, an acclaimed alto saxophonist and a MacArthur fellow, presents \u201cEn Pie de Lucha,\u201d a new work dedicated to the struggle for self-determination in his homeland of Puerto Rico. He will play the lush, marching, almost bellicose piece in a concert benefiting victims of Hurricane Maria. Mr. Zen\u00f3n will be joined by a 23-piece iteration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Festival Jazz Ensemble, led by the conductor Fred Harris; the orchestra was planning to perform the work during a tour of Puerto Rico in January but had to postpone because of damage wrought by the storm.\n\n212-772-5020, music.hunter.cuny.edu\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\n\nTimes Talks\n\nBEN HARPER AND CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE at the Times Center (March 5, 7 p.m.).

On Friday, the guitarist, an eminence on New York\u2019s greater improvised music scene, releases \u201cMusic Is,\u201d his first solo album in almost 20 years. Mr. Frisell has exerted his influence gently, funneling inspiration from 1960s folk rock and 1970s free jazz into a sound that\u2019s hearthlike and imperturbable, whether spinning through reverb-drenched runs or caressing its way through a slow, major-chord progression. This weekend he\u2019s at the Village Vanguard with his trio, featuring the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Rudy Royston. He takes a break on Monday, then returns for six more nights with the violist Eyvind Kang joining the group.\n\n212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com\n\nHAROLD MABERN QUARTET at Smoke (March 16-18; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). With a crisp, harmonically rich attack, Mr. Mabern carries the mantle of a piano tradition that runs through Ahmad Jamal and Phineas Newborn Jr. From time to time, Mr. Mabern holds court for a weekend at Smoke, presenting his grooving, varnished brand of hard bop with a small group. This weekend is of particular note, as it is Mr. Mabern\u2019s 82nd birthday celebration. He performs here with Eric Alexander on tenor saxophone, John Webber on bass and Louis Hayes on drums.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nOMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Roulette (March 22, 8 p.m.). The argument that a piano is a glorified percussion instrument \u2014 a big box of strings, to be struck by hammers \u2014 finds ample support in \u201cTransparent Water,\u201d the engulfing new album by Mr. Sosa, a Cuban pianist, and Mr. Keita, a kora player from Senegal. The kora, too, is a stringed instrument with a largely percussive charter. On the album, Mr. Sosa ornaments the space around Mr. Keita\u2019s playing with lilting undercurrents and deftly studded terrain. At Roulette, they will perform with the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles, a longtime collaborator of Mr. Sosa\u2019s who appears as a guest on the album.\n\n917-267-0368, roulette.org\n\n\u2018(UN)SILENT FILM NIGHT: IMPROV EDITION\u2019 at the New School\u2019s John L. Tishman Auditorium (March 16, 7 p.m.). The New School has been presenting \u201c(Un)Silent Film Night\u201d shows for the past few years, but never before has the event focused on improvising musicians. This evening\u2019s program includes three combos led by pre-eminent jazz improvisers, all accompanying short films. The guitarist Marc Ribot\u2019s band will play an original score to the 2005 short \u201cShadows Choose Their Horrors\u201d; the pianist Kris Davis\u2019s combo will accompany Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Pawnshop\u201d; and a group led by the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Andrew Cyrille will score a pair of Superman shorts from 1941.\n\nevents.newschool.edu\n\n\u2018WEST SIDE STORY: REIMAGINED\u2019 at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture (March 17, 7:30 p.m.). Bobby Sanabria is a leading Cuban percussionist and historian of the Afro-Cuban folkloric tradition, as well as others from across Latin America. Here he leads his 21-piece Multiverse Big Band in a creative homage to Leonard Bernstein\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d teasing out the various strands of musical information that Bernstein used \u2014 from Dominican merengue, Brazilian samba and Cuban mambo \u2014 and offering extrapolations of his own.\n\nhostos.cuny.edu/culturearts\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "title": "13 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis award-winning dramedy from Donald Glover returns with a second season promising a more focused kind of storytelling than that of its often dreamlike debut. As Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) deals with the unexpected fallout from regional hip-hop success and Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) disappears deeper into druggie weirdness, Glover\u2019s moody protagonist, Earn, reckons with whether finally making enough money to support his child can satisfy his restless soul. Given the remarkable ways in which the first season explored the complexities of African-American life, it will be fascinating to see what the career progress of these three friends \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 has to offer as a comment on the real world.\n\n\u2014\n\nOscars\n\n\u201890th Annual Academy Awards\u2019\n\nAirs: March 4, on ABC.\n\nIt will be tough for this year\u2019s Oscars to spring a moment as memorable as announcing the wrong movie for best picture last year, although given that this is a year with few obvious front-runners for the big prize, who knows what\u2019s in store? Once again, Jimmy Kimmel will host, and he will have a lot of topical material to work with, from the actions of the Trump administration to the #MeToo moment.

His new show promises to pair stinging showbiz satire with a genuine exploration of a melancholy soul. The fact that \u201cBarry\u201d was created in part by a \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d producer, Alec Berg \u2014 and features supporting performances by Henry Winkler and Stephen Root \u2014 secures its status as a must-see.\n\n\u2014\n\nBBC\n\n\u2018Call the Midwife\u2019 Season 7\n\nStarts: March 25, on PBS.\n\nMarch 25, on PBS.

In this new season, the heroines will continue to witness the highs and lows of changing times \u2014 from modest gains in feminist liberation to simmering racism \u2014 through the lens of their patients\u2019 medical complaints.\n\n\u2014\n\nFX Networks\n\n\u2018Trust\u2019\n\nStarts: March 25, on FX.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t get enough of the John Paul Getty III kidnapping in \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d this new FX anthology series begins its first season with the same strange, sad tale. In this version, Donald Sutherland plays the mega-rich J. Paul Getty, who responds to the abduction of his grandson with skepticism and stinginess, creating a rift within his family. Hilary Swank and Brendan Fraser are also in the cast, although what\u2019s most attractive for cinephiles is the creative team that includes director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, who previously collaborated on \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201c127 Hours\u201d and \u201cBattle of the Sexes.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\namc\n\n\u2018The Terror\u2019\n\nStarts: March 26, on AMC.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBased on the best-selling Dan Simmons novel about an Arctic naval expedition gone awry, this offbeat horror series will combine realistic detail about wilderness survival with a story that features a supernatural evil that stalks stranded sailors. Given that \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d is starting to stumble in the ratings, AMC could use another breakout genre hit. \u201cThe Terror\u201d has an appropriately arresting name, although its premise suggests that it deals with a different kind of \u201cbrainy\u201d than the channel\u2019s zombie drama.\n\n\u2014\n\nABC Television Network\n\n\u2018Roseanne\u2019\n\nStarts: March 27, on ABC.\n\nMarch 27, on ABC.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "RAVI COLTRANE at Jazz Standard (March 27-April 1, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Mr. Coltrane\u2019s music finds a tottery balance in the space between free-form improvisation and pulsing, onrushing flow. He hasn\u2019t released an album in six years, but he has been busy; most recently he\u2019s put a lot of effort toward furthering the legacy of his mother, the jazz pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane. He appears at Jazz Standard in a trio featuring the bassist Dezron Douglas and the drummer Allan Mednard, as well as a rotation of special guests. On Wednesday, it\u2019s the saxophonist Tomoki Sanders, the son of Pharoah Sanders, an esteemed musician who collaborated in the 1960s and \u201970s with Ms. Coltrane. On March 30, it\u2019ll be the harpist Brandee Younger; and on April 1, the trumpeter Ralph Alessi.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nANDREW CYRILLE QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (March 27-April 1, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). An experimental drummer who can easily balance propulsion and sensitivity, Mr. Cyrille began his career in the 1960s, when he apprenticed with Philly Joe Jones and recorded with the big-band-era eminence Coleman Hawkins. Then he embarked on a 10-year stint with Cecil Taylor, a pioneer of free jazz, establishing himself as a protagonist on the avant-garde. Now 78, Mr. Cyrille has never lost his omnivorous musical appetite; his work ranges from free improvisations to smoldering small-group jazz to a collaboration with Haitian musicians. He performs here with the personnel from his entrancing 2016 release, \u201cThe Declaration of Musical Independence\u201d: Bill Frisell on guitar, Richard Teitelbaum on synthesizers and piano, and Ben Street on bass.\n\n212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com\n\nORRIN EVANS at Mezzrow (March 28, 8 and 9:30 p.m.). It\u2019s been a big year for this Philadelphia-based pianist: He made his leadership debut at the Newport Jazz Festival in August, playing a riveting solo set, and he officially joined the Bad Plus, a renowned power trio, in February. But catch him in a small combo, and he can renew your faith in the vitality of classic, straight-ahead jazz. He works in an argot of amiable swing, punctuated by startling disruptions and occasional shots of seraphic beauty. Mr. Evans celebrates his 43rd birthday at this intimate show in a stalwart quartet with the trumpeter Sean Jones, the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Gene Jackson.\n\n646-476-4346, mezzrow.com\n\nBOBBY MCFERRIN SPIRITYOUALL at the Blue Note (March 23-April 1, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Since the 1980s, audiences have known Mr. McFerrin as a virtuoso vocalist who can deliver entire captivating sets without any accompaniment. But when he\u2019s with his Spirityouall band, Mr. McFerrin discovers untold possibilities in the rootsy, molten arrangements of Gil Goldstein, the ensemble\u2019s pianist and musical director. Spirityouall has a smartly tailored aesthetic, but Mr. McFerrin complicates and provokes it \u2014 sounding shots of vocal percussion, modulating the flow, coaxing kinetics out of languor. Here Mr. Goldstein helms a five-piece band, and Mr. McFerrin is joined on vocals by his daughter, Madison, a notable talent in her own right.\n\n212-475-8592, bluenote.net\n\nTHE SWING COLLECTIVE at Jazz at Lincoln Center (March 23-24, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). The Swing Collective features five young improvisers of growing renown, all hailing from different countries of origin. Out front are Melissa Aldana \u2014 a Chilean-born tenor saxophonist of precise, fine-bore articulation, boasting a vast palette of influences \u2014 and the Trinidadian trumpeter Etienne Charles, who makes a kind of nouveau Afro-Caribbean soul jazz. The formidable rhythm section features the Cuban pianist Elio Villafranca, the Japanese bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the Florida-born drummer Ulysses Owens.\n\n212-721-6500, jazz.org\n\nTHERESA WONG at the Stone (March 27-31, 8:30 p.m.). A singing cellist and an experimentalist of patient, farsighted demeanor, Ms. Wong leaves all options on the table: Most of the time, she plays the instrument in slow swipes and resonant plucks, resisting pattern or repetition. In residence at the Stone, Ms. Wong appears in a duo with the pianist Motoko Honda on Tuesday, alone on Wednesday and in a variety of small-group formations through March 31.\n\nthestonenyc.com\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "title": "14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "LAURA STEVENSON at Sunnyvale (March 31, 8:30 p.m.). Ms. Stevenson hasn\u2019t released an album since \u201cCocksure,\u201d in 2015, but that LP had enough high-wattage power-pop hooks to last \u2014 see \u201cTorch Song\u201d and \u201cJellyfish,\u201d both of which sound as electric as ever three years later. Hear what she has gotten up to since then at this Brooklyn show. With support from Zula and Fern Mayo.\n\n877-987-6487, sunnyvalebk.com\n\nSWEARIN\u2019 at Market Hotel (April 5, 9 p.m.). Alison Crutchfield\u2019s solo career has flourished since the breakup of her pop-punk-tinged group Swearin\u2019 in 2015 \u2014 she released a very good solo LP a little over a year ago \u2014 but fans were delighted all the same when Ms. Crutchfield and her former bandmates announced a reunion in November. Before supporting their indie-rock forebears Superchunk at two New York shows next week, Swearin\u2019 will play a one-off headlining set at this Brooklyn D.I.Y. venue.\n\n877-987-6487, twitter.com/markethotelnyc\n\nTOKIMONSTA at Brooklyn Steel (March 31, 9 p.m.). Jennifer Lee, the well-respected electronic and hip-hop producer who records as Tokimonsta, overcame remarkable odds to make her third album, \u201cLune Rouge\u201d: Its creation followed multiple brain surgeries that threatened her ability to hear and understand music. Dramatic back story aside, it\u2019s a strong set of elegant, danceable psychedelia.\n\n888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel\n\nSIMON VOZICK-LEVINSON\n\nPhoto\n\nJazz\n\nSTEPHAN CRUMP, INGRID LAUBROCK AND CORY SMYTHE at the Jazz Gallery (March 30, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ms. Laubrock has a strong, unflinching tone on the tenor saxophone, but she uses it to outline and define space, not fill it. On the album \u201cPlanktonic Finales,\u201d released last year, she joined Mr. Crump, a bassist whose playing is more embodied and abundant, and Mr. Smythe, a pianist of cogent articulation who comes at improvisation from the perspective of a contemporary classical musician.\n\n646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc\n\nTIA FULLER at Smoke (March 30-April 1; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Scalding and propulsive, Ms. Fuller always seems to be testing the limits of her own power \u2014 as if seeing if she can single-handedly overload your ear\u2019s switchboard. It\u2019s not every alto saxophonist\u2019s way, but with Ms. Fuller\u2019s blend of impeccable straight-ahead-jazz chops and gospelly inflections, it\u2019s engrossing. Later this spring, she will release \u201cDiamond Cut,\u201d her first album in six years. She plays this weekend with the pianist Shamie Royston, the bassist Mimi Jones and the drummer Tyson Jackson.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nMARY HALVORSON at Jazz Standard (April 3-4, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ms. Halvorson\u2019s fraying, sparkplug style makes her as singular a guitarist as they come. As a bandleader and composer, she\u2019s always changing shape. Her latest project is one to seek out: Code Girl, a quintet in which the vocalist Amirtha Kidambi sings lyrics written by Ms. Halvorson. The band is about to release a fine debut album \u2014 a mix of indie-rock testimonial, noisy convulsion and warped group improvising \u2014 and will celebrate the disc with this two-night run, featuring Ms. Kidambi on vocals, Adam O\u2019Farrill on trumpet (filling in for Ambrose Akinmusire, the group\u2019s regular horn player), Michael Formanek on bass and Tomas Fujiwara on drums.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As a pianist, Ms. Rosnes is known for her breezy swing and limpid touch. The tunes tend to run hot and bright, often recalling the crossed, multidirectional energy of mid-1960s postbop. At the Village Vanguard, she\u2019s joined by most of the personnel from the album: the bassist Peter Washington, the drummer Lenny White and, for all but the last night, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson. From April 6 to 8, the young tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana climbs aboard, too.\n\n212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com\n\nCAMILLE THURMAN at the Greenwich House Music School (April 5, 8 p.m.). Ms. Thurman doubles as a vocalist and a reeds player, and then she doubles again: She\u2019s proficient on both tenor saxophone and flute. And these aren\u2019t party tricks; her soloing style on the saxophone is swift and purposeful, often moving in dashes and broad harmonic sweeps. As a vocalist, she scats with unshakable aplomb. Ms. Thurman\u2019s repertoire balances jazz standards with a thick book of swinging, blues-driven originals. She will perform \u201cBecause of Them, We Are,\u201d a collection of new compositions inspired by her own reckoning with the effects of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. She appears as part of the Greenwich House Music School\u2019s Uncharted concert series. (This year, all eight of Uncharted\u2019s shows feature female headliners \u2014 a fact that, happily, seems hardly worth mentioning.)\n\n212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPATTY WATERS at First Unitarian Congregational Society (April 5, 8 p.m.). Few vocalists possess either the stark intimacy or the darkened mystery of Ms. Waters. She inhabits the territory of singers like Sibylle Baier, Jeanne Lee, Nick Drake, Billie Holiday \u2014 and hardly anyone else. A sylph of a singer, Ms. Waters spent a few potent years on jazz\u2019s avant-garde in the 1960s, then vanished. Her 1965 debut, \u201cPatty Waters Sings,\u201d is still her definitive document. It features seven hushed and haunted originals, with little more than a piano backing her and a 14-minute take on \u201cBlack Is the Color of My True Love\u2019s Hair,\u201d the Appalachian folk song that she pulverizes into noxious dust. Now 72, Ms. Waters plays here in her first New York performance since a brief re-emergence in 2003. She is joined by Burton Greene, the pianist from \u201cSings,\u201d as well as the bassist Mario Pavone and the percussionist Barry Altschul.\n\n718-624-5466, blankforms.org\n\nDAN WEISS at Nublu 151 (April 1, 8 p.m.). Next week, the drummer Mr. Weiss will release \u201cStarebaby,\u201d a seething, spacious album that unites doom and thrash metal with jazz. The band from that record \u2014 Craig Taborn and Matt Mitchell, both on keyboards and electronics; Ben Monder on guitar; and Trevor Dunn on bass \u2014 performs here in a special prerelease concert. The show starts with an opening set from Mick Barr and Brandon Seabrook, guitarists who each have their own idiosyncratic ideas about blending metal and jazz. (If you miss this show \u2014 or decide you haven\u2019t had enough \u2014 Mr. Weiss will also kick off a five-night residency at the Stone on Tuesday.)\n\nnublu.net\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO", "title": "14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

That\u2019s where my friend Brian McPhillips of Second Tank Battalion was fatally shot in the head, but I wouldn\u2019t hear the news for another two weeks. Information rarely travels laterally in war. I was a few miles from the ambush that killed him when I learned that my platoon would lead the battalion over the Diyala River and into Baghdad.\n\nThe bridge was partly destroyed. Two-thirds of the way to the far side, a chunk of the span was gone, leaving pieces of exposed rebar and a clear view to the water below. Combat engineers laid a makeshift bridge over the gap. I asked the engineer lieutenant if it would hold a tank\u2019s weight. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the platoon commander, I could dictate which tank went over first, but it wasn\u2019t really a choice. It had barely been a week since Charlie Company\u2019s Marines drowned in the Euphrates; I left the hatch of my cupola all the way open, prepared to jump free of the vehicle if it went in the water.\n\nAs we came over the crest of the bridge, a man on the far side of the river fired an AK-47 at us. This was inconvenient. I was trying to guide our driver onto the engineer\u2019s bridge while scanning the landscape for other threats; being shot at felt gratuitous.\n\n\u201cCo-ax, fire,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOn the way,\u201d my gunner replied, and ended someone\u2019s life with the tank\u2019s 7.62-millimeter coaxial machine gun.\n\nAs he fired, I caught sight of a Soviet-made T-72 tank dug into a defensive position. I grabbed the override to rotate the turret while giving a hasty fire command to my gunner. The thunderous boom echoed across the battlefield, and I saw the orange spark of steel on steel. Secondary explosions followed as the T-72\u2019s ammunition cooked off. On the radio, I reported the kills and called off the artillery mission, which was well inside the \u201cdanger close\u201d range of 600 meters.

It\u2019s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar\u2019s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and \u201980s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century.

The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America\u2019s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program \u201cSam and Friends\u201d before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was crafted from his mother\u2019s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends.

This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico\u2019s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico.

After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art, by Jews and gentiles alike \u2014 Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective \u2014 curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA\u2019s photo chief \u2014 opens with Mr. Shore\u2019s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of \u201cAmerican Surfaces\u201d and the steely precision of \u201cUncommon Places\u201d \u2014 landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA\u2019s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)\n\n212-708-9400, moma.org\n\n\u20182018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE\u2019 at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum\u2019s fourth triennial exhibition, \u201cSongs for Sabotage,\u201d is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it\u2019s also the best looking. There\u2019s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it\u2019s a safe and unchallenging show. In a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art \u2014 easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects \u2014 that art fairs suck up.

In contrast to the PBS series \u201cThe Vietnam War,\u201d this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there\u2019s graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled \u201cHome Front\u201d and \u201cWar Front\u201d that put you in the middle of the war\u2019s primary issues and events.

Nearly 18 years have passed since the artist and activist Tania Bruguera first mounted \u2014 or attempted to mount \u2014 \u201cUntitled (Havana, 2000)\u201d at the Seventh Havana Biennial. Critical of the post-revolutionary politics of Cuba, it was shut down by censors within hours. Now \u201cUntitled (Havana, 2000)\u201d is recreated here. In groups of four, you enter a dark space where you walk on sugar cane. As your eyes adjust, you see four naked men along the wall and video propaganda images of Fidel Castro. Borrowing aesthetic motifs from earlier art, like medieval and Renaissance painting, Ms. Bruguera\u2019s tableau vivant asks you to \u201cstop looking and start thinking\u201d about politics, history and violence.

What modern misogynist will be yanked from museums next? Gauguin? Picasso? I say, sure, why not? Set them aside, give them a rest and make room for what we never see, which means art by almost any woman you can name. Carolee Schneemann is one I\u2019d move right into the cleared-out spotlight, not just because she has star quality, which she does, or because she has majorly shaped art history, which she has. I\u2019d put her there because, in a career of some 60 years, she\u2019s been one of the most generous artists around \u2014 generous with her presence, her thinking, her formal and political risk taking, and her embrace of embracing itself. You\u2019ll find evidence of all of this in her first comprehensive retrospective. (Cotter)\n\n718-784-2084, momaps1.org\n\n\u2018THE SCULPTURE OF GONZALO FONSECA\u2019 at the Noguchi Museum (through March 11). The Uruguayan-American sculptor Gonzalo Fonseca (1922-97) pioneered an architecturally inflected, whimsically literary style of relentless ambiguity. Whether covering large pieces of Italian travertine with incised circles and tiny pyramids, fixing a small red sail to a flat chunk of limestone or titling a tabletop-size pillar of dark gray stone \u201cSelf-Portrait,\u201d Fonseca made his work live by putting it almost entirely in the power of the viewer\u2019s imagination. This modest but jampacked mini retrospective \u2014 aptly sited in the museum built by his friend and fellow stone carver Isamu Noguchi \u2014 is worth taking in slowly. (Will Heinrich)\n\n718-204-7708, noguchi.org\n\n\u2018CATHY WILKES\u2019 at MoMA PS1 (through March 11). A tea-ringed saucer, a discolored hatbox, an unfixed sink or a case of vegetable peelers \u2014 from these humble materials, the Irish-born artist conjures wrenchingly moving tableaus of family, loss and memory. Ms. Wilkes is one of the leading lights of the white-hot Glasgow contemporary art scene, and her unprepossessing sculpture, installations and paintings are shown to advantage here. Works are shown without barriers and often sit directly on the floor, emphasizing their fragility and care. (PS1 limits entry to the galleries to a few dozen at a time.) This show is an invitation to slow down, to look closely, to think and to feel at once.

Council members on Friday took a step toward creating a commission that would propose changes to the charter \u2014 hours after the mayor rushed appointments to his own, separate, charter commission.\n\nThe City Council held a hearing on a bill that would authorize a commission to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the charter, New York City\u2019s equivalent of a constitution. The review could potentially take up issues such as whether to increase public participation in land-use decisions, alter the way budget decisions are made and question the checks and balances between the mayor and the Council. The last time such a broad review occurred was in 1989.\n\nThe bill was drafted last year by the public advocate, Letitia James, and the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer. It envisions a commission whose members would be appointed by a range of elected officials, including the mayor; Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker; Ms. James; Scott M. Stringer, the comptroller; Ms. Brewer and the four other borough presidents.\n\nBut Mr. de Blasio jumped ahead of them in February when he announced in his State of the City address that he planned to create his own commission.

Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, remain at large in Russia despite British demands for their extradition.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf it was poison, it would mean people are still not protected,\u201d Ms. Litvinenko said, referring Mr. Skripal\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad message for other people.

Even after he retired from active duty in 1999, according to British news reports, he continued to tease out salable information from former colleagues.\n\nThe chronology suggests that Mr. Skripal was spying against the F.S.B. at precisely the moment that Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer on his rise to supreme power, headed the organization. Treachery was not something he tolerated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Putin regards him as a traitor,\u201d said Tony Brenton, the British ambassador in Moscow from 2004 to 2008 \u2014 a period of rapidly deteriorating relations that some compared to the Cold War.\n\nBut, Mr. Brenton added in an interview, \u201cthe evidence isn\u2019t there yet\u201d about why Mr. Skripal fell ill. Investigators in the Litvinenko case discovered shortly before he died that polonium had been used, Mr. Brenton said, noting that if Mr. Litvinenko had passed away earlier, \u201cthey would never have found it.\u201d The killers in that case, he added, \u201ccould have gotten away with it.\u201d\n\nMr. Skripal, once a colonel in Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, the G.R.U., was arrested in 2004 and jailed in 2006, accused of selling the Kremlin\u2019s secrets to Britain\u2019s MI6 overseas intelligence service over a 10-year period in return for $100,000 paid into a bank account in Spain. Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s widow said that he, too, had received a stipend from MI6, but only after the family moved to London in 2000.\n\nThe authorities have rarely moved swiftly to follow suggestions that the Kremlin is actively pursuing a policy of reprisals against adversaries beyond its own borders. In 2012, for instance, Alexander Perepilichnyy, a whistle-blower financier, died near his home outside London. An inquiry by his life insurance company found traces of a rare and toxic plant extract \u2014 gelsemium \u2014 in his stomach, but the British police have insisted that there was nothing suspicious.\n\n\u201cBritish law enforcement doesn\u2019t have a lot of credibility when it comes to poisoned Russians in the U.K. after the complete failure of finding out what happened to Perepilichnyy in 2012,\u201d Mr. Browder said on Twitter.\n\nThe public inquiry into Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s death came even as British officials fought strenuously to block a deeper look into the circumstances, including using security legislation to seal some details from public scrutiny.\n\nThe head of the Home Office at the time was Theresa May, who is now the prime minister of country that must find a response after the death of another Russian on British soil.", "title": "2 Ex-Spies Fell Ill in Britain.

(In Paris, the play ran nearly three years.)\n\n\u201cHarold and Maude\u201d has now arrived at the Charing Cross Theater, through May 12, in a sympathetic production from the director Thom Southerland, who is better known for his work in musicals \u2014 among them \u201cRagtime\u201d and \u201cGrey Gardens,\u201d both of which were very fine. But the play, like the film before it, feels like one elongated life lesson, this time minus the Cat Stevens songs.\n\nLike the movie, the play is a decades-straddling romance packed with fortune cookie bromides about not being \u201cafraid to be human.\u201d The 80-year-old Maude insists at one point that the suicidal Harold, who is pushing 20, \u201creach out, take a chance, get hurt maybe.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the film\u2019s release, Maude must have felt like an eccentric equivalent to Mame Dennis of the Broadway musical \u201cMame,\u201d which similarly urged audiences to \u201copen a new window\u201d and embrace life. Harold\u2019s signature funk presumably spoke to the hangover of the post-\u201960s generation, yearning to break free but not knowing how. The play, by contrast, mostly registers as an exercise in whimsy as the dotty but determined heroine rescues the blank-faced, indrawn Harold from himself. (Francis O\u2019Connor\u2019s airy, Magritte-like set keeps the mood light.)\n\nIt\u2019s to the credit of Bill Milner, the current Harold, that his blossoming in Maude\u2019s company is achieved without ever being cloying, and I doubt there has been a better Maude than the English stage veteran Sheila Hancock, who, at 85, is older than the character as written and seems even more spry. (She leaves the cast on March 31, with Linda Marlowe to replace her for the remainder of the run.)\n\nWhereas the diminutive Ruth Gordon in the film is, to my mind anyway, an acquired taste, the tall and willowy Ms. Hancock is naturally expansive as the self-described European countess who speaks five languages and breaks into pet shops to liberate canaries. (\u201cHow the world does like a cage,\u201d Maude says by way of explanation.)\n\nIt could be argued that Ms. Hancock locates more delicacy in this meeting of soul mates than it probably deserves. But a gift for tossing off head-scratchers like \u201che studied Zen Buddhism at the penitentiary\u201d turns out to be very useful indeed. An audience may have no idea moment to moment where Maude is headed next, but Ms. Hancock ensures that we, like Harold, follow her every step of the way.", "title": "2 Films Come to the London Stage, With Losses and Gains", "authors": []}

On the evening of March 18, two officers from the Sacramento Police Department were dispatched to investigate a complaint that someone was breaking vehicle windows.\n\nPhoto\n\nA helicopter from the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department was also hovering over the scene looking for a potential suspect when it identified a man with a crowbar heading toward a nearby house.\n\nA few minutes after responding to the call, with the apparent guidance from the sheriff\u2019s helicopter, the city police officers spotted Mr. Clark, who they said ran from them. They followed him into the backyard and ordered him to show his hands, police video shows. Seconds later, in the dark, one officer shouted, \u201cgun, gun, gun, gun!\u201d and they shot 20 times at Mr. Clark. The officers believed Mr. Clark had a weapon and opened fire \u201cfearing for their lives,\u201d according to a police statement.\n\nThe entire encounter lasted roughly 10 minutes. The officers looked for a gun but all they found was a cellphone.\n\nVideo\n\nMinutes later more officers arrived and the team handcuffed Mr. Clark, who lay mortally wounded.\n\nAs other officers arrived, the two involved in the shooting muted the audio feeds to their body cameras. One of the officers was black and the other was white. They are both on paid leave, Mr. Hahn said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTimothy Davis, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, called the event a tragedy and voiced his support for the officers involved. \u201cNo police officer ever wants to have to take a life,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cOur officers are out there serving this community, leaving their family behind to serve this community.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if the decision to mute the cameras went against official protocol, but the act alone has prompted intense suspicion. The Clark family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the move \u201creeks of impropriety\u201d and that the Police Department was trying to cover something up. Mr. Crump represented the families of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012, and Michael Brown, killed by the police in Ferguson two years later.\n\nMr. Hahn said that the department could not explain why the officers muted their cameras, but that the officers\u2019s actions were under investigation. The department had been considering banning muting cameras outright before Mr. Clark was shot, he said.\n\n\u201cIn their training they are told a couple different instances when they can mute their body cameras.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "I called a friend from the playground, and we talked it through and agreed to march. And it felt good to have something to do on that terrible day, a day when it\u2019s normally hard to even get out of bed. We now had a plan. We would be together in Washington, standing on our grown-up feet and remembering Westside while walking for everyone who\u2019s experienced this. And I thought the Warriors would agree; I thought that would be the clear consensus.\n\nThat\u2019s why my breath was taken away by a post to the Facebook group that denounced the march entirely. Some members were upset that the day was being taken from us, but many were even more upset about the agenda of the event. They thought it was purposely planned to drive a political point home, one that they did not agree with.\n\nPeople posted that the organizers were \u201cagainst all guns,\u201d that they chose \u201cour day of remembrance\u201d for their political agenda. People talked about arming teachers, increasing security, running \u201clockdown drills.\u201d\n\nI understand that some people make an argument for preparedness over prevention, but it is an argument that I can\u2019t accept. If my classmates think back to 1998, I imagine they\u2019ll remember our teachers were white as sheets and frozen with fear. I personally had to shove a grown woman aside in order to dial 911 because she was in understandable shock. One teacher was able to pull a student to cover and safety, but that was the most she could do. She couldn\u2019t have fought off our attackers and I don\u2019t think it would have been right to ask her to. No person knows how he or she would react in a time like that, so the idea of arming teachers lends itself to a false sense of security.\n\nBeyond my lack of confidence in the practicality of arming teachers as a solution, the discussion made me incredibly sad. It meant we accept this as our new norm. Westside was the beginning of an epidemic. It was jarring to find a group of survivors \u2014 my former classmates \u2014 as divided as our country. It felt like they were responding with jaded, grown-up brains instead of the honest, childhood hearts we had when we were younger.\n\nI cannot accept that more guns will solve the issue of more shootings. Some of my classmates wrote that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be lumped into the gun debate,\u201d but you cannot talk about a shooting without talking about guns.\n\nThey send journals to the newest survivors, encouraging them to write their feelings and begin their healing. But this is a generation that has grown up with many platforms to voice their opinions, and they\u2019re not satisfied with hiding their thoughts in a journal tucked away on a shelf. Standing up, speaking out and marching may be part of their therapy. One of the comments to our Facebook thread read: \u201cIt\u2019s just all different than ours was. These people have a serious agenda: to get rid of guns.\u201d That\u2019s true. It is different than ours. These victims are helping themselves by fighting for common-sense gun laws to save the future.\n\nEach March 24 is harder for me than the last because, as an adult, I\u2019m able to better define how horrific the shooting really was. In less than 10 minutes on that playground, my classmates and I gained a deeper understanding of evil and fear than most people experience in their entire lives. I can\u2019t trade the Warriors for a group that agrees with me, but I can march this weekend in Washington to ensure that in 20 years Emma Gonz\u00e1lez won\u2019t be writing to remind you of her story and her friends.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Original headline: \u201cThe Man Date,\u201d from April 2005\n\nWow, what a different era: Check the date. Yep, this article is indeed from 2005, not 1965. While some remember the aughts as a time when gay acceptance began to go mainstream (\u201cWill & Grace\u201d dominated sitcom ratings; \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d won a handful of Oscars), it apparently still had a ways to go. Look no further than this provocative Styles feature, which still had keyboards clacking more than a decade after the fact . The article probed the putatively awkward social dynamic created when two straight male friends hung out together somewhere other than a hockey game. To dine together, or see a movie one-on-one, it seems, required pretzel-like social contortions to avoid any \u201cundercurrent of homoeroticism.\u201d The dilemmas, according to the author Jennifer 8. Lee, were endless. Is it O.K. to split a bottle of wine over dinner? If you go out to a movie, do you need leave a seat open between the two of you? This article was written only 13 years ago. Was it really that different an era?\n\nDefining the terms: You may not find it in Webster\u2019s, but a \u201cman date,\u201d as defined by Ms. Lee, consists of \u201ctwo heterosexual men socializing without the crutch of business or sports. It is two guys meeting for the kind of outing a straight man might reasonably arrange with a woman. Dining together across a table without the aid of a television is a man date; eating at a bar is not. Taking a walk in the park together is a man date; going for a jog is not. Attending the movie \u2018Friday Night Lights\u2019 is a man date, but going to see the Jets play is definitely not.\u201d\n\nAnd the problem was \u2026 \u201cThe concern about being perceived as gay is one of the major complications of socializing one on one,\u201d according to the \u201cmany straight men\u201d whom Ms. Lee interviewed. One University of Virginia graduate student and his lawyer friend, for example, decided to grab dinner at a buzzy Italian restaurant, only to bolt in horror when they were confronted with cello music, amber lights, a wine list and \u2014 yikes! \u2014 another friend who happened to be dining there. \u201cThis is weird,\u201d the lawyer was quoted as saying. \u201cAnd now there is a witness maybe.\u201d Out of discomfort, the duo high-tailed it out to a fried chicken joint for a proper bro-down. Even the most casual of outings involving two straight men sometimes involved a degree of \u201csocial Stratego,\u201d the author asserted, referencing a board game that now seems as antique as the \u201cman date\u201d itself. \u201cSome men avoid dinner altogether unless the friend is coming from out of town or has a specific problem that he wants advice about,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote. \u201cOtherwise, grabbing beers at a bar will do just fine, thank you.\u201d\n\nIt was not always thus: Ms. Lee\u2019s article posited that straight male anxiety over such social engagements was a relatively recent phenomenon. \u201cBefore women were considered men\u2019s equals, some gender historians say, men routinely confided in and sought advice from one another in ways they did not do with women, even their wives,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote. \u201cThen, these scholars say, two things changed during the last century: an increased public awareness of homosexuality created a stigma around male intimacy, and at the same time women began encroaching on traditionally male spheres, causing men to become more defensive about notions of masculinity.\u201d", "title": "2005: When Two Guys Splitting a Bottle of Wine Became a \u2018Man Date\u2019", "authors": []}

But if Ms. Nixon were to overcome Mr. Cuomo\u2019s advantages and prevail, it would certainly represent a triumph for Mr. de Blasio, as well.\n\nAs it is, Ms. Nixon is drawing on some of the same supporting cast from 2013: Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s top former strategists, are guiding Ms. Nixon\u2019s current run.\n\nBack in 2013, the front-runner with an air of inevitability was Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker with an inside track to be New York City\u2019s first female and lesbian mayor. But Ms. Nixon, who is also gay, sided with Mr. de Blasio instead.\n\n\u201cMost people assumed Christine Quinn was going to win that race and one of the lessons is the arrogance of being on top sometimes results in a terrible tumble,\u201d said Billy Easton, a friend of Ms. Nixon and the executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group that seeks more money for schools, for which she served for years as a spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Easton called the 2013 race \u201can important development\u201d in Ms. Nixon\u2019s political progression. \u201cThat experience gave her a pretty high-profile, practical experience with the day-to-day political world in New York,\u201d he said.\n\nThe wounds are apparently still fresh for Ms. Quinn. This week, she called Ms. Nixon an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u201d who didn\u2019t back a \u201cqualified lesbian\u201d for mayor five years ago. Ms. Quinn quickly apologized for the lesbian jab but not the unqualified part.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, at a campaign launch party at the Stonewall Inn, the gay rights landmark, Ms. Nixon mocked Ms. Quinn\u2019s remark.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI just want to say tonight that she was technically right,\u201d Ms. Nixon said. \u201cThat I don\u2019t have my certificate from the Department of Lesbian Affairs. But, in my defense, there is a lot, a lot of paperwork involved.\u201d\n\nMs. Nixon, an award-winning actress (she has a Grammy, two Tonys and two Emmys), has never run a large organization or held elected office before but has been a vocal political activist for more than 15 years.\n\n\u201cCynthia Nixon has been fighting for better public schools, LGBT equality and women\u2019s health since long before Bill de Blasio ran for mayor,\u201d said Ms. Katz, the Nixon adviser who also worked for Mr. de Blasio five years ago. Ms. Katz said the tipping point that inspired Ms. Nixon\u2019s run was Mr. Cuomo\u2019s comments last year about not seeking higher levels of education funding that she said he campaigned on in 2010.\n\nMs. Nixon became friendly with Mr. de Blasio in the early 2000s, when he was a city councilman and she was still shooting \u201cSex and the City.\u201d They both opposed then-Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s education programs and found a common cause.\n\nIn the years after, she has trekked to Albany for schools and same-sex marriage, headlined events for Planned Parenthood and President Barack Obama, campaigned for Al Franken and delivered her own speeches at political rallies.\n\nBut it was the 2013 mayor\u2019s race where she truly dove in, canvassing the city with Mr. de Blasio when even his backers would joke that he was battling for fifth in a five-person field. Her wife, Christine Marinoni, an education activist herself, volunteered extensively on the campaign, too.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere are weeks where four or five days in a row, I\u2019m doing something with Cynthia,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at the time.\n\nShe would gush about him as \u201cNew York City\u2019s Obama.\u201d And her presence would invariably draw cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCynthia Nixon was the life support for de Blasio\u2019s campaign for many, many months,\u201d said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist aligned with Ms. Quinn\u2019s campaign.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In August, Ms. Nixon helped produce and appeared in an ad for Mr. de Blasio that starred a mosaic of famous New Yorkers including Harry Belafonte, Lee Daniels and the Lady Bunny.\n\nAfter Mr. de Blasio won in November, Ms. Nixon became his representative with the Public Theater and was given a role on the advisory board for the Mayor\u2019s Fund. She continued to speak about public education and universal prekindergarten. Ms. Marinoni joined the de Blasio administration itself at the Department of Education.\n\nBoth have been spotted around City Hall in the years since, and Ms. Nixon\u2019s name is sprinkled through the public calendars of Mr. de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, whom she joined in a skit at an annual media show in 2014.\n\nNow it is Mr. Cuomo that Ms. Nixon is hoping to slay \u2014 a far taller task than even Mr. de Blasio\u2019s victory in a crowded 2013 mayoral field. Early polls had him down 25 percentage points to Ms. Quinn. Ms. Nixon trails by nearly 40 percentage points, according to one survey.\n\nPeople close to Ms. Nixon, who declined an interview request, say she is undaunted by the challenge ahead.\n\nShe certainly came out swinging on her first day on the stump, calling Mr. Cuomo\u2019s budget \u201cinhumane,\u201d linking him to the Koch brothers and questioning whether he is a \u201creal Democrat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for Ms. Quinn, now an ally of Mr. Cuomo, she is the one who may play the role of spoiler.\n\nMs. Quinn said in an interview she was \u201ccertainly surprised\u201d that Ms. Nixon backed Mr. de Blasio five years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m equally surprised she\u2019s challenging the governor who has the best record on L.G.B.T. issues of any non-L.G.B.T. politician in the country,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s about celebrity and thinking that being a celebrity is enough. But running for office and serving in office is not a flight of fancy.\u201d Ms. Quinn vowed to campaign for Mr. Cuomo ardently: \u201cAs they say, \u2018every day and twice on Sunday.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMs. Nixon, for her part, said five years ago that she was \u201cnot anti-Chris Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked alongside her in the marriage fight, and I believe she was incredibly eloquent and incredibly effective,\u201d she said then. \u201cBut apart from that particular gay issue, I don\u2019t see a lot of stuff where I line up with her.\u201d\n\nMore central in the current race is Ms. Nixon\u2019s relationship with Mr. de Blasio, who the governor has charged is behind her campaign. \u201cProbably either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin,\u201d Mr. Cuomo laughed earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Ms. Katz said, Ms. Nixon was first approached about running for governor in 2010, by the late progressive activist Jon Kest \u2014 which would have pitted her against Mr. Cuomo eight years earlier.\n\nAmong those that Ms. Nixon wooed into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fold in 2013 was the playwright Jon Robin Baitz, who said that, in hindsight, \u201cIt is quite clear that Quinn would\u2019ve been a better choice for this city, tough, fierce, brave and rock solid \u2014 perfect for New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt stings to think about,\u201d Mr. Baitz said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he has soured on Ms. Nixon, who he said was not to be underestimated.\n\n\u201cIn a race between Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, I know who I\u2019d bet on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t the guy.\u201d", "title": "2018 Is Cynthia Nixon\u2019s First Race; 2013 Was Her First Political Rodeo", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Jacob Bernstein"]}

You will probably be spending more money at once than you have ever spent in your life, and committing to spend even more money that you don\u2019t have, all while becoming responsible for something that won\u2019t necessarily love you back.\n\nTo make matters worse, 2018 presents a new set of problems for rookie home buyers: a new tax law whose full effects have yet to be felt on homeowner taxes or property values; record low inventory; tough credit; and rising mortgage rates.\n\nSo should you make that leap?\n\nWhat Will the New Tax Law Do to Home Values?\n\nHow the new Republican tax plan approved late last year will affect housing isn\u2019t completely clear yet, but buying a home in 2018 will likely become more expensive, especially for buyers who live in high-tax states. Taxpayers used to be able to deduct all of their state and local taxes, including property taxes, state income taxes and city income taxes, from their federal taxes. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000 \u2014 and at $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately.\n\nIn New Jersey, for example, the average 2017 property tax bill was $8,690 across the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and more than $11,000 in counties that make up the suburbs of New York City.

Mount Kumgang, or the \u201cDiamond Mountain,\u201d lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang\u2019s Olympic Stadium, but it\u2019s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries\u2019 worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters.

This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico\u2019s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or \u201cthe beauty of tight binding.\u201d Given the venue, it\u2019s natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki\u2019s omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral.

The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person\u2019s game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring.

This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico\u2019s at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment.

After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike \u2014 Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations.

Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective \u2014 curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA\u2019s photo chief \u2014 opens with Mr. Shore\u2019s teenage snaps at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of \u201cAmerican Surfaces\u201d and the steely precision of \u201cUncommon Places\u201d \u2014 landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA\u2019s smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)\n\n212-708-9400, moma.org\n\n\u20182018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE\u2019 at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum\u2019s fourth triennial exhibition, \u201cSongs for Sabotage,\u201d is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it\u2019s also the best looking. There\u2019s a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it\u2019s a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art \u2014 easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects \u2014 that art fairs suck up.

In contrast to the PBS series \u201cThe Vietnam War,\u201d this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there\u2019s graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled \u201cHome Front\u201d and \u201cWar Front\u201d that put you in the middle of the war\u2019s primary issues and events.

Nearly 18 years have passed since the artist and activist Tania Bruguera first mounted \u2014 or attempted to mount \u2014 \u201cUntitled (Havana, 2000)\u201d at the Seventh Havana Biennial. Critical of the post-revolutionary politics of Cuba, it was shut down by censors within hours. Now \u201cUntitled (Havana, 2000)\u201d is recreated here. In groups of four, you enter a dark space where you walk on sugar cane. As your eyes adjust, you see four naked men along the wall and video propaganda images of Fidel Castro. Borrowing aesthetic motifs from earlier art, like medieval and Renaissance painting, Ms. Bruguera\u2019s tableau vivant asks you to \u201cstop looking and start thinking\u201d about politics, history and violence.

What modern misogynist will be yanked from museums next? Gauguin? Picasso? I say, sure, why not? Set them aside, give them a rest and make room for what we never see, which means art by almost any woman you can name. Carolee Schneemann is one I\u2019d move right into the cleared-out spotlight, not just because she has star quality, which she does, or because she has majorly shaped art history, which she has. I\u2019d put her there because, in a career of some 60 years, she\u2019s been one of the most generous artists around \u2014 generous with her presence, her thinking, her formal and political risk taking, and her embrace of embracing itself. You\u2019ll find evidence of all of this in her first comprehensive retrospective.

The Uruguayan-American sculptor Gonzalo Fonseca (1922-97) pioneered an architecturally inflected, whimsically literary style of relentless ambiguity. Whether covering large pieces of Italian travertine with incised circles and tiny pyramids, fixing a small red sail to a flat chunk of limestone or titling a tabletop-size pillar of dark gray stone \u201cSelf-Portrait,\u201d Fonseca made his work live by putting it almost entirely in the power of the viewer\u2019s imagination. This modest but jampacked mini retrospective \u2014 aptly sited in the museum built by his friend and fellow stone carver Isamu Noguchi \u2014 is worth taking in slowly. (Will Heinrich)\n\n718-204-7708, noguchi.org\n\n\u2018CATHY WILKES\u2019 at MoMA PS1 (through March 11). A tea-ringed saucer, a discolored hatbox, an unfixed sink or a case of vegetable peelers \u2014 from these humble materials, the Irish-born artist conjures wrenchingly moving tableaus of family, loss and memory. Ms. Wilkes is one of the leading lights of the white-hot Glasgow contemporary art scene, and her unprepossessing sculpture, installations and paintings are shown to advantage here. Works are shown without barriers and often sit directly on the floor, emphasizing their fragility and care. (PS1 limits entry to the galleries to a few dozen at a time.) This show is an invitation to slow down, to look closely, to think and to feel at once.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil\u2019s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or \u201ccannibalism.\u201d Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila\u2019s three most important paintings, including the classic \u201cAbaporu\u201d (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works \u2014 a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris\u2019s \u201cMan at the Caf\u00e9\u201d (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration.

Mount Kumgang, or the \u201cDiamond Mountain,\u201d lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang\u2019s Olympic Stadium, but it\u2019s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries\u2019 worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics.

In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests \u2014 in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows \u2014 served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met\u2019s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a \u201csculpture\u201d divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own.

The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America\u2019s great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program \u201cSam and Friends\u201d before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother\u2019s old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade.

It\u2019s hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar\u2019s photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and \u201980s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century.

More devout than Vel\u00e1zquez, more shadowy than Murillo, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n was little known outside Spain until the mid-19th century, when Manet and his friends found the seeds of modernism in his frisky, open brushwork and streamlined form. The Frick is now showing a baker\u2019s dozen of the Spaniard\u2019s biblical portraits, of aged, hunched Jacob and the sons who would become the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with most of the paintings on loan from a castle that until recently belonged to the Church of England. The gents pose in a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob\u2019s foretelling of their destinies in Genesis. Two are especially compelling: Judah, child No. 4, decked out in a fur-trimmed coat and vamping alongside a kindly lion, and Joseph, who forgoes the Technicolor dreamcoat for a blue sash and a belt stitched with gold.

The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the year\u2019s best so far.

The photocopier never gained traction as a popular artistic tool, but this exhibition is an intriguing curiosity, showcasing the work of three artists and a collective who worked seriously with machines that were invented to reproduce office documents. Edward Meneeley, a photographer, embraced the photocopier, making small wallpaperlike abstractions, while Lesley Schiff created deadpan images of everyday objects and Barbara T. Smith generated hazy abstractions with cooking flour (and feminist overtones). The International Society of Copier Artists, which had 500 members at one point, produced work that ranged from still lifes to graphic montages reminiscent of contemporaneous punk rock album covers and zines.

Cowin Women\u2019s History Gallery assembles more than 100 images and artifacts, including advocative posters; progressive magazines of the time, such as The Woman Voter; and cookbooks and pepper shakers bearing suffragist propaganda.

In the first part of what is planned as a recurring series on women in the labor force, BAM will focus on movies about union activity. The program opens with \u201cSalt of the Earth\u201d (Friday), an independent production that was controversial in 1954 for having been made by the director Herbert J. Biberman (one of the Hollywood 10) and other blacklisted filmmakers. Cast with a mix of professional and nonprofessional actors \u2014 and partly funded by a union that the Congress of Industrial Organizations had expelled for its politics \u2014 the film revolves around a New Mexico miners\u2019 strike that requires unity not only among the workers, who begin the movie divided, but also between the miners and their wives, who start picketing in place of their husbands when a court forbids the miners from doing so.

As creative director of Repossi (jeweler to the House of Grimaldi), Ms. Repossi commissioned Ms. Niarchos to create two collections in 2007.\n\nThe experience prompted Ms. Niarchos, who had studied fashion and interned for John Galliano, to apprentice in the fine jewelry department of Christie\u2019s in New York. She also studied at the London branch of the Gemological Institute of America.\n\nWhile the training provided a technical foundation, master paintings and modern art seem to be the creative fuel of Venyx.

A Dan Flavin fluorescent light piece proved the motivation for the glow-in-the-dark enamel that lends an otherworldly quality to Oseanyx, a 2015 collection inspired by aquatic life and outer space.\n\nIn her 2017 Elementa collection, Ms. Niarchos\u2019s credits her admiration of Monet\u2019s shimmering Houses of Parliament series for her use of vibrant stones, including carnelians, fire opals, orange sapphires and amethysts.\n\nAnd a trio of Elementa necklaces, showcasing striking intarsias (polished stones set within marble), appear to be miniature masterpieces.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Ms. Niarchos said she discovered the intarsias at the Tucson Gem, Mineral and Fossil Showcase, an annual trade fair in Arizona that she attends in Arizona, and then created the precious metal and gemstone frames: \u201cI thought it would be nice to wear a little painting around your neck.\u201d\n\nThe first jewelry Ms. Sheibani designed were gold brooches that also resembled picture frames.\n\nThe designs, now a motif in her collection of bold 18-karat pieces, were motivated by her memory of a pin, a small Picasso etching encased in gold.

It is a virtual assembly line of college basketball, and for the true hoops fanatic it is basketball paradise.\n\n\u201cThis is the real March Madness,\u201d Larry Cordaro, the coach of Louisiana State-Alexandria, said during a busy breakfast on Thursday at Kansas City\u2019s Westin hotel, where all 32 teams were billeted. \u201cIt\u2019s a really special time.\u201d", "title": "32 Teams, 7 Days, 1 Gym", "authors": ["David Waldstein"]}

The America\u2019s Cup Sailing experience from the tour company Explore Group (180 dollars) allows amateurs to feel the thrill of a heeling 80-foot boat and the grind of raising the sails on two-hour trips in Waitemata Harbor. The fleet includes a 2003 vintage boat that served as a practice ship for Team New Zealand long before the twin-hulled, hydrofoil catamarans of present-day racing came along. But the older model still provides plenty of speed and the crew encourages all passengers to steer and crank on the grinders to adjust the sails throughout the trip.\n\n7) 3:30 p.m. SHOP LOCAL\n\nThe 16-acre waterfront development Britomart, wedged between the harbor and the Central Business District, or C.B.D., mixes historic and new buildings that are rapidly filling with upscale tenants. A strong contingent of them wave the Kiwi flag for fashion, including boutiques from local designers such as Karen Walker, known for refining street styles in ruffle-edge dresses and cropped stovepipe pants; Trelise Cooper, whose dresses combine bohemian silhouettes with glam touches; and Kathryn Wilson, a women\u2019s shoemaker with a taste for embellishment. Men get equal attention at Zambesi Store which makes progressive fashion for both sexes, and the spirited World which supplements its inventory of colorful, avant-garde looks with boutique beauty brands.\n\n8) 6 p.m. BRITOMART BITES\n\nChic cafes spill into the streets that web the Britomart district, offering convenient respite. The new Amano scales up farm-to-table and nose-to-tail cooking to serve sizable crowds in a former warehouse with rough plaster walls and exposed beams. An open kitchen spans the space, making theater of chefs cutting fresh pasta or roasting chicken. The menu champions New Zealand ingredients from Kaipara oysters (4 dollars each), to grilled lamb chops (34 dollars). Down the street, the similarly seasonal Ortolana offers fewer but no-less-sophisticated choices \u2014 try kingfish crudo (20 dollars) and pasta with clams (29 dollars) \u2014 plus superb people-watching from the patio or the conservatory indoors.", "title": "36 Hours in Auckland", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "Stop drinking soda\n\nThis one is a no-brainer. Sweetened beverages account for about 47 percent of added sugar in the American diet, and they are essentially nutrient-free calorie-delivery vehicles. A 16-ounce bottle of Coke contains 52 grams of sugar, more than your entire daily limit.\n\nIf you drink soda for the caffeine, switch to tea or coffee. If it\u2019s the carbonation or the convenience of having a drink in a can handy, try switching to a seltzer like La Croix (my personal beverage of choice \u2014 try the coconut flavor!).\n\nPhoto\n\nWatch your breakfast\n\nSugar is stealthily sneaked into many breakfast foods that are marketed as \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnatural.\u201d Flavored yogurts, for example, are loaded with sugar, and fruit juices are an easy way to drink tons of sugar without realizing.\n\nFor your morning meal, try to eat more grain-based foods with low or little sugar, like Cheerios, plain oatmeal, bread and homemade granola, Mr. Leonhardt suggests. And if you want to skip grains altogether, great options include scrambled or fried eggs, whole fruits, plain yogurt and nuts.\n\nFor even more breakfast recipes, check out these breakfast recipes from whole30, a more radical diet that forces out all sugar, in addition to other items. (A personal favorite crash diet of yours truly.)\n\nCheck the sauces\n\nAs with breakfast foods, food producers sneak more sugar into sauces and condiments than you\u2019d guess \u2014 for example, two of the four biggest ingredients in Heinz Ketchup are sweeteners, Mr. Leonhardt writes.\n\nRead the labels on sauces and see how high sugar is listed, and watch out for sugar by another name, like high fructose corn syrup.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome sauces that don\u2019t rely on sugar for flavor are Maille dijon mustard, Gulden\u2019s spicy brown, French\u2019s Yellow Mustard, Prego\u2019s Marinara, and Newman\u2019s Own Classic Oil and Vinegar salad dressing.\n\nTry a diet reset\n\nMr. Leonhardt\u2019s own reckoning with sugar came when he cut sugar out of his diet for an entire month, which he wrote about here. I had a similar experience years ago when I tried Whole30 for the first time (and wrote about it here), and it is truly shocking how much sugar we eat without even realizing it.\n\nIf a full month sounds like too big an undertaking, try this: The next time you\u2019re making a big shopping trip at the grocery store, stop to read the ingredients label of every single thing you buy. Watch out for keywords that are used to disguise sugar \u2014 like dextrose, fructose, saccharose, agave nectar and evaporated cane juice \u2014 and take stock of how much sugar you\u2019ve been eating without even realizing it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "The problem, of course, is that Staub got so much of his on-base production through walks rather than hits. He finished his career with a good-but-not-great 2,716 hits, and a truly spectacular 1,255 walks. Those totals propelled him to a .362 career on-base percentage, which when combined with his .431 slugging percentage, and adjusted for his home parks and era, made him 24 percent better than the average batter for the duration of his career. Only 19 batters in major league history finished their careers with as many at-bats as Staub (9,720) and an adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage higher than his (124).\n\nBut Staub gets overlooked by plenty of people because for the majority of fans a hit will always trump a walk, or even several walks. It was this concept that led to the sabermetrics world coming up with a theoretical conversion to provide context on a player who derives so much value from walks. Popularized by Joe Posnanski, among others, the concept is to trade 500 of a player\u2019s walks for an additional 325 singles to see if that makes you view the player in a different light. It is a slightly inexact application of Pete Palmer\u2019s concept of linear weights, which is a process of assigning point values to various statistics so they can be properly compared.\n\nIf you execute that trade for Staub you are left with a popular player who finished his career with 3,041 hits and 755 walks. As just about anyone with a passing interest in baseball statistics can tell you, the only members of the 3,000-hit club that reached Hall of Fame eligibility without being inducted are Rose and Palmeiro. It is not a stretch to think that if Staub had finished with those totals \u2014 keep in mind, this trade would result in his having reached base 175 fewer times \u2014 he would have sailed into the Hall, especially considering he would have been just the 16th or 17th player to reach 3,000 hits depending on how things shook out between him and Rod Carew.\n\nIn fairness to the voters who went against him, Staub is an exceptional case and by almost every accepted measure he is rightly excluded from the Hall. Jay Jaffe\u2019s useful career evaluation tool, known as JAWS, pegs Staub as the 35th best right fielder in major league history. There are some players ranked below him that managed to make it to Cooperstown, but there are plenty ahead of him who did not.\n\nBut Staub, at the very least, was a curiosity deserving of far more notoriety than he was afforded during and after his career. A remarkably durable player who hit his first home run at 19 and his last at 41, Staub did not look much like an elite athlete, but he managed to turn a fairly brief stint as one of the game\u2019s true stars into an extended career as a guy who simply knew how to get on base. And while the general public may not have appreciated just how gifted he was in that all-important skill, a survey of fans of the Montreal Expos and the Mets would reveal that many of the people who saw him the most knew just how important he was.", "title": "4,050 Reasons to Appreciate Rusty Staub", "authors": ["Benjamin Hoffman", "Keeping Score"]}

Mr. Trump, who won the district by about 20 percentage points, campaigned personally for Mr. Saccone, as did Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, a top presidential aide.\n\n\u201cRick is going to vote for us all the time,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a weekend rally, where he called Mr. Saccone\u2019s rival \u201cLamb the Sham.\u201d\n\nBut polling has shown Mr. Trump\u2019s political appeal receding in the district, and a Monmouth University poll published on Monday found that his approval rating there was 49 percent \u2014 identical to his disapproval rating.\n\nMr. Lamb may also benefit from the Democratic enthusiasm seen in special elections since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, as angry voters on the left turn out to send a message of opposition to the president.\n\nIf Mr. Trump cannot deliver victory for Republicans in a district like this one, there may be few places for him to campaign helpfully in the fall. During a long and unfocused speech on Saturday night, Mr. Trump appeared aware of the personal stakes. \u201cI hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all watching because I won this district, like by 22 points.\u201d\n\n[Read about why The Times decided to bring back \u201cThe Needle\u201d]\n\nPhoto\n\nLamb\u2019s Pelosi Playbook\n\nRepublicans have battered Mr. Lamb with a familiar set of attacks meant to disqualify him with conservative-leaning voters. Most of all, they have tried to tie him to Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is intensely unpopular in districts like this one. Should Mr. Saccone prevail, it could be a testament to the enduring power of an attack Republicans have deployed every two years for a decade.\n\nBut Mr. Lamb has said that he would not support Ms. Pelosi for speaker of the House \u2014 and if he wins, other Democrats in Trump country might feel free to make the same pledge. When Republicans began airing Pelosi-themed ads, Mr. Lamb responded with a blunt commercial of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don\u2019t support Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Lamb said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lamb has broken with the national Democratic Party in other ways, too, declining to support new gun regulations and downplaying his disagreements with Mr. Trump. If that approach works, it would probably embolden other moderate Democrats to go their own way in deep-red areas, and perhaps encourage candidates across the board to distance themselves from Ms. Pelosi as a partisan lightning rod.\n\nTwo Americas in One District\n\nWhile it was historically steel-and-coal country, this district, like much of greater Pittsburgh, is more complex than the caricature drawn from its hard-hat past. Part of the reason this race has become so competitive is that the district includes affluent enclaves, like Upper St. Clair and Mt. Lebanon, that have previously gone Republican but are now uneasy with Mr. Trump, as voters are in other upscale suburbs across the country.\n\nThese communities, home to a swath of Pittsburgh\u2019s professional class and more than a few of the city\u2019s professional athletes and coaches, will have to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Lamb if he is to have a chance to win. He will need those votes to offset the more rural and Republican-leaning parts of the district, in the counties on the West Virginia border and in areas closer to Johnstown, Pa. This terrain is more unambiguously Trump country, and more closely resembles the western Pennsylvania conjured by the film \u201cThe Deer Hunter.\u201d\n\nThe district is not going to be around much longer. The state Supreme Court threw out the state\u2019s current congressional map as an unfair partisan gerrymander, and issued a new map last month with very different district boundaries. Whoever wins on Tuesday will have to decide soon which new district to run in for the next election in November.\n\nThe Role of Unions\n\nMr. Trump would not have carried Pennsylvania and other parts of the industrial Midwest in 2016 had it not been for the support he drew from rank-and-file union members.\n\nTo try to lure many of those Trump voters, Mr. Lamb has highlighted his military service, voiced support for the president\u2019s steel tariffs, and generally done all he could to avoid the liberal label.\n\nIt was not by happenstance that Mr. Biden, with his ties to organized labor, was the only major national Democrat with whom he campaigned. Laying hands on Mr. Lamb at a union carpenter\u2019s facility recently, Mr. Biden offered a succinct bit of testimony: \u201cHe is not afraid to say the word \u2018union.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf Mr. Lamb prevails, it will probably be in large measure because he recaptured some of the unionized workers who have been drifting away from the Democrats. And Republicans know it: As part of their final push in the race, the leading House Republican \u201csuper PAC\u201d created a digital ad made to look like a cable television news report portraying Mr. Lamb as supposedly reaching a \u201cboiling point\u201d with labor unions. The headline on the screen says \u201cDemocrat Abandons PA Unions,\u201d as the ad makes note of Mr. Lamb saying he opposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Other books are more hopeful: Jesse Ball\u2019s novel \u201cCensus\u201d may tell the story of a functionary volunteering to carry out a mysterious government project, but at heart it remains a tender exploration of a poignant father-son relationship. And while Dara Horn\u2019s novel \u201cEternal Life\u201d takes organized religion as one theme\u2014 it unfolds against the backdrop of 2,000 years of Jewish history \u2014 it also features a heroine who comes to understand, through love, why everyone around her clings so hard to life.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nCENSUS, by Jesse Ball. (Ecco, $25.99.) In Jesse Ball\u2019s new novel, full of the author\u2019s signature surreal flourishes, a father learns he has a fatal disease and decides to travel across the country with his young son, who has Down syndrome. The book was inspired by Ball\u2019s relationship with his brother, Abram, who had Down syndrome and died at 24 in 1998. \u201cAs a boy, Ball expected that he would grow up to look after his brother, a possibility that brought him anxiety but also quiet contentment.

Freeman. (Norton, $27.95.) In this rich and ambitious history, Joshua B. Freeman depicts a world in retreat that still looms large in the national imagination. He traces the rise of the factory and how it became entwined with Enlightenment ideas of progress. \u201cNow that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, \u201cit can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us.\u201d\n\nA FALSE REPORT: A True Story of Rape in America, by T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong. (Crown, $28.) This is the \u201cJohn Grisham-worthy\u201d true-life account of a rape investigation in which the victim was bullied into recanting her story before evidence surfaced, years later, to prove she was telling the truth all along. \u201cMiller and Armstrong tell their story plainly, expertly and well,\u201d Emily Bazelon writes in her review. \u201cIt\u2019s gripping and needs no dressing up.\u201d Bazelon adds that the case\u2019s resolution helped the victim get on with an interrupted life. \u201cThat\u2019s the larger lesson of a nonfiction narrative like this one,\u201d she writes: \u201cIt continues, beyond a book\u2019s pages.\u201d\n\nWE THE CORPORATIONS: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights, by Adam Winkler. (Liveright, $28.95.) A law professor argues that corporations have been inseparable from American culture and government since the nation\u2019s founding \u2014 often to the detriment of individual citizens \u2014 and traces methodical corporate efforts throughout American history and case law to expand the rights and very definition of corporations, with the result, he writes, that today they have \u201cnearly all the same rights as individuals.\u201d Reviewing the book, Zephyr Teachout says it \u201cprovides a masterful retrospective map at a time when people are feeling bewildered and enraged by growing corporate power.\u201d\n\nETERNAL LIFE, by Dara Horn. (Norton, $25.95.) What are the downsides of living forever? Horn explores this idea through the story of Rachel, who has been alive for 2,000 years and is getting a little tired of it. \u201cThe hard part isn\u2019t living forever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s making life worth living.\u201d The origins of Rachel\u2019s predicament date back to the days of the Roman occupation of Jerusalem, meaning that Jewish history and the lives of the characters are intertwined \u2014 \u201cas is often the case in Horn\u2019s fiction,\u201d our reviewer, Joshua Max Feldman, notes. \u201cThe question at the heart of this wise and appealing novel is finally not how Rachel finds meaning in her eternal life,\u201d he concludes. \u201cIt is how we, despite our portions of sorrow, tedium and disaster, persist in finding meaning in ours.\u201d", "title": "5 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

The interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nMatthew Girling, the global chief executive of Bonhams, is a jewelry specialist \u2014 and the house is not known for watches. Is your appointment an effort to move that needle?\n\nI think so, yes. I have known Matthew for quite a few years on a professional basis, so it was good to speak with him and then have the opportunity to come to Bonhams. My field is watches, and I\u2019ve been in this field for 20 years \u2014 so it was quite nice to come back to Hong Kong. Back in 1997 was the first time that I came over, obviously with another auction house.

And I think watches is one medium that\u2019s very good because they connect with so many different people.\n\nAre there regional trends that you\u2019re following or trying to anticipate?\n\nThe other houses have a goal of going online, which is good in some ways: It cuts out a lot of costs involved in auctions. But you are missing out on that connectivity with the clientele. It becomes very much more of a synthetic type of relationship; it\u2019s a name, and a body, but it\u2019s not somebody that you know. You have an address, and they buy, and off you go. So I think that those relationships, perhaps, are being lost.\n\nAre there pockets of Asia that you\u2019re watching, or markets that you find interesting?\n\nIt will be interesting to see the development of places like Vietnam. I quite like following Southeast Asian paintings, and I\u2019ve noticed that now the sales are incorporating artists from Myanmar and places like that. So it\u2019s interesting to see whether, in these countries, there may be pockets of collectors sprouting up. They\u2019re all developing wealth in their own particular ways.\n\nIs that a loaner you\u2019re wearing on your wrist?\n\nNo, this is a Rolex Explorer II that\u2019s been with me for years.

The properties in these areas have nightly rates at least 20 percent lower than ones in touristy spots. Or, consider renting a luxury apartment, which can be between 30 and 50 percent less expensive than a luxury hotel. Sites like Access Italy and OneFineStay offer a portfolio of Rome apartment rentals.\n\nDine Smart\n\nStay away from the overpriced, average restaurants situated in Piazza Navona, Pantheon and Campo dei Fiori, Rome\u2019s main squares. You\u2019ll enjoy less expensive and tastier meals and also get more of a local flavor of the city by dining at spots in Monti, especially on Via Urbani, where there are some excellent trattorias. Other areas worth visiting for great local restaurants include Via del Corallo, Piazza del Fico, Via Giulia and Via del Governo Vecchio.\n\nWhen it comes to lunch, Mr. Amorico suggested enjoying a thin-crust pizza (around $10) at a pizzeria or going to a trattoria for a bowl of pasta (around $12) such as his favorite, cacio e pepe. This strategy allows you to save your money for a nice dinner or two with wine in some of Rome\u2019s terrific seafood and fine dining spots.

Pick the colors based on where you\u2019re going.\n\nIf you\u2019re headed to Paris or another urban destination, for example, any combination of black, white, navy and charcoal is a good bet. For a beach vacation or outdoors excursion, khaki, off-white (or white) and bright hues like orange or yellow always work.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "My guess is that if Martin Luther King Jr. of 1968 were to return to 2018 America, he would be unsurprised by some of what he\u2019d find: the staggering numbers of black men in jail; the recurrent killings of unarmed black youths by police; the emboldened presence of white supremacism. As a leader, he shaped a great humanitarian movement; as a thinker, he came to understand humanism\u2019s deep flaws.\n\nI wonder what he would think about how we engage with the history he helped create. A glance at contemporary art might give him some clues. In 1988, the African-American artist Glenn Ligon took as a subject a foundational civil rights emblem, the \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d strike placard, and did several things to it simultaneously: He replicated it, customized it, and critiqued it.\n\nHe turned it into a painting. In doing so, he paid homage to the mass-printed original; he gave its adamant words a new, queer dimension (Mr. Ligon is gay); and he turned an activist artifact, one that functioned as demand for economic equity, into an elite museum object, its text now done in glossy, light-catching enamel. (The painting is currently on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, in honor of the King anniversary.)\n\nPhoto\n\nOn multiple levels, Mr. Ligon made a piece of civil rights history his own, though attempts by other artists to do something similar have backfired. A recent example is the painting \u201cOpen Casket\u201d by Dana Schutz, in the 2017 Whitney Biennial. The source of the image in this case was also a movement icon: a 1955 post mortem photograph of Emmett Till, a black teenager who, after being accused of whistling at a white woman, was murdered. At his mother\u2019s insistence, Till\u2019s tortured body was put on public view and photographed. The pictures, printed in Jet magazine, are credited with bringing many people into the civil rights movement, among them Dr. King.\n\nAt the Whitney, the painting sparked protests by some black artists who demanded its removal. At issue was that Ms. Schutz is white. Dr. King\u2019s initial vision for the civil rights movement was one of racial harmony; blacks and whites working together to achieve equal lives for all. Possibly in those early days, Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting might have passed as a gesture of solidarity.\n\nBut by 1968, it was clear, even to moderate blacks, that sharing power was not likely to happen. For the Whitney protesters, \u201cOpen Casket\u201d was an emblem of the continuing exercise of white privilege that, in this case, allowed a white-controlled museum and a white artist to lay claim to a sensational image of black pain.\n\nI suspect that the Dr. King of Room 306 would have understood the protesters\u2019 point. In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, given in 1964, when he was 35, he said that he could not, would not, permit himself to envision a world in which humanity was \u201cso tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.\u201d But over the next four years, as Vietnam ground on, civil rights activists met violent ends, and race wars laid waste to American cities, daybreak must have seemed far-off.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo idealists of the 21st century, it may seem that on many social, economic and ethical fronts the country has come to what seems a futureless halt, just as the museum\u2019s civil rights story does. But rather than exit the scene in weariness or frustration, we would do well to go back in time. If we stay alert, we can find instruction there.\n\nThe emphasis of the present-day protest movements is on inclusion: equal salaries, equal education, the right to marry. The goal is to get a share in the system. The civil rights movement began with that goal too, then realized that the system was the problem. Dr. King eventually came to this conviction, and in some ways it made the end of his life hard, complicated and unsettled.\n\nOther people, however, held that view all along, and many of them were women. Sexism was rampant within the movement leadership. Women were expected to make coffee, make nice and stay home. Some, like Ella Baker, a tireless civil rights organizer, refused. True monuments have yet to be raised to enough of these women. One, Fannie Lou Hamer (1917-1977), was a monument herself.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Mississippi Delta field worker, she was jailed and beaten when she tried to register to vote at 46, but went on to run for Congress.

Hundreds were arrested; others were blasted with fire hoses. When people rebuked Dr. King for putting young people at risk, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t hold them back if they want to go to jail. For they are doing a job not only for themselves, but for all of America and for all mankind.\u201d The world reacted, shamed the city and Birmingham took its first steps toward desegregation.", "title": "50 Years After Dr. King\u2019s Death, New Lessons for Today", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

An impossible documentary, at once austere and rhapsodic, it evokes the 18th century while feeling as present as a live concert.\n\nThe movie is being released here on Friday in an excellent new 4K digital restoration on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.\n\nMost simply described, \u201cChronicle\u201d is a feature-length series of recitals, nearly always filmed from a fixed camera in a single, uninterrupted take. The music was recorded from a microphone placed by the camera and the musicians, who play authentic 18th-century instruments and are dressed in clothing from that period.

But bringing high-speed service to underserved areas \u2014 closing the digital divide \u2014 has also been one of Mr. Pai\u2019s central arguments for reining in local regulations.

Mobilitie, one of the nation\u2019s largest cell-tower operators, submitted an unofficial plan in Montgomery County, Md., in the fall, designating where the company might want to place small cells. Of the 215 small-cell sites in that plan, only 11 were in areas with fewer than 1,000 people per square mile.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disingenuous to suggest that the need to pre-empt urban areas\u2019 ordinances is so we can bring broadband to rural areas,\u201d said Mitsuko R. Herrera, the county\u2019s technology special projects director. \u201cThere is zero evidence to support that premise.\u201d\n\nJason Caliento, a Mobilitie senior vice president, agreed. \u201cSmall cells are a tool in the toolbox, but alone are not going to solve the rural divide,\u201d he said.\n\nIn January, Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, Calif., resigned his seat on an F.C.C. 5G advisory committee, saying it was rigged to give industry what it wanted \u201cwithout any obligation to provide broadband access to underserved residents.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mr. Pai said the F.C.C. looked forward to working with the committee \u201cto remove regulatory barriers to broadband deployment and to extend digital opportunity to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe wireless industry has filed multiple comments to the F.C.C. complaining about delays from local governments. AT&T executives said officials in California, whom they did not identify, had delayed deployment of small cells by more than 800 days because they \u201cscrutinized\u201d antenna designs, radio-frequency exposure and effects on property values, among other things. Companies have suggested cutting local approval windows by a month or more.\n\nCities and counties argue the delays are caused by the wireless companies themselves. Officials in Montgomery County said Mobilitie had routinely filed incomplete applications that caused months of setbacks.\n\nPhoto\n\nMobilitie officials said their relationship with local governments was \u201cevolving\u201d and leading to better collaboration. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen more progress\u201d than has occurred lately, Mr. Caliento said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCity officials say shortening reviews risks small-cell facilities becoming unsightly and unsafe.\n\nThat is what worries Donna Baron, a 75-year-old retiree who learned a streetlight near her home on DuFief Drive in North Potomac, Md., was marked to become a small cell, as were dozens more nearby. She held up an image of a possible cell station that might replace the light.\n\n\u201cThe pole is a lot rounder, it has boxes on it and a huge fake mailbox at the bottom,\u201d Ms. Baron said. If the F.C.C. pre-empts local rules, \u201cyou\u2019re going to end up with a Medusa, with a bunch more stuff attached.\u201d\n\nWireless companies are also asking the F.C.C. to cap local fees. AT&T says that three California cities assess fees of $2,600 to $8,000 a year per attachment, and that a \u201cGeorgia municipality is considering an annual fee of $6,000 per node.\u201d\n\nDavid Young, who manages infrastructure leases for Lincoln, Neb., said he understood the carriers\u2019 frustration. But he said cities had a responsibility to charge fair rates. He has negotiated with wireless companies to pay $1,995 a year per pole. He set the rate based on market analysis, which he discussed with the companies. \u201cThey were quite happy to pay the price that we asked,\u201d Mr. Young said.\n\nTexas cities can\u2019t negotiate rates. Last year, the State Legislature passed a law pushed by AT&T that allows cities to charge carriers no more than $250 per pole each year. Before the law, cities often charged $1,500 to $2,500 a year per pole, and the change will cost Texas cities as much as $1 billion over eight years, the Texas Municipal League estimated.\n\nAT&T argues that charging fees not based on cost violates the federal Communications Act, which blocks local governments from prohibiting broadband services.\n\nA group of Texas cities led by the city of McAllen, near the Mexico border, filed a lawsuit last year against the state, arguing that the new cell-site law violated the state Constitution, which prohibits the Legislature from forcing cities to grant something of value to corporations.\n\nLawyers representing Texas argue the state has the authority to cap municipalities\u2019 pole rental fees. During oral arguments in December, a judge denied the state\u2019s motion for dismissal, and last month denied the cities\u2019 request for a temporary injunction.

It is not often that one looks at a program and thinks that Beethoven\u2019s titanic \u201cHammerklavier\u201d Sonata might well be the less interesting half of a concert. But Mr. Aimard is always full of surprises. Before that Beethoven, which he will doubtless play with his usual analytical fervor, comes music by Liszt, Messiaen, Scriabin and an oddity: the post-Scriabin avant-gardist Nikolai Obukhov.\n\n212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org\n\nINON BARNATAN at the 92nd Street Y (March 3, 8 p.m.).

Its entirety comprises \u201cMoments musicaux,\u201d and it looks at how the idea of a \u201cmoment\u201d has changed over time. Schubert, the obvious composer in the genre, is here with his reflective set of six pieces, and Rachmaninoff, too, demanding greater virtuosity. Rightly, there is a contemporary take as well, with two pieces by Avner Dorman.\n\n212-415-5500, 92y.org\n\nCLAIRE CHASE at the Kitchen (March 2, 8 p.m.; March 3, 5 and 8:30 p.m.).

Its music director, Kirill Petrenko, soon off to the Berlin Philharmonic, leads both concerts, the first of which includes Brahms\u2019s Double Concerto, with the soloists Julia Fischer and Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott, and Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cManfred\u201d Symphony.

At the festival, Ms. Varda introduced her movie by proclaiming that the attendees were going to see \u201ca film about women who were also people.\u201d\n\nMs. Varda discussed gender imbalance in movies. \u201cIs there such a thing as a woman\u2019s film, of special interest to women? We have to see, they haven\u2019t had any choice,\u201d she said. Ms. Varda wanted to portray female relationships on film. \u201cThere are always stories about virile male friendships, Brando and Nicholson, Newman and Redford and so on, but not about friendship between women. The women are always motherly or tarty.\u201d\n\n1986: \u2018She aims to unsettle.\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Varda\u2019s film \u201cVagabond\u201d won the Golden Lion at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, making her the second female director to receive the prize. Annette Insdorf noted that the film had \u201clittle in common with the Parisian farces, American blockbusters and urban thrillers that dominated the French box office.\u201d Ms. Varda said she wanted to \u201cmake a film about the real France \u2014 not Parisian intellectuals \u2014 the France that is completely ignored in contemporary cinema.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s star, Sandrine Bonnaire, had become \u201cone of the most sought-after screen artists in her country.\u201d Ms. Varda said she sold Ms. Bonnaire on the film by telling her that the character would be \u201calone, dirty and rebellious, and she dies of the cold. Miss Bonnaire was delighted.\u201d\n\n1997: \u2018I think I was a feminist before being born.\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art screened all of Ms. Varda\u2019s films in a retrospective of her work in 1997. When Mel Gussow spoke to Ms. Varda about the tribute, she said, \u201cAt least it doesn\u2019t say posthume.\u201d The story describes her point of view on the art of filmmaking, including her case for the auteur theory. \u201cAuteurs are much attacked nowadays because people say they are selfish and narcissistic, that they don\u2019t want to listen to anybody. It\u2019s true \u2014 and so what?\u201d\n\nShe also speaks to her origins as a feminist. \u201cI think I was a feminist before being born. I had a feminist chromosome somewhere.\u201d She describes hating Snow White as a child. \u201c I could see she was behaving stupidly, cleaning the dishes, brooming everything for these monsters. It was ridiculous \u2014 and waiting for the ugly prince.\u201d\n\n2001: \u2018They called me \u2018The Ancestor of the New Wave,\u2019 but I was only 30.\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Varda spoke to Leslie Camhi in 2001 about her inspiration for the film \u201cThe Gleaners and I,\u201d which focused on people who live off the garbage thrown out by others. Ms. Varda told Ms. Camhi the film was \u201cabout an ill society, that does a poor job of sharing its bounty \u2014 but the very people who are living through that difficulty point the finger and teach us about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Camhi tied \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d to the socially conscious themes of Ms. Varda\u2019s other work and detailed her legacy, including how Ms. Varda, then 72, was crowned \u201cthe ancestor of the New Wave\u201d at the age of 30.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like those old painters who don\u2019t bother to make sketches or ask permissions.

Scott spoke to Ms. Varda about her documentary \u201cThe Beaches of Agn\u00e8s.\u201d The film \u201cis a cinematic memoir in two senses,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. \u201cAn autobiography rendered in carefully chosen, meaning-rich images and the account of a life lived in, through and for cinema.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the queen of the margins, but the films are loved. The films are remembered,\u201d Ms. Varda said of her career. \u201cAnd this is my aim \u2014 to be loved as a filmmaker because I want to share emotions, to share the pleasure of being a filmmaker.\u201d\n\n2017: \u2018One of the greatest.\u2019\n\nMs. Varda\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201cFaces Places\u201d was a Times Critic\u2019s Pick, and both chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and Mr. Scott, named it one of the best films of the year. \u201cContemplating some of the sorrows in her own past and the precariousness of the European present, she keeps gloom at bay with her resilient faith in the power of art to conserve and expand human dignity,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cEvery second of this movie proves her right.\u201d\n\nMs. Dargis takes it a step further. \u201cMs. Varda is often described as one of the greatest female directors alive, which is true.

In some of the hardest hit areas of the country, markets are already solving the housing problem. If the government really wants to help, instead of bailing out irresponsible mortgage holders, it should support new and younger families who want to buy starter homes and begin to climb the ladder of prosperity.

That does not generally include new and younger families, who have little credit history and are considered riskier than those with a track record of on-time payments.

Mismatched signals may have set up the talks to fail.\n\nUsually, before high-level talks like these, both sides spend a long time telegraphing their expected outcomes.\n\nSuch signals serve as public commitments, both to the other side of the negotiation and to citizens back home. It\u2019s a way for both sides to test one another\u2019s demands and offers, reducing the risk of surprise or embarrassment.\n\nThat is not really how things have proceeded with the United States and North Korea. Mr. Trump has already committed to granting North Korea one of its most desired concessions: a high-level meeting between the heads of state.\n\nIn exchange, North Korea has not publicly committed to anything. It has, quite cannily, channeled its public communications through South Korea, making it easier to renege.\n\nFurther, Mr. Trump has declared \u201cdenuclearization\u201d as his minimal acceptable outcome for talks, making it harder for him to accept a more modest (but more achievable!) outcome and costlier for him to walk away.\n\nThe table is now set in such a way that virtually any outcome is a win for North Korea, but only a very narrow and difficult range of outcomes will save the United States from an embarrassing failure.\n\nThe North Koreans can walk away more freely, while the Americans will be more desperate to come home with some sort of win. It\u2019s a formulation that puts the Americans at significant disadvantage before talks even begin.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. The sides do not agree on the point of talking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth belaboring the costs of skipping the usual process of mutual public signaling.\n\nSouth Korean officials have said that Mr. Kim is willing to enter talks for \u201cdenuclearization\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s that word again \u2014 which is perhaps why Mr. Trump seems to believe this will happen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based analyst, writes in a column in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists that \u201cdenuclearization\u201d means vastly different things to the United States and North Korea.\n\nAmericans understand the word as describing North Korea\u2019s full nuclear disarmament, which is very difficult to imagine happening.\n\nBut North Koreans, she writes, tend to mean it as a kind of mutual and incremental disarmament in which the United States also gives up weapons.\n\nNormally, the United States and North Korea would have issued months, even years, of public statements on their goals for direct talks, to clear all this up.\n\nBut, again, the Americans have made splashy public commitments while letting the North Koreans get by without doing the same.\n\nPhoto\n\n4.

Lower-level officials can lose face or sacrifice credibility for the sake of talks. Heads of state are much too constrained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRobert E. Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University, wrote on Twitter that, in a more typical process, \u201cthere would be a series of concessions and counter-concessions building trust and credibility over time (likely years) eventually rising to a serious discussion of denuclearization.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is jumping straight to the last step.\n\nThere is little obvious gain in skipping over a process that is intended to lock North Korea into public commitments, test what is achievable and ensure maximum American leverage and flexibility.\n\nThere is potentially significant downside, though. Victor Cha, a well-respected North Korea expert, warns in a New York Times Op-Ed essay, \u201cFailed negotiations at the summit level leave all parties with no other recourse for diplomacy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n5. The State Department is in a shambles.\n\nWouldn\u2019t this be a good moment to have an American ambassador to South Korea? Or an under secretary of state for arms control and international security?\n\nBoth posts are empty. The desk for assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs is occupied by a respected but interim official who has clashed with the White House. Her boss, the under secretary for political affairs, is retiring.\n\nMr. Trump lacks the institutional support and assistance that more experienced presidents found essential. There will be fewer high-level diplomats to run parallel talks, fewer midlevel officials to assist and brief the president, fewer analysts to feel out North Korean intentions and capabilities.\n\nThis is why the emerging conventional wisdom among analysts, as summed up by The Economist, is that \u201cMr. Trump \u2014 a man who boasts about his television ratings, and who is bored by briefings and scornful of foreign alliances \u2014 could end up being played like a gold-plated violin.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n6. Everything could turn on the president\u2019s personality.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s headstrong personalization of North Korea policy may be the most significant aspect of all this.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt means that talks and their outcome will be determined, to an unprecedented degree, by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal biases and impulses. By his mood at the time of talks. By his particular style of negotiation.\n\nMr. Kelly expressed concern over Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cchaotic management style, erratic, moody personality and chronic staffing problems.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s not ideology talking. I am a registered Republican and worked once for a G.O.P. congressman.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s negotiating record as president, mostly focused on domestic legislative matters, is instructive.\n\nHe has tended to oscillate unpredictably between policies, throwing talks over the budget or health care into chaos. He has set members of his own party against one another, weakening their position against Democrats.

The first, which features the multitalented Keisha Zollar as a writer and cast member, is set in the year 2036. Trump is still president because term limits have been ignored, and President Obama\u2019s daughters must come to America\u2019s rescue.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "Though he left his eponymous label nearly a decade ago, there are few designers as influential today as Martin Margiela. While he aspired to be invisible \u2014 to the point of refusing to be photographed and conducting all interviews by fax or email \u2014 Margiela\u2019s impact is writ large on the contemporary fashion landscape. So many of his innovations \u2014 once radical \u2014 have become accepted norms in the industry (his deconstructed tailoring, his championing of recycling and his pioneering of the see-now buy-now model, to name but a few). Brands as diverse as Vetements, Marques\u2019Almeida and The Row continually mine his archive for inspiration. The conceptual Belgian designer is being celebrated in two separate exhibitions in Paris this month: a retrospective at the Palais Galliera, which examines his career until he retired in 2009, and another at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, which premiered in Antwerp last year and catalogs his six-year tenure designing for Herm\u00e8s.\n\nAfter starting his own label in 1988 with his business partner Jenny Meirens, Margiela spent the next two decades establishing an entirely new vocabulary for clothing \u2014 the \u201ccigarette\u201d shoulder, the iconic cloven-footed Tabi boot, the unfinished edges and paint-splattered surfaces, the repurposing of vintage garments into new clothes. He constantly questioned the received norms of luxury \u2014 particularly during his unconventional shows, which upended the traditional catwalk format, taking over abandoned Metro stations and, once, a Salvation Army store.\n\nBut the designer\u2019s fall/winter 2000 collection was perhaps the finest expression of many of his career-long preoccupations. The show was staged inside a disused freight train docked in a loading bay in Paris\u2019s 19th Arrondissement, and models walked to a dissonant instrumental track from David Lynch\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\u201d film soundtrack. The show saw Margiela develop the oversize concept he\u2019d introduced the previous season \u2014 garments came in an Italian size 78 \u2014 but he also experimented with new techniques, such as baking knitwear over an XXXL dummy to retain its voluminous form. While some critics found the show's setting \u201cdisturbing,\u201d the clothes, with their blown-out proportions, achieved a new sculptural elegance. On the occasion of the Galliera exhibition, some of Margiela\u2019s longtime collaborators and fans share their memories of the designer and that radical show.", "title": "7 Martin Margiela Fans and Collaborators Remember His Most Radical Show", "authors": []}

First the physical: John Banville\u2019s \u201cTime Pieces\u201d offers a nostalgist\u2019s reflective tour of Dublin, Mark Whitaker\u2019s \u201cSmoketown\u201d excavates an overlooked bastion of African-American culture in Pittsburgh, and Patricia Vigderman\u2019s \u201cThe Real Life of the Parthenon\u201d surveys sites of classic antiquity in an attempt to puzzle out the relationship between art and its sources. For readers who favor metaphysical wandering \u2014 or wondering \u2014 Marilynne Robinson has an expansive, inquisitive new essay collection whose title pretty much says it all: \u201cWhat Are We Doing Here?\u201d (Mostly reading, I hope.) Finally, we also feature works of fiction exploring marriage and fate, by Tayari Jones; exile and the afterlife, by Ismail Kadare; and notions of evil and the other, in a book that pairs art by Del Samatar with text by his sister, Sofia Samatar.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nWHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? Essays, by Marilynne Robinson. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.) In essays that are characteristically rigorous and combative, Robinson wrestles with various points of civics and theology. \u201cIt\u2019s an intellectual autobiography \u2014 a starchy, ardent and, on occasion, surprisingly personal account of what it means to be the custodian of one\u2019s conscience in a world saturated with orthodoxies,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cIn other words, it\u2019s a passionate treatment of one of Robinson\u2019s longtime preoccupations\u201d and \u201ca dense, eccentric book of profound and generous gifts.\u201d\n\nTIME PIECES: A Dublin Memoir, by John Banville. (Knopf, $26.95.) The Booker Prize-winning novelist wanders Ireland\u2019s capital city, recalling people and places that still live in his memory. Scattered throughout are suitably atmospheric photographs by Paul Joyce. As Roger Rosenblatt notes in his review, Dublin\u2019s pull in the memoir is more or less impressionistic \u2014 \u201cPity the fool who\u2019s reading this book to get a clear and orderly picture\u201d \u2014 but irresistible nonetheless: \u201cTo Banville, an apostle of the ordinary, the deep appeal of city life is that here the ordinary may be made magical.\u201d\n\nTHE REAL LIFE OF THE PARTHENON, by Patricia Vigderman. (Mad Creek/Ohio State University Press, paper, $21.95.) An American scholar visits classic sites of the ancient world in a book that\u2019s part travelogue, part memoir and part musing on our contested cultural heritage. \u201cVigderman approaches her subject evenhandedly, noting that the repatriation of works of art can be seen as a victory for local communities and their sense of identity,\u201d Bruce Boucher writes in his review, \u201cbut she also spots the questionable ties between the handiwork of an ancient Greek vase painter, say, and the inhabitants of modern-day Paestum. \u2026 Behind the examples in this thoughtful book lies the realization that the relationship between the spectator and art is inevitably complex.

Your children may think they can walk on water, but this free event in the Bronx will allow them to prove it. A satellite fair that takes highlights of the annual World Science Festival and transports them outside Manhattan, this daylong adventure offers more than a few startling demonstrations. In addition to that water feat (which happens courtesy of cornstarch and the principles governing what are known as non-Newtonian fluids), this fest will also invite young science fans to investigate a giant pendulum wave; an astroblaster, also known as a seismic accelerator; a space-time simulator that uses marbles to illustrate the theory of general relativity; and many other exhibits and experiments.\n\n212-348-1400, worldsciencefestival.com/cityofscience\n\nJUNOT D\u00cdAZ PRESENTS \u2018ISLANDBORN\u2019 at the Central Library of the Brooklyn Public Library (March 13, 6-8 p.m.). A fresh work by Mr. D\u00edaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, is always an occasion, but this one is especially remarkable for its potential to bring him a whole new generation of fans. \u201cIslandborn,\u201d which will be published simultaneously in English and Spanish by Dial Books for Young Readers, is Mr. D\u00edaz\u2019s first picture book, with illustrations by Leo Espinosa. It chronicles the experiences of Lola, a little New Yorker who, like Mr. D\u00edaz, was born in the Dominican Republic. When asked by her school to draw a picture of her family\u2019s homeland, she seeks out her relatives to weave a story of her roots.

They\u2019re all characters in \u201cHatched,\u201d a dance-theater work for equally young humans: infants to 6-year-olds. Written and directed by Mara McEwin, a founder of the troupe Treehouse Shakers, the show centers on a chick\u2019s hatching and her discovery of her country neighbors, which include a newborn calf, a strutting rooster, cavorting fellow chicks and wild nestlings. These puppet creatures, designed by Patti Gilstrap, will also interact with the audience members, who can \u201cfeed\u201d and play with them. Performed to Anthony Rizzo\u2019s score, the 45-minute production has little dialogue but lots of dance, as the company members show how it feels to fledge and frolic on a farm.\n\n212-715-1914, treehouseshakers.com\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKIDS FLEADH AT THE CRAIC FEST at Cin\u00e9polis Chelsea (March 10, 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m.).

Don\u2019t judge a show by its title. Although this Montreal-based circus production has plenty of foolishness, it\u2019s unlikely to strike young audiences as a fruitless enterprise. Part of the BAMkids series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it stars Jamie Adkins, a clown and acrobat, and Julie Houle, a composer and musician whose instrument \u2014 the tuba \u2014 comes loaded with comic potential. Mr. Adkins\u2019s instrument is his body, which he uses intriguingly, whether he\u2019s navigating a tightrope or juggling with his mouth as well as his hands.

This final family concert in Jazz at Lincoln Center\u2019s season will trace Williams\u2019s life and her career as a pianist, composer and arranger.

Inside Empire Stores, a converted 19th-century warehouse complex in Brooklyn Bridge Park, this new museum branch and its inaugural display explore the borough\u2019s shoreline history. Among its many activities, \u201cWaterfront\u201d invites children to build a city from magnets; dress up like the female Brooklyn Navy Yard welders from World War II; touch and smell goods from the mercantile trade; and, using technology, make brief films in which they insert themselves into historical scenes.

Seder, the name of the traditional Passover meal, means \u201corder,\u201d but sometimes a little disorder can be just as satisfying. Presented by the museum and the Workmen\u2019s Circle, a progressive Jewish organization, this annual event adds contemporary flourishes to the ancient Passover holiday. Children can make crafts, like a cup for Elijah and a tambourine for Miriam \u2014 both biblical invitees to many modern Seders \u2014 and will even meet Moses himself, portrayed by an actor. The day will include a scavenger hunt, holiday foods and social justice projects devoted to Passover\u2019s theme: freedom.\n\n212-219-0302, circle.org\n\n\u2018SHENANIGANS: IRISH CELEBRATION!\u2019 at the Actors Temple Theater (March 17, 3:30 p.m.; March 18, 10:30 a.m.). Many New Yorkers are all too familiar with St. Patrick\u2019s Day shenanigans. The deeds being honored at this theater, however, involve neither rowdy crowds nor alcohol. Written by Brian Barrentine, the creator of Funikijam World Music, an organization presenting world-music classes and programs for children, \u201cShenanigans\u201d offers Irish songs and stories for theatergoers 10 and younger. The tunes helpfully explain not only the meaning of the show\u2019s title but also elements of Irish folklore like leprechauns, banshees and rainbows. Mr. Barrentine stars, along with his Agents of Jam and guest performers from the Aherne Sheehan School of Irish Dance.\n\n347-913-5267, funikijam.com", "title": "7 Things to Do With Your Kids in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

Within three days, they were joined by some 300 others. By summer, the sit-ins had spread to more than 50 cities, and lunch counters were rapidly desegregating.\n\nThe actions of the so-called Greensboro Four led directly to the creation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which the civil rights organizer Ella Baker urged students to form in April 1960 to coordinate the continuing sit-ins. Later, SNCC would play a major role in the Freedom Rides and in voter registration efforts across the South. And the momentum that began at the Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter would eventually contribute to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in public spaces.\n\nPerhaps more than anything, the results of the Greensboro sit-ins showed the power of a small group of students prepared to stand alone if necessary.\n\n\u201cInevitably, people ask me, \u2018What can I do?\u2019\u201d Mr. McCain said in an interview in 2005. \u201cWhat kind of question is that?

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "Before you dive in, it helps to consider the different sorts of fees that residents pay. Type A contracts, as they\u2019re known, are all inclusive. You pay a one-time entry fee, part or all of which may be refundable, plus a monthly rent. In return you get unlimited access to health care services in the facility for the rest of your life. Type C contracts are less expensive up front, and you pay for health services as you need them, at market rates. Type Bs are hybrids of these two. A fourth option: month-to-month rentals with no entry fee.\n\nIt\u2019s important to compare apples with apples. The financials at a community offering full entrance-fee refunds, for example, may look very different from those at a monthly rental home that does not need to hold cash for refunds in reserve.\n\nHere are seven key items to focus on when considering a community\u2019s finances.\n\n\u25a0 Occupancy. If 90 percent or more of a home\u2019s rooms are full \u2014 and have been that way for the past few years \u2014 that suggests it\u2019s doing something right. This is especially important at C.C.R.C.s promising refunds, because you (or your heirs) often don\u2019t get the money back until someone has moved into your old unit.\n\n\u25a0 Rate increases. Lately, most C.C.R.C.s have been increasing their monthly fees by about 3 to 3.5 percent a year, said Justine Vogel, president of RiverWoods, a New Hampshire retirement community. If you see anything above that, ask for an explanation. Similarly, if you find a home where monthly fees have remained unchanged for several years, it may be struggling to maintain its occupancy rate.\n\n\u25a0 Debt rating. Many communities issue bonds to fund expansions or other capital improvements, and Fitch Ratings evaluates them. Ratings of AAA to BBB are considered \u201cinvestment grade\u201d and should bring a measure of comfort to potential residents.\n\n\u25a0 Profitability. You want a community that usually brings in more cash than it spends. When looking at a retirement home\u2019s financial statements, pay special attention to cash operating expenses as a percentage of cash operating revenue, suggested Amy Castleberry, a director at the investment bank Ziegler and a member of the Financial Advisory Panel of the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. A number below 100 means the home is generating enough cash to cover expenses. Communities whose debt gets an investment-grade rating from Fitch have a median score of 96.1 percent.\n\n\u25a0 Capital improvements. Is your community spending enough on its upkeep? One way to gauge this: Find the line for capital spending on its annual financial statement and compare this with the line showing depreciation. Ms. Vogel said she generally liked to see spending equal to at least 50 percent of depreciation, though she conceded that could be way too low if the community hadn\u2019t spent anything in previous years. \u201cYou need to combine that info with a visit to the campus,\u201d she said. \u201cHow does it look? Does it look like they haven\u2019t replaced the carpet in a while? Is the dining venue outdated?\u201d", "title": "7 Ways to Judge a Retirement Community\u2019s Financial Health", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-25 00:00:00", "text": "Sexual Harassment\n\nCracking down on sexual harassment is that rare Albany unicorn, a priority both parties agree on. Even rarer, they seem to agree on how to make it happen: prohibiting secret settlements, banning forced arbitration, standardizing a definition of harassment for all state employees.\n\nBut when it comes to finalizing the details, disagreement prevails as usual. The Senate\u2019s bill defines sexual harassment as \u201cconduct of a sexual nature,\u201d a definition critics call too narrow. The Assembly\u2019s plan requires a neutral arbitrator, while the governor and Senate Republicans want to create an investigative arm within the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, despite critiques that the body lacks independence.\n\nAnd over it all have loomed new accusations that top state officials mishandled harassment claims, including one against Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of a breakaway group of Democrats that collaborates with Republicans. Mr. Klein will be one of \u201cfour men in a room\u201d \u2014 and no women \u2014 negotiating the final budget behind closed doors. (The others are Mr. Cuomo; Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker; and John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader.)\n\nGun Control\n\nPhoto\n\nThe massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida led to a national student movement demanding gun control, but among Albany\u2019s leaders, the response has been a flurry of symbolic action, party division and not a single new law. Republicans who rule the Senate want more security, supporting armed guards in school, but no further gun control; Democrats who rule the Assembly want bans on possessing bump stocks \u2014 which accelerate the firing speed of semiautomatic weapons \u2014 and think that fewer guns, not more, is the answer.\n\nMr. Cuomo leans heavily toward his fellow Democrats on this issue \u2014 he is credited with a 2013 law that banned the sale of so-called assault weapons in the state \u2014 but may have a tough time convincing Republicans. Still, last week, Mr. Cuomo endorsed an idea floated by state Senator Michael Gianaris to put in place a 10-day waiting period for any gun purchase. The governor has repeatedly called for a bump stock ban, and may have some hope for a bill to bar domestic abusers from having firearms.\n\nTax Overhaul\n\nThe governor\u2019s promises in January to overhaul the state\u2019s tax code and shield New Yorkers from the new federal tax plan raised eyebrows. Academics and tax experts said such complicated proposals \u2014 swapping the income tax for a payroll tax, or funneling tax payments through deductible charitable contributions \u2014 had never been tried and shouldn\u2019t be rushed.\n\nNearly three months later, those fears may not even play out. The Senate has rejected both the payroll-tax plan, which the Assembly accepted, and the charitable-contributions tactic, which the Assembly partially rejected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cuomo, perhaps cognizant of the political points he may score for fiery remarks against the Trump administration, has doubled down on his plans. He has joined with other governors to sue the federal government over the tax plan, and in an appearance on WNYC on Friday, insisted that changing the state\u2019s tax laws was \u201cone of our top priorities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This year, Mr. Cuomo has proposed increasing school aid by $769 million, or 3 percent. The Assembly countered with an increase almost twice as large, at $1.5 billion. Even the spending-shy Senate proposed a larger increase, of $957 million.\n\nActivists predicted that the state would spend heavily on education in anticipation of the elections this fall. \u201cNo one wants to go into an election year having their school district make cuts,\u201d said Jasmine Gripper, the legislative director for the advocacy group Alliance for Quality Education.\n\nMr. Cuomo may now have extra incentive to ramp up his support for school funding: His newly announced primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, is a longtime education advocate.\n\nCongestion Pricing\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the battle over how to fund and rehabilitate New York City\u2019s flailing subway system rages on, Mr. Cuomo has thrown his support behind congestion pricing, the idea of charging cars to drive into the busiest part of Manhattan.\n\nBut neither the Senate nor the Assembly included the congestion pricing plan in their budget proposals, although the Assembly did include a fee on for-hire vehicles. Both houses also rejected the governor\u2019s proposal to make New York City pay for subway-related capital costs, though the Senate was open to making the city match state funding in a declared state of emergency. (The Assembly, dominated by members from the city, was not.)\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nIn January, Mr. Cuomo unveiled a plan to eliminate cash bail for many crimes and make several other criminal justice reforms. But such legislation usually dies in the State Senate, where Republicans are often loath to appear soft on crime. (An inverse dynamic is at play in the Assembly, where Democrats generally don\u2019t like bills that increase punishments for criminal offenses.)\n\nStill, Mr. Cuomo has continued to pound on the issue, calling the bail system \u201ca civil-rights abuse\u201d that \u201cfavors the wealthy.\u201d\n\nOpioid Tax\n\nAt first blush, this proposal \u2014 for a 2 cents-per-milligram surcharge for the active opioid ingredient in prescription drugs \u2014 would have seemed to hit a sweet spot in the divided State Legislature, addressing both the need to fight the heroin epidemic (which Senate Republicans have been actively supportive of in past sessions) and raising significant new revenue for the state, a priority for Democrats.

But it may prove just another example of Egyptian women speaking out against sexual violence. In 2005, female journalists and activists exposed the use of systematic sexual violence by the government of Hosni Mubarak to stop them from protesting.\n\nEgypt\u2019s first conviction for street sexual harassment came in 2008, when a 27 year-old named Noha al-Ostaz dragged a man to a police station after he grabbed her breast. Officers refused to file a complaint until the woman\u2019s father arrived. Nobody had intervened to help her, and Egyptian media outlets accused her of cruelly \u201cruining the life\u201d of her assailant, who was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nLess than a month after the 2011 uprising forced Mr. Mubarak to step down, the military subjected female activists to \u201cvirginity tests\u201d \u2014 a form of sexual assault. Three women exposed the assaults. One tried, in vain, to sue the military.\n\nI too became a victim. In November 2011, the riot police beat me, broke my left arm and right hand, and sexually assaulted me before I was detained by the Interior Ministry and then military intelligence. Later, I went on Egyptian television with both arms in casts and with X-rays of my injuries. I tried unsuccessfully to sue the regime.\n\nSeveral other Egyptian women have shared stories of sexual assault by policemen or mobs during protests since then. Their goal was obvious: to reassert men\u2019s dominance over hundreds of thousands of women now claiming a role in Egypt\u2019s political life.\n\nThe police and the military are not alone in silencing women. A feminist group in Cairo told me that at least 12 other women who were sexually assaulted were too ashamed to speak or were silenced by their families. We still don\u2019t know the name of a woman who was stripped to her bra by soldiers who then stomped on her chest in Tahrir Square in December 2011. That woman deserves a statue for her courage, not a silencing.\n\nFor years, Egyptian women have navigated our way out of the maze of taboo and shame to expose sexual violence by the state and by men in the street. It is slow going. But last December, a lawyer was sentenced to three years in prison for saying that women who wear ripped jeans should be raped as a punishment.

Steel and aluminum may not be important enough for that: They accounted for only 2 percent of American imports last year, or 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, as The Economist has pointed out.\n\nFurthermore, on Thursday, Mr. Trump carved out exceptions even to this particular trade restriction. He said that for now, at least, he would not impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s closest allies, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and might not impose them on Australia, either.\n\nStill the president has begun what, if it continues, would be a colossal shift in longstanding United States policy. Instead of relying on multilateral institutions that have been pillars of world trade \u2014 and American power \u2014 since World War II, the president vowed to revise America\u2019s approach, stressing bilateral costs and benefits, and national security, very narrowly defined.\n\nThe Trump tilt has left many people flabbergasted.\n\nMichael Froman, who served as United States trade representative in the Barack Obama administration, said he was troubled by this possible shift. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what it means to enter a global trade war\u201d as government policy, he said on a conference call at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is a distinguished fellow.\n\nSerious people, he said, have tried to devise ways to \u201cexit trade wars,\u201d not start them.

That makes the selection dependent not only on Mr. Liu\u2019s broad-ranging tastes, but on the Chinese publishing houses.\n\nThey, in turn, are subject to the Communist Party censors who control what is published by Chinese authors and foreign writers translated into Chinese.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Internal party guidelines on what is prohibited are passed from the propaganda apparatus to the bosses of the publishing houses, sometimes on a daily basis. They are never made public. Nor is any list of banned books.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome basic rules prevail, Mr. Liu said. The first motivation of the censors is protection of the Communist Party. \u201cAnything that explains the Communist Party as a threat is a red line,\u201d he said.\n\nThis leads to some striking choices. Books about the Soviet Union\u2019s labor camps are banned, but accounts of the Nazi concentration camps are tolerated. Histories of Castro\u2019s rule in Cuba are not translated much; Cuba\u2019s medical system compared too favorably with China\u2019s overcrowded hospitals.\n\nWith about 600 large, state-run publishing houses and 3,000 smaller publishers attached to government agencies, some titles that annoy the government sometimes slip through the net. Publishers tend to be liberals and lovers of literature, and some of them want to publish good books. Some push the parameters.\n\nSo in an exception to the rule against maligning a Communist Party, one of Mr. Liu\u2019s favorites, Arthur Koestler\u2019s novel \u201cDarkness at Noon,\u201d about the Soviet gulag, was available in China for many years.\n\nIt was last published in 2006, however, and now appears to be banned. Secondhand editions of Koestler\u2019s classic are available online for $50. The original price: $1.50.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmong the steady sellers at All Sages are books on American history and biographies of the early presidents \u2014 Washington and Jefferson in particular \u2014 and of Benjamin Franklin. The interest in America\u2019s founding fathers is tied up with a thirst to know how America became a democratic and global power, Mr. Liu said.\n\nRecent political books about presidential election campaigns do not appeal much to his clientele, Mr. Liu said. He said he would read Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d due out in Chinese soon, before stocking it.\n\nTwo standbys for Western liberals \u2014 Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism\u201d and George Washington\u2019s Farewell Address, which outlines his argument for term limits \u2014 have always sold well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the last several weeks, both works circulated on the Chinese internet, in a quiet protest against Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to scrap the Chinese Constitution\u2019s two-term limit for presidents. Most likely, the censors never read what Washington had to say, Mr. Liu said.\n\nWeekends are the busiest time at the store, and on a recent Saturday the narrow aisles were packed, especially around the nonfiction shelves. Fiction is not the store\u2019s strength.\n\nThere is plenty of Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro but no Joan Didion. Books on feminism merit only two shelves, a function of slow demand.\n\nIn the philosophy section, Sue Ping, 29, a Tsinghua University M.B.A. student dressed in a white sweater, jeans and a black beret, was searching for Plato\u2019s \u201cThe Republic.\u201d \u201cFor me, it\u2019s paradise,\u201d Ms. Ping said of the store. \u201cI buy online but I come because I like the atmosphere. It\u2019s very open, you feel welcome.\u201d\n\nA few shelves away, Daisy Fu, 45, a primary school science teacher, who came with her husband on their motorbike, was deciding whether to buy a book about North Korea. \u201cA bookstore is a symbol of culture; we need it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t come often, it\u2019s important to know I can come and walk among the books.\u201d\n\nOne book that Mr. Liu knows he will never be able to stock stands out. Works critical of Mao Zedong are automatically banned, and a sensational memoir, \u201cA Life of Chairman Mao\u201d by Li Zhisui, Mao\u2019s personal doctor of many years, is considered a particular abomination. The book describes Mao as a tyrannical personality with a fiendish sexual appetite and appalling personal hygiene who suffered from a motor neuron disease in his last years.\n\n\u201cThere is literally no way to get this book in China,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cJust imagine if I put two copies on the shelves. The minimum punishment would be a fine of $3,000. The medium-level punishment would be shutting down the bookstore. And the most extreme would be the bookstore owner jailed for three to five years.\u201d", "title": "A Beijing Bookstore Where George Washington Is on the Shelves", "authors": ["Jane Perlez"]}

In Ferguson, Mo., for example, a single $151 parking violation sent a black woman struggling with homelessness into a seven-year odyssey of court appearances, arrest warrants and jail time connected to her inability to pay.\n\nAcross America, one-size-fits-all fines are the norm, which I demonstrate in an article for the University of Chicago Law Review. Where judges do have wiggle room to choose the size of a fine, mandatory minimums and maximums often tie their hands. Some states even prohibit consideration of a person\u2019s income. And when courts are allowed to take finances into account, they frequently fail to do so.\n\nOther places have saner methods.

About a third of the state\u2019s six million renters pay more than half of their monthly income on rent, according to census figures. Homelessness is rising throughout the state, and about one in five residents in the state lives in poverty once housing costs are factored in \u2014 the highest poverty rate in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wiener, who has pushed for various housing bills in both the State Senate and in his previous job on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said his bill would help reduce housing costs by speeding up construction and alleviating a housing shortage that has plagued the state for decades. High housing costs are also a culprit behind the state\u2019s longer commutes. In the Bay Area, about 5 percent of commuters spend more than 90 minutes traveling to work, compared with 3 percent nationwide, according to an analysis of census data by the Brookings Institution.\n\nBut lower- and even middle-income residents fear being evicted or priced out of their neighborhoods, making them resist development. Some of Mr. Wiener\u2019s most vocal opposition has come from anti-gentrification and tenants\u2019 rights groups that see his plan as a socioeconomic makeover backed by the real estate industry. Mr. Wiener said late last month that he was amending the bill to add provisions to restrict demolition and tenant displacement. Hearings are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nIn part because of the vexed politics, states have often taken a lighter approach to promoting density, using carrots rather than sticks. In the Northeast, at least six states \u2014 Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Maine, New Jersey and New York \u2014 have adopted goals of sharply slowing the growth in vehicle miles traveled in the coming decades. Their plans typically envision financial incentives for revitalizing downtown areas and encouraging greater density.\n\nCalifornia tried an incentive approach to density with the Sustainable Communities Act, a sweeping bill passed in 2008. But some experts say it did not go nearly far enough to change the state\u2019s urban sprawl or car culture.\n\nCalifornia has made impressive strides in solar and wind power and its push for electric vehicles. But the combination of high housing costs and rising commute times threatens to keep the state from achieving its ambitious target of cutting emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.\n\nLast year, the California Air Resources Board estimated that meeting those goals would require a 7 percent cut in vehicle miles traveled by 2030, compared with levels that the agency projects would otherwise be reached under current policy.

(Without that, the others wouldn\u2019t matter.) The food is Southern, which I was primed to like before I walked through JuneBaby\u2019s Dutch doors in this city\u2019s Ravenna neighborhood. And whenever Edouardo Jordan\u2019s menu offered a dish I\u2019d expect to see at a Southern restaurant, he gave me something better than I\u2019d imagined.\n\nFried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense.\n\nThis is the tactic \u2014 find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them \u2014 favored by most of the South\u2019s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn\u2019t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don\u2019t serve, that pulled me in deeper.\n\nLike any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he\u2019s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Now It\u2019s a Book\n\nMs. Collins, who lives in Brooklyn Heights in a modish duplex apartment overlooking the East River, is emblematic of a certain demographic: mostly white \u2014 though Ms. Collins is half-black \u2014 expensively educated and housed liberals. You would assume that group would mirror itself online and stay small and homogeneous. But within a year of its founding, WWVWD, to use its colloquial abbreviation, had more than 1,300 members; the week after the presidential election there was an increase of another 1,000, Ms. Collins said, with many seeking a way to marshal themselves for political action.\n\nThe original group, which Ms. Collins changed from \u201csecret\u201d to \u201cclosed\u201d (meaning it can be seen by the public), begot subgroups, for those who wanted to focus on philanthropy, activism, business networking and writing. Woolfers in New York City began meeting in person, as Ms. Collins led field trips to Toys in Babeland, the sex accessories emporium on the Lower East Side, and hosted Scrabble tournaments and clothing swaps.\n\nPhoto\n\nWoolfers have also swapped houses and apartments, rented each other rooms and raised money for groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Trust for Public Land. Recently, four Woolfers spent a day at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, joining a mentorship program for inmates there.\n\nThere are now more than 7,600 Woolfers across the country, from New York City, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as you might expect, but also from Arkansas, Chicago and Maine. And Ms. Collins, who spent a few weeks last month on a cross-country road trip with a new boyfriend meeting Woolfers in Memphis and Telluride, Colo., among other spots, has a new book, out in April, called \u201cWhat Would Virginia Woolf Do? And Other Questions I Ask Myself as I Attempt to Age Without Apology.\u201d It is a sometimes wince-inducing primer on fashion, sex, marriage, divorce, money and health gleaned from her experience as Woolfer in chief, and with contributions from her Woolfer sisters.\n\nIt also has memoirish elements: Ms. Collins details her adventures in the orgy tent at Burning Man (she and her ex brought their own sheets, and kept to themselves), her struggles with depression and her adherence to an expensive beauty routine that involves fake eyelashes and Botox. She also cops to divorce envy, and notes the benefits of prenups, long-term-care insurance and pharmaceuticals like Xanax. In its breezy candor, the book is as appealing and appalling as the conversations of the Woolfers online, though it lacks the tartness and invective that occasionally erupts there, turning a you-go-girl group of self-affirmers into an unruly scrum.\n\nBecause when thousands of women get together on social media, what could possibly go wrong?\n\n\u2018Assume Goodness, Please\u2019\n\n\u201cWe do fight sometimes,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about super-candid things, and people have strong opinions. If you\u2019re talking about whether or not to let your 16-year-old have sex or whether to have an affair or how to tell your colleague at work that she\u2019s a jerk, people will have strong responses.\u201d\n\nWhen one long-married woman wrote about the heartache she was feeling because her lover of five years had broken up with her, many Woolfers were upset by her adultery, Ms. Collins said, and she had to step in to remove comments that were aggressive, moralistic and vitriolic. When a white Woolfer reported that a black man in a park had exposed himself to her, many in the group were inflamed that she had noted his race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt first, Ms. Collins read every post herself, to steer the conversation and defuse tension. But when the group swelled to 3,000, she asked some of the early Woolfers to help her moderate; now, about 20 women have oversight of what\u2019s posted. Politics, race and infidelity are topics that reliably lead to problems. \u201cI\u2019ll be out somewhere and I\u2019ll get a text from someone saying basically there\u2019s a huge fight in Aisle 6 and what do we do?\u201d Ms. Collins said.\n\nEarly last year, Ms. Collins chastised the group for what she saw as occasional reflexive pettiness. \u201cThis is not a liberal arts college, circa 2016,\u201d she wrote in part. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to give trigger warnings. Bring on the posts about money concerns and racism concerns and class struggle, but don\u2019t blame fellow members without real cause. Assume goodness, please.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nJenny Douglas, an early Woolfer and moderator, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a post you don\u2019t like, we say, \u2018Scroll on by.\u2019 You don\u2019t need to pick a fight with everything or anyone you disagree with. When we are meeting online and tackling subjects that are so nuanced, you can lose that nuance. Those tender subjects are tricky to tackle in any form.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks ago, a moderator quit the group after a discussion of moderator practices \u2014 how they vetted posts, for example \u2014 left her feeling bullied, she said.\n\nThere are over-posters, and drunk posters; there are angry, cursing posters \u2014 whose words are promptly removed, Ms. Collins said \u2014 and posters who are a tad self-righteous. And there are the lurkers and the hate readers, along with those who are repelled or bored or disappointed by the particular window into women\u2019s lives that the group affords them.\n\n\u201cI always think that Virginia Woolf would be mortified at having her name associated with this group,\u201d said Daphne Merkin, the memoirist and cultural critic, who is a member of the group but does not post anything. \u201cAt first I thought it was going to be some kind of literary meeting of the minds. That there would be some interesting comments about Jean Rhys. Instead it\u2019s, \u201cWhat do you do with your dildos?\u201d Or this sort of subclinical despair about no longer having a flat stomach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that stuff is beneath me,\u201d Ms. Merkin went on. \u201cI mean, I once wrote a story on buffing up the vagina, but these revelations are very cosmeticized. There\u2019s little wit, but maybe wit takes more time than social media allows. This is more like the stuff you tell your girlfriend at the end of the day, the eye-glazing end of intimacy. There\u2019s intimacy that\u2019s thrilling, but this isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nConversations have leaked outside the group, like the time one woman wrote of her son\u2019s bad behavior, and another Woolfer told her own child, who happened to know the son, who then told the son of his mother\u2019s revelations about his conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was pretty easy to figure out who it was,\u201d Ms. Collins said of the offending member. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018This is super-uncool,\u2019 and we removed her from the group. The way we dealt with it was to write about it, so everyone knew what had happened. Ironically, and because I\u2019m a bigger personality, I\u2019ve probably suffered more than others for this.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

In 2013, in an article for Elle magazine, she wrote about being arrested three times: for assaulting her first husband, for assaulting his girlfriend and for violating an order of protection he had taken out against her, by overturning a coffee table. A recent Page Six item reported that her second husband had broken her nose during a fight last September.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be \u2018too much,\u2019 as a woman?\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk about this a lot in the group.\u201d\n\nMs. Collins is happy to share her labial regimen (see \u201ccoconut oil,\u201d above), the minutiae of her sex life and the unraveling of her second marriage, which ended in part because of the meddling of a Woolfer, as it happens.\n\n\u201cThe marriage was strained, and I had been wanting a second dog for a while,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t, but like most women I do most of the work around the house and pay my fair share.\u201d She asked the Woolfers, in essence, \u201cAm I a jerk if I just go ahead and get the dog?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a throwaway thread,\u201d she said. \u201cBut suddenly there were like 600 comments,\u201d evenly divided in opinion. (She didn\u2019t get the dog.)\n\nIt turns out that one Woolfer who read the thread was an old friend of Ms. Collins\u2019s husband, and the woman told him about his wife\u2019s query. \u201cHe came home pretty angry, and the marriage ended pretty much the next day,\u201d Ms. Collins said.\n\nA revenue model for the Woolfers has yet to emerge, though Ms. Collins is working on it. She has built a website to promote her book, created a newsletter and recorded five sample podcasts \u2014 called \u201cRaging Gracefully\u201d \u2014 which she plans to release in April. As Ms. Collins has told the group, she received a $75,000 book advance, which she split with an editor and researcher who worked with her. She is as candid about her entrepreneurial behaviors and aspirations as she is about more intimate matters.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCan we create a digital platform for women over 40?\u201d Ms. Collins said. Fortunes have been lost on the print version of such endeavors, despite economic data that shows the purchasing power of this demographic, decade after decade. And Ms. Collins is not alone in trying to reach them online. Girls of a Certain Age, a six-year-old style site created by Kim France, the founding editor of Lucky magazine, gets about 30,000 unique hits a month and makes over six figures, Ms. France said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLesley Jane Seymour, the editor in chief of More magazine, which folded in 2016 after publishing for 19 years and was reintroduced as an online magazine for millennial women, has spent the last two years working on Covey Club, \u201can online club for women 40+ who want to continue learning, growing and expanding their world by making new friends and deeper connections,\u201d which went live this past Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nMs. Seymour was promoting the site at the South by Southwest festival a few weeks ago, joining the stage with Tausha Robertson, creator of Ms. X. Factor, a digital space for Gen X women of color. \u201cI know there\u2019s a business here,\u201d Ms. Seymour said. \u201cThe question is how to do it. We can\u2019t just sell content online, it has to be something else. What is clear is that women who are a little bit older feel disenfranchised. They feel no one is listening to them, and they feel invisible.\u201d\n\nMs. Collins said of her group, \u201cI see it as incredible content potential and, though this sounds a little grandiose, possibly culture shifting. These women are powerful, and they have made me feel more powerful.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a continuing conversation about whether the group is getting too big and how or if to control for privacy. When the news of Facebook\u2019s breaches broke last week, the moderators again discussed restricting new members or moving to a different platform. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll have an app or some other platform for more intimacy,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cBut for now, here we are, basically addicted and not budging.\u201d\n\nDina Seiden is a Brooklyn-based writer and performance artist, a committed Woolfer and, now, a moderator. The group\u2019s foibles, she said, are part of the draw. \u201cThey make aging so much fun. We\u2019re not all saints \u2014 no, we\u2019re perfectly human, and that is ultimately good for the group, too.\u201d\n\nLast Christmas she participated in a Secret Santa gift exchange. In a \u201ccheeky nod,\u201d she said, to a topic the group seems to hold dear, Ms. Seiden sent her recipient a vintage vibrator: a formidable, Machine Age relic called the Vitilator she\u2019d bought on eBay for $15, the price cap the group had set. \u201cI mean, kismet!\u201d Ms. Seiden said, truly delighted by her find.\n\nUnfortunately, the recipient was a germophobe, and was horrified to have received such an intimate, secondhand device, as she explained. Did Ms. Seiden want it back? If so, she\u2019d leave it with her doorman.\n\n\u201cBut it was a schlep and I just wanted to put the incident behind me, so I never did pick it up,\u201d Ms. Seiden said. \u201cMy dream is that the doorman gave it to a woman in his life, or that a slightly awkward exchange ensued in which the doorman had to return the vibrator to its recipient, passing it clumsily to her and in my dream, by the time she gets up to her apartment, she can\u2019t resist, transcends her putative germophobia, and gets herself off like a rock star.\u201d", "title": "A Chat Room of Their Own", "authors": ["Penelope Green"]}

His audacity had already made him a hero. A little more than a year before, he started an unlikely rebellion after discovering that local officials had been selling off the villagers\u2019 land without their knowledge. Since then, he anticipated a government crackdown, and if he had to leave his beloved Wukan, there was only one place he wanted to go.\n\nThe United States \u201cwas a country of justice and freedom, a place with values that paralleled his own,\u201d he reasons. \u201cWork would be easy to find there. People would be friendly.\u201d Zhuang could already envision the hearty welcome an ardent democracy advocate like himself would receive. He was so enamored of his chosen destination that \u201che had to whisper when he said it: America.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, his fantasy of America founders once he reaches its rough shores. And it\u2019s then, when the country frustrates him, that life in America becomes palpable, and exceedingly real.\n\nZhuang and his wife, Little Yan, neither of whom speak any English, wait for their asylum applications to come through while they try to eke out a new life in Flushing after arriving on a tourist visa. Little Yan, unrelentingly practical and resigned to \u201ceating bitter,\u201d immediately starts to work in a nail salon; Zhuang, meanwhile, keeps telling her she should quit her job because he\u2019s perpetually on the verge of something big. Ever entrepreneurial, he pursues a number of moneymaking schemes, including a logistically convoluted and barely profitable personal-shopping business, schlepping to an outlet mall north of the city to buy up discounted designer goods and resell them to moneyed customers back in China.\n\nHilgers observes all of this with a sharp eye and an open heart. She follows Zhuang and Little Yan around, together and separately, becoming privy to their daily routines and their candid thoughts about America and each other. But Hilgers isn\u2019t in this book more than she needs to be. Aside from hosting the couple in her Brooklyn apartment when they first arrive \u2014 the inquisitive Zhuang is curious about everything, including why she owns more than one kitchen knife \u2014 Hilgers recedes into the background, the better to let them speak for themselves.\n\nUnlike a number of other asylum-seekers from China, Zhuang and Little Yan are in a relatively privileged position: They arrive flush with savings from a land sale, and without crushing debts. At the same time, they have no family, no ready-made network to show them how anything is done. Zhuang never finished middle school.

Throughout Russia\u2019s slow slide into authoritarianism, there has lingered a hope that relations with Moscow can be reset, as Hillary Clinton sought to do and as President Trump seems eager to do. And while Mr. Putin\u2019s drive to restore Russian influence and might \u2014 witness his proud unveiling of an intercontinental missile in March that \u201ccan reach any point in the world\u201d \u2014 is an echo of Soviet behavior, Russia has also undergone a considerable transformation since 1991. Russians travel widely and have nearly unlimited access to information and technology, and the Soviet command economy has given way to far greater consumerism.\n\nMore significantly, there is no Western consensus on Russia of the sort that held against the Soviet Union. European politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary or Czech President Milos Zeman are open admirers of Mr. Putin, and President Trump\u2019s relations with the Kremlin are a major question mark. Though the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle, Mr. Trump made no comment on the crisis, either when he called Mr. Putin last week to congratulate him on his re-election or since.\n\nAll that makes the current confrontation less predictable than the showdowns of the Soviet past. Both Britain and the United States have left open further actions against Russia, to which Moscow would inevitably respond, and the deterioration in relations could affect efforts to find common ground on Syria or Islamist terrorism.\n\nThat, however, is not an argument for looking the other way when Russia violates the most elemental norms of international behavior. Russia is not the old Soviet Union, which makes it all the more imperative for the West to send a clear message that the old wiles and subterfuges also belong in the dustbin of history.\n\nThe former K.G.B. agent in Mr. Putin may find it intolerable that a turncoat is living comfortably in Britain, but it must be made clear to him that the West will unite in fury \u2014 yes, including Mr. Trump\u2019s America \u2014 when Russia\u2019s most fearsome weapons are deployed in a peaceful English town.", "title": "Opinion | A Colder War With Russia?", "authors": []}

The English-language version of \u201cYellow Negroes\u201d is part of New York Review Comics\u2019s drive to unearth foreign gems that have built up a cult following.\n\nThe translation feels timely because \u201cYellow Negroes\u2019\u201d twin themes of undocumented migrant workers and the damaging legacy of European colonialism have not gone away. \u201cRelatively speaking, in France we don\u2019t let any immigrants in anymore,\u201d said Mr. Alagb\u00e9, who provided an illustrated coda to the American version of \u201cYellow Negroes\u201d updating its themes.\n\n\u201cEurope has become a kind of fortress where misfortunates do not have a place. For me that in itself is a kind of hell,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat has added insult to injury for Mr. Alagb\u00e9 is that in the meantime France has continued to shape its former African colonies in its own image by erasing the past as it sees fit. In \u201cYellow Negroes\u201d he reported on a collective of undocumented workers striking in Montreuil who put up a photograph of Thomas Sankara, Burkina Faso\u2019s revolutionary president from 1983 to 1987, in the window of their headquarters.\n\nInserting himself into the narrative, Mr. Alagb\u00e9 remarked that when he once looked up Sankara\u2019s name in France\u2019s famous Larousse dictionary there was no entry for him. However there was an entry for Blaise Compaor\u00e9 who led the 1987 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat during which Sankara was assassinated. \u201cI thought that was incredibly violent,\u201d Mr. Alagb\u00e9 said. \u201cNot only was Sankara assassinated but he was also erased from French history.\u201d\n\nMr. Alagb\u00e9\u2019s other comic books include 2004\u2019s \u201cWho Has Known the Fire\u201d which stages a hypothetical conversation between Sebastian I, who was king of Portugal during the 16th century, and B\u00e9hanzin, who became king of Dahomey (now Benin) during the 19th century. His interest in history extends to making light of his own fraught upbringing: He based a husband who abandons his wife in \u201cYellow Negroes\u201d on his father giving him the name Augustus after the Roman emperor.\n\nMr. Alagb\u00e9 cited the films of Pier Paolo Passolini and Rainer Werner Fassbinder as key influences on his work. \u201cBoth directors showed the harshness of human relationships where mistrustfulness is ever-present,\u201d he said. Their open-mindedness also touches him in a way that some comic book artists struggle to do. \u201cI\u2019ve chatted with illustrators who have told me that they are so used to drawing white people all the time that when they draw a black person it\u2019s a problem for them,\u201d he said.\n\nMaking art for art\u2019s sake has never interested Mr. Alagb\u00e9 and the sheer quantity of comic books on offer nowadays does not necessarily constitute a golden age for him. \u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is work that renders visible what has previously been invisible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you need to look long and hard before that can happen.\u201d", "title": "A Comic Book Artist Who Makes the Invisible Visible", "authors": []}

The cello\u2019s darkly expressive riches seem to have especially appealed to Zimmermann; he also wrote two concertos for the instrument, one relatively early, and revised as \u201cCanto di Speranza,\u201d with formal inspiration derived from Ezra Pound\u2019s cantos, and a second in the mid-1960s.\n\nStylistic pluralism went hand-in-hand with expressionism \u2014 one heightening the other \u2014 nowhere more so than in \u201cDie Soldaten\u201d (\u201cThe Soldiers\u201d), for which Zimmermann wrote a libretto closely built (at least to begin with) on an 18th-century play by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz drawing upon his military service. Zimmermann extended Lenz\u2019s multilayered plotlines in every direction, eventually including a vision of the atomic bomb whose return so many in the \u201960s feared. Multiple ensembles, languages, stages, film projections, loudspeakers, musical styles and so on were intended to surround the audience \u2014 originally meant to be seated on swivel chairs in the center of a vast performing space \u2014 to tell in multiple ways the story of a girl\u2019s destruction by a brutal society.\n\nZimmermann\u2019s final version was a simplification of the initial conception, which had been rejected by the Cologne Opera. The libretto and score maintained different levels of staged action, yet could conceivably be performed (abortive first attempts notwithstanding) by traditional opera companies in traditional theaters. Michael Gielen, who conducted the 1965 premiere in Cologne, would later say that Zimmermann\u2019s \u201cimagination was always several stages ahead of current standards of performing practice, and he could never understand why, precisely for that reason, we performers could offer only an approximation of his vision at the first performance.\u201d\n\nWe know, Gielen added, \u201cthat, from Beethoven onward, so-called \u2018unplayable\u2019 pieces become playable with time,\u201d and \u201cDie Soldaten\u201d has seen memorable performances in recent years, including at the 2012 Salzburg Festival and at the Zurich Opera, in 2013, directed by Calixto Bieito.

And legions of Ms. Penny\u2019s fans take a 2.5-hour tour in Quebec City, based on her popular novel \u201cBury Your Dead,\u201d where they can walk in the footsteps of Gamache as he investigates the murder of an amateur archaeologist at the Literary and Historical Society of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nMs. Penny and I also chatted about Quebec\u2019s culture wars, which she experienced while living in Quebec City during the 1995 referendum on the province\u2019s independence.\n\nShe pointed out that Quebec had an English minority surrounded by a French majority, who were themselves eclipsed by an English majority in the rest of the country. So in Quebec, she noted, everyone defines themselves as \u201cThe Other,\u201d creating a sense of alienation that both inspired and repelled.\n\n\u201cAs much as the English don\u2019t know the French, the French don\u2019t know the English,\u201d she said.\n\nIn multilingual Knowlton, however, she stressed that a love of country living and nature overcame any linguistic differences.

He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.\n\nBut what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away \u2014 and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?\n\nComplicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.\n\nThat is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander \u2014 as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them.

The SamSam group is known for choosing targets that are the most likely to accede to its high ransom demands \u2014 typically the Bitcoin equivalent of about $50,000 \u2014 and for finding and locking up the victims\u2019 most valuable data.\n\nIn Atlanta, where officials said the ransom demand amounted to about $51,000, the group left parts of the city\u2019s network tied in knots. Some major systems were not affected, including those for 911 calls and control of wastewater treatment. But other arms of city government have been scrambled for days.\n\nThe Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to validate warrants. Police officers have been writing reports by hand. The city has stopped taking employment applications.\n\nAtlanta officials have disclosed few details about the episode or how it happened. They have urged vigilance and tried to reassure employees and residents that their personal information was not believed to have been compromised.\n\nDell SecureWorks and Cisco Security, which are still working to restore the city\u2019s systems, declined to comment on the attacks, citing client confidentiality.\n\nMs. Bottoms, the mayor, has not said whether the city would pay the ransom.\n\nThe SamSam group has been one of the more successful ransomware rings, experts said. It is believed to have extorted more than $1 million from some 30 target organizations in 2018 alone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is not ideal to pay up, but in most cases, SamSam\u2019s victims have said that they can more easily afford the $50,000 or so in ransom than the time and cost of restoring their locked data and compromised systems. In the past year, the group has taken to attacking hospitals, police departments and universities \u2014 targets with money but without the luxury of going off-line for days or weeks for restoration work.\n\nInvestigators are not certain who the SamSam hackers are. Judging from the poor English in the group\u2019s ransom notes, security researchers believe they are probably not native English speakers. But they cannot say for sure whether SamSam is a single group of cybercriminals or a loose hacking collective.\n\nRansomware emerged in Eastern Europe in 2009, when cybercriminals started using malicious code to lock up unsuspecting users\u2019 machines and then demanding 100 euros or similar sums to unlock them again. Over the past decade, dozens of online cybercriminal outfits \u2014 and even some nation states, including North Korea and Russia \u2014 have taken up similar tactics on a larger scale, inflicting digital paralysis on victims and demanding increasing amounts of money.\n\nCybersecurity experts estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion from ransomware in 2016, according to the F.B.I. Then, last May, came the largest ransomware assault recorded so far: North Korean hackers went after tens of thousands of victims in more than 70 countries around the world, forcing Britain\u2019s public health system to reject patients, paralyzing computers at Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry, at FedEx in the United States, and at shipping lines and telecommunications companies across Europe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That attack shut down automated teller machines in Kiev, froze government agencies and even forced workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to monitor radiation levels manually. Collateral damage from that attack affected computers at Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate; at Merck, the American-based pharmaceutical giant; and even at businesses in Russia.\n\nAttempted ransomware attacks against local governments in the United States have become unnervingly common. A 2016 survey of chief information officers for jurisdictions across the country found that obtaining ransom was the most common purpose of cyberattacks on a city or county government, accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, also found that about one-quarter of local governments reported that they were experiencing attacks of one kind or another, successful or not, at least as often as once an hour.\n\nYet less than half of the local governments surveyed said they had developed a formal cybersecurity policy, and only 34 percent said they had a written strategy to recover from breaches.\n\nExperts said government officials needed to be more aggressive about preventive measures, like training employees to spot and sidestep \u201cphishing\u201d attempts meant to trick them into opening the digital door for ransomware.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be even more important that local governments look for the no-cost/low-cost, but start considering cybersecurity on the same level as public safety,\u201d said David Jordan, the chief information security officer for Arlington County, Va. \u201cA smart local government will have fire, police and cybersecurity at the same level.\u201d\n\nMs. Bottoms, who took office as mayor of Atlanta in January, acknowledged that shoring up the city\u2019s digital defenses had not been a high priority before, but that now \u201cit certainly has gone to the front of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs elected officials, it\u2019s often quite easy for us to focus on the things that people see, because at the end of the day, our residents are our customers,\u201d Ms. Bottoms said. \u201cBut we have to really make sure that we continue to focus on the things that people can\u2019t see, and digital infrastructure is very important.\u201d\n\nDuring the ransomware attack, local leaders have sometimes been able to do little but chuckle at a predicament that was forcing the city to turn the clock back decades.\n\nAsked on Monday how long the city might be able to get by doing its business strictly with ink and paper, Ms. Bottoms replied: \u201cIt was a sustainable model until we got computer systems. It worked for many years. And for some of our younger employees, it will be a nice exercise in good penmanship.\u201d\n\nSecurity researchers trying to combat ransomware have noticed a pattern in SamSam\u2019s attacks this year: Some of the biggest have occurred around the 20th of the month.\n\nAllan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future who has been tracking the group, said in an interview that he believed that SamSam gains access to its victims\u2019 systems and then waits for weeks before encrypting the victims\u2019 data. That delay, Mr. Liska said, makes it harder for responders to figure out how the group was able to break in \u2014 and easier for SamSam\u2019s hackers to strike twice.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Transportation was able to restore its systems on its own after a SamSam attack, without paying SamSam a dime.

In January 2017, computers went dark at the National Industrialization Company, Tasnee for short, which is one of the few privately owned Saudi petrochemical companies. Computers also crashed 15 miles away at Sadara Chemical Company, a joint venture between the oil and chemical giants Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical.\n\nWithin minutes of the attack at Tasnee, the hard drives inside the company\u2019s computers were destroyed and their data wiped clean, replaced with an image of Alan Kurdi, the small Syrian child who drowned off the coast of Turkey during his family\u2019s attempt to flee that country\u2019s civil war.\n\nThe intent of the January attacks, Tasnee officials and researchers at the security company Symantec believe, was to inflict lasting damage on the petrochemical companies and send a political message. Recovery took months.\n\nEnergy experts said the August attack could have been an attempt to complicate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plans to encourage foreign and domestic private investment to diversify the Saudi economy and produce jobs for the country\u2019s growing youth population.\n\n\u201cNot only is it an attack on the private sector, which is being touted to help promote growth in the Saudi economy, but it is also focused on the petrochemical sector, which is a core part of the Saudi economy,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSaudi Arabia has cut oil exports in recent years to support global oil prices, a strategy central to its efforts to make a potential public offering of shares of government-controlled Saudi Aramco more attractive to international investors. The kingdom has tried to compensate for its lost revenue by expanding its petrochemical and refining industry.\n\nSome technical details of the attack in August have been previously reported, but this is the first time the earlier attacks on Tasnee and other Saudi petrochemical companies have been reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSecurity analysts at Mandiant, a division of the security firm FireEye, are still investigating what happened in August, with the help of several companies in the United States that investigate cyberattacks on industrial control systems.\n\nA team at Schneider Electric, which made the industrial systems that were targeted, called Triconex safety controllers, is also looking into the attack, the people who spoke to The Times said. So are the National Security Agency, the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has been supporting research into forensic tools designed to assist hacking investigations.\n\nAll of the investigators believe the attack was most likely intended to cause an explosion that would have killed people. In the last few years, explosions at petrochemical plants in China and Mexico \u2014 though not triggered by hackers \u2014 have killed several employees, injured hundreds and forced evacuations of surrounding communities.\n\nWhat worries investigators and intelligence analysts the most is that the attackers compromised Schneider\u2019s Triconex controllers, which keep equipment operating safely by performing tasks like regulating voltage, pressure and temperatures. Those controllers are used in about 18,000 plants around the world, including nuclear and water treatment facilities, oil and gas refineries, and chemical plants.\n\n\u201cIf attackers developed a technique against Schneider equipment in Saudi Arabia, they could very well deploy the same technique here in the United States,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nThe Triconex system was believed to be a \u201clock and key operation.\u201d In other words, the safety controllers could be tweaked or dismantled only with physical contact.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Investigators found an odd digital file in a computer at an engineering workstation that looked like a legitimate part of the Schneider controllers but was designed to sabotage the system. Investigators will not say how it got there, but they do not believe it was an inside job. This was the first time these systems were sabotaged remotely.\n\nThe only thing that prevented significant damage was a bug in the attackers\u2019 computer code that inadvertently shut down the plant\u2019s production systems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestigators believe that the hackers have probably fixed their mistake by now, and that it is only a matter of time before they deploy the same technique against another industrial control system. A different group could also use those tools for its own attack.\n\nThe August attack was also a significant step up from earlier attacks in Saudi Arabia. Starting on Nov. 17, 2016, computer screens at a number of Saudi government computers went dark and their hard drives were erased, according to researchers at Symantec, which investigated the attacks.\n\nTwo weeks later, the same attackers hit other Saudi targets with the same computer virus. On Jan. 23, 2017, they struck again, at Tasnee and other petrochemical firms, deploying a computer virus known as Shamoon, after a word embedded in its code.\n\nThe Shamoon virus first surfaced five years earlier at Saudi Aramco, wiping out tens of thousands of computers and replacing the data with a partial image of a burning American flag.

Panetta, the United States defense secretary at the time, said the attack could be a harbinger.\n\n\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment officials and cybersecurity experts in Saudi Arabia and the United States attributed the 2012 Shamoon attack to Iranian hackers.\n\n\u201cAnother attacker could have adopted that code\u201d for the January 2017 attacks, said Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher at Symantec, \u201cbut our analysis showed the likelihood it was the same perpetrator was pretty high.\u201d\n\nThe attack in August was not a Shamoon attack. It was much more dangerous.\n\nInvestigators believe a nation-state was responsible because there was no obvious profit motive, even though the attack would have required significant financial resources. And the computer code had not been seen in any earlier assaults. Every hacking tool had been custom built.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe attackers not only had to figure out how to get into that system, they had to understand its design well enough to know the layout of the facility \u2014 what pipes went where and which valves to turn in order to trigger an explosion.\n\nInvestigators believe someone would have had to buy the same version of the Triconex safety system to figure out how it worked. The components, investigators said, could be purchased for $40,000 on eBay.\n\nThe attack has also shown the challenge of attributing with unquestionable evidence an attack to one country.\n\nSecurity experts said Iran, China, Russia the United States and Israel had the technical sophistication to launch such attacks. But most of those countries had no motivation to do so. China and Russia are increasingly making energy deals with Saudi Arabia, and Israel and the United States have moved to cooperate with the kingdom against Iran.\n\nThat leaves Iran, which experts said had a growing military hacking program, although the Iranian government has denied any involvement in such attacks.\n\nTensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have steadily escalated in recent years, and the conflict has drifted online.\n\nUnited States officials and security analysts blamed Iranian hackers for a spate of attacks on American banks in 2012 and more recent espionage attacks on the airline industry. Iranian hackers were blamed for the 2012 Aramco attack and are also the leading suspects in the more recent Shamoon attacks.\n\nThe August attack was far more sophisticated than any previous attack originating from Iran, Mr. Thakur of Symantec said, but there is a chance Iran could have improved its hacking abilities or worked with another country, like Russia or North Korea.\n\nTasnee said in an email that it had hired experts from Symantec and IBM to study the attack against it. The company said it had also \u201ccompletely overhauled our security standards\u201d and started using new tools to prevent attacks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBeing a global business,\u201d the company said, \u201cwe believe that cybersecurity is a concern wherever you are in the world.\u201d", "title": "A Cyberattack in Saudi Arabia Had a Deadly Goal.

It was diverting but never considered the premier team test. Now the leadership of the men\u2019s tour, the ATP, is looking to revive it on a grander and more lucrative scale in cooperation with Tennis Australia. It would place this one- or two-week event at the start of the season in early January as part of the lead-up to the Australian Open.\n\nIf approved by the ATP leadership, the new-age World Team Cup could begin in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Davis Cup has over a hundred years of history, and the I.T.F. are clearly looking to evolve the competition in an attempt to maximize its potential,\u201d the ATP executive chairman, Chris Kermode, said in an email. \u201cThe results of those efforts remain to be seen. Our focus remains on bringing the ATP World Team Cup back into the calendar, an exciting project which we\u2019ve been working on for over 18 months now, with the last few details still to be finalized.\u201d\n\nThe idea appears to be to use an Australian city like Brisbane, which has an ATP event for now, as the site of the new event.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have a strong option in partnership with Tennis Australia in Week 1 of the calendar, utilizing locations which are known to showcase the sport in a very positive way,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cIt\u2019s an option that would cause minimal disruption to existing player scheduling given that the vast majority of players are playing that week already in the Southern Hemisphere.\u201d\n\nSomething clearly has to give, and though Haggerty and Kermode met at Indian Wells last week and agreed to keep each other informed, nothing has given yet.\n\n\u201cThey will compete, but one\u2019s going to end up swallowing the other eventually,\u201d Milos Raonic, the Canadian star, said of the two events. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think in any sport, two team competitions, other than something as big as soccer, really survive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParticularly when they could be just five weeks apart, and particularly when there is also a third men\u2019s team competition happening nearly every September: the new Laver Cup, created by Roger Federer and his management company, Team8. The event matches a European all-star squad against an international squad; it was a hit in its debut in 2017 in Prague and is set to head to Chicago this year.\n\n\u201cWe take three days out of the year, so don\u2019t worry about us,\u201d Federer said on Wednesday after advancing to the quarterfinals in Indian Wells. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great event. I think the players really enjoyed themselves. I hope it\u2019s going to be forever successful. We have no guarantee, like no tournament really has, except maybe Wimbledon, to be honest.\u201d\n\nTo be just as honest, who knows where sports or grass-court tennis will find themselves on the popularity charts in 100 years? But what is clear is that in the much shorter term, it is pure folly to create a glut of men\u2019s team tennis events that will only end up diluting the interest in all of them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Grand Slam Cup, open to the most successful players in the year\u2019s four major tournaments, offered huge money for the time \u2014 $2 million to the winner \u2014 but no ranking points without ATP support. It lasted until 1999 before reason (and economics) prevailed, and the two events essentially merged.\n\nWhy go through it all again? The current conflict also seems like a late-in-the-game scramble to capitalize on the golden era of Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic before it starts to fade to sepia, which could be very soon.\n\nWhat the sport really needs for the long term is one, just one, clearly defined and fully supported team event, preferably not an annual one. In an ideal world, it would include the women. Combined events, including the Grand Slams, are among tennis\u2019s greatest strengths going forward, with women\u2019s sports set to take on greater importance and market share.\n\nA combined team event of true import \u2014 not the low-key Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia \u2014 would set tennis apart from all the other sports that stage their World Cups for men and women separately.\n\nBadminton already has proved that the combined model works by bringing men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams together with its biennial Thomas & Uber Cup, which will be in Bangkok in May.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even a single men\u2019s team event is looking like a pipe dream for tennis at the moment. Part of the problem is that the Kosmos group was deeply involved in negotiations with Kermode and the ATP to revive the World Team Cup before running into resistance from ATP board members representing the tournaments.\n\nKosmos, which is headed by the Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and backed by the Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani, then resumed negotiating with Haggerty after the I.T.F. had rebuffed an initial approach.\n\nThe bottom line: Kermode, a popular leader so far, is now vulnerable for having let Kosmos get away, and Haggerty and the I.T.F. are now vulnerable because their organization\u2019s cash cow, the Davis Cup, is steadily fading as the major stars decline to make it a consistent priority.\n\nIf the World Team Cup comes into existence, and provides nearly the same prize money as a revamped Davis Cup along with the ranking points that the Davis Cup cannot provide, it is a potential existential threat.\n\nThat would be true whether or not the Davis Cup adopted a new format. Even if the Davis Cup stays put with four weeks of world group competition spread throughout each season, top players, presented with a less-demanding option to represent their nations annually, would be more likely to choose the path of least resistance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it would be great to play both competitions in the same year,\u201d said Feliciano L\u00f3pez, the 36-year-old Spanish veteran, conceding that \u201ctwo in five weeks would be too much.\u201d\n\nHear, hear.

But Federer was breaking away for a few hours, catching a private jet to Chicago to promote the Laver Cup, the team event that he helped create with Godsick and played at last year in Prague.\n\nThis was a long-planned detour, but it also ended up serving as a way to quickly change the chip after the final in Indian Wells, Federer\u2019s first loss in 2018.\n\n\u201cRoger\u2019s life, if it\u2019s not hectic, it\u2019s not Roger\u2019s life, because it\u2019s all he knows,\u201d Godsick said.\n\nHe has been with Federer since 2005, leaving IMG with him in 2013 to form Team8. Their families are exceptionally close: Godsick\u2019s wife, the former tennis star Mary Joe Fernandez, is a godmother of Federer\u2019s children.\n\nBut today is about business, and Federer, back at No. 1 at age 36, is clearly pushing himself to make it happen after back-to-back three-set matches on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s passion and a love for the game,\u201d Federer said. \u201cAnd Laver Cup is something that is very dear to me, so clearly I always have extra energy for the Laver Cup. For my own career, I don\u2019t play as much anymore, and when I am there, it\u2019s all out and full speed, and then I need the time away again.\u201d\n\nAfter takeoff at 7 a.m., there was no shortage of legroom or long yawns. There was an unsuccessful attempt at a nap in his chair, a modest shared breakfast (burritos, steel-cut oatmeal and juice) and plenty of chatter about this being Federer\u2019s first trip to Chicago. He then went into a separate cabin at 8:30 a.m., closed the drapes and took a 45-minute official nap that may or may not have included actual napping.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe would have been up early anyway today because he\u2019s got four kids, and they are still adjusting from European time,\u201d Godsick said. \u201cHe also had to get to Miami. We spend a lot of time maximizing time, because he doesn\u2019t have that much time. This is a four-hour detour. There are worse things to do, but sure it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nAs the plane approached Midway International Airport after about three hours in the air, Federer warmed up for chilly Chicago with a quick quiz.\n\nN.F.L. team? \u201cBears,\u201d he answered.\n\nN.H.L. team? \u201cBlackhawks.\u201d\n\nBaseball team? \u201cCubs.\u201d\n\nAnd? \u201cWhite Sox,\u201d he said triumphantly after a pause, dragging out the vowels in his best American accent.\n\nThere was no need to test him on the N.B.A. Federer has been an N.B.A. fan since boyhood and was 16 when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen won their last title with the Bulls in 1998.\n\nA visit to United Center, the home arena of the Bulls and the Blackhawks and the site of the Laver Cup in September, was a big part of Monday\u2019s dense itinerary, which was focused on building interest for the event and creating social-media content.\n\nFederer walked down the plane\u2019s stairway shortly after 1 p.m. Chicago time after selecting a fresh set of clothes.\n\nHe was soon at a deep-dish pizza parlor downtown for a photo op with the 79-year-old Rod Laver, John McEnroe and the Australian star Nick Kyrgios.\n\nPhoto\n\nA former No. 1-ranked player, McEnroe still wears many a tennis hat and is the captain of the Laver Cup\u2019s Team World, which lost to Federer, Rafael Nadal and Team Europe in last year\u2019s inaugural edition. Kyrgios, 22, was one of the most enthusiastic members of McEnroe\u2019s team in Prague, leading the cheers and nearly defeating Federer in the final and decisive match of the competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe funnest week of my career so far, better than the Grand Slams,\u201d said Kyrgios, who for all his evident talent has yet to get past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nIf he comes closer to fulfilling his massive potential, he and his generation will be critical to the Laver Cup\u2019s uncertain future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Any new event that lacks ranking points and mandatory participation is vulnerable to irrelevance.\n\nWith Federer still near the peak of his powers, Chicago should be a success, and Godsick expects to sell out United Center for all three days of competition. Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor, was part of the push to secure the event for the city, which has long been without a men\u2019s or women\u2019s main tour event. Emanuel joined Federer and the others on Monday at a news conference. There were also cameo appearances from Pippen and the German soccer star Bastian Schweinsteiger.\n\nSchweinsteiger plays for the Chicago Fire of M.L.S. and became a parent last week with his wife, the retired tennis player Ana Ivanovic. Pippen, 52, served as chief tour guide for Federer and Co. as they visited the Bulls\u2019 and the Blackhawks\u2019 locker rooms and the statues of Pippen and Jordan at United Center.\n\nFederer said he got goose bumps when he met Pippen and got a few more chills as he walked into the arena for the first time, though not because of the sheet of ice still in place after Sunday night\u2019s N.H.L. game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a multiple layer cake,\u201d Federer said after gazing up and up. \u201cIn Europe, we don\u2019t have those very often, where you have suites and another layer and another layer. Usually it stops after two or three, but here it keeps going. I think it\u2019s going to be epic.\u201d\n\nThe Laver Cup\u2019s epicness will be determined in large part by who actually decides to play. The competition comes less than two weeks after the United States Open. Might some European and Asian stars \u2014 some of whom, like Hyeon Chung of South Korea, are represented by IMG \u2014 choose to save their energy for other late-season events?\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to always be an open question a little bit,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not going to happen. I hope by showcasing and giving them such an amazing platform and being part of something quite unique, being on a team together, that they would not want to miss it. There comes a bit of sacrifice with doing something like this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Laver Cup offers prize money to the winning team and sizable participation fees on a graduated scale. Team8 has arranged for private-jet travel to and from Europe to encourage European players like Nadal and Alexander Zverev to play again and others, Novak Djokovic in particular, to play for the first time.\n\nDjokovic and Andy Murray, both injured last year, did not take part, and it is unclear whether they would have done so anyway.\n\nFederer, meanwhile, continues to fly improbably high as the oldest No. 1 in ATP history. How long can he defy gravity?\n\n\u201cWhen I started with him, I made many more predictions than I do now, and I was very often wrong,\u201d Luethi said. \u201cI am ready to be surprised by him. I\u2019m actually expecting to be surprised by him, and I think the best thing is to leave it open and not try to put fences around it.\u201d\n\nFor Federer, who will most likely skip the clay-court season for a second straight year, the key is internal at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to, say, Rotterdam, you need to go there with fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not excited at this age, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nCreating and playing in the Laver Cup, his potential legacy event, has helped feed the fire. But then, so has his personality: extroverted and still curious about new people and new experiences.\n\n\u201cThink about today,\u201d he said on his way back to Midway Airport. \u201cWe left with the sunrise, beautiful weather in Indian Wells, and we get here and it\u2019s cold and a totally different vibe. That\u2019s the beauty of travel, of seeing different places. I love it. I do.

He was eventually disbarred and banned from practicing law in Michigan.\n\nMs. Thomashow, 28, said she learned only in recent months that Mr. Dunnings\u2019s office had declined several times to press charges in her case against Dr. Nassar, part of a series of delays that permitted the doctor to continue his behavior for two more years, until women began going public with their accounts of abuse.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that the police had tried to get charges and that Stuart Dunnings\u2019s office had said no, I was not surprised,\u201d Ms. Thomashow said. \u201cHe was busy doing his own thing.\u201d\n\nA Report, but No Case\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Dunnings, then the top prosecutor in the county, was ever personally aware of Ms. Thomashow\u2019s accusations against Dr. Nassar, though they were laid out in detail in a police report sent to his office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the report, Ms. Thomashow, an athlete, went to see Dr. Nassar because of pain in her hip. During the exam, he began to massage her breast, removing his hand only when Ms. Thomashow told him to stop, she told the police.\n\nDr. Nassar then told a female resident in the room to leave and ordered Ms. Thomashow to lie face down on the table, the report said. Without wearing gloves, he put his hand down her pants and massaged her vagina with three of his fingers for one to two minutes. He was \u201cextremely close\u201d to inserting a finger in her vagina, the report said, adding: \u201cShe told him to stop and that he was hurting her.\u201d\n\nMs. Thomashow had told her story in detail to Valerie O\u2019Brien, a university police officer, and Kristine Moore, a Title IX investigator, during an interview that May in a campus building, she said.\n\n\u201cI left feeling like these women had really heard me,\u201d Ms. Thomashow said. \u201cThey seemed really, genuinely concerned, like they were going to make sure it would never happen again.\u201d\n\nMonths later, Ms. Thomashow was informed that her Title IX complaint had been considered and that Dr. Nassar\u2019s conduct was found to be not sexual in nature, leaving her furious and disgusted. But she also learned that the separate investigation by the university police was underway.\n\nBy 2015, the university police had sent a warrant request to the office of the Ingham County prosecutor, and the case was assigned to Steve Kwasnik, an assistant prosecutor in Mr. Dunnings\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Kwasnik, a lawyer in the crimes against children unit, said that he reviewed the report and consulted with several other senior lawyers in the office, a typical practice. The office decided not to pursue charges against Dr. Nassar.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Mr. Dunnings did not respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\n\u201cI determined that we would not be able to sustain our burden at trial,\u201d Mr. Kwasnik said. \u201cGiven the information available to me at the time, this was the correct decision and I stand by that decision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Prosecutor\u2019s Downfall\n\nBy 2014, Mr. Dunnings, a Democrat, was midway through a fifth four-year term as the elected prosecutor of Ingham County.\n\nFrom the time he was young, it always seemed that Mr. Dunnings would be a lawyer, said Mr. Williams, who has worked in public relations and journalism and knew Mr. Dunnings for decades. There were great expectations for the Dunnings children, Mr. Williams said.\n\n\u201cThey had the nicest place in the neighborhood, and Stuart seemed to be groomed for success,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his early years as a prosecutor, Mr. Dunnings made a name for himself in part by aggressively pursuing prostitution cases, and taking special, public aim at people involved in human trafficking.\n\nIn later years, his team of assistant prosecutors seemed to be juggling cases on their own, according to some who worked around the office.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, a former state senator and Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, stepped in temporarily as Ingham County prosecutor after Mr. Dunnings was removed. After talking to people in the months after he left, Ms. Whitmer said she came away with a sense that Mr. Dunnings had often been gone.\n\n\u201cHe was an absentee prosecutor,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t around very much.\u201d\n\nRumors sometimes reached local law enforcement about Mr. Dunnings\u2019s behavior. Gene Wriggelsworth, who was the sheriff of Ingham County at the time, said the authorities would occasionally hear that Mr. Dunnings was getting away with misdeeds.\n\n\u201cWe would try to drill down on that, and I have to tell you \u2014 if there was something to it, we couldn\u2019t find it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen came a new tip. This time, the investigators unraveled the case. They said Mr. Dunnings had paid prostitutes for sex, finding women on websites like Backpage.com and occasionally having sex with prostitutes in his office during working hours, according to court documents. One woman, who was not a prostitute, came to Mr. Dunnings for help with a child custody dispute and he suggested that she have a sexual relationship with him for money; she eventually agreed, afraid that he would use his power as prosecutor to harm her if she refused, the investigators said.\n\nMr. Wriggelsworth said Mr. Dunnings had been a friend and political ally in the decades past; the two men had even done some television advertisements together.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge betrayal to me,\u201d the former sheriff said of Mr. Dunnings\u2019s crimes. \u201cI have not had a word with him since.\u201d\n\nScandals Intertwined\n\nIn the end, Bill Schuette, Michigan\u2019s attorney general, pursued cases against both men \u2014 the doctor and the prosecutor. The two cases, both involving sex crimes, made their way along separate paths that intersected at odd moments. Two scandals, separate but intertwined, were unfolding publicly at once.\n\nIn November 2016, Mr. Dunnings pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misconduct in office and one count of engaging the services of a prostitute, a misdemeanor. Mr. Schuette, who is now seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Michigan, offered Mr. Dunnings a plea deal; he was sentenced to a year in jail and three years of probation.\n\nIt was a stunning fall for the prosecutor, who grew emotional in the courtroom, telling the judge at one point: \u201cI betrayed the trust of the people.\u201d\n\nOn the day of Mr. Dunnings\u2019s sentencing, another man was in the local jail. Appearing in the courtroom via video, Dr. Nassar pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. It had taken years since reports of abuse were first made against Dr. Nassar, but the story was finally starting to emerge.", "title": "A Famed Doctor, a Troubled Prosecutor and a Case That Went Untried", "authors": ["Julie Bosman", "Monica Davey"]}

They also worry that Kimba will forever be known as the nuclear dump town.\n\nThe state of South Australia, where Kimba is located, is no stranger to radiation and radioactive waste. Most of Australia\u2019s uranium mines are here, as is the remote area known as Maralinga where the British tested nuclear weapons in the 1950s.\n\nWith the site selection process in its final stages, the government has opened an office in the center of Kimba to improve communications with the community.

In early 2016, a vote showed that Kimba was almost split down the middle.

The piece is a buler\u00eda, a strongly accented, high-spirited song form. Again and again, Mr. Carmona charges the singer, snapping his fingers, slapping his thighs and chest, feet pattering out fast rhythms. The two, dancer and singer, are locked in a completely private exchange, seemingly oblivious to the world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to sing, and he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to dance,\u201d Mr. Carmona said. \u201cIt\u2019s that moment of surprise, which is so important in flamenco. Anything can happen.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u00cdmpetus\u201d is a quiet, even pensive show for a dancer known for his extroverted, electrifying stage persona. \u201cI\u2019m a very impetuous person, on and offstage,\u201d he said. His biography bears that out. He left home at 16 to pursue a professional career, after giving his mother an ultimatum: \u201cI told her, either you let me go, or one day, you\u2019ll find a farewell letter on the bed!\u201d he recalled. He joined Nuevo Ballet Espa\u00f1ol and then danced for five years with the Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, becoming one of its biggest stars.\n\nBut lately he has been trying to corral his energies, to slow things down and build intensity through containment. \u201cI\u2019ve been realizing that I\u2019m comfortable with stillness. You listen to the music, the singing, the guitar. It\u2019s like a battery, slowly charging, and then, boom.\u201d\n\nThis idea of restraint is also the inspiration behind a new experiment at the Flamenco Festival, a workshop entitled \u201cExploring Stillness,\u201d conceived by Mr. Mar\u00edn. \u201cFor me,\u201d Mr. Mar\u00edn said, \u201cthe most powerful moments are when the dancer is still. It can be more exciting than seeing 20 pirouettes.\u201d\n\nThe workshop will involve three dancers from different disciplines: Mr. Carmona, the Madrid-born Joaquin De Luz of New York City Ballet, and the American modern dancer-choreographer David Neumann. (Mr. Carmona and Mr. De Luz are friends: Mr. Carmona stayed with Mr. De Luz when he came to New York to study tap.)

But there was one apparent conundrum at the heart of the findings: While the effect on sales was quite large \u2014 the 7 percent increase swamps the 1-to-3 percent improvement that many retailers struggle to achieve \u2014 the overall consistency of schedules improved only marginally.\n\nConsider a part-time worker with an average of 16 shifts per month. At stores that attempted to make the changes, nearly 10 of those shifts were scheduled for a consistent time of day. At stores that had not done so, about nine of the shifts were consistent.\n\nThe explanation for how such modest changes could lead to such unusually large increases in sales may be that managers focused disproportionately on more experienced employees when it came to stabilizing the number of hours worked from week to week. That, in turn, appears to have lowered turnover among experienced workers, who helped their stores perform better.\n\n\u201cIt looks like managers did the rational thing \u2014 they had to improve stability, and so they picked the more experienced people,\u201d said Saravanan Kesavan, another author, who teaches business at the University of North Carolina. \u201cNow you have more experienced people in the store, and the productivity you\u2019re seeing increased, leading to higher sales.\u201d\n\nMr. Kesavan suggested that Gap could reap still greater financial benefits by making schedules even more stable and reducing turnover beyond what the experiment achieved. \u201cThe attrition rate is still high,\u201d he said. (Susan Lambert of the University of Chicago was the third author.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers chose the 28 stores in the study, then randomly selected the 19 where the new policies would take effect for just under a year. Although the managers in those stores had previously agreed to take part, the researchers could not be certain that they carried out all the new policies. The managers were simply urged to do so with the company\u2019s blessing, an approach known as \u201crandomized encouragement design.\u201d\n\nMarshall L. Fisher, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who is an expert on retailing and was not involved in the project, said the study provided compelling evidence that \u201cif you treat people decently, you get better results.\u201d\n\nMr. Fisher cautioned, however, that generalizing from the study to the company writ large, to say nothing of the entire industry, could be complicated. For one thing, he said, it was unclear if the improvement in sales would be as large as the researchers found if the company were to put the new policies in place in all of its stores at once. It is possible that the stores that adopted the new policies became attractive to shoppers, and may have siphoned traffic and sales from other Gap stores.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement, Gap was noncommittal on whether it would introduce most of the changes across all of its stores.\n\nLooming over the study was a gnawing question: Given the effort that went into making workers\u2019 schedules more consistent from day to day and week to week, why wasn\u2019t there more improvement in the actual scheduling?\n\nOne answer, the researchers concluded, is that the biggest cause of disruption in work schedules at Gap stores wasn\u2019t the fluctuation in traffic from customers, as was long assumed to be the case in retailing. Overly narrow decision-making at the corporate headquarters was a major factor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But schedules can nonetheless change quickly. According to interviews the researchers conducted with workers and managers, sales promotions mandated by corporate headquarters often required a large increase in worker-hours on short notice. So did preparing for store visits by executives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a roller coaster with promo changes,\u201d one manager told the researchers. \u201cThis week alone the window changed three times.\u201d\n\nAnother manager reported having \u201cprobably extended two to three shifts every day in the run up to the visit\u201d by an executive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers also identified inaccurate information about the size and timing of shipments as a key obstacle to predictable scheduling, since processing new inventory is labor-intensive.\n\nMr. Fisher said those findings could have an optimistic interpretation, because they suggested that it was largely within the company\u2019s power to smooth out the peaks and troughs in its workers\u2019 schedules. Some companies, like Costco, are able to provide more regular schedules in part by stocking a smaller range of products or scaling back or eliminating promotions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement, Gap brand\u2019s top human resources official, C. David Ard, said, \u201cWe are taking a closer look at certain decisions made at headquarters and actively examining changes that could further stabilize the store scheduling process.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the fact that an inconveniently timed shipment could derail a store\u2019s schedule may point to a broader issue: Stores like Gap frequently leave little margin for error when it comes to staffing because managers are given targets for labor hours and their ability to meet them figures prominently in their evaluations.\n\n\u201cA lot of the instability comes from managers having tight labor budgets,\u201d said Carrie Gleason, the director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group. \u201cThey\u2019re understaffing to basically meet their numbers from one week to the next. It\u2019s management by the practice of triage.\u201d\n\nAs part of its scheduling changes in 2015, Gap officially eliminated tentative \u201con-call\u201d shifts that could be canceled at the last minute.

In 2013, after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Cornyn voted against expanding background checks to cover guns sold over the internet and at gun shows.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, told reporters Tuesday that he was eager to pass it soon, and Mr. Cornyn said he hoped it could pass by next week.\n\nBut neither offered any specifics on a way forward.\n\nAs students plan a nationwide walkout on Wednesday to demand tougher gun laws, the slow progress of Mr. Cornyn\u2019s bill is yet another indication of how ossified the gun debate has become in Washington. The measure, known as the Fix NICS Act \u2014 NICS stands for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \u2014 is hardly radical and would not do anything to restrict gun ownership. It would simply enforce existing law.\n\nCongress passed a similar measure in 2007 after the shooting at Virginia Tech, hoping to improve the reporting of criminal records and mental health information to the gun purchasing database. It did not head off Sutherland Springs, where a gunman legally bought his firearm despite having been convicted of domestic abuse.\n\nYet at least two, and possibly, three Republican senators are blocking the proposal from quick consideration. And Democrats \u2014 whose leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, is a co-sponsor of the measure \u2014 do not want to allow it to move forward for a vote unless it is paired with more far-reaching legislation, like an expansion of background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\n\u201cHe comes to the floor every day and says, let\u2019s do the small Fix NICS bill and then we\u2019ll see about other proposals,\u201d Mr. Schumer said Tuesday, referring to Mr. Cornyn. \u201cHe knows, as well as I do, that Fix NICS is not even close to a response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the House is expected to vote Wednesday on a measure, introduced in response to the Parkland shooting, to beef up safety at the nation\u2019s schools.\n\nThat bill has nothing to do with guns; it would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats. A companion measure in the Senate would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof windows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely interested in seeing Senator Cornyn\u2019s Fix NICS bill pass, and a significant school safety bill pass,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cThe best way to get that done is still under discussion, but I\u2019m anxious to pass both of them and pass both of them soon.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the title conjures polite restraint, the novel itself is reliably free-flowing. And why not? Carey is once again in his happy place, Australia\u2019s past, this time the 1950s, where he\u2019s free to fill the text with all the evocations he savors as an expat, perched overseas in New York. While he isn\u2019t channeling a rough-hewn character like Ned Kelly, as he did in \u201cTrue History of the Kelly Gang,\u201d his second Man Booker Prize-winning novel, his two narrators still like to kink and twist their Aussie phrasing.\n\nIrene Bobs and Willie Bachhuber are neighbors in Bacchus Marsh, Carey\u2019s hometown. It\u2019s a familiar world: The author\u2019s parents sold automobiles when he was young, and at the beginning of the book Irene and her pint-size husband, Titch, are vying to get a dealership of their own. The race they enter, for the sake of publicity, is the Redex Trial, a dusty tour of Australia that will pit the dominance of Ford over \u201cAustralia\u2019s Own Car,\u201d the General Motors Holden: \u201cTwo hundred lunatics circumnavigating the continent of Australia, more than 10,000 miles over outback roads so rough they might crack your chassis clean in half.\u201d It\u2019s an adventure that will trace the \u201cCrystal Highway,\u201d named for all the broken windscreen glass scattered along the verges on a road of \u201crough conditions, corrugations, bulldust, bone-breaking rock\u201d and, in calmer moments, \u201cthe hypnotic undulations of the blacktop.\u201d The landscape is so alive to Carey that it forms a body, from the tip of Darwin down to the desolate Nullarbor Plain, where the wind whips the sand, the \u201cgnarled and stunted scrub, myall and mallee and mulga.\u201d \u201cIf Australia had a bottom,\u201d Carey writes, \u201cthis would be the place it did its business.\u201d\n\nThe land may be a character, but the speaking voices belong to Irene and Willie, the unlikely driver and her navigator. Irene is tough: a driver able to craft inventive solutions, at one point stretching her sister\u2019s dirty stocking over cylindrical mesh to reassemble an air cleaner. \u201cIf I had been so easily discouraged,\u201d she explains, \u201cI would still be a virgin bride. That was not how I did things, by being defeated at the start.\u201d\n\nWillie is the oft-mentioned German bachelor of Bacchus Marsh, a disgraced teacher suspended for holding a student out of a second-story window after being taunted with racial remarks. Raised by a Lutheran pastor in Adelaide, Willie is unaware of the complexity of his heritage. He\u2019s convinced his correct place in the world is \u201celsewhere, located on a map with German names.\u201d As he navigates for Irene and Titch along the Crystal Highway, these internal German maps of his lost identity become less important than those of his own country, just as the race becomes less important than the journey. Their battered Holden crosses land mapped with lines made by whites and Aboriginals, some laid down in the present, some as old as the soil. But Carey isn\u2019t bound by the car-race plot he introduces at the beginning. His plans for the novel flap as they exit out the window.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Much of the narrative frame concerns high politics, and rightly so. A book like this one is particularly valuable in an age when history undergraduates often startle their teachers by their ignorance of basic facts. So it\u2019s good to be reminded of the personal as well as principled conflicts among Wellington, Melbourne, Peel, Aberdeen, Disraeli and Gladstone, all of whom, one may say, seem towering figures by today\u2019s dismal standards. Against the reforming spirit of the age there were contrary forces, the neoreactionaries of \u201cYoung England\u201d and the high church revival of the Oxford movement.\n\nThat meant little to the victims of the \u201cHungry Forties,\u201d with severe recession throughout the country, and catastrophe in Ireland. Sir Robert Peel was converted to free trade and the repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws, with not much immediate effect on \u201cthe condition of England\u201d about which Thomas Carlyle and many others wrote.\n\nPhoto\n\nToward the end of the century, Sir John Seeley said with smug facetiousness that the British had acquired an empire, which by then extended over much of the globe, in \u201ca fit of absence of mind.\u201d What was true was the reluctance of successive governments for either war or expansion. Prime ministers found themselves \u2014 Lord Aberdeen in the Crimea and Lord Salisbury with the Boers \u2014 dragged into conflicts they didn\u2019t much want. And there was continual tension between the British government and distant settlers from South Africa to Australia, with London trying to restrain the settlers and making at least a pretense of safeguarding the interests of the indigenous peoples.\n\nAnd yet there was an underlying imperialist savagery, seen in the bloody suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, combined with cynicism. The English did not endear themselves to others by combining rapacity with seeming high-mindedness. If the governor of Hong Kong, who claimed that \u201cJesus Christ is free trade, and free trade is Jesus Christ,\u201d was an extreme case, there was nothing \u201cfree\u201d about the monstrous way China was forced to buy opium by the British.\n\nAs in that case, much of British commercial success had nothing to do with formal empire. By midcentury, \u201c1,500 British mercantile houses were trading around the world, and nearly two-thirds of them were based outside the European mainland, with 41 in Buenos Aires alone.\u201d As Cannadine says, the British had found the secret by which they could \u201coperate as a global hegemon on the cheap.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In some ways it actually was a generous country. Around and about Soho at the time could be found dissidents and revolutionists from half the countries of Europe \u2014 Louis Blanc, Karl Marx, Giuseppe Mazzini, Lajos Kossuth and Alexander Herzen. The Times boasted that \u201cthis country is the asylum of nations,\u201d a contrast indeed to today.\n\nAfter the very unsettled period in domestic politics from the 1840s to the 1860s, a modern party structure took shape, the franchise was widened twice more, and a secret ballot was introduced in 1872, dramatically affecting Ireland. Gladstone tried but failed to pass Home Rule and, as Cannadine grimly says, \u201cthe \u2018Irish question\u2019 was back, and it would not go away for the rest of the 19th century or, indeed, for the whole of the 20th century \u2014 and beyond.\u201d\n\nWhile the empire grew apace, so did production of the coal and ships that ensured British naval supremacy. And yet by the end of the century, a new boastful imperialism was qualified by a mood of apprehension, expressed by the bard of Empire himself. Kipling warned \u201clest we forget,\u201d and imagined the day when \u201call our pomp of yesterday / Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!\u201d\n\nBesides these alarms there was astonishing scientific advance, a steady decline in religion and also something wonderful. The \u201ccondescension of posterity\u201d would be exceptionally misplaced for literature. During the one decade 1811-20 not only were Byron, Keats and Shelley writing and Jane Austen\u2019s novels published, but Thackeray, Dickens, Trollope and George Eliot were all born. Maybe our vaunted contemporary writers will one day be rated as highly. We\u2019ll see.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Cannadine\u2019s lucid account there is the occasional slip (the 1833 Irish Church Temporalities Act suppressed 10 bishoprics, not 18). And there\u2019s one subject that he deals with cursorily at the very end, but that was of the greatest importance in the second part of the century: the growth of organized games. He mentions the publication of Mill\u2019s \u201cUtilitarianism\u201d in 1863, but not another and surely more important event that year, the meeting at a London pub that drew up a common code for association football.

The procedure was illegal in West Germany until the 1970s, when women took to the streets to demand the right to decide what happens with their bodies. In 1974, a law was passed legalizing abortion in the first trimester, but the country\u2019s highest court overturned that ruling the following year.\n\nA compromise requiring permission from a doctor in order to be allowed an abortion was further eased in the 1990s, after East Germany \u2014 where abortion was allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 was absorbed into the West, leading to the current legal agreement. Under that arrangement, abortion is a crime, but will not be prosecuted in the first 12 weeks if a woman undergoes counseling and a three-day waiting period.\n\nIn neighboring Austria, Christian Fiala, a gynecologist, has advertised for years that his clinic offers abortions. \u201cUnwanted pregnancy?\u201d reads a billboard in the University station of Vienna\u2019s subway that includes his clinic\u2019s name and telephone number. A decade ago, he began collecting the names of German doctors who perform abortions and publishing them on his website, which is based in Austria and therefore not subject to German restrictions.\n\n\u201cInformation is absolutely essential, because women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant need information urgently,\u201d Dr. Fiala said. \u201cThis has nothing do with advertising that would make it easier for a woman to decide to have an abortion just because she sees a poster somewhere. That idea is not only completely absurd, it is pretty sexist.\u201d\n\nThe Netherlands requires a five-day waiting period for an abortion to be carried out in the first 12 weeks, while in Belgium that time period is six days. In neighboring France, a woman seeking an abortion must take part in two consultations with a doctor or midwife.

Alibaba executives say they want to present a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d alternative to foreign media, a mission statement that echoes Fox News.\n\nGary Liu, a Harvard-educated technology entrepreneur who is The Post\u2019s chief executive, said the newspaper could offer a more nuanced portrait of China than Western news outlets, with a staff of 350 journalists in Asia, including about 40 in the mainland.\n\n\u201cWe are not here, certainly, to promote the views and wishes of Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was previously chief executive of Digg, a news aggregation site in New York.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut a culture of self-censorship at the newspaper predates its purchase by Alibaba, said Wang Feng, who served as The Post\u2019s online editor from 2012 to 2015. He said top editors routinely rewrote, played down or withheld critical stories for fear of offending influential Chinese officials or business executives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was often done in a very hush-hush manner,\u201d said Mr. Wang, now the editor of the Chinese-language website of The Financial Times. \u201cYou could see that people were not exactly free to speak their minds.\u201d\n\nThat timidity has persisted under Alibaba, according to more than a dozen Post journalists who, speaking on condition of anonymity, described how the paper shies away from investigative reporting on Communist Party leaders and contentious subjects such as human rights.\n\nLast year, The Post retracted a business column that suggested an investor in Hong Kong had ties to a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and had used his connections to amass wealth. The editors said the column made \u201cinsinuations beyond the facts.\u201d\n\nIts author, Shirley Yam, a well-respected financial commentator, resigned. In a statement, Ms. Yam defended her column, saying that editors had vetted the piece extensively before its publication.\n\nSome critics said the more notable change under Alibaba may be The Post\u2019s ramped-up production of articles that present China in a friendly light.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn February, Post journalists said, the Ministry of Public Security pushed the paper\u2019s top editors to send a reporter to interview Gui Minhai, a political critic and Swedish citizen whom the Chinese police had snatched from a train.\n\nMr. Gui was then quoted saying he had broken Chinese law and did not want help from the outside world. In its coverage, The Post said that the interview with Mr. Gui was \u201cgovernment-arranged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Post risks being a vehicle in Beijing\u2019s overall propaganda machinery,\u201d said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a former Post journalist.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Mr. Tsai, the co-founder who spoke at the celebration last month, maintains a close connection, offering occasional feedback on coverage and new products.\n\nThere has been at least one noticeable change since the sale: an outpouring of coverage of Alibaba and its leader, Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s richest men. Articles mentioning Alibaba reached an average of about 3.5 per day last year online and in print, roughly double the number in 2016, according to an archival search.\n\nAlibaba appears to be willing to lose money on The Post, which is not profitable, according to newsroom leaders. Mr. Tsai has said The Post, with a circulation of about 101,000 and more than 10 million monthly active users on its website, may not become a self-sustaining business for at least five more years.\n\nTraffic to The Post\u2019s website has roughly tripled over the past year, the company said. Alibaba made access free when it took over.\n\nBut Alibaba has abandoned ambitions of expanding the audience for The Post\u2019s journalism in the mainland, where its website is blocked. Even with its pro-China mission, articles in The Post still touch on topics that are off limits to mainland readers, like the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile many of its approximately 850 articles a week appear tailored for a Hong Kong or Asian audience, The Post has gone on a hiring spree of journalists from outlets like the BBC and The New York Times to help bring an international tone to its coverage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo cater to young people and readers in the United States, now its largest market, The Post this month launched Inkstone, an app and newsletter that offers a conversational take on China, and Abacus, a multimedia site focused on technology.

The measure is the rare piece of legislation supported by representatives from both the majority and opposition parties in the House. A survey released this month found that 53 percent of Filipinos support legalizing divorce.\n\nAbout 80 percent of Filipinos are Roman Catholic, and previous attempts to pass a divorce bill have faltered under the influence of the Catholic Church here, which vehemently opposes legislation that runs counter to its teachings.\n\nThe divorce bill comes in the wake of a bitter battle over a reproductive health law that provides modern family planning education and free birth control for the poor. It took more than 13 years to pass into law, which occurred in 2012; it then languished in appeals for several years, and has yet to be implemented fully. Politicians who supported that measure were vilified by priests or threatened with excommunication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just exhausting to be debating with the church all the time,\u201d said the deputy House speaker, Pia Cayetano, a practicing Catholic who advocated both reproductive health and divorce, and was denounced as an agent of the devil during Sunday Masses. \u201cA lot of my colleagues are just too scared\u201d to take on the church, she said.\n\n\u201cWhile divorce may indeed vindicate the rights of women, as congressmen believed,\u201d the Rev.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "These days I spend most of my time writing and working on a documentary series. Though I do love my work, I miss the camaraderie of professional kitchens. So when some chef friends recently invited me to join them for the day, I jumped at the opportunity. Shortly after we turned to peeling and chopping, I noticed two cooks at the other end of the kitchen whispering excitedly to each other. I waited a few minutes, hoping they\u2019d invite the rest of us into their salacious conversation. When they didn\u2019t, I impatiently demanded to know the subject of their gossip. Rolling her eyes, one of them responded, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a recipe, Samin.\u201d\n\nI blushed. And then I asked for the recipe.\n\nUsually when a friend hands me a beloved recipe, it comes with a warning not to change anything. My inability to follow recipes as written \u2014 without obeying the devil on my shoulder telling me to replace ingredients or change the temperature \u2014 is well documented. But this recipe, for something I\u2019d never tried called butter mochi, was different. Written in cook\u2019s shorthand, it seemed simple enough \u2014 just a few ingredients stirred together in no particular order, then baked. And at the top, a note promised that the cake was \u201ceasy and forgiving\u201d to adaptation.\n\nI decided to make the recipe once as directed before getting creative, but my commitment was tested immediately. The original list of ingredients included evaporated milk, an ingredient I\u2019d never used. I had to suppress the urge to replace it with heavy cream, as I do when I \u201cfollow\u201d the pie recipe on the label of Libby\u2019s canned pumpkin. But I remained strong. Peeling back the lid, I realized evaporated milk is just milk that has been cooked down to a thicker, sweeter version of itself. I stirred it into the batter along with the other ingredients, poured it all into a large cake pan and slipped it into the oven.\n\nButter mochi is the Hawaiian descendant of chewy Asian rice cakes like Japanese mochi, Filipino bibingka and Chinese nian gao. Unlike those versions, though, it\u2019s enriched with a stick of butter. And with a recipe that calls for exactly a can each of coconut and evaporated milks, I suspect it\u2019s the prime hapa example of classic postwar dump-and-stir baking.\n\nWhen I pulled mine from the oven, I was surprised by its still-pale hue. My general opinion about baked goods is that darker is always better, so I was skeptical. But that didn\u2019t keep me from having a taste before the mochi could cool completely. It was so sweet that it burned my throat. Its extraordinary gumminess \u2014 not a quality I generally seek in my food \u2014 overwhelmed me. But I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Once the mochi cooled, its texture shifted from gummy to addictively chewy. As I picked at it over the next couple of days, it became clear that the outer edge was the best part. The way the slightly caramelized crust contrasted with the gooey center reminded me of my favorite pastry: the canel\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat I love most about that small, legendary pastry from Bordeaux is the satisfying contrast between its deeply caramelized crust and tender, custardy center. But I\u2019m far too lazy and stingy to try making it myself. Most canel\u00e9 recipes begin with an instruction to brush $30 copper molds with melted beeswax. Unsurprisingly, I\u2019ve never made it past the internet search for \u201cused canel\u00e9 molds\u201d before giving up.", "title": "A Lazy Woman\u2019s Canel\u00e9", "authors": ["Samin Nosrat"]}

{"date": "2018-03-17 00:00:00", "text": "Now and again, another startling upset occurs that causes people to invoke Chaminade\u2019s name. That happened on Friday, when a school called the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, beat top-ranked Virginia, 74-54. U.M.B.C. became the first 16th-seeded men\u2019s team to beat a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament.\n\nChaminade found itself in the conversation again. That it was Virginia, first in 1982, again in 2018, gives the discussion a poetic refrain. \u201cIt amazes me that people don\u2019t forget that game for some crazy reason,\u201d Lopes, now 85, said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens to Maryland and how people talk about them 35 years from now.\u201d\n\nA tiny Catholic university, with fewer than 1,000 students and a shared campus with a high school, about a mile from Waikiki, Chaminade was in the process of changing its name before Dec. 23, 1982. The school wanted something easier to remember, easier to pronounce. It wanted to be the University of Honolulu.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut then its basketball team beat Virginia, the best team in the country. Chaminade \u2014 suddenly famous, forever remembered \u2014 could not change its name. How could you, after people made T-shirts and stickers that read, \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Chaminade\u201d?\n\n\u201cThe name Chaminade became a household name,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cIt\u2019s so recognizable. We\u2019re very proud of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaybe U.M.B.C. will resist the urge, someday, to rename itself something easier to remember, something more phonetically alluring, because of the lingering fame of a basketball game. Maybe those clunky initials will become part of the sporting lexicon, shorthand for a monumental upset, the way that the once unknown, often mispronounced Chaminade has been for 35 years.\n\nFor now, though, it does not seem right to try to compare the two, really. How do you rank upsets, anyway? Who cares? The only sure thing is that Chaminade\u2019s victory came in a different time and a far different place.\n\nOn Friday, U.M.B.C.\u2019s feat unfolded in a full-size, full arena in Charlotte, N.C., in real time everywhere. Countless people around the world, presumably, gathered around television screens and mobile devices to watch it happen. The U.M.B.C. athletic department\u2019s Twitter account played along as color commentator. Its followers grew tenfold in a matter of hours, pushing past 50,000.\n\nIn 1982 in Honolulu, the only people watching were the 3,383 counted in the Neal Blaisdell Center, which was not half full. There were no television cameras. News of the upset, in the middle of the night in the early hours of Christmas Eve for most of the United States, took hours, even days, to spread across the mainland.\n\n(As Sports Illustrated wrote a decade ago in an article titled \u201cThe Greatest Upset Never Seen,\u201d Chaminade\u2019s victory, among other things, \u201cassured that ESPN and its cable spawn would henceforth permit virtually no game to go untelevised.\u201d)\n\nThe culture and the game were different back then. There was no shot clock, no 3-point line. Virginia, with the 7-foot-4 center Ralph Sampson, the two-time player of the year, was undefeated. It had beaten Georgetown about 10 days earlier in what was dubbed, despite occurring just two years into the 1980s, the \u201cgame of the decade.\u201d\n\nVirginia and Sampson arrived in Hawaii from Japan, having just beaten Utah and the University of Houston, which had been gaining steam as a high-flying juggernaut nicknamed Phi Slama Jama. The Virginia Cavaliers were 8-0, and Honolulu was meant as a rest stop on the way home.\n\nChaminade was an N.A.I.A. school that had lost to Wayland Baptist two nights before. At the time, Lopes was a junior high school counselor who coached Chaminade on the side.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Unlike what happened on Friday, when U.M.B.C. turned a halftime tie with the Cavaliers into a rout, Chaminade fell behind by 7 midway through the second half. The Silverswords, named after a plant, chipped away at the lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSampson was guarded mostly by Randolph. They knew each other from Virginia, where they grew up. Randolph spent years guarding Sampson in recreation leagues and in high school, and reportedly even dated Sampson\u2019s sister. (He said on Saturday that they were \u201cgood friends.\u201d)\n\nRandolph, knowing he could not compete with Sampson inside, hit several midrange jump shots that pulled his opponent out from under the basket. Randolph scored 19 points and hauled in five rebounds. Sampson had 12 points and 17 rebounds.\n\n\u201cRalph was so caught up playing those big guys, like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing, that he forgot that his homeboy could shoot jumpers,\u201d said Randolph, now 55, a basketball coach who spent years counseling troubled youth.\n\nWhen Chaminade\u2019s Mark Rodrigues lobbed a pass over Sampson on a backdoor screen to fellow guard Tim Dunham for a dunk, the score was tied.\n\nDunham, who attended high school at St. Louis School, the Catholic school that shares a campus with Chaminade, soon broke the tie for good with a 22-foot jumper, with just over five minutes remaining.\n\nThat was when fans in the building truly began to believe that they were witnessing a game that would resonate across time zones and over the years. Chaminade usually attracted dozens or hundreds of fans, not thousands. Most were there that night to see the best team and the best player in the country, not the scrappy squad of locals.\n\n\u201cAs the game unfolded, they were a little quiet, but all of a sudden when we started pouring it on and getting the lead, the crowd just switched,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cThat\u2019s when they got the chills. \u2018Are they going to beat these guys?\u2019 \u201d\n\nVirginia, down by 2 points, missed three shots in the final minute. Then Chaminade sealed the victory with three free throws. The postgame photograph on the court, taken after fans in the stands called the team out of the locker room for an encore, is on a wall that serves as a Hall of Fame at Chaminade. The 1982-83 team was inducted in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe victory spawned the Maui Invitational, an early-season tournament that attracts some of the top programs to Hawaii. Chaminade, now in Division II in the Pacific West Conference, plays and occasionally upsets one of them, despite having lost its element of surprise more than three decades ago.\n\n(\u201cDon\u2019t be the next Virginia,\u201d one can hear a coach telling his players. Turns out that, as of Friday night, Virginia might have become the next Virginia, with U.M.B.C. the next Chaminade.)\n\nThese days, Chaminade has 1,157 undergraduates. Seventy percent of them are from Hawaii, and 71 percent of the students are women, the school said. A movie deal about Chaminade\u2019s upset win over Virginia is in the works, said William Villa, the athletic director.\n\n\u201cThat hopefully will help to perpetuate the Chaminade legend to a whole new audience who weren\u2019t in this world in 1982,\u201d Villa said in an email on Saturday.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re Chaminade on the rise \u2014 35 years later!\u201d\n\nBack in 1982-83, it was not Virginia\u2019s only upset loss to rock college basketball. North Carolina State beat Virginia in the final of their conference tournament, which got the Wolfpack into the N.C.A.A. tournament, where they beat Virginia again in a regional final. That set up North Carolina State\u2019s dramatic championship victory over Houston, another game that is mentioned in the debate over history\u2019s biggest upset.\n\nIt took Virginia 35 years \u2014 all the way to this February \u2014 to attain the No. 1 ranking again. It took U.M.B.C. a game to take it away, just as Chaminade did in 1982.\n\n\u201cIt seems like every year there\u2019s more and more people who were at that game,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cThere was only 3,000 that night, but now there\u2019s about 80,000.\u201d", "title": "A Little-Known University Stuns No. 1 Virginia?

With no state, church or royal funding, it is supported by entry fees (an adult ticket costs about $30, or \u00a322) and donations. Last year, the abbey attracted 1.3 million visitors and 300,000 worshipers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe museum will be accessible only through a Gothic-style tower being built outside the abbey.

She left her seat, then returned to it.\n\n\u201cAfter that, there was a decision to rehearse in advance,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said. Starting in 1937, rehearsals used replicas of the crown jewels.

Jante is governed by the \u201cLaw of Jante,\u201d rules for living that reflect both Scandinavia\u2019s ethnic homogeneity and its long-held belief that people are happier when both pleasure and pain are spread among all citizens:\n\nYou shall not believe that you are someone.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are as good as we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are any wiser than we are.\n\nYou shall never indulge in the conceit of imagining that you are better than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you know more than we do.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are more important than we are.\n\nYou shall not believe that you are going to amount to anything.\n\nYou shall not laugh at us.\n\nYou shall not believe that anyone cares about you.\n\nYou shall not believe that you can teach us anything.\n\nThese days, Scandinavians bristle at the mention of the Law of Jante. Such stereotypes, they insist, no longer have such a stronghold in a modern world, one where Stockholm now leads in billion-dollar technology companies per capita, second only to Silicon Valley.\n\nYet it is hard not to think of Sandemose as you drive along the winter-deserted roads of Gotland, Sweden\u2019s largest island, a 40-minute flight south from Stockholm. About the size of Long Island and flat as a soccer field, it is the country\u2019s sunniest locale. (Admittedly, that doesn\u2019t say much in a place that spends most of the year in frigid darkness.) And along with Faro, its companion island off its northern tip, it is forever associated with the director Ingmar Bergman, who set many of his greatest films here and lived in Faro for the last decades of his life. In July and early August, Gotland is a tourist mecca; young professionals, starved for heat and light, party in the beer gardens of Visby, a port town of 24,300. An hour or two away, up and down the coasts, are the summer houses of the country\u2019s politicians and business executives, fronting beaches dotted with rauks \u2014 gigantic, craggy sculptural formations unique to the area, as ghostly as something from Stonehenge, created by ice-age reef erosions.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Within a year of putting its initial offerings on the market in December 2015, Forest City had sold 80 percent of all units on the first island. The project is a relatively cheap alternative to property havens in North America, Australia and China itself. A luxury two-bedroom apartment costs only $180,000 in Forest City, about a third of what it would command in Shanghai. Still, the sheer volume in sales means that Forest City raked in more than $3 billion in 2016 alone, according to the company. Much of this money was Chinese flight capital, but Country Garden has tried to make buying into Forest City seem almost patriotic. One Olympic-themed show unit features the gold-medal shooters Du Li and Pang Wei, who have invested here, too. (A sign proclaims in Chinese: \u201cWelcome home, Olympic champions!\u201d) Throughout the sales tour, potential buyers are reminded that Forest City sits in a strategic geographical position for China \u2014 astride a vital maritime route that connects their homeland with the rest of the world.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut after a banner year in 2016, Forest City encountered significant setbacks in 2017 \u2014 revealing some of the fault lines created by the phenomenal growth of Chinese wealth. The uncomfortable fact that hundreds of thousands of Chinese may soon be residents of Malaysia led a former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, to lash out at the project last year. \u201cWe should realize that once we sell land to others, we no longer have any ownership over it,\u201d he said. The sultan of Johor accused Mahathir of \u201cplaying the politics of fear and race\u201d ahead of nationwide elections in which the former prime minister is running. But Mahathir, 92, railed on. He even compared the situation to the sultanate\u2019s sale of the neighboring island of Temasek to the British nearly two centuries ago. That island is now the wealthy city-state Singapore.\n\nGeopolitics only added to the controversy. Forest City sits just a few miles off the Straits of Malacca, an indispensable channel for commerce ever since the beginning of the global spice trade in the 16th century. Today the straits are China\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, a vulnerable choke point through which 80 percent of its oil imports flow. China is building pipelines, ports and railways in Pakistan and Myanmar to relieve its dependence on this waterway. It is also lavishing Malaysia with large investments, like a $7.2 billion port complex in Malacca, to secure its position along the straits. Forest City is not a government infrastructure project, but it is a largely autonomous Chinese outpost in a strategic location. \u201cWhere else in the world has a foreign company created new land in another country, populated it with people from its home country and asserted sovereignty over it?\u201d Moser asks. \u201cThis is a brand-new level of colonial expansion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd yet the greatest blow to Forest City last year was struck by the Chinese government, through a set of new restrictions that underscore the tension inherent in Beijing\u2019s economic vision, in which it encourages companies to \u201cgo global\u201d yet fears the exodus of its citizens\u2019 new wealth. Over the last decade, China has seen an estimated $3.8 trillion in capital leave the country, much of it going into offshore real estate. In an effort to crack down on rampant capital flight, Beijing tightened its capital controls, making it nearly impossible for investors to send large amounts of money out of the country. The limit on foreign transfers remains $50,000 a year per person, but now senders must sign a pledge that no money will be used to buy property \u2014 and face investigation if they violate the pledge. The tougher controls have strengthened China\u2019s currency and stabilized its foreign reserves, but many Chinese investors, including some Forest City customers, were left stranded: They had made down payments on their tropical idylls, but banks wouldn\u2019t let them send the rest.\n\nSoon after the restrictions were put in place, Country Garden shuttered its Forest City sales offices in China \u2014 \u201cfor renovation,\u201d a notice said \u2014 and scrambled to find new customers in Dubai, Japan, Thailand and beyond. Yu Runze, the president of Country Garden Pacificview, the joint venture that runs Forest City, told Today, a Singapore newspaper, last year that capital controls gave them \u201can opportunity to shift our sales strategy to be more international.\u201d Forest City hasn\u2019t revealed its 2017 sales figures, so it\u2019s hard to tell just how much its business has suffered.\n\nStill, on a recent Saturday, a few hundred visitors \u2014 almost all of them Mandarin speakers \u2014 circulated through the sales gallery. They gaped at the sleek scale model with \u201csold out\u201d towers, tested a facial-recognition camera and ate dumplings at one of the Chinese restaurants. No transactions seemed to be taking place, but outside, the flock of construction cranes kept moving and Forest City continued to rise. \u201cThere are so many permutations on how this project can move ahead that it\u2019s unwise to write it off prematurely,\u201d Yu said. \u201cNever underestimate the resolve of a new China.\u201d /\u2022/", "title": "A Malaysian Insta-City Becomes a Flash Point for Chinese Colonialism \u2014 and Capital Flight", "authors": ["Brook Larmer", "On Money"]}

But critics \u2014 some in his own party \u2014 say that by not issuing a more direct warning, Mr. McConnell is undermining Congress\u2019s standing as a coequal branch of government \u2014 and inviting Mr. Trump to act on his impulses.\n\nIt is time, they say, for the majority leader to lead.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we ought to do is be more forceful \u2014 everybody, especially the leadership,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who took to Twitter on Tuesday to beg the president not to fire the special counsel and warn that doing so could lead to impeachment. (Mr. Graham issued a similar warning during an interview with the radio host Hugh Hewitt.)\n\nRepublican leaders including Mr. McConnell, Mr. Flake said, should \u201cstand up and forcefully say, \u2018This will not stand.\u2019\u201d\n\nConfrontation is not Mr. McConnell\u2019s style. He is a shrewd politician and a parliamentary tactician who much prefers operating behind the scenes. Complicating matters, his wife, Elaine L. Chao, is the secretary of transportation, in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always viewed his role as more of a legislative craftsman than a moral leader,\u201d said William Kristol, the founding editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. He sees Mr. McConnell \u2014 and many other Republicans \u2014 as making a purely political calculation in their silence.\n\n\u201cThe Republican primary electorate is pro-Trump, a good chunk of it,\u201d Mr. Kristol said. \u201cWhy pick a fight with them? Why get in the middle of anything?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s weekend Twitter posts, driven by the ever-widening scope of the Mueller investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference, was the first time he had criticized the special counsel by name, not counting a message he reshared. The president has long insisted that neither he nor his campaign colluded with Russia. He calls the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump ordered the firing of Mr. Mueller in June, but backed off after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\n\nSuch threats have inspired two bipartisan bills that would add job protections for Mr. Mueller and future special counsels. Both would empower a panel of federal judges to review the case for firing the special counsel and render a judgment about whether there was good cause to do so. Both are stalled in committee.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Bush on domestic policy, that is not good enough.\n\nMr. McConnell and other Republican leaders must \u201cmake it clear to Trump and the White House that if he fires Mueller, that is crossing a red line, and there will be consequences,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. One idea: Warn the president that Congress will hire Mr. Mueller to continue his inquiry if Mr. Trump fires him.\n\n\u201cI understand that this is not McConnell\u2019s thing to speak out and challenge people publicly, and maybe he is being extremely effective privately \u2014 and if he is, more power to him,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, what\u2019s said publicly matters, too. And at some point, if what Trump says and does is met with silence, it implies complicity for the party.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell learned the dangers of criticizing Mr. Trump in August, when he was asked in Kentucky about the Senate\u2019s struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Defending the chamber\u2019s work, Mr. McConnell offered an offhand assessment of how the president appeared to be learning on the job, saying Mr. Trump \u201chad excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201d\n\nIt was hardly inflammatory, but the comment infuriated Mr. Trump, who responded with a Twitter tirade against the leader that lasted six weeks. The two did not speak for a long stretch during that period, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where Mr. McConnell privately expressed doubts that Mr. Trump could salvage his presidency.\n\nIn October, as suddenly as it began, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack ended. In an orchestrated show of togetherness, he brought Mr. McConnell into the Rose Garden to declare that the two were \u201ccloser than ever before.\u201d One person close to Mr. McConnell says he does not want a repeat of what followed the \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d remark.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat caused him six weeks of unrelenting pain of Trump whacking him,\u201d that person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Mr. McConnell\u2019s thinking. \u201cI think at that moment, McConnell learned a lesson: There\u2019s nothing to be gained by commenting on his comments because it doesn\u2019t change his behavior.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell has always been a man of few words, and one who chooses his words carefully. Unlike other senators who linger in the Capitol corridors to talk with reporters, he shuns hallway interviews and rarely takes more than a few questions at his Tuesday briefings. His reticence is integral to his leadership style.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why he\u2019s a pretty effective leader \u2014 it\u2019s because he economizes words,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff for Mr. McConnell who remains close to him. \u201cWhen he speaks, it generally means something.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell also makes it a point not to speak out on an issue unless his position has changed. He said in November, and then again in January, that he saw no need for legislation to protect the special counsel; when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets over the weekend, his advisers simply cited those statements.\n\nAnd the leader routinely advises his conference that it is more effective to deal with concerns internally than debate them through the news media.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, \u201che probably communicates it directly and doesn\u2019t feel the need to pontificate in public.\u201d", "title": "A Man of Few Words, McConnell Tiptoes Around the Issue of Mueller", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"]}

Sure enough, he holds a grudge. Thirteen years earlier, Joona interfered with the Sandman scheme, which had Jurek spiriting away the wives and children of his enemies. They never came back, and if all went well, their husbands or fathers would be driven to suicide.\n\nPhoto\n\nThese are the memories that warm Jurek\u2019s heart on lonely days. But \u201cThe Sandman\u201d disrupts his peace of mind by allowing one of the kidnapped children to reappear suddenly after years of apparent captivity. The boy\u2019s father, who has descended into Champagne-soaked decadence, suddenly becomes the most doting of parents and hopes Joona can find his missing daughter too.\n\nThe boy\u2019s story is suitably eerie. He was locked up and blindfolded, and he can\u2019t remember much. This fits in with the M.O. of Jurek, whose crime spree ended when he was caught having imprisoned a woman in a coffin for two years, which he found much more satisfying than killing her. You will probably wind up on the fence about whether you needed to know more about him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut is Jurek the Sandman? The latter was a creature right out of children\u2019s fables. He tossed sand at them, clicked porcelain fingers, forced them into a sleep from which they couldn\u2019t awaken.

He himself has already made huge sacrifices to this case, as we find out. He\u2019s being an honest cop by telling Saga the truth, and she doesn\u2019t flinch at it. She\u2019s his peer when it comes to meeting this challenge.\n\nBy this point the book\u2019s greatest tension comes from wondering whether either Joona or Saga is any match for this near-supernatural monster, who can implant thoughts in his victims\u2019 heads or turn up as an apparition just staring into their windows. Scared yet? You will be.\n\nKnopf has taken the trouble of having some of the other books retranslated into English for their rerelease.

But Xhenet Aliu\u2019s perceptive debut novel, \u201cBrass,\u201d offers a reminder that assumptions \u2014 whether about a place, or a person as close to you as your mother \u2014 never tell the full story.\n\nIn Aliu\u2019s Waterbury, daughters aren\u2019t exactly wanted. Instead of Victorians, there are triple-deckers, their porches lined with railings that flex against a body\u2019s weight. Meals are sometimes labeled \u201cGRADE D BUT EDIBLE.\u201d The brass factories that had once made the town attractive to waves of Eastern European immigrants have long been closed, though the grandchildren of those hopeful workers remain, largely trapped in dead-end jobs. Aliu\u2019s characters, most of whom have seen little of the world outside of Waterbury, understand at a visceral level that to live costs money; everything in this novel \u2014 the rubber soles on sneakers, bread from the Hostess outlet, an ultrasound \u2014 is quantified. One narrative thread is uneasily resolved when a character upgrades from an air mattress to a bed. For Elsie and Lulu, the mother and daughter at the center of the book, the most valuable thing in Waterbury is a ticket out.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBrass\u201d is their duet, and Elsie sings the opening note. She is the young granddaughter of Lithuanian immigrants, a waitress, with a doomed crush on Bashkim, an Albanian line cook with secrets back home. In an abrupt second chapter shift, their 17-year-old daughter Luljeta takes over, narrating in a second person that feels appropriate for a girl in the middle of crisis. Lulu, a soft-spoken, Honor Roll student, has just been rejected by N.Y.U. and suspended for fighting, all in the course of a single day. The plot advances through each woman\u2019s story; as the symmetries between them pile up, along with misunderstandings, the novel accumulates momentum and emotional power. In Elsie\u2019s storyline, we\u2019re reading for Lulu\u2019s arrival; meanwhile, in the narrative present, Lulu is rejecting her mother to pursue the mystery of the father who left her behind.\n\nAfter Lulu\u2019s suspension, Elsie, switching to the third person, accuses her daughter of not acting like herself: \u201cDon\u2019t try to tell me. I\u2019m her mother. You think I don\u2019t know Luljeta?\u201d It\u2019s one of many funny exchanges in \u201cBrass\u201d \u2014 what daughter hasn\u2019t heard her mother say such a thing \u2014 but it\u2019s also a deft illustration of the way both women are hemmed in by the other\u2019s long-held assumptions. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s infuriating, your mother\u2019s need for you,\u201d Lulu says, later. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you should serve as her primary motivation for getting out of bed in the morning, especially considering that you have no idea what the hell you want from your own life, other than to get out of this crap town and figure it out elsewhere.\u201d Reading that, I both wanted Lulu to \u201cget out,\u201d and to shake her for being so ungrateful. They\u2019ll never see each other, or themselves, as clearly as the reader gets to see them both \u2014 that\u2019s the magic trick here. In granting the reader access to both women\u2019s interiority, Aliu brings to life the simple, heartbreaking fact that though our stories can intersect, we\u2019re ourselves alone.\n\nExcept, maybe, when we are still part of our mothers. For fear of spoiling it, all I will say about the moment Elsie and Lulu meet for the first time is that it transformed what was already a unique coming-of-age story and an incisive reckoning with class in America to something unforgettably wise and powerful. From its opening page, \u201cBrass\u201d simmers with anger \u2014 the all too real byproduct of working hard for not enough, of being a woman in a place where women have little value, of getting knocked down one too many times. But when the simmer breaks into a boil, Aliu alchemizes that anger into love, and in doing so creates one of the most potent dramatizations of the bond between mother and daughter that I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nOf course, the ending note is Lulu\u2019s \u2014 as the daughter, she will finish what her mother started. It\u2019s the kind of quiet closing gesture that feels less like an ending than an opening. I left this book with the sure sense that the characters were alive beyond its pages, though I wouldn\u2019t dare try to guess what they are up to \u2014 Elsie and Lulu are too real for that.", "title": "A Mother and Daughter and a Town Made of \u2018Brass\u2019", "authors": ["Julie Buntin", "Xhenet Aliu"]}

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "The Galeries Lafayette already has an exhibition space devoted to art, contemporary fashion and design: the Galerie des Galeries, which opened in the store in 2001. Mr. Houz\u00e9, 36, an established collector cherished by commercial galleries around the Marais, said his passion for art drew him to engage more deeply. \u201cIn 2011, I convinced my family to further our commitment and to imagine creating a foundation, but actually I had no idea about what we would do,\u201d he recalled. \u201cParis has a lot of institutions and foundations.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is indeed plenty of competition for the art-loving public\u2019s attention. Alongside public institutions like the Pompidou Center and Palais de Tokyo, the city is served by the Cartier Foundation, the Ricard Foundation, and the recently opened Louis Vuitton Foundation and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Seydoux-Path\u00e9 Foundation. Next year, the luxury magnate Fran\u00e7ois Pinault will open a private museum to showcase his art collection in the central Bourse de Commerce, which sits midway between the Pompidou Center and the Louvre.\n\nWhat Mr. Houz\u00e9 hopes will set Lafayette Anticipations apart will be its provisions for production, with exchanges of ideas across disciplines and the ability to fabricate artworks and spectacles on a massive scale, for exhibition both on and off site. Ahead of the building\u2019s completion, well-equipped workshops in the basement were already up and running, assisting in projects destined for the Tate, the New Museum in New York, the Kunsthalle Basel and the Pompidou Center.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn English, Rue du Pl\u00e2tre, the location of the new art space, translates as \u201cplaster street.\u201d Lafayette Anticipations has brought the plaster workers back to one of the most architecturally protected areas of Paris, and with them carpenters, metalworkers, programmers, dressmakers and all else that an artist might need to realize an ambitious work.\n\nMr. Koolhaas\u2019s involvement started in late 2011, when Ms. Finders joined Mr. Koolhaas\u2019s firm, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. She continued her conversations with Mr. Houz\u00e9 and his team, helping them delve further into the connections between Galeries Lafayette and the Paris art world, not just in terms of patronage and investment but in episodes of historical coincidence. \u201cThe department store was born at the same time as the art salon, and the new urban development of Paris,\u201d Ms. Finders said.\n\nThe following year, Galeries Lafayette invited the Office for Metropolitan Architecture and its research arm to mount a historical exhibition in the Galerie des Galeries. Together with a team in the Koolhaas firm that included the architect Cl\u00e9ment P\u00e9riss\u00e9, Ms. Finders dug into the archives on the ninth floor of the Boulevard Haussmann building. Exploring the family\u2019s history was a process Mr. P\u00e9riss\u00e9 called \u201ca sort of mutual psychoanalysis\u201d between the architects and the Galeries Lafayette group. For Ms. Finders, it was a means, too, of divining how accommodating Mr. Houz\u00e9 and his group might be to radical propositions: \u201cWe needed to know what they could tolerate: What was their breaking point.\u201d\n\nBesides Galeries Lafayette\u2019s innovations in retail, what stood out in Mr. P\u00e9riss\u00e9 and Ms. Finders\u2019 study was the store\u2019s long heritage of production, from apparel making through contemporary design. This tradition of creating and commissioning became foundational to the art space\u2019s identity: The name Lafayette Anticipations was chosen to suggest the start of a process and expectations of things to come.\n\nTHE GOAL to be a nimble platform for creation has been given rather literal physical form in Mr. Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture\u2019s design. A glass box with four movable segments of flooring on vertical tracks now occupies a former courtyard space. These provide adaptable space at the core.\n\nThe movable parts offer 49 possible configurations to accommodate a range of projects. \u201cSince it\u2019s not about a collection, you couldn\u2019t be precise\u201d about what would be exhibited and how, Mr. Koolhaas said. \u201cPerformance, ballet, theater, music, concerts, digital, video, film: Already, those are extremely diverse and can sometimes have opposite demands. We have to accommodate all of those.\u201d\n\nThis is not the Office for Metropolitan Architecture\u2019s first building with a central elevating platform. In 1998, it unveiled the audacious Maison Bordeaux, a home created for a client in a wheelchair. More radical, perhaps, is the discretion of this project: The architect\u2019s intervention is not visible from the street. Mr. Koolhaas, whose firm is responsible for memorable landmarks like the looping CCTV headquarters in Beijing, said there is now a \u201ctotal excess in terms of visibility of architecture.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRather than plan more attention-grabbing buildings, he suggested that architecture insinuate itself into the fabric of a city. Mr. Koolhaas rejects the idea that Paris\u2019s status as a living museum stultifies innovation. \u201cI, myself, would have maybe represented that idea even 10 or 12 years ago,\u201d he conceded. Today, the notion that architectural preservation necessarily causes creative stagnation is, he said, \u201csimply a lack of ambition: a lack of understanding of what you can do within preservation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSo, for me, preservation became a very interesting field,\u201d he continued, suggesting a new urban paradigm in which architects leave the existing architectural language of the street intact and reimagine those portions that are out of sight. \u201cI think it\u2019s also, in a certain way, an interesting, new, metropolitan style,\u201d he said, \u201cold outside but super fresh, new, inside.\u201d\n\nThe Marais is already home to several buildings that hide contemporary glass boxes behind Haussmannian facades. Many, like the Marian Goodman Gallery, are adapted to accommodate contemporary artworks that grow ever larger, in turn, to fill the outsize exhibition spaces of modern museums and galleries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While he might not acknowledge it as such, one could view Lafayette Anticipations\u2019 production facility as, in part, an architect and a collector\u2019s solution to an architect- and collector-generated problem: a way to help artists tasked with filling enormous gallery spaces beyond the practical scope of an individual.\n\nLAFAYETTE ANTICIPATIONS itself is of relatively modest dimensions, with 9,400 square feet of exhibition space \u2014 less than a quarter of the Louis Vuitton Foundation\u2019s. It reflects Mr. Houz\u00e9\u2019s positioning of his institution \u201con the side\u201d of Paris\u2019s new art ecosystem. Unlike the huge crowds that attend the Palais de Tokyo openings, Lafayette looks to keep its audiences small and focused.\n\nAsked how he might judge success, if not by audience size, Lafayette Anticipations\u2019 managing director, Fran\u00e7ois Quintin, suggested it might come from the liberated quality that emerges when commercial imperatives are removed.\n\nIn Paris, as in London and New York, the cost of living puts pressure on artists to create work that can be sold. Rising rents have driven artist-run spaces out of the city center and fomented the closing of smaller independent galleries. Lafayette Anticipations \u201cwas not conceived to be an alternative, but of course it is,\u201d Mr. Quintin said. \u201cSometimes we are able to produce things that neither galleries nor museums are able or wanted to produce.\u201d\n\nWorking with three associate curators in programming the art space, among them Charles Aubin of Performa in New York, Mr. Quintin is setting his sights on the international as well as the local scene. The only common criterion that he seeks in artists to work with is \u201cintelligence\u201d: bright minds for a bright new space.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say what the impact will be on the Paris scene. Perhaps for this reason, Lafayette Anticipations\u2019 future has been left open: Only two shows have been scheduled, including the opening exhibition, a site-specific installation by the New York artist Lutz Bacher.\n\n\u201cI have an image of where the foundation could be in 25 years,\u201d Mr. Quintin said, smiling. \u201cBut I have no idea of what we\u2019re going to do in two.\u201d", "title": "A Newcomer in the Paris Art Scene Jostles for Position", "authors": ["Hettie Judah"]}

But it is especially true for Mr. Trump, who spent his first year in the Oval Office in a near constant state of agitation about what he views as a media that is unfair and plotting against him.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always so. As a real estate developer and later a reality TV star, Mr. Trump eagerly sought the media\u2019s attention, basking in the fame and celebrity that produced front page articles and frequent appearances on news programs.\n\nAs president, he remains drawn to the TV lights and the newspaper headlines, often conducting discussions and negotiations live on television. But he also complains bitterly when the stories turn negative or personal.\n\nDuring his remarks on Saturday, he acknowledged one of those story lines: that his administration is in constant chaos.\n\n\u201cI like turnover. I like chaos,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt really is good. Who is going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?\u201d\n\nAt that point, he looked out to his wife and asked whether she still loved him.\n\nThe Gridiron dinner has long been a bipartisan venue for good-natured ribbing at times when tensions between the media, lawmakers and the president are at their highest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama took a few swipes at the conservative media, saying that he enjoyed doing an interview during the Super Bowl with Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News. \u201cI don\u2019t often get a chance to be in a room with an ego that\u2019s bigger than mine,\u201d he joked.\n\nFour years later, Mr. Obama tried a bit of humor at his own expense, noting that \u201cif I did not love America, I wouldn\u2019t have moved here from Kenya.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump has not always been a good sport when he is on the receiving end of the roasting. In 2011, when Mr. Obama savaged him at the White House Correspondent\u2019s Dinner, Mr. Trump appeared to take it badly, and some say his decision to run for president was a result in part of his anger at Mr. Obama for the jokes.\n\nThis time, he turned the tables. Saturday\u2019s dinner was a chance for Mr. Trump to enjoy a bit of humor at other people\u2019s expense. After a song mocking Hillary Clinton that was performed by journalists and Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump applauded vigorously.\n\nThe president\u2019s appearance at the Gridiron dinner suggests that he may also be planning to attend other events with the media that he has skipped since becoming president.\n\nEarly last year, as the president and his aides repeatedly attacked the White House press corps, Mr. Trump announced that he would not attend the White House Correspondents Association\u2019s annual dinner \u2014 the first time a president had skipped the event in decades.\n\nThe president has also not yet attended the Alfalfa Club dinner, an exclusive black-tie event that often extends an invitation to the president to attend. Club members are politicians, military leaders and business executives who gather each year for a banquet at the Capital Hilton in Washington.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump skipped the dinner in 2017, he became the first president to miss the party in his first year in office since 1993. Mr. Pence attended last year, along with Ms. Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, and Mr. Kushner, her husband.\n\nToward the end of his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Trump apologized that he had to be \u201cup early tomorrow morning\u201d to watch \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis might be the most fun,\u201d he added, \u201csince watching your faces on election night.\u201d", "title": "A Night of Laughs Between Trump and His Favorite Punching Bag", "authors": ["Michael D.

Fortunately, this novel does not have such a tree. Instead, the reader has to do what any guest visiting such a family for the first time must do: Be alert, be attentive, be appreciative. And there is much to appreciate in Urrea\u2019s highly entertaining story of Big Angel, the de La Cruz family\u2019s patriarch, who buries his mother even as he himself is dying and as his family gathers to celebrate his 70th, and last, birthday.\n\nDispelling the notion held by some Americans that all Mexicans have just crossed the border, Urrea creates a rambunctious de La Cruz family that lives in San Diego and \u201chas been around here since before your grandparents were even born.\u201d Urrea is intent on both celebrating the particularities of Mexican-American life and attacking the anti-Mexican racism that has been a part of American culture ever since the United States conquered quite a bit of Mexico. Well aware that Mexicans are perceived by many, including themselves, as having a flexible relationship with time \u2014 \u201cYou know you\u2019re a Mexican when lunch doesn\u2019t show up till 10 at night\u201d \u2014 Big Angel prides himself on his punctuality. \u201cAs if a Mexican couldn\u2019t be punctual,\u201d he says. \u201cAs if Vicente Fox was late to things, cabrones.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe quips and jokes come fast through a poignant novel that is very much about time itself, especially the passing of time and the inevitability of death. The narrative unfolds in a little over a week, from the funeral of Mam\u00e1 Am\u00e9rica to the passing of Big Angel. The last is hardly a secret, given how his name signals toward heaven. In addition, we know from early in the novel that he is dying of cancer and that his body\u2019s basic functions are nearly beyond him. His wife, Perla, and daughter, Minnie, must help him bathe and relieve himself. \u201cI used to be your father,\u201d Big Angel says to Minnie with a sob. \u201cNow I am your baby.\u201d From the threshold of death back to the beginning of life, Big Angel finds himself in a \u201ctime bubble\u201d and a \u201ctime storm,\u201d immersed in memories of his journey from Mexico to the United States and the complexities of his family drama.\n\nTechnically, Big Angel and Perla are undocumented immigrants, having crossed the border from south to north as teenagers. But Urrea takes care to show how Mexicans and Mexican-Americans \u2014 and Americans as a whole \u2014 are caught in the ever-changing politics and economics of border definitions and labor exploitation. Big Angel\u2019s \u201cgrandfather Don Segundo had come to California after the Mexican Revolution, crossing the border in Sonora.\u201d In the United States, he \u201clearned English and learned to love baseball\u201d during a time when Mexican labor was needed. When that time ended, however, \u201cthe de La Cruz family became Mexican again when they went back south in the great wave of deportations of 1932, joining two million mestizos rounded up and sent across the line in boxcars. The United States had apparently grown weary of hunting down and deporting Chinese people for the moment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBorder politics have been important to Urrea \u2014 a prolific author of fiction, poetry and nonfiction \u2014 since he began his career with 1993\u2019s \u201cAcross the Wire: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border.\u201d During the 10-year struggle to publish his first book, he was told by one New York editor that \u201cnobody cares about starving Mexicans.\u201d Big Angel, his mother and his siblings are among those starving Mexicans who ultimately ascend to the middle and working classes. Big Angel is able to rent and then buy his home in a neighborhood where \u201call the houses had bars on the windows, which scared outsiders but which nobody from there even saw.\u201d Big Angel\u2019s achievement of the (Mexican) American dream is made possible by working multiple jobs \u2014 contrary to the stereotype of lazy Mexicans that irritates him so much \u2014 until he finally lands a position running computers for the gas and electric company, even though \u201che didn\u2019t even like computers.

His hands were clawed with arthritis and spotted, misshapen nails with dirt under them that could not be scrubbed away. He was a man you would not notice, or if you did, not wish to touch as he shuffled behind the cart. He wore a cap that read in proud gold stitching, \u201cVietnam Veteran U.S.N.\u201d\n\nIt should be said that seeing Vietnam veterans is not unusual in Vermont or any other state, but the generation is declining in number and strength. About 400 die a day of the 2.7 million who served. It was a long time ago, and newer conflicts have taken the stage and headlines. Heroes and graves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe veterans of Vietnam are opaque coming to transparent, like onion paper held to light. Soon they will be crippled relics in homes and memories, photos on a dusty mantel or side table with a yellowed doily. You have passed them unseen a hundred times. You never knew their stories, because they are mostly private and you did not want to ask or know. Beyond the cap or the coat with the same words, they do not share. They wear these things for themselves and to say, I am here, and I was there.\n\nWe stood by the counter waiting for our slices of pastrami and teriyaki chicken. The old man carried in his cart milk, ground coffee, a few cans of stew and soups. I could see that most of the food was ready to eat, or add water and stir. He likely lived by himself, wife dead or gone.\n\nDuring the pause of commerce I asked him where he had served. He responded by telling me simply that he had been in Danang on helicopters, and on a warship off the coast. It was vague and intentional. When he said he had piloted a chopper, I thought most likely a Huey with that iconic whooping sound of the blades biting the air and announcing its flight path, a sound that you know for life and run for the tree line when you hear. He might have flown something larger, a workhorse Chinook, used to carry anything that would fit or be hung, from troops to supplies, small artillery. It went where it was needed; you did what was required.\n\nBetween the cutting of the meats and the wrapping of the cheese, each of us looked at the other. Maybe I had fewer scars in the open. Maybe I had more hair, a down winter coat and better boots, gloves, a wool scarf. It looked as if he had had a hard time after the war. The Kingdom offered a hard life, but easier than what he had done. His boots had uneven soles. His gait was off. He had probably been wounded.\n\nI did not want to ask. Fate had treated me more kindly. But as we used to say, no one gets out of here alive. It could have been my imagination, but our eyes reflected back into ourselves. We were doubled. He did not smile.\n\nHe asked if I had been there. He asked because I had spoken first. He could not tell if I was a flatlander, from out of state, just curious or a fool. He wanted to know if he had to explain that place and the cap. His eyes saw the answer before I spoke. He asked if I knew Danang, Nha Trang, Dong Ha, the Highlands and the Delta. How many words did I use to reply? I said two or three, meaning years or tours. How many words do you need for the rainy season, fighting, the heat, humidity and the smell, fear?\n\nI said yes, remembering the firefights over the hills and low mountains at dusk, surrounding the bay at Danang, the jets coming in and dropping bombs and tumbling napalm. Heard the artillery, a different sound and cadence for every caliber. Beautiful parts in a violent orchestra, with strings, wind instruments and drums.\n\nI watched the earth explode and burn, green to black and dead. A Broadway show sitting on a folding aluminum chair for the afternoon matinee performance with a beer. He chuckled with his eyes, told me about rocket-propelled grenade attacks on the airport, running for cover, strafing runs on the riverbeds and trails, dancing to the music, killing men in the open. He told me about friends on the wall, the memorial we thought was going to be singular, unique, though we learned that was a lie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI told him about flying supplies into fire bases, coming in hot, breaking hard, slowing and throwing off ammunition and water, grabbing the wounded, engines whining to full power and the aircraft shuddering, lifting off short and hoping that the enemy we hardly knew did not have the range or luck. Dust choking, blinding. Laughing as we gained altitude, at the odds beaten, and hoping to go back for another run. Until next time. Every time we did this, the bets went back to even, the clock unwound.\n\nOur purchases were put on the glass counter top. He took his, tipped his head and cap and headed off, nothing else. I glanced as he turned, said, \u201cSo long,\u201d watched him walk to the cash register, pay with bills, and out of the store, leaving his cart at the door. He limped and did not look back. If he had said other than an acknowledgment with his nod, it would have been more than he wanted to say and more than I needed to hear.\n\nWhat was it, two, three minutes of history? Meeting, touching and knowing that there had been a past and that the present was tinged with the gone before. Walking on. Shared survival and the pleasure of release with the conjugation of years. Nothing to be spoken or shared with clerks, cashiers or office workers. A diminishing private world with signals and symbols.\n\nTwo men, strangers, known from and for a thousand years in kind, history buried, burned into the circuits of the brain and whatever passes for the soul. Pushed far back and down, down deep as it is possible to go. For a second, I thought I saw a young man, looking out the door of an aircraft at the jungle and rising flashes of light, soaring, swooping and rocking, smiling, wind in his hair, wind so strong that it made the eyes water and distorted his cheeks.\n\nWhat he saw was something else. Maybe nothing.\n\nWe had validated ourselves at the meat counter in a small rural town under a winter sky. For a day I thought about the man that I would never meet again, except in myself. A man said that in our youths our hearts were touched by fire, and fire is cleansing. I am not sure. Fire leaves ash and scar.

When their friend, the music executive Danny Fields, found out, he gifted Bond with Sedgwick\u2019s leopard-skin pillbox hat. Through the hat, which purportedly inspired Bob Dylan\u2019s song \u201cLeopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,\u201d Bond explains how their fascination with the actress and model has evolved.\n\nI first met Danny Fields when he came to a \u201cKiki and Herb\u201d show at Flamingo East in the \u201990s. Danny was an A & R guy who had signed Iggy and the Stooges to Elektra in the \u201960s. In the \u201970s, he was the editor of 16 Magazine and went on to be the manager of the Ramones for a while.\n\nWe struck up a friendship, and at a certain point we discussed how I was obsessed with Edie Sedgwick. Danny had been quoted heavily in Jean Stein\u2019s book \u201cEdie: An American Biography.\u201d That book was so important to me. I grew up in a lower-middle class family in Hagerstown, Maryland and my job in 1982 \u2014 the summer between my freshman and sophomore years of college \u2014 was at the Waldenbooks at the Valley Mall. I unpacked books for the bookstore and I had unpacked this book. It was very beautiful. I was like, \u201cWho is this Edie person?\u201d I was just a kid in Maryland. I\u2019d heard about Andy Warhol and I\u2019d probably seen him on \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d but I didn\u2019t know much about that world. I bought the book and from then on I was obsessed with Edie Sedgwick.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn my sophomore year in college at Adelphi University the upperclassman had a Halloween party, and I decided to go as Edie Sedgwick. It was sort of my first coming out as queer, cross-dressing, if you will. I went to the party and pretended I was on acid and got all these people to get in the shower together. I took on the personality of a New York City party girl and I found out how well it worked.\n\nI wanted to be just like Edie. There was a romance in it, a sense of freedom. She sounds glamorous to a young person. But the way she died at age 28, after taking a bunch of downers, wasn\u2019t all that glamorous. It wasn\u2019t until years later, when I was in my 30s, that I was like, \u201cWell, if I was like Edie Sedgwick, I would be dead right now.\u201d\n\nBecause Danny knew about my love for Edie, he presented me with this leopard-skin pillbox hat that had belonged to her. They\u2019d been roommates when she first moved to New York. According to Danny, it\u2019s the hat that inspired Bob Dylan to write the song \u201cLeopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\u201d because Dylan dated Edie briefly. When Danny gave it to me, he basically said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t give it to you, it\u2019s probably going to be stolen by some hustler someday anyway, so it might as well end up with somebody who will love it and take care of it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never worn the hat. It\u2019s too small for my big head. So it\u2019s usually on display in my living room, whether in my loft in the East Village, my house upstate, or when I did my degree show in London, hanging on a wall hook or in a bookcase.

But when Dana went downstairs to check on Ruth in the morning, her sheets were soaked with sweat and she wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\nIn the horror that followed, we called 911, but it was too late. Ruth was gone. Her neurologist believed that she had kernicterus, a condition that could have been what caused both her cerebral palsy and her deafness.

I\u2019d grown up on a farm \u2014 running barefoot through the sheep pasture, riding my fat brown pony around the pond. I longed to plant a garden, something to nurture that would nurture me. But, living in Bath, one of Maine\u2019s most densely populated neighborhoods, our house was pinched between a busy road and a forested backyard.\n\nWhy not volunteer at a local farm, a friend suggested. On a slip of paper, she wrote the name of one where she bought vegetables, and I\u2019d set up this time to stop by.\n\nThe farmer spotted us across a frozen field and tromped over, springy brown hair twisting around her face. \u201cI\u2019m Lucretia,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re interested in working?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Chasing a piglet that had escaped under the fence, Lydia and Asher were laughing. But I knew they were hurting too. Especially Lydia, who had been just three weeks older than Ruth. Lucretia invited me to come back in April. For two hours of work each week \u2014 plus a contribution to help with planting \u2014 I\u2019d receive a weekly box of organic vegetables from June through October.\n\nI promised to think about it but wasn\u2019t sure I had the energy. Of all the friends who\u2019d shared advice after Ruth died, not one had warned how exhausting grief could be. Some days, leaving the house was too much. But two weeks later, there I was, standing with Lucretia inside a plastic-covered hoop house at Milkweed Farm.\n\nWind snapped the flimsy walls and blew frozen mist across the fields outside, but inside was warm. Concrete-block-and-wire tables held trays of soil cubes \u2014 each indented with a small dimple. Lucretia cut an envelope to form a spout and sprinkled round, pebble-like eggplant seeds into them. Using the tip of a pencil, she nudged each seed into a hole and covered it with a pinch of soil.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWant to try?\u201d She handed me the envelope.\n\nFor the rest of the morning, all I had to think about was placing one seed into each hole. Two hours later, I felt more at peace than I had in months. The following week I planted meager dots of tomato seeds. Then, even tinier specks of onions. Soon, a miniature forest sprouted from the eggplant trays, tender leaves uncurling toward the light.\n\nAs the temperature rose, the earth came alive, and I worked in the fields while Lydia and Asher raced up the rows, searching for eggs from the few chickens who\u2019d escaped their enclosure to scamper about the garden. By midsummer, the farm had blossomed into a profusion of stalky pink echinacea flowers, sunshiny-yellow calendula buds, beds of ripening strawberries, fragrant mounds of chamomile and an intoxicating blanket of holy basil.\n\nEach week I carried home boxes of sun-ripened tomatoes, Swiss chard, turnips, cabbage, cucumbers, zucchini and flowers. But more than that, I carried home a renewed sense that even when the all the world appears bleak and lifeless, a flourishing future was still possible. I simply had to plant the seeds I\u2019d been given, to feed and water and shelter them, while waiting to discover what new life emerged.\n\nAt first, I\u2019d been fragile, wanting only to curl up and protect myself from any more pain or loss. But as I looked at the rows of vegetables and vines bursting with life around me, I knew the answer to grief was not in locking myself away but in opening myself to whatever came next. If a tiny seed could grow strong by reaching toward the light, maybe I could too.\n\nOne hot morning, Lucretia and I knelt in the garden together. Bees and butterflies flitted between the sunflowers. A stray chicken bobbed down the row as we pulled tough stalks of lamb\u2019s quarters, and I talked about Ruth \u2014 not just the loss of her but the joy of her too. How clever she was. And funny. And how incredibly much we loved her. Lucretia nodded, telling me about a friend who also had a child with disabilities. As she talked, I realized that the boy had gone to preschool with Ruth. Warmth at the memory softened my heart like the sun-warmed soil falling through my fingers.\n\nA burst of laughter made me turn. Lydia raced down a garden path, hand extended. In her outstretched fingers, she cupped the fragile brown shell of an egg. Asher tottered after her, golden light warming his cheeks. And I knew that although I would always carry the grief of losing Ruth, a life full of goodness lay ahead if only I would embrace it.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "For years, geriatricians and researchers have sounded the alarm about the use of benzodiazepines among older adults. Often called \u201cbenzos,\u201d the problem drugs include Valium (diazepam), Klonopin (clonazepam), Xanax (alprazolam) and Ativan (lorazepam).\n\nThe cautions have had scant effect: Use of the drugs has risen among older people, even though they are particularly vulnerable to the drugs\u2019 ill effects. Like Ms. Falstein, many patients take them for years, though they\u2019re recommended only for short periods. The chemically related \u201cz-drugs\u201d \u2014 Ambien, Sonata and Lunesta \u2014 present similar risks.\n\nNow the opioid epidemic has generated fresh warnings, because pain relievers like Vicodin (hydrocodone with Tylenol) and OxyContin (oxycodone) are also frequently prescribed for older people. When patients take both, they\u2019re at risk for overdosing.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhy are opioids dangerous? They stop you from breathing, and they have more power to do that when you\u2019re also taking a benzo,\u201d said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University researcher and co-author of a disturbing editorial about overuse and misuse of benzodiazepines last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNumbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tell the story: In 1999, it tallied just 63 benzodiazepine-related deaths among those aged 65 and older. Almost 29 percent also involved an opioid. By 2015, benzo deaths in that age group had jumped to 431, with more than two-thirds involving an opioid. (Benzo-related deaths in all age groups totaled 8,791.) In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black-box warning about co-prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids, including those in cough products.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven patients taking the drugs exactly as prescribed can unwittingly wind up in this situation, since both sleep problems and chronic pain occur more frequently at older ages. \u201cA psychiatrist puts a woman on Xanax,\u201d Dr. Humphreys said. \u201cThen she hurts her hip, so her primary care physician prescribes Vicodin.\u201d\n\nBut fatal overdoses \u2014 which are a comparatively tiny number given the size of the older population \u2014 represent just one of many longtime concerns about these medications.\n\n\u201cSet aside the opioid issue,\u201d said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist at the National Institutes for Health. \u201cWay too many older Americans are getting benzos. And of those, many \u2014 more than half \u2014 are getting them for prolonged periods. That\u2019s just bad practice. They have serious consequences.\u201d\n\nProbably the most serious: falls and fractures, already a common danger for older people, because benzos can cause dizziness. They\u2019re also associated with auto accidents, given that they cause drowsiness and fatigue.\n\nMoreover, \u201cthey have a negative effect on memory and other cognitive function,\u201d says Dr. Donovan Maust, a psychiatrist at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Health Care System. Some studies have shown an association with dementia, though experts call the evidence to date inconclusive.\n\nYet when Dr. Maust and his colleagues looked at a broad national sample of older adults, they found that the proportion of primary care and psychiatry visits that resulted in benzo prescriptions rose from 5.6 percent in 2003 to 2005 to 8.7 percent just seven years later \u2014 including 11.5 percent of visits by patients older than 85.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In your 60s, you get lightheaded\u201d from the same amount, because older bodies metabolize drugs differently. (Alcohol, by the way, is another substance you don\u2019t want to combine with benzodiazepines.)\n\nPersuading users that they should stop is only the first step, however. \u201cWeaning someone off these things when they\u2019ve become habituated is incredibly difficult,\u201d Dr. Schoenbaum said.\n\nSignificant declines in benzo use among older people in Ontario, Canada, in Australia and in the Veterans Affairs health care system in the United States show that it can be done, with more cautious prescribing and programs to help users become ex-users.\n\nBut it\u2019s not easy.\n\n\u201cYou never, ever recommend that someone stop cold turkey,\u201d Dr. Maust said. That can bring withdrawal symptoms that include nausea, chills, anxiety, even delirium. \u201cYou taper down very gradually.\u201d\n\nCanadian researchers have demonstrated that some older users can taper off with an informational booklet and a 21-week tapering protocol, an approach the Veterans Affairs has begun using. Most patients should expect to spend six to 12 months detoxing, Dr. Maust said.\n\nBut some find it takes much longer, with rebound effects unlike those of other habituating drugs.\n\nWhen Ms. Falstein began experiencing \u201cjelly legs\u201d that left her too weak to stand for long, increased panic attacks, extreme fatigue and other health problems, she and her psychopharmacologist agreed that she should begin tapering off her benzos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d be off them in a year, maybe two,\u201d Ms. Falstein said.

There is no perfect political candidate. Voting is choosing the lesser of evils. Yes, there is gender inequality. And yes, there is a race problem in the country, though racism, implying hate, is not the right word. Pastor Morris said it was a subtler problem of prejudice.\n\nThen he focused attention on the upcoming presidential race.\n\n\u201cThe election,\u201d he said, \u201cis extremely important.\u201d\n\nThe country is in trouble financially; a critical Supreme Court appointment awaits; one of the major parties advocates using \u201ctaxpayer dollars, your dollars,\u201d for abortion.

But the implication in the sermon, and in the leaflets that were handed out at church, was lost on no one: that one must vote to uphold Christian values, and that the Republican Party platform reflected those values. And Mr. Trump was the Republican candidate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Pruitt sent messages to several white couples she had befriended at the church, telling them she was going to take some time off.

Sitting in the living room over a plate of brownies, Ms. Pruitt explained to the wife how disturbed she had been by the clear inference from the pulpit that she should support a candidate whose behavior and rhetoric were so offensive that she could not bring herself even to say his name.\n\nThe woman explained that a Trump victory had been prophesied and handed Ms. Pruitt a two-page printout, which began: \u201cThe Spirit of God says, \u2018I have chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this.\u2019\u201d Barack Obama, the woman continued, should never have been president, since he was not born a United States citizen. The visit ended with the woman suggesting that Ms. Pruitt\u2019s discomfort at the church was God telling her it was time to move on.\n\nMs. Pruitt never went back.\n\nJeremiah\u2019s family also left for good that summer, though he has heard that pictures of them still show up in church videos. They have not found a church since.\n\nOne young black woman who had been going to Gateway for some years said she has begun exploring Ethiopian Christian traditions. Another woman, a former church staff member who still goes to Gateway, cut back her attendance from five days a week to once a month, if that, and is now praying for guidance on whether to leave altogether.\n\nCarla McKissic Smith stayed until one Sunday in March 2017, when a guest speaker, a messianic rabbi from New Jersey, spoke of the 2016 election from the pulpit, saying that it \u201cthreatened to seal the acceleration of America\u2019s apostasy,\u201d but that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was the fulfillment of God\u2019s covenant with Israel. \u201cIt was not the Russian intervention that determined it,\u201d he said to a congregation that frequently broke into applause and cheers. \u201cThe intervention was a bit higher.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Ms. Smith\u2019s father, the Rev. Dwight McKissic of Cornerstone Baptist Church in Dallas, would introduce a resolution condemning the alt-right at the annual Southern Baptist Convention in Phoenix. Unlike the resolutions condemning gambling and Planned Parenthood, his alt-right resolution didn\u2019t make it out of committee.\n\nPastor McKissic was told that racism had already been adequately addressed by the Southern Baptists, that the resolution was inflammatory and that sympathy for the alt-right was not an issue in the church. Word leaked, embarrassing the convention, and a new version of the resolution was reintroduced and overwhelmingly passed, albeit with some language changed and with an added tally of the Southern Baptists\u2019 past efforts against racism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt that point,\u201d Ms. Smith said, \u201cI was no longer surprised.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s win, which one elder at Gateway described as a \u201csupernatural answer to prayer,\u201d generated a frisson of excitement at the church. Pastor Morris told the congregation that he was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s faith advisers. The church was a sponsor of an inaugural ball in January 2017.\n\nJelani Lewis, one of the two black campus pastors, knew this was creating unease among many black members of Gateway. A black deacon approached him at one point and asked how he should reconcile his trust in Pastor Morris with \u201csome of the things that I\u2019m seeing from the current president.\u201d We trust in God, Pastor Lewis assured him, and we can trust in the heart of our pastor.\n\n\u2018A Lack of Understanding\u2019\n\nAs a tumultuous 2017 unfolded, Pastor Morris understood that some wanted him to address race directly.\n\n\u201cAs I prayed about it as I talked with black pastor friends of mine, I realized I don\u2019t really understand the depth of the pain they feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is personal to them \u2014 it was history to me. I would talk to my friend and it was personal to him because it was his great-grandfather.\u201d\n\nIn October 2017, he preached a message entitled \u201cA Lack of Understanding.\u201d Addressing \u201call the ignorant white people,\u201d and acknowledging his own past grappling with prejudice, the pastor listed reasons that racism was evil \u2014 among them that it was an affront to God\u2019s creation, given that Adam and Eve were probably brown-skinned. A video played of a black pastor talking of the racism he experienced as a child in East St. Louis in the 1960s.

That\u2019s not how it works.\n\nIn fact, even if we could eliminate U.S. trade deficits with tariffs, there would be lots of unpleasant side effects: sharply higher interest rates wreaking havoc on real estate and those with large debts (hello, Jared), and a sharply higher dollar inflicting severe harm on exporters, like many of America\u2019s farmers. And a full-scale trade war would disrupt international supply chains, displacing huge numbers of workers: The U.S. government\u2019s own estimates say that exports to the European Union, Canada and Mexico support 2.6 million, 1.6 million and 1.2 million American jobs respectively.\n\nWill Trump actually follow through on his ranting? Nobody knows.

But whether or not the trade war actually happens, Trump\u2019s display of belligerent ignorance ought to worry us a lot.\n\nFor one thing, talking tough and stupid on trade in itself damages U.S. credibility: If we go around threatening our most important allies with retaliation against policies they don\u2019t even have, how can we expect them to trust us \u2014 or support us \u2014 on anything else?\n\nBeyond that, is there any reason to believe that Trump\u2019s belligerent ignorance stops with trade? Actually, we know that he\u2019s just as bombastic and clueless (with added racism) when it comes to crime, and there\u2019s no reason to believe that he\u2019s any better on real national security issues.\n\nListening to a garrulous old guy spout nonsense is annoying in the best of circumstances.

It is concerned that the Russians \u2014 along with the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans \u2014 could easily retaliate against any attack, striking American banks, utilities, stock markets and communications networks.\n\nAnd in the nuclear sphere, the Trump administration has yet to offer a strategy to contain or deter Russia beyond simply matching the weapons buildup. Mr. Trump himself has largely remained silent about his vision to contain Russian power, and has not expressed hope of luring Moscow into new rounds of negotiations to prevent a recurrent arms race.\n\nThe threat that Russia poses on both fronts has helped push the United States to declare a fundamental shift on national security: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asserted in January that \u201cgreat power competition,\u201d not terrorism, is now the primary American focus.\n\nWashington\u2019s response \u2014 at least in the nuclear realm \u2014 also harks back to the Cold War era: a cycle of move and countermove. This time, however, it involves not just building larger stockpiles, but also developing new types of weapons of greater sophistication, matched with more advanced missile defenses.\n\n\u201cPutin has become the best friend of the U.S. nuclear arms industry,\u201d said nonproliferation expert Gary Samore. He negotiated with the Russians during the Clinton administration, when optimism ran high that the era of nuclear competition was over, and again during the Obama administration, after Mr. Putin had begun Moscow\u2019s current nuclear modernization.\n\nThe Pentagon believes that many of the new plans that Mr. Putin announced last week to bolster his arsenal \u2014 including undersea nuclear torpedoes, nuclear cruise missiles and other new weapons \u2014 are years away from deployment. He has called his new missiles \u201cinvincible,\u201d as some can evade missile defenses, and started a contest to name them.\n\nMr. Putin has blamed the United States\u2019 failure to embrace past arms control treaties as the reason for his buildup. But he has particularly complained about American nuclear defenses, which he said were aimed as much at Russia as they were at North Korea. American officials have said that is a wild misstatement of the technology\u2019s reach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump demanded that Congress \u201cmodernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal.\u201d That was followed in February by the administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review, which was more specific. It called for new, low-yield nuclear weapons that it justified on the basis of recent Russian advances. It also described in detail a once top-secret Russian autonomous nuclear torpedo that is designed to cross the Pacific.\n\nAdditionally, the nuclear review abandoned earlier promises by the Obama administration that nuclear weapons would be a diminishing part of American security and defense. \u201cPast assumptions that our capability to produce nuclear weapons would not be necessary and that we could permit the required infrastructure to age into obsolescence have proven to be mistaken,\u201d the document said.\n\nPhoto\n\nDrafts of a new missile defense strategy, which may be published later this month, include suggestions that the program may now turn to developing missile defenses against Russia and China, not just countering states like North Korea with smaller arsenals.\n\n\u201cWe must no longer think in terms of building just \u2018limited\u2019 missile defense capabilities,\u201d concluded a report that was issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe United States should begin the journey to develop a next-generation missile defense.\u201d\n\nIt called for pursuing a \u201cspace-based kill layer\u201d that would try to shoot down swarms of enemy warheads and missiles \u2014 a step that would go beyond the Reagan administration\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d research on space arms and no doubt prompt new rounds of reaction from Mr. Putin and the Russian military.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Kennedy\u2019s time in office through President Barack Obama\u2019s, new treaties were negotiated that first limited atmospheric testing, then the numbers of weapons that could be deployed. The result was an 85 percent decline in the number of nuclear weapons in the world.\n\nBut the most recent arms reduction treaty, called New Start, expires in early 2021. Mr. Trump has not expressed interest in renewing it. And there is evidence that even before its scheduled sunset, expensive new cycles of technological action and reaction are beginning to take shape.\n\nOver the past few months, most talk of restraint has been cast to the wind as Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump take steps to rebuild their arsenals, according to arms control advocates. Doing so portends a new generation of nuclear weapons, as such moves and countermoves create a rationale for building more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass., said Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement last week \u201cfurther ratchets up what is clearly a new arms race, making the world a more dangerous place.\u201d\n\nBut what worries veterans of that Cold War is less the new technology than the old rhetoric.\n\n\u201cNone of this changes the fundamental picture of what the U.S. and Russia do to each other,\u201d Matthew Bunn, a Harvard professor who is one of the directors of the Managing the Atom project, told a group of journalists at the Nieman Foundation in Cambridge on Friday.\n\nHe said what is changing \u201cis the degree of tension\u201d that revives the dangers of miscalculations that could lead to military action \u2014 the great fear at the height of the Cold War during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe cyberchallenge is the newest one, and thus is not captive to the strategies of past generations. But in public statements in recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s top intelligence officials have conceded that the president has yet to discuss strategies with them to prevent the Russians from interfering in the midterm elections this year. Mr. Trump has expressed severe doubts that the Russians meddled in 2016, contradicting the conclusions of his intelligence officials.\n\nTwo days before General Nakasone\u2019s hearing last week, the man he would replace at the N.S.A. and Cyber Command \u2014 Adm. Michael S. Rogers \u2014 offered striking testimony in what is likely to be his last public appearance on Capitol Hill before leaving office.\n\nFour years ago, after he took command, Admiral Rogers said one of his goals was to assure that American adversaries would \u201cpay a price\u201d for their cyberactions against the United States that \u201cwill far outweigh the benefit\u201d derived from hacking. He also frequently said that the retaliation might not necessarily be a counter-cyberstrike, but could involve economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation.\n\nHowever, last week Admiral Rogers conceded that his own test had not been met.\n\nPressed about what pressure he had put on the Russians, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps, but we\u2019re probably not doing enough.\u201d He also dismissed sanctions that Congress approved last year \u2014 and that Mr. Trump has failed to impose \u2014 as insufficient to change \u201cthe calculus or the behavior\u201d of Mr. Putin.\n\nAt General Nakasone\u2019s confirmation hearing two days later, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said that \u201cthe problem is not technical,\u201d but political, given the United States\u2019 impressive cyberarsenal.\n\n\u201cWe are not responding in any way that\u2019s adequate to the challenge we face,\u201d Mr. Sasse said.", "title": "A Russian Threat on Two Fronts Meets an American Strategic Void", "authors": ["David E.

I bought myself canvas pastry bags marked \u201cMade in France\u201d and outfitted them with a wardrobe of accessories. Each week, I would take my place in front of a ruled board, just as I had when I was learning cursive, and spend two hours squeezing Crisco (cheaper and more forgiving than frosting) into shapes that always fell short of botanical verisimilitude.\n\nEventually I developed a repertoire of pansies, ruffled leaves, shells, swags and roses, never perfect, but nonetheless a source of pride. An ambitious student, I also set myself the task of learning to construct the most complicated desserts in the French canon. I worked my way through the Parisian chef Gaston Len\u00f4tre\u2019s first English-language cookbook, and on any old Tuesday night, I\u2019d serve a g\u00e2teau St. Honor\u00e9 \u2014 puff pastry, cream puffs, two kinds of pastry cream and caramel, some spun.

I was creating beautiful desserts, but the more elaborate they were, the less I enjoyed eating them.\n\nMy tastes were changing.

Like a minimalist architect, I began removing the superfluous and judging what I constructed on its bedrock elements. I always knew that dessert\u2019s only purpose was pleasure.

And the line cannot form until the Education Department explains how it will administer the fix-it fund. It is supposed to do so by late May, though federal agencies do miss such deadlines sometimes.\n\nAnd what if you\u2019re in Mr. Shafer\u2019s shoes, where you\u2019re short of 120 payments when you suddenly figure out that you are not in the right loan or repayment plan, even though you were adamant about your desire to qualify for the forgiveness program?

Complain to the ombudsman at the Department of Education, especially if, like him, you dealt with a particularly problematic servicer called ACS several years ago.\n\nAlso, contact your representative in the House and your two senators and ask to speak with someone in constituent services. Many of the people in those jobs are young and in debt themselves and have contacts with the Department of Education that can be useful. The Senate staff members I spoke to this week echoed this; louder volume can yield more action or at least inject a greater sense of urgency.\n\nAs for Mr. Shafer, he\u2019s just beginning to allow himself to imagine what he will do with the extra money once his loan payments end in 2020. \u201cWhat would anyone do in their hometown if they had an extra $500 a month?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d buy furniture in local stores, hire local contractors, buy cars in local car lots.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed some trepidation. In the last two weeks, his loan servicer has sent him inaccurate information about his current payment and about his overall number of payments toward forgiveness. That has him imagining himself back on the negative side of the forgiveness equation. \u201cI would like to be an example of what fighting back can do, and I would not like to be an example of what fighting back can do,\u201d he said, chuckling.\n\nMs. Warren said she was disappointed with the fact that a more permanent or expansive fix for this problem was not politically possible this time around, and vowed to keep watch.\n\n\u201cI certainly intend to keep an eye on Secretary DeVos,\u201d she said, referring to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. \u201cThe fight isn\u2019t over until every single nurse, teacher, police officer and firefighter gets the student loan forgiveness that they earned.\u201d", "title": "A Student Loan Fix for a Teacher, and Many Other Public Servants", "authors": []}

Bandol, especially with some aging, would be delicious, as would a richer Burgundy, like a Nuits-St.-Georges, or a pinot noir. From Italy, a Chianti or other Tuscan sangiovese-based wine would go well, as would an aglianico from Campania or Basilicata.

One key is for countries to retaliate carefully against what they consider to be unfair practices, targeting politically sensitive industries in the country with which they are clashing. It is a safe bet that negotiators in the United States, China and elsewhere are well aware of this.\n\nThe implication of this view is not that an all-out trade war is impossible, just that some of the loose talk about the idea in the last week \u2014 including by the president \u2014 is getting far ahead of the facts.\n\nJoe Brusuelas, the chief economist at the accounting firm RSM, sketched out what a true trade war would look like.\n\n\u201cThe first indicator that a trade war has begun would be the announced intention to withdraw from, or abrogate, current trade treaty arrangements,\u201d Mr. Brusuelas wrote recently.\n\nHe contrasts that with \u201ctrade spats,\u201d which take place continually, and tariff actions that are rarer but have been used many times without setting off a major economic dislocation. A recent example was the Obama administration\u2019s 2009 tariff on Chinese tires, which did coincide with a rebound in domestic tire production (though it was costly relative to the number of jobs created).\n\nIf the United States ignored rulings of the World Trade Organization, or pulled out of Nafta, it could trigger a series of steps including not just tariffs but other restrictions on international commerce, and perhaps limits on the flow of capital across borders and even the expropriation of foreign-owned assets.

Paper, $16.\n\nTHE LAND BETWEEN TWO RIVERS\n\nWriting in an Age of Refugees\n\nBy Tom Sleigh\n\n255 pp. Graywolf Press. Paper, $16.\n\nIn \u201cBarbarian in the Garden,\u201d the poet Zbigniew Herbert\u2019s collection of essays published in the 1980s, Herbert, fresh out of Cold War Poland, travels around Europe, meditating on food, art and the relationship of culture to torture or violence. He\u2019ll savor Orvieto wine or truffles on village patios before delving into the historic burning of a medieval sect known as the Cathars or the slaughter of bulls commemorated at Lascaux. As Herbert travels across Europe, his essays move in constellation, asking: How do moments of deep human culture relate to moments of deep human violence? How does the history of art relate to the history of torture? These are complex questions. No one would expect a poet to answer straightforwardly. In a world that would like simple answers, Herbert evades simplicity.\n\nThe ingredients of Herbert\u2019s essays rose up for me again as I read Tom Sleigh\u2019s linked and intertwined new books \u2014 one of memoir and reportage (\u201cThe Land Between Two Rivers\u201d), and one of poems (\u201cHouse of Fact, House of Ruin\u201d). Like Herbert, Sleigh is a deliberate traveler in the troubled world. Rather than unearth the deep cruelties of European history, Sleigh leaves the confusions of 21st-century America to visit some of the world\u2019s hot zones: Kurdistan, Mogadishu, rural Lebanon, Nairobi. Sometimes he\u2019s conducting poetry workshops; sometimes he\u2019s dealing with cultural attach\u00e9s or smooth-tongued diplomats; sometimes he\u2019s face to face with refugees in camps. At all times his mission is also to be present with his own body, with others, and with the notebook whose contents he will eventually weave into essays and poems that feed one another, sometimes cannibalizing one another line for line, joke for joke.\n\nIn Herbert\u2019s title, there was a sly pun: Herbert, the Pole, was the barbarian; Europe was the garden. Sleigh\u2019s garden is Qana; the Lebanese town where Jesus is said to have turned water into wine, now the site of two particularly devastating Israeli bombings; and also Baghdad, in the Tigris-Euphrates valley, cradle of civilization, now the violence-ridden capital of Iraq. In writing from parts of the world that are all too often refracted in what Sleigh calls \u201ccrisis chatter\u201d or \u201cdisaster porn,\u201d he wants to investigate what it means to be present among others who are more often than not perched on some precarious verge. Yet as Sleigh makes clear, he\u2019s also uncomfortable with what might be called \u201cthe poetry of witness\u201d or with any overweening formulation of \u201cspeaking for the voiceless.\u201d When called upon to explain what he\u2019s trying to do, Sleigh, who has spent much of his adult life too sick to travel in this way, or to practice the craft of journalism he so admires, talks about wanting to learn from the \u201cnegative capability\u201d of journalism. By this he means getting close enough to a complex thing to suspend any agenda except for detail, observation, texture, note-taking. Obviously, Sleigh cannot help having a vantage, a prejudice, a body, but he also wants to follow both his watching mind and his language where they lead.\n\nLike Herbert, Sleigh often explores the hair-trigger balance between culture and chaos. Like Herbert, who began an essay on human brutality by savoring truffles, Sleigh often lingers over food as the base form of pleasure and culture by which we create and sustain human peace. Sleigh revels in the moment in Jordan when a skilled Syrian refugee finds a new life as the baker of a honeyed bird\u2019s-nest pastry called kenafeh. He\u2019s drawn to the moment when a formerly listless child in Mogadishu perks up and begins \u201cplaying with the shiny wrapper of a nutritional biscuit he\u2019d just eaten\u201d and the moment in the relative calm of Kurdistan when he and a friend \u201cstood in line with everyone else helping themselves to the abundance of local cheeses, baklava and other honeyed pastries.\u201d In Sleigh\u2019s hands these moments of ongoingness mix something of the daily with something of the miraculous. As he points out, \u201cpeople \u2014 even people threatened by drought and starvation \u2014 have to get on with their lives.\u201d Yet he also notes when they can\u2019t, as at a field outside Qana where oranges cannot be harvested because the ground is still seeded with bombs. In a poem called \u201cBefore Rain\u201d (which might as easily have been called \u201cAfter Ruin\u201d), Sleigh writes: \u201cTrees grow up where there once were people, weeds / take over beds of lettuces and coddled flowers, / uprearing mole hills unpopulate the fields.\u201d As he observes in the next line, \u201cthe bricked-in hours of the human have all been knocked down.\u201d Sleigh is after the enormously fragile ways that even in the face of war or famine people do get on, even while at any moment survival, that most fragile of luxuries, might just as easily end.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs a poet-journalist traveling through war zones, Sleigh also has a distinct precursor in Walt Whitman, who in traveling to Civil War hospitals and battlefields filled his notebooks with dispatches that would later become the essayistic poems \u201cDrum Taps\u201d as well as the impressionistic essays in \u201cSpecimen Days.\u201d In his poetry and his prose, Whitman was exploring novel forms of writing in a new democracy \u2014 a language of access, of one body witnessing another in shared space. Like Whitman, Sleigh here plays with what the observer\u2019s notebook can become. He embeds lines of poetry in journalistic essays like a rogue reporter; conversely, he\u2019ll forge a sonnet or rhymed tercets out of reported language, as he does in poems that incorporate the testimony of Tony Lagouranis, who witnessed the torture at Abu Ghraib. Sleigh doffs his hat to Whitman expliciitly, noting in one poem that he\u2019s practicing \u201cwith Whitman a raw / form of brinksmanship.\u201d\n\nIf Sleigh\u2019s brinksmanship is about drawing near to lives at the verge, it is also about trying to record the narratives by which lives come to have meaning, and finding the language in which we come to understand what Sleigh calls \u201cthe soul\u2019s vulnerable republic.\u201d Sleigh\u2019s cross-pollinating forms remind us that language, too, is always being deployed to some purpose. In the face of propaganda, political backlash and crisis chatter, which stories allow us to become human to one another? Just outside Qana, Sleigh listens to a man named Joseph, who was asked to recover the shattered bodies of small children after the most recent bombings. At that moment, they see in the rubble the \u201cgleaming, flesh-colored, plastic thigh and leg of a baby doll.\u201d The image is chilling.\n\nPhoto\n\nLater, meditating on this experience, Sleigh mulls the words of Robert Frost, who said that politics is \u201can extravagance about grievances, and poetry is an extravagance about grief.\u201d In Frost\u2019s formulation, the divisions at first seem clean. The politics of grievance face outward, acting publicly, while poetry turns inward to attend to our private landscapes of sorrow. Yet look more closely, and things become murky. To which realm do Joseph\u2019s memories of the shattered bodies of the lost girls and the still-present doll belong? To what realm do they belong when Sleigh tells us Joseph\u2019s story?\n\nMost of us live and breathe between the scales of so-called political and so-called private life; the languages we speak shift depending on circumstances. Late in his essay collection, after Sleigh has recounted his travels, he shifts registers. He describes some of the sources of his own grief \u2014 about his parents, who felt coerced into uncomfortable business dealings in the segregated South, and especially his mother, whose electroshock treatments left her uneasily adrift from the self she\u2019d been before. He describes his own illness. How might these things forge a politics, a poetics, an imagination? Sleigh has made a project of trying to write about other lives under pressure, at the brink. He\u2019s also watching himself watching, wondering how to read the longings and sorrows that urge him, the watcher, on.", "title": "A Traveler to Troubled Lands, Called to Bear Witness", "authors": ["Tess Taylor"]}

Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, where international corporate chieftains and investors had gathered, Mr. Mnuchin reassured the world that \u201cwe\u2019re not looking to get into trade wars.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFive weeks later, after announcing the stiff new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, Mr. Trump sounded like someone eagerly looking to do exactly that. \u201cTrade wars are good,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Friday, \u201cand easy to win.\u201d\n\nThe tariff announcement came before his staff had even come up with a written policy and only then in answer to a reporter\u2019s question. Republicans, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were exasperated and even distraught. The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, called it \u201cthe biggest policy blunder of his presidency.\u201d\n\nDaniel Price, a former international economics adviser to President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump was \u201cquixotically picking fights\u201d with allies. \u201cThe president\u2019s positions on trade and global engagement place him at right angles with core Republican views, U.S. business and agricultural interests and indeed the traditional Western alliance,\u201d Mr. Price said.\n\nRepublican leaders are more upset about the president\u2019s apostasy on trade than gun control because he has the authority to impose tariffs on his own, and they assume Congress will never impose significant limits on gun rights.\n\nBut the party leaders on Capitol Hill assumed that Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum was not really his final position, and that he could still be steered off his current course before actually signing an order next week. Even White House officials imagined that could happen.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, seemed to acknowledge the possibility when asked by reporters on Friday about the president\u2019s commitment to following through. \u201cNever say never, but I think he\u2019s pretty committed to moving this forward,\u201d she said. Asked specifically about the rates Mr. Trump threw out, she said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect those to change, but some of the other details need to be finalized.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Mr. Trump\u2019s support for gun control measures, like raising the minimum age for purchases of semiautomatic rifles, seemed fluid. During his session with lawmakers from both parties, the president seemed intent on defying the N.R.A. and fashioning a bipartisan bill with Democrats. Since then, however, he and his staff have been more equivocal, much like he was after a similar televised meeting with lawmakers on immigration that seemed to open the door to a compromise only to lead to more partisan crossfire.\n\n\u201cConceptually, he still supports raising the age to 21,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cBut he also knows there\u2019s not a lot of broad support for that. But that\u2019s something he would support.\u201d\n\nAnd even as she downgraded his support to \u201cconceptual,\u201d she seemed ready to pass off responsibility for enacting it outside Washington. \u201cI think he thinks it would probably have more potential in the states than it would at the federal level,\u201d she said.", "title": "A Week of Policy Surprises Leaves Even Trump\u2019s Supporters Confused", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "In just a few years, what began as a lineup of monochromatic streetwear pieces (emblazoned with the brand\u2019s signature striping) has evolved into full men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections (which launched in 2015), totaling eight collections per year. This season\u2019s inspiration, he explained while scanning a lineup of looks, derives from the West Village \u2014 specifically the Soul Cycle-then-healthy-brunch crowd of young, downtown women with roots in affluent, horse-country suburbs like Greenwich. There were nods to equestrian styles in the form of tall riding boots, reworked with heels and pointy toes, and form-fitting silhouettes to match the tailoring of competition jackets.\n\nPlacing new spins on familiar pieces is a major signifier of both the Off-White brand and Abloh\u2019s method: \u201cIt\u2019s like taking a Yankees logo and flipping it upside down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken something that people already wear, and made it so that people who are familiar with it now see in a new way. And now they want it.\u201d Though he admits that \u201cstreetwear\u201d was always an easy identifier for his designs, one might argue that Abloh\u2019s not redefining the concept, so much as undefining it \u2014 untethering streetwear from any and all definitions.\n\nAn hour later, Abloh left Dance, the stylist, to manage the remainder of the fittings, while he traveled to his rented studio in the 18th Arrondissement to paint pieces for his show at Murakami\u2019s Kaikai Kiki Gallery in Tokyo next month. Massive canvases featuring words such as \u201cTelevision\u201d in white script fill the bare-bones space. Ten pieces will make up the show next month, including a video installation and a sculpture mimicking an old Sunoco gas station sign. It\u2019s the first exhibition Abloh has done of this kind, but he\u2019s more daunted by the limited time frame in which to complete and ship all the pieces to Japan than by the work itself. \u201cThere\u2019s no failure in constantly creating,\u201d Abloh said. \u201cThe only failure is if you\u2019re actually not making anything. And so, that\u2019s how, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, in a whole other studio with paint on it. The way my brain is set \u2014 there\u2019s no box.\u201d\n\nThe following afternoon, Abloh signs sweatshirts, sneakers, even the shirt on a fan\u2019s back, inside the Chrome Hearts store on the tony shopping strip of Avenue de Montaigne. Outside, a line has formed down the block with fans hoping to claim one of just 50 limited-edition Off-White x Chrome Hearts hoodies, all of which sell out in less than two hours. Later that evening at the show\u2019s venue, a pavilion on Rue Cambon, Abloh sits on a plastic-wrapped bench, gazing between his phone and the models\u2019 rehearsal. Clusters of white balloons hover high overhead as \u201cclouds\u201d within a set design he described as \u201cfabricated nature.\u201d There\u2019s already been a fair share of excitement surrounding the show: a last-minute dress addition to the lineup, and just down the street, a feverish mob scene outside the brand\u2019s pop-up, where the newest Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 sneaker had gone on sale that day (a situation that required police intervention).\n\nEarlier, Abloh explained why, even as an American, with his home base in Chicago and his brand\u2019s headquarters in Milan, the decision to present his collections in Paris has always been integral to his ambitions for Off-White: \u201cParis is home to the birthplace of this idea. The names: Givenchy, Balenciaga, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent. Of course, clothes have been made everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this idea, with these principles I\u2019ll still uphold when I\u2019m 50 years old \u2014 I\u2019m only doing it for that. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019d be doing something else.\u201d", "title": "A Whirlwind Paris Fashion Week With Virgil Abloh", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Wylie\u2019s time in Ottawa, however, brought to light something that most people have overlooked. Unlike businesses and the federal government itself, federal political parties aren\u2019t subject to Canada\u2019s internet privacy and data protection laws.\n\nSome of those laws date to the 1980s and the federal privacy commissioner, among others, has been calling for a 21st century update. But while Canada lags behind Europe in this area, it\u2019s still well ahead of the United States.\n\nThe political party exemption came about in part because of a parliamentary tradition of not giving bureaucrats or outside bodies control over a party\u2019s affairs. I called Michael Pal, an assistant law professor at the University of Ottawa who studies election laws and related issues like voter suppression, and asked if it\u2019s time for a change.\n\n\u201cEvery other sector is covered by privacy laws but political parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all using data so I don\u2019t think there is a good argument about why they should be under privacy rules.\u201d\n\nAs for concerns about encroaching on Parliament, Professor Pal isn\u2019t buying that either. He noted that parties were already \u201cheavily regulated\u201d through Elections Canada and election fund-raising laws.\n\nSo what\u2019s a Facebook user to do now? My colleague Brian X. Chen, who writes about consumer technology, has offered some guidance on minimizing privacy risks on Facebook, although his overall take on the situation facing Facebook users is a little discouraging:\n\n\u201cWhat, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network? Here\u2019s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat about deleting old Facebook and Twitter posts? Brian tried it and found that his \u201cdelete-everything approach was probably not worth most people\u2019s time. And even after all that time, my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me \u2014 including photos from my 21st birthday (need I say more?) \u2014 because that content was not mine to delete.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Canada Letter Every week, receive a handpicked selection of news and opinion plus exclusive commentary from New York Times journalists.

The birth, and survival, of the quints at the height of the Great Depression was both a global sensation and a tale of grave injustice. The girls were taken from their family and made wards of the province of Ontario, ostensibly to protect them from exploitation. But the government turned around and exhibited almost like zoo animals. Millions of visitors viewed them from a special gallery.\n\nOther injustices and misfortune followed the five through their lives. The decision by the City of North Bay to turn over the log house to a village without the obvious means to maintain or restore it looked like the latest one.\n\nBut much has changed in the past year. After a public campaign, North Bay reversed its decision, and the house has been moved to downtown where it will become a museum.\n\nAnd this week, The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the birth of the quints an event of national historical significance.\n\nCarlo Tarini, a friend who acts as the family\u2019s spokesman, told me this week that Annette and C\u00e9cile, the two surviving sisters, are doing well, although C\u00e9cile was hospitalized for a time in January because of pneumonia.\n\n\u201cIn the pre-internet decades of the 30s and 40s, the worldwide fascination they sparked as children brings shade to the Kardashian kids popularity,\u201d Mr. Tarini wrote in an email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRead: 2 Survivors of Canada\u2019s First Quintuplet Clan Reluctantly Re-emerge\n\nTrans Canada\n\n\u2014The Protestant churches involved in a system that took Indigenous children away from their families to boarding schools apologized for their role in during the 1990s.

They joined the Astros before last season \u2014 McCann coming via a trade with the Yankees, Morton arriving from Philadelphia as a free agent.\n\nFor all their shared experiences, they could not be more different.\n\nMcCann, who grew up in Duluth, Ga., outside Atlanta, is bearded, bald and burly, and a seven-time All-Star whose biting wit, keen baseball mind and easy confidence have made him a clubhouse leader. Morton, who grew up in Redding, Conn., is towering and lithe, an introspective journeyman whose talent has often exceeded his confidence, which at times has been as fragile as his health. He has undergone surgeries on his elbow, hip (twice) and hamstring.\n\nBut in each of their voices, there is an appreciation for the path the other has taken. They were the only players on that Area Code Games team, which was run by Pittsburgh Pirates scouts, to ascend to the major leagues. And among the 52 players drafted by the Braves in their class, they are among six who reached the majors and the only ones still there.\n\nMcCann recalls arriving at the Braves\u2019 minor league complex in 2002 after signing and seeing two other players in the clubhouse. One was Morton. Their rooms were across the hall from each other at the hotel where they lived, and they hung out during a stage in a ballplayer\u2019s life that usually involves video games and pizza delivery.\n\n\u201cWhen you sign, you\u2019re going to a place where you don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Morton said. \u201cThere are people of different ages, different backgrounds, different nationalities, different cultures and you\u2019re just showing up. You\u2019re all there to begin your career and become acclimated to professional baseball. It\u2019s not even necessarily about baseball. It\u2019s more about adhering to structure and responsibility and then you go from there.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Morton was going nowhere.

McCann said he was not sent down to the minors a few days later \u2014 as had been planned \u2014 because Smoltz lobbied Manager Bobby Cox to keep him.\n\nSmoltz recognized then what Morton had gotten a glimpse of in their brief summer together and would get a full viewing of later, when he navigated six innings in a win over the Los Angeles Angels in his major league debut, on June 14, 2008.\n\n\u201cI remember Vladimir Guerrero hitting a ball straight back up the middle,\u201d Morton said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I remember Brian scream, \u2018Watch out,\u2019 even before he hit it.\u201d\n\nMorton described good catchers as having a selfless self-confidence about them.\n\n\u201cIt allows you to feed off their confidence, off their self-determination, off their experience because it\u2019s hard \u2014 especially as a young guy \u2014 to look in and believe in the totality of the decisions you\u2019re making, pitch to pitch, batter to batter,\u201d Morton said. \u201cBut a good catcher, you can see it in their eyes, you can see it in their face \u2014 how they receive the ball, how the game is called \u2014 that quiet, I-know-what-I\u2019m-doing look in their eyes.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt could not have hurt Morton to have such a settling hand when he went to the mound to begin the sixth inning of Game 7 against the Dodgers in November. It was Morton\u2019s first relief appearance in nine years, and it is hard to overstate how desperately Houston was counting on him. Though the Astros led, 5-0, they had already used four pitchers from a threadbare bullpen.\n\nMorton\u2019s outing did not start promisingly: The Dodgers had one run in and two runners on with one out, bringing Dodger Stadium alive and the top of the order to the plate.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to throw as hard as I could,\u201d said Morton, who had one fastball clocked at 99 miles per hour. \u201cI remember thinking: Wow, the ball\u2019s coming out really well, but I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going because I\u2019m trying to throw it really hard. Then I threw a couple where it\u2019s just, \u2018make a pitch,\u2019 and I look up to see if the ball is coming out well on the radar gun and it was like the same.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He then shattered Seager\u2019s bat \u2014 a shard hit Morton on the thigh \u2014 to escape. He did not allow another base runner.\n\n\u201cAfter the pitch he made on Seager, I knew from catching him that he was going to finish the game,\u201d McCann said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was an extraordinary show of faith in a pitcher who has a losing record in his career (60-78) and whom the Astros pitching coach Brent Strom described as a glass half-empty guy. Just to be sure, Astros Manager A. J. Hinch had Justin Verlander \u2014 who threw 93 pitches the day before \u2014 warming up in the ninth inning.\n\nBut McCann\u2019s faith was buttressed by his history with Morton, who was 14-7 with a 3.62 earned run average in the best season of his career and even better in the playoffs. He threw five shutout innings in the Astros\u2019 4-0 win over the Yankees in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, and left Game 4 of the World Series with one out in the seventh and a 1-0 lead the bullpen would not hold.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all synced up, he\u2019s one of the best pitchers in the game,\u201d McCann said.\n\n\u201cI just remember those Game 7s how calm he was, like he had played this moment in his head a million times. Not one moment got too big for him \u2014 he owned it.\u201d\n\nThat is not completely true. Morton said his one anxious moment came at the start of the ninth inning of Game 7 against the Dodgers, when Chase Utley, who was hitless in the postseason but 5 for 10 with a double and a homer in his career against Morton, was called upon to pinch-hit.\n\n\u201cThat was a game within a game for me,\u201d Morton said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t to take away from any other hitters in the game, but over a 10-year stretch, he\u2019s a guy that I felt was really going to give me a hard time. So when Chase Utley steps into the box in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, you\u2019re like, uh, all right, let\u2019s see how this goes.\u201d\n\nIt went just fine. Morton struck Utley out on three pitches.\n\nThen he retired Taylor and Seager on routine grounders to Altuve.\n\nWhen first baseman Yuli Gurriel gloved Altuve\u2019s final throw, shortstop Carlos Correa hurled his glove in the air, third baseman Alex Bregman sank to his knees and a brigade of pitchers burst through the bullpen gates. Morton checked to make sure it was the third out.\n\n\u201cYou kind of get lost in the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we were on a good roll, we were making pitches and then, just like that, the season\u2019s over. You throw one pitch and the whole thing is over.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has been a little more than four months since the World Series ended. McCann, who had never advanced in five previous trips to the playoffs, said that time \u2014 and the watching and rewatching of the playoffs from his couch \u2014 had allowed for a deeper appreciation of how hard it is to win and for how remarkable the Series was.\n\nMorton said he had rewatched Game 7 only a handful of times. It was not transformative, he said, or a validation. What if he is back in the same spot this season and ends up losing? But it was, he added, a reminder of why the game matters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t romanticize baseball as much as people would love us to,\u201d Morton said as he stood inside the clubhouse this month. \u201cAfter a certain amount of time \u2014 I was drafted in 2002 and here we are 16 years later \u2014 and it\u2019s become a job. It\u2019s still appealing in the way that I get to go play baseball for a living, but the utopian idea of it, that\u2019s kind of played out and now I have legitimate responsibilities to the organization, to myself and my family because it\u2019s become about more than just me.\u201d\n\nHe paused to think.\n\n\u201cBut those moments,\u201d Morton continued. \u201cIn baseball, if you\u2019re speaking from in here, in this environment, that\u2019s what we live for.\u201d", "title": "A World Series Embrace Was Only One Stop on a Shared Journey", "authors": ["Billy Witz"]}

In order to succeed, you will have to put time in and designate someone to show face in person, since that\u2019s important in Asia.\u201d\n\nMr. Spiegler said that such conversations put him in a surprising position at times: \u201cThere are galleries we\u2019d love to have, but once we speak we realize they have work to do before their first appearance. It\u2019s a surreal experience for a fair director to caution big galleries from entering a fair, but it\u2019s the responsible thing to do.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of the biggest international galleries have already set down roots in Hong Kong, and one building in particular has proved alluring: the art-focused, 24-story development H Queen\u2019s.

The concurrent show in the gallery\u2019s space at H Queen\u2019s features the German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. And the idea is that the exhibitions bolster each other: \u201cPeople at the fair can get a taste of the gallery program,\u201d said Mr. Xu, who formerly had his own gallery in Shanghai.\n\n[READ MORE: Where to Play (and Eat) in Hong Kong]\n\nH Queen\u2019s is only one facet of the steadily growing Hong Kong art scene.

Ms. Wei pointed out the difference in approaches from the opening price: \u201cIn auctions, you hammer up, and at fairs, you bargain down.\u201d\n\nThe auction house view is that anything that gets a person to buy art for the first time is good. \u201cLast year, one-third of buyers globally were new to Christie\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Wei said. \u201cAnd 22 percent of them were from Asia.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Kurimanzutto gallery will fill its booth with works by Gabriel Orozco, who has had his own solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nThe gallery made its debut at Art Basel Hong Kong last year. \u201cWe were quite impressed by the response from collectors,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Manzutto, the co-founder. \u201cWe managed to find great contacts.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Orozco is a relatively known quantity among Asian institutions, and is featured in the collection of Tokyo\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, among others.

Ms. Lam said that for her money, South Korea \u2014 about 2,000 miles away \u2014 is actually the continent\u2019s most sophisticated art market.\n\nBut in the eyes of dealers and fair organizers, that means only that there\u2019s room to grow.\n\n\u201cWe claim a certain degree of credit,\u201d Mr. Spiegler said. \u201cThis show not only builds a bridge between East and West, it builds them between different markets in Asia.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor Australians, the idea of a great art fair only eight hours away was a godsend.\u201d", "title": "A Worldwide Focus on Hong Kong for Art Basel", "authors": ["Ted Loos"]}

The spaces are more affordable. Here, there\u2019s amazing work, but I think it can be a bit too much about the market.

She was class president and a member of the National Honor Society; she sang in two choirs and worked on the school newspaper.\n\nThe yearbook described her as one of two students who \u201cdid the most\u201d for their class and school. She graduated in 1988 third in her class of more than 200 seniors, and her college tuition was covered by scholarships, some from local churches.\n\nTo Nakesha, Williams College, a competitive private liberal arts school in pastoral Berkshire County, must have seemed a world away from home.\n\nYet she adjusted easily. A former classmate, Valda Clark Christian, now a health care executive in Maryland, recalled how Nakesha had warmly introduced her to the relatives who accompanied her to campus. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who met her and didn\u2019t fall right into some comfort and familiarity,\u201d Ms. Clark Christian said.\n\nPart of a close-knit group of students of color, Nakesha joined the college\u2019s gospel choir and a traditional African dance troupe called Kusika, which Ms. Burton directed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNakesha, Ms. Clark Christian and two other students were seen together so often that they became known on campus as the Four Musketeers.\n\n\u201cThey were like the women you looked up to, that you admired,\u201d said Tanya Nicholson Miller, another former classmate and now an educational consultant in New Jersey. \u201cIt was just like the way they carried themselves on campus, their sense of self-esteem.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNakesha was also a source of support for other students \u2014 a \u201creally bright light to all of the faculty and her peers,\u201d Ms. Burton recalled.\n\nBecky Dickinson, who had felt self-conscious about performing, said she joined Kusika only after Nakesha encouraged her.\n\n\u201cI do remember her saying like, \u2018You can do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dickinson said. \u201cI admired her. She was inspiring.\u201d\n\nIn her dorm room, Nakesha kept a photograph of her mother, Geraldine Williams, and she had saved her mother\u2019s cards and letters, which often bore an imprint of a lipstick kiss.\n\nIn the fall of 1990, several weeks into her junior year, Nakesha learned that her mother, who had breast cancer, had become gravely ill. Nakesha withdrew from school and returned to New Jersey, moving into the Willingboro home of her aunt, Jacqueline Fattore, who was caring for Geraldine.\n\nNakesha slept in a recliner at the foot of her mother\u2019s bed in the den. \u201cI spent every moment I could at her side,\u201d Nakesha later wrote in an essay about her mother\u2019s final days.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeraldine was an unwed teenager when Nakesha was born in 1970. Although she soon married Nakesha\u2019s father, Marvin Rothmiller, they divorced several years later. Geraldine became involved with an abusive man who repeatedly molested Nakesha when she was just a child, as Nakesha eventually confided to Ms. Burton and others. (The man was later convicted in a drug case and has since died.)\n\nNakesha was sent to live with her maternal grandmother, with whom she stayed until leaving for college. But she remained close to her mother, and was devastated by her death in February 1991, at the age of 37.\n\n\u201cI looked at her face,\u201d Nakesha wrote. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I saw a calm that wasn\u2019t clouded by bitterness, hurt or anger.\u201d\n\nNakesha enrolled for the spring semester at Rutgers University\u2019s Camden campus, and in the fall, returned to Williams College, with a renewed sense of dedication and seriousness, Ms. Burton recalled.\n\nPhoto\n\nOver the next two years, Nakesha focused on researching, writing, choreographing and directing an ambitious senior project \u2014 a panoramic performance of black dance, from its origins in Africa through contemporary hip-hop.\n\nNakesha, lithe and petite, also performed in the two-hour show in March 1993 which involved some 20 dancers and musicians.

One former student, Lisa Bevevino, to whom Nakesha taught sixth-grade history, remembered Nakesha as beloved by students, often sitting on the floor with them, talking through their problems and assigning projects that provoked creativity.\n\nOnce, she said, Nakesha had each student invent a holiday and write about how it would be celebrated, the values it promoted and what artifacts would be involved.\n\n\u201cShe was one of the foundational people,\u201d said Ms. Bevevino, now an assistant professor of French and Latin at the University of Minnesota, Morris, \u201cthat really cared about how we were doing and how we thought about the world.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, after three years, Nakesha abruptly left Sewickley. Neither Ms. Bevevino nor anyone else could recall her giving a clear reason for her departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nNakesha drifted over the next decade, moving among family members and friends and holding odd jobs, working as a sales clerk at Victoria\u2019s Secret and as a bridge toll collector. She took computer software courses, and a writing class at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she wrote the essay about her mother\u2019s death. Hints of her mental illness began to surface.\n\nIn 1997, Ms. Burton and her husband invited Nakesha to live with them in Hancock, Mass., a short distance from Williams College, where Nakesha found administrative work in the dance department. The couple had been concerned that Nakesha had quit her teaching job, and they sensed that something was not right. One day, Ms. Burton said, she arrived home to find all the curtains drawn. Nakesha said she believed someone had followed her home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a few months, Nakesha decided to move to New York, against the advice of Ms. Burton and her husband. \u201cWhat could we do?\u201d Ms. Burton said. \u201cShe was an adult.\u201d\n\nBy the summer of 1998, Nakesha was living in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with Anim Steel, a former college classmate. Mr. Steel had been captivated by Nakesha when they first met at Williams, writing in his journal, \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like her.\u201d\n\nIn Brooklyn, they shopped together, played kickball and visited the Statue of Liberty for Nakesha\u2019s birthday. But Nakesha was having bouts of anxiety, Mr. Steel said, and he found a therapist who agreed to see her on a pro bono basis.\n\nThe therapy did not last; Mr. Steel moved to Boston at the end of the summer, and Nakesha stopped seeing the doctor. She moved in with another friend, Greg Holland, a paralegal and friend from high school, who she once described as being \u201clike a brother.\u201d\n\nAfter about two years, Mr. Holland recalled, Nakesha began claiming that the C.I.A. was looking for her. She stopped working and paying her share of the rent. She moved back to New Jersey, first staying with her father and then with other relatives. Her erratic behavior continued, and she began to cut off family members.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, a former college classmate, Joan Rocklin, invited Nakesha to dinner in Manhattan. As first-year students at Williams, they lived across the hall from each other, and had remained friends. Ms. Rocklin was planning to move to teach at the University of Oregon School of Law and wanted to see Nakesha before leaving.\n\nAs they relaxed in Ms. Rocklin\u2019s apartment, Nakesha mentioned that she had found messages in books she was reading. Ms. Rocklin assumed Nakesha meant certain books had seemed meaningful to her; she was disturbed to learn that Nakesha meant actual written messages.\n\nNakesha moved a few years later to Philadelphia, where she taught at an adult literacy center. Her supervisor recalled her as a talented teacher but said she began talking to herself and complaining that people were stealing from her, and she eventually left the job without collecting her last paycheck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was in November 2006 that Ms. Rocklin received the first in a stream of emails from Nakesha.\n\n\u201cHey Joan, What\u2019s going on?\u201d Nakesha wrote. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in California right now.\u201d\n\nNakesha said she was \u201cstranded\u201d with no address and could be reached through the Los Angeles library system.\n\nMs. Rocklin responded that she cared about Nakesha and was worried \u201cwhether you have shelter at night and whether you are getting enough food.\u201d\n\nNakesha, then 36, replied that she was \u201cnot exactly homeless,\u201d but was in \u201ca wandering, unstable state that is sad at best.\u201d", "title": "A \u2018Bright Light,\u2019 Dimmed in the Shadows of Homelessness", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser"]}

Altuve, the A.L. most valuable player, said the Cole trade told the team that Luhnow wanted to add another trophy immediately.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nRead our National League preview here.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of everything, how hard it is to win back to back,\u201d Altuve said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not impossible. We\u2019re going to do the best we can to make it happen.\u201d\n\nNo team has repeated since the Yankees won three titles in a row from 1998 through 2000. This is the longest stretch in major league history without a repeat champion, but the Astros have everything they need to change that. Only two of their starters exceeded 200 innings last season: Verlander (242\u2154, including the postseason) and Cole (203). Only two position players, Altuve and third baseman Alex Bregman, played more than 140 games in the regular season.\n\n\u201cPhysically, our guys are fine,\u201d Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cThe mental part of it will be our biggest challenge.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI watched this last season when the Indians and the Cubs \u2014 both World Series teams \u2014 struggled the first month of the season. They were told they were struggling. They were told they were having a hangover. They were told they weren\u2019t playing up to expectations. That has to lead to a ton more anxiety and a ton more tension around a team that you don\u2019t normally have to deal with. You carry a lot of baggage around the following season from winning, and that type of attention isn\u2019t always good attention.\u201d\n\nIf any team is immune to prolonged struggles, though, this should be the one. The Astros, who return almost everyone, led the majors in slugging percentage in 2017 while finishing last in strikeouts. They have mastered the modern power game without the trade-off most teams must make \u2014 like drinking all the Champagne at a party yet feeling just fine the next morning.\n\nExpect no hangover for the 2018 Astros, just another championship banner at Minute Maid Park.\n\nThe rest of the West division should not pose much of a challenge. The game\u2019s best player, Mike Trout, begins his seventh full season with the Los Angeles Angels still seeking his first playoff victory. The Angels will try a six-man rotation behind him, being careful not to ask much from a group that includes no starting candidates who worked even 150 innings last season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to allow us to use depth,\u201d starter Matt Shoemaker said. \u201cAnd if it gives us extra days to help us stay fresh, it\u2019s just going to help the team, and us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a trying spring training, Shohei Ohtani, the pitching and hitting sensation from Japan, is the great unknown. The Angels upgraded their infield with Ian Kinsler at second base and Zack Cozart at third, and they begin their first full season with left fielder Justin Upton. But designated hitter Albert Pujols, 38, regressed markedly last season and still has four years left on his contract.\n\nDespite a rash of late-spring pitching injuries, the Oakland Athletics don\u2019t feel like a last-place team anymore. They found long-term solutions by putting Matts on their infield corners \u2014 Matt Olson at first base and Matt Chapman at third. And the newcomers Stephen Piscotty and Jonathan Lucroy will help a lineup whose designated hitter, Khris Davis, hit 85 homers the last two seasons. (Only Giancarlo Stanton, with 86, had more.)\n\nCould the A\u2019s sneak up on the field and snag a playoff berth, as they did six years ago? It\u2019s unlikely, but you never know.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s putting pretty high expectations on them, but it is something we\u2019ve discussed, certainly internally but also publicly,\u201d General Manager David Forst said. \u201cThe ideal situation for this team would be to be like the \u201912 team, and be better than expected now and then continue to get better going forward.\u201d\n\nBaseball 2018 Predictions Tyler Kepner makes his picks for the season. Teams are listed in predicted order of finish. American League East: Yankees, Orioles (wild card), Red Sox, Blue Jays, Rays A.L. Central: Indians, Twins (wild card), Royals, White Sox, Tigers A.L. West: Astros, Angels, Athletics, Mariners, Rangers National League East: Nationals, Phillies, Mets, Braves, Marlins N.L. Central: Cubs, Cardinals (wild card), Brewers, Pirates, Reds N.L.

Rookie of the Year: Shohei Ohtani, Angels N.L. M.V.P.: Paul Goldschmidt, Diamondbacks N.L. Cy Young: Stephen Strasburg, Nationals N.L. Rookie of the Year: Ronald Acuna, Braves\n\nThe Seattle Mariners keep trying, but seem destined to miss the playoffs for the 17th season in a row. Even if Nelson Cruz, 37, and Robinson Cano, 35, continue their elite offensive production, a thin rotation dooms this team. The ace James Paxton has pitched parts of five seasons but never made 25 starts, and there\u2019s only mediocrity behind him, including Felix Hernandez, who has a 4.08 earned run average since turning 30 in early 2016.\n\nIf a hitter\u2019s job is to get on base and avoid making outs, the Texas Rangers\u2019 Rougned Odor had a historic performance in 2017: Of all the players to make 500 outs in a season, Odor had the lowest on-base percentage, at .252. He did have 30 homers, but also 162 strikeouts, and symbolized the Rangers\u2019 all-or-nothing offense. They took no steps to improve it, and went bargain-hunting (Mike Minor, Matt Moore, Doug Fister) to address a wobbly rotation.\n\nThe Central\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Cleveland Indians finished 17 games ahead of the Minnesota Twins in the A.L. Central last season, and the gap has narrowed significantly. The Indians lost first baseman Carlos Santana, right fielder Jay Bruce and the setup man Bryan Shaw in free agency, while the Twins added starters Jake Odorizzi and Lance Lynn, relievers Addison Reed and Fernando Rodney, and designated hitter Logan Morrison, among others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe more or less returned the entire position-player club from last year, which in the second half really performed,\u201d said Derek Falvey, the Twins\u2019 chief baseball officer. \u201cThey\u2019re young and they\u2019re growing. We knew on the pitching side we could add some experience and some depth.\u201d\n\nThe Indians \u2014 a team Falvey helped build \u2014 still have more star power than the Twins, with starters Corey Kluber and Carlos Carrasco, relievers Cody Allen and Andrew Miller and the lineup mainstays Francisco Lindor and Edwin Encarnacion. But this could be the closest division race of them all, with both teams qualifying for the postseason as they batter their three division neighbors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But with Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer gone via free agency \u2014 and no additions to a weak rotation \u2014 the Royals may slip back to 90 losses and trade whoever they can in July.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are finished with their tear-down trades, but waiting for their high-end prospects to arrive before adding veterans. In the meantime, they\u2019ll enjoy watching second baseman Yoan Moncada break through as a star beside first baseman Jose Abreu, his fellow Cuban and the team\u2019s steady leader.\n\nAfter going 64-98, the Detroit Tigers hold the No. 1 overall draft pick for just the second time in franchise history. They might do so again in 2019 because this could be the worst team in baseball. The Tigers have three fading veterans combining for $72 million in salaries (Miguel Cabrera, Jordan Zimmermann and Victor Martinez), with nobody else making more than $6.5 million.\n\n\u201cThey might take some lumps, but it\u2019s going to be a learning process and we have to let it unfold in front of our eyes,\u201d said Ron Gardenhire, the veteran manager who replaces Brad Ausmus. \u201cYou can\u2019t force it, you can\u2019t beat \u2019em up. It\u2019s all going to be about patience here.\u201d\n\nThe East\n\nSince the last time the Yankees won the A.L. East, the Boston Red Sox have won it three times and the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays have each had a turn. The Yankees should take back the division for the first time since 2012, and could do it with relative ease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of coverage in the infield and outfield side,\u201d General Manager Brian Cashman said. \u201cIn the bullpen, we\u2019ve got a lot of high-leverage guys. The rotation\u2019s the area, like any team, mostly you get affected. You lose some key guys in that rotation, it could be really challenging to your season.\u201d\n\nFair enough, but the Yankees\u2019 group of Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, Sonny Gray, C.C. Sabathia and Jordan Montgomery looks a lot stronger than Boston\u2019s starting staff, which falls off sharply after the left-handers Chris Sale and David Price. And that\u2019s assuming Price\u2019s elbow allows him to make more than the 11 starts he made last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat, then, about the Baltimore Orioles as the second wild-card team, with the Twins? The Red Sox will score a lot of runs, but so could the Orioles, especially if shortstop Manny Machado has a big platform year before free agency and third baseman Tim Beckham builds off his first full season as an everyday player.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe homegrown starters Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman may never develop into All-Stars. But they are solid, and remember, the Orioles contended into September last year despite giving 300 innings to Wade Miley and Ubaldo Jimenez, who combined for a 6.18 E.R.A. The newcomers Andrew Cashner and Alex Cobb are bound to do better.\n\nThe Orioles will miss closer Zach Britton for half the season as he recovers from a ruptured Achilles. But it should be no surprise if Manager Buck Showalter finds a way to squeeze this team into the playoffs for the fourth time in seven seasons.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t question the end goal playing for Buck Showalter,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThe end goal is winning. As a player, with some organizations, you question that.\u201d\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays seemed to make a halfhearted effort at winning this off-season, opting for complementary moves instead of reloading in Josh Donaldson\u2019s final season before free agency. The Blue Jays wanted to give themselves a chance to contend without touching a farm system they have worked hard to revive. A decent rotation does give them a chance, but only a small one. If the Blue Jays struggle early, expect a major roster overhaul.\n\nThat process is well underway for the Tampa Bay Rays, who plan to use only four starting pitchers this season, using days off and mixing in occasional bullpen games. The Rays\u2019 offense, which strikes out prodigiously, has lost four players who combined for 115 homers last season: Logan Morrison, Corey Dickerson, Evan Longoria and Steven Souza Jr.\n\nThe franchise has finished in last place just once since 2007, the last year it was known as the Devil Rays.

Those who give it their undivided attention, without pressure of competing events, will be richly rewarded. This year\u2019s incarnation is the 30th gathering organized by the Art Dealers Association of America and it overflows with interesting material, new and not, in solo and group presentations. Herewith, some tips to help you navigate your way.\n\nThe New New\n\nPhoto\n\nThe latest work by several artists shines in solo shows. At Casey Kaplan Jonathan Gardner continues to cultivate his stylized figurative, still life and landscape painting, in beautiful colors and multiple spatial shifts. He could be our Fernand L\u00e9ger. At David Nolan the artist Wardell Milan reprises his recent breakthrough into panoramic, subtly dystopian paintings of figures in gardens, building on his drawing skill with color, collage and a touches of Cubism. At Van Doren Waxter, Jackie Saccoccio\u2019s latest abstractions effervesce more than ever with dots and carefully directed drips, suggesting windows onto worlds of atomized color. Marian Goodman is showing the exquisitely pastel pods of the sculptor Nairy Baghramian, each fastened to the floor or wall by a black stem, creating a delicious distortion of scale. Sperone Westwater is spotlighting the work of Otto Piene (1928-2014), a founder of Germany\u2019s Zero group, who made his minimalist forms in glamorous glazed ceramic during his last years.\n\nThe New Old\n\nSeveral galleries have solo shows of older material often never seen before (or not lately). In three instances works from the 1960s or \u201970s underscore the achievements of distinguished female artists. Anglim Gilbert has an extraordinary trove of mostly delicate drawings of women\u2019s bodies by the pioneering Lynn Hershman Leeson; all were discovered when the artist recently moved house. At Paul Kasmin: Jane Freilicher\u2019s silken paintings of self-possessed nudes add stunningly to her excursions still life and landscape. Fergus McCaffrey has brought back a series of painting-reliefs by the Italian artist Carol Rama from her recent show at the New Museum, where their truth-to-materials toughness was sometimes lost in the sexual extravagance of her watercolors and etchings.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the standouts in this group is Hirschl & Adler\u2019s tribute to Frank Walter, the polymorphous, self-taught Antiguan genius \u2014 painter, sculptor, composer, writer \u2014 included in Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s inaugural participation in the 2017 Venice Biennale. This display touches all bases and includes a family tree, with the artist tracing his ancestry back to Charlemagne. Other don\u2019t-miss moments include, at Washburn, some newly discovered drawings by Myron Stout from the early \u201950s showing Provincetown dunes and trees in quick jagged lines. Pavel Zoubok is showing little-known collages from the late 1950s and early \u201960s by the American expatriate painter Janice Biala (1903-2000) that ambitiously conjure Abstract Expressionist gestures in collages incorporating cut paper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Alexander Gray, Harmony Hammond\u2019s prescient Weave paintings of the mid-1970s add a subversive domestic twist to the modernist monochrome. And three dealers present distinctive abstract paintings from the late 1980s and early \u201990s: at Michael Rosenfeld, William T. Williams achieves the colors of Byzantine icons and the solidity of fortress walls; at Lelong, the fiery compositions of Mildred Thompson (1936-2003) spin Kandinsky toward still-unknown galaxies; and at Peter Freeman, Mel Bochner\u2019s early post-conceptual forays into (shaped) painting build intensity with jousting, improvised lines, rather than \u2014 as currently \u2014 with words.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmerican Modernism\n\nThis year\u2019s most plentiful American modernists include Marsden Hartley, Milton Avery, Oscar Bluemner and Charles Burchfield.

Dr. Redfield\u2019s views on gun violence research and other contentious issues such as access to abortion and sexual health education are not yet known.\n\nHis work in AIDS research and policy has generated concern over the years, in particular for his call in the mid-1980s to late 1980s for widespread AIDS testing and screening of military recruits for H.I.V.\n\nWhile pushing for broader AIDS testing during routine exams as a means to contain the epidemic, Dr. Redfield also called for reducing the stigma associated with the disease. At a congressional hearing in August 1987, Dr. Redfield recommended regular testing, at doctor\u2019s appointments and hospitalizations, as well as for marriage license applicants, and incorporating the test into the practice of medicine, according to news reports. But he also said, \u201cWe have to tell people it\u2019s anti-American to discriminate against people who have the AIDS virus.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dr. Redfield was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine at presentations and in a report. The investigation led to a correction in some published data, according to documents.\n\nSeveral high-level colleagues, however, felt the military should have been tougher on Dr. Redfield, who they felt raised false hopes about the efficacy of a treatment vaccine he was developing. At the time, Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group sued to gain the records, and made them public.\n\nIn a 1992 letter to Col. Donald Burke, the director of the division of retrovirology, Major Craig W.

President Trump was a vocal critic of the deal during his presidential campaign, and while in office, he has consistently blamed CNN, a channel owned by Turner and part of Time Warner\u2019s television business, for unfair coverage of his administration.\n\nAT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.\n\nBut late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal. AT&T and Time Warner has dropped \u201cselective enforcement\u201d as a defense, according to the new filings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, are expected to take the stand.\n\n\u201cThis is the single most important decision this year\u201d for technology, telecom and media firms, said Amy Yong, a research analyst at Macquarie Group in New York. \u201cIt will frame regulation and mergers and acquisitions going forward and raise questions about all the consolidation in the past, too.\u201d\n\nIf the judge sides with AT&T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth \u2014 one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.\n\nThe company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the Justice Department prevails in this suit, it would signal a new era of scrutiny for the media and telecom industries. In 2011, Comcast won approval for its purchase of NBCUniversal that also created an enormous telecom and media company.

Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.\n\nThe Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\n\n\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.\n\nAT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content. The company said it would argue that the merger of two companies that do not compete would be a stronger competitor in a market that had many new companies from Silicon Valley, like Facebook and Netflix.\n\n\u201cAs will be demonstrated at trial, the new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies as market leaders in both video programming and video distribution,\u201d AT&T said in its brief.", "title": "AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang"]}

He said the merger would do the opposite of what the government asserts: The company would have no incentive to withhold Turner channels, which are owned by Time Warner.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt would be financially ruinous if Turner were not as widely distributed as possible,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said.\n\nThe opening statements previewed the fierce legal battle that will play out before Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. His decision in the case will help set the direction for antitrust law for years to come. It will also frame the shape of the media industry, which is facing major shifts as more people move from cable television to viewing streaming entertainment over the internet.\n\nHundreds of company officials, reporters, hedge fund investors, antitrust scholars and industry analysts stood in line for hours to get a seat at the trial. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, sat together during the 90 minutes of opening remarks. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust official, watched from the front row on the other side of the room. The chief executives and Mr. Delrahim did not interact.\n\nThe case has drawn unusual public attention partly because of questions about whether it had a tinge of political interference. The Justice Department\u2019s opposition came as a surprise when it was announced in November, and AT&T suggested it had been instigated by President Trump, who has said that he opposed the deal. The government said that Mr. Trump did not communicate with antitrust officials on the deal and that their decision to oppose the merger had not been ordered by the White House.\n\nJudge Leon has rejected many of AT&T\u2019s efforts to introduce evidence about political interference into the case. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, will largely focus on fundamental principles of antitrust law: whether the merger would cause prices to increase and competition to decrease.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision will determine what sort of media mergers will be permitted between the creators and the distributors of content. Such deals, called \u201cvertical mergers,\u201d generally pass regulatory scrutiny because they don\u2019t make a company dominant in one specific market area. Judge Leon has noted the unusual case is like a \u201crare horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

As we saw in 2016, many former Sanders supporters sat out the general election, voted for a third-party candidate or voted for Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats should be concerned about their ability to mobilize populists in the races \u201cestablishment\u201d figures won. So the party could find itself facing another enthusiasm deficit for many key races, even with Mr. Trump in the White House.\n\nOn the Republican side, there was clear unity behind the president and his party. The races were mostly about which candidate was most supportive of President Trump. As a result, it seems likely that Republican voters will support whoever is on their ticket in the general election.\n\nWe can count on Republican primary voters to turn out in November as well. Republicans reliably vote in midterms, and again it is important to note that primary patterns suggest that enthusiasm is particularly high in the Republican base this year, too.\n\nRepublicans are motivated, in part, to act as a bulwark against any \u201cblue wave\u201d that might be coming their way. Following Mr. Abbott\u2019s lead, candidates like Senator Ted Cruz have been doing their best to reinforce expectations of a possible Democratic surge in order to get his voters fired up: \u201cWe know that the left is going to show up,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on Tuesday. \u201cThe extreme left, they\u2019re angry. They\u2019re filled with rage. They hate the president.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 record primary turnout suggests this is an effective mobilization strategy. In contrast, for the Democrats, raising expectations of a wave could be dangerous. Democratic constituents are generally disinclined to vote in midterms in the first place. To the extent that they are not particularly excited about the candidate their party fielded and believe that Democrats will most likely make major gains with or without them, it becomes more likely that a significant number will stay home on Election Day.\n\nIn other words, not only can the blue wave narrative distract us from what is happening on the ground, it can also help drive Republican enthusiasm and undermine Democratic turnout \u2014 not quite the double whammy Democratic strategists are looking for.", "title": "Opinion | About That Blue Wave \u2026", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "And in New Jersey, the Red Bulls in January took the extraordinary step of revoking official recognition of one of their oldest supporters groups, the Garden State Ultras. The Red Bulls said the decision \u2014 the G.S.U. claimed it was a first for the league \u2014 followed repeated disciplinary infractions, culminating in an episode on the last day of the 2017 season in which the team said a G.S.U. member dropped a flare into the family section of a rival team\u2019s stadium.\n\nThe G.S.U. disputed the team\u2019s account, and noted acidly in a statement on Facebook that, \u201cWe, along with billions of other soccer fans, are impassioned in both our love for our team and dislike of our opponents, and we disagree with attempts to mold a passive fan base that sits quietly, eating and drinking its overpriced concessions.\u201d\n\nEvery M.L.S. team has at least one official supporters group. Most have several. Often, the groups are run by an elected committee, and they enjoy exclusive privileges: block seating behind the goals; allotments of tickets for away matches; and the right to bring nominally banned items like flags, musical instruments and giant banners into stadiums.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a few of the league\u2019s newest arenas, even the architecture itself \u2014 steep banks of seats, safe-standing areas, roofs pitched to amplify chants \u2014 has the hard-core fan experience in mind, often in consultation with supporter groups.\n\nYet the relationships between teams and their supporters have always had a certain tension built into them. The supporters groups of the original M.L.S. teams in particular \u2014 a group that includes Columbus, D.C. United and the Red Bulls team originally known as the MetroStars \u2014 are proud of their independent histories.\n\nAs the league plants its flag in new markets \u2014 a 23rd franchise, Los Angeles F.C., will join M.L.S. this season, and expansion teams in Nashville and Miami were recently approved \u2014 many of the oldest groups see themselves as the true keepers of the institutional memories of their teams, and even of the league itself.\n\nThe Columbus story in particular highlighted that sense of ownership. When it was revealed on the eve of last season\u2019s playoffs that the team\u2019s owner, Anthony Precourt, was working behind the scenes \u2014 with the league\u2019s aid, if not blessing \u2014 to move the club to Austin, Tex., Crew fans mutinied. A grass-roots opposition was formed to lobby city and state leaders to keep the team in Ohio, and a hashtag campaign \u2014 #SaveTheCrew \u2014 quickly spread from social media to banners in other M.L.S. cities, and even in other sports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe message to Precourt and the league was clear: Columbus fans would not abandon the decades of cultural capital they had expended without a fight.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the basis of my longest standing friendships in this country,\u201d Graham Randall, an English expatriate member of the Crew Union supporters group, said of his relationship with the team. \u201cNow I see it through the eyes of my 11-year-old son. The news that the team might not be here at some point made me realize I would lose a huge thread in my life in the last 13 years.\u201d\n\nSince the missteps of the league\u2019s early days, when M.L.S. acquired a reputation for gimmickry that it struggled to shake, the emergence of a genuine independent supporters culture has been viewed as a necessary step toward credibility, and it remains vital to the league\u2019s vision of itself. But managing the dance between \u201corganic\u201d support and a strong league office can be delicate.\n\n\u201cThe supporters groups are really smart and creative \u2014 I mean, you see the work that goes into the giant tifo displays alone \u2014 and they have smart leaders who communicate really well with the clubs and basically police themselves,\u201d said Mark Abbott, the league\u2019s deputy commissioner. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do much, though we do set down guidelines for acceptable behavior.\u201d\n\nYet that desire for authenticity and passion often yields only symbolic displays of these qualities. It is one thing for fans to emulate a banner style imported from Italy, or the capo-led nonstop singing of South America, or the pop-parody chants of English soccer. But any organized fan groups that might actually feel and act on any of the enmity toward their rivals swiftly comes up against the realities of how the American sporting experience is managed and policed.\n\nIt also can make for absurdities on both sides, with teams who cultivate an \u201cultras\u201d culture punishing anyone who runs afoul of an explicit code of conduct published on the league\u2019s website. (\u201cThe use of streamers and confetti as an expression of fan enthusiasm is not prohibited,\u201d one section of the code reads, \u201cbut will be kept under review.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t help that even notionally unified fan sections can end up Balkanized. The Garden State Ultras, for example, were one of three main Red Bulls supporters groups housed in what is known as the South Ward at the team\u2019s stadium, Red Bull Arena. Yet collective sympathy for the G.S.U.\u2019s loss of its official status was tempered by the differing flavors of support that make the adjacent Empire Supporters Club and Viking Army as much rivals for attention as natural allies.\n\nStill, where there is a point of agreement among league, teams and fans, it is that there is little desire for fan groups to emulate the worst types of hooliganism seen in other parts of the world. If anything, today\u2019s M.L.S. fan groups emphasize a positivity that would look gauche to some of the groups they notionally emulate: charity fund-raisers, clothing drives and events supporting social issues from anti-racism initiatives to gay rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven studiedly provocative groups like Philadelphia\u2019s long-suffering Sons of Ben, known for their occasional contempt for their team\u2019s management but also for a \u201cNo one likes us, we don\u2019t care\u201d chant borrowed from the infamously hostile supporters of the London club Millwall, regularly show a softer side. The group maintains a philanthropy tab on its website that charts, among other initiatives, money and goods raised in an annual community food drive for the residents of Chester, Pa., which is home to the Union\u2019s stadium.\n\nCorey Furlan, one of the Sons of Ben founders, said of the apparent paradox: \u201cLook, we\u2019re Philadelphia sports fans \u2014 loud, obnoxious, whatever \u2014 but the type of people who care deeply about our team also give their energy, care and passion in other aspects of their life. We didn\u2019t just want to drop into Chester for 17 home games a year. We wanted to put down roots.\n\n\u201cI mean, players and coaches come and go, but we\u2019re the people who are going to be here forever.\u201d", "title": "Acrimony F.C.: M.L.S.

Since June, the water technology purification company \u2014 in collaboration with the Danish artistic, curatorial and research collective Diakron \u2014 has hosted Primer, an exhibition space that is within its open-plan factory, laboratory and offices.\n\nAnyone interested in seeing a free exhibition (\u201cLife Without,\u201d the current show by Michala Paludan, is on view until June 3) must first book an appointment.

Though a transcript is not available, the host and guests generally speak slowly and clearly enough for English Language Learners to understand. The example embedded above, which can also be found here, is from March 5, 2018. (The Learning Network also has a lesson plan on teaching with this podcast: Experimenting With Sound and Story: Teaching and Learning With \u2018The Daily\u2019 Podcast.)\n\nTimes Video\n\nThis page has a huge selection of short films on various topics. Many of the more recent ones now also have closed captioning, which makes them accessible to E.L.L.s. ((When the videos on The Times site do not have closed captioning, you can often find them on The New York Times YouTube Channel. You can also change the speed of the videos there so that the words are spoken at a slightly slower speed. We often will set it at .75)\n\nIn our classroom, we usually show videos from the Science, Sports and Op-Docs sections because they are short and engaging for adolescents. We also use clips from the Movie Trailers section, though they do not include closed captioning.\n\nGreat Read-Alouds From The New York Times\n\nThis is a classic Learning Network list of categorized, evergreen articles and essays from The Times that can be read aloud to students, on topics like \u201cteenagehood,\u201d \u201cmishaps,\u201d \u201canimals and insects,\u201d \u201ccrime and punishment,\u201d \u201cinspiration,\u201d \u201cidentity\u201d and \u201cfood.\u201d\n\n_________\n\nMetacognitive Listening Strategies\n\nVideo\n\nStudents who are learning English will make more progress if they are aware of how listening processes work and how those processes apply to their own experiences. To foster this awareness, we set up listening practice sessions where students have an opportunity to learn, use and evaluate different metacognitive listening strategies.\n\nWe start by emphasizing to students that they are constantly employing these skills in their daily lives and that they probably use many of them in their native languages automatically. This practice activity is designed to help them develop this same automaticity in English.\n\nBefore our students start a session, we give them a listening practice sheet to fill out, guided by the questions below.\n\nBefore Listening: What do I already know? What predictions can I make? While Listening: What strategies can I use to help me understand what I\u2019m listening to? After Listening: Which strategies helped me the most? What will I do next time?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou can use these questions with almost any audio text, whether podcasts, speeches, videos, movie clips, dialogues or news reports. The first time we do this as a class, however, we model our own listening strategies while filling it out. Here\u2019s how:\n\nBefore listening: What do I already know? What predictions can I make?\n\nWe start by writing the title of the audio text on the board and telling students what type of text it is. For example, we might have students watch the above Times video, \u201cWhy Do Bees Buzz?\u201d\n\nIn the first section of our listening practice sheet, we ask them to write what they already know about the title \u2014 if anything. In the \u201cWhy Do Bees Buzz?\u201d example, they might say that bees fly, make a buzzing sound and sting people. Students then share their writing with a partner or in a small group to generate more ideas.\n\nThen, based on this knowledge, students write their predictions about the content of the text. For instance, they might predict that the video will say that bees buzz to talk with each other. Students share these predictions with a partner and add any new ones they hear.\n\nWhile listening: What strategies can I use to help me understand what I\u2019m listening to?\n\nNext, we ask students to list strategies that might help them understand the text while they listen to it. We remind them that many of the strategies they use for reading can also be applied to listening. Students might come up with things like summarizing, using context clues to guess word meanings, asking questions or visualizing.\n\nThen, we play the text and, while they listen, students practice using one or more of these strategies.\n\nNote: If you are playing a text for the whole class either on speakers or on a screen, you might pause it every so often and replay it so students can practice these strategies. If you have the resources, you can also have students listen to the text using their own devices and headphones so they can pause and replay as needed.\n\nAfter listening: Which strategies helped me the most? What will I do next time?\n\nAfter they are finished, we have students use the third section of our listening practice sheet to reflect on which strategies were most helpful and what was particularly difficult about the task. Then, we ask them to share their reflections and how they might improve their skills.\n\nThis activity focuses on helping students name what they do while they listen \u2014 strategies that are often invisible. The emphasis in this type of practice is less about teaching new content than it is about teaching students how to listen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen students do engage in a listening activity to learn new content, we often ask them first to review which strategies might be most helpful for their listening. You will find more of those activities below.\n\n_________\n\nExercises to Improve Listening for Content\n\nVideo\n\nHere are a few interactive listening lessons in which students can use the above metacognitive strategies to learn new content:\n\nInteractive Read-Alouds\n\nIn this strategy, a teacher reads written content aloud, but stops every few paragraphs or pages (depending on your goals and the density and level of your text) to ask questions or give prompts. These can either be classic literacy-skills questions like \u201cWhat predictions can you make about what happens next?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think is the main idea of this article so far?\u201d or they can be more whimsical prompts, like \u201cDraw a quick illustration that could accompany this part of the text.\u201d\n\nInvite students to turn to a partner and share what they\u2019ve written or created, then have a very brief whole-class share before you continue reading.\n\nChronology\n\nHave students write a chronology of what they saw and heard in a video or podcast. For example, this edition of an older Learning Network feature, E.L.L. Practice, invites students to watch a short scene from \u201cThe Desolation of Smaug\u201d; a Science Take video on the physics of ants; or clips from The Times feature \u201cVideos That Creep and Crawl Toward Viral.\u201d Then, they work with a partner to write a description or chronology of what happened in the video.\n\nEvent Sort\n\nAs a class, view a video or listen to a podcast together. Then, give students a sheet with a list of events in the wrong sequence. Have them cut out the events and sort them into the correct order.\n\nEven better, invite students to find a short movie clip or podcast of their own. Have them identify three or four major events and make a sheet for the class with the events out of order. Then, let them play the clip and challenge the class to put the events in a chronological sequence. If you have access to multiple devices, students can do this kind of activity in pairs.\n\nComprehension Quiz\n\nGive a simple comprehension quiz on a video or podcast. This can be used as a formative assessment by having students write out and show their answers on mini-whiteboards or by using an online tool like Poll Everywhere. Students can also form teams to turn the activity into a game.\n\nTwo Predictions, Three Questions\n\nStudents themselves can create questions about what they saw and heard, which they can exchange with a classmate to answer. We give our students a work sheet that looks like this:\n\nThe title of today\u2019s episode or film is ______________________________ Write two predictions about this episode based on the title: 1. 2. While you watch the episode or film, write three questions about this episode for a classmate to answer. After the episode or film, give your paper to a classmate so that he or she can write the answers to your questions. Question 1: Answer: Question 2: Answer: Question 3: Answer: After watching the episode: Were your predictions correct? Explain why or why not. 1. 2.\n\nWhat strategies do you use to practice active listening with your students? Tell us in the comments.\n\n_________\n\nRelated\n\nExperimenting With Sound and Story: Teaching and Learning With \u2018The Daily\u2019 Podcast\n\nSkills Practice | Listening and Taking Notes, Via Times Podcasts", "title": "Active Listening: Using Times Videos, Podcasts and Articles to Practice a Key Skill", "authors": ["Larry Ferlazzo"]}

When they threatened to bail, she apologized.\n\n\u201cThese self-righteous kids screaming at you on television over the weekend aren\u2019t helping out at all,\u201d said Tucker Carlson, another Fox scold.

And young people are the least likely to vote.\n\n\u201cAdults mess up a lot,\u201d Sotomayor told the high school kids in her audience in Seattle. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers. We need you to come up with fresher and better ideas.\u201d\n\nSo today, these young people wonder why even the most obvious legislation, universal background checks on all gun purchases, can\u2019t pass in Congress despite support from 90 percent of the public. They learn quickly that it\u2019s because a single lobby owns the politicians. The obvious solution, which jaded political minds often forget, is to vote the bums out. It\u2019s not complicated.\n\nAnd again, it shouldn\u2019t be a D.I.Y. thing. Let\u2019s teach people how to tell fake news from real news. They do this in Italy, and many universities in the United States have taken it up as well. It should be, like learning road signs before you can get a driver\u2019s license, one of the courses that everyone takes before getting out of high school.\n\nDemocracies die when citizens feel powerless. The biggest stress test will come if Trump fires the special counsel Robert Mueller. Then, all the people new to the process will see what a constitutional crisis looks like.

Gotti, the grandson of the infamous Gambino family don who shares his name, was sentenced to five years in prison, following in the footsteps of two of his uncles, two great-uncles and both grandfathers. For three generations, members of the gangland dynasty have been imprisoned for crimes that have included shaking down construction sites, murdering a mob boss at a steakhouse and trying to extort the action-movie hero Steven Seagal.\n\nThe crimes that led this latest Gotti scion to be sent away were, according to the government, also entangled in the business that has occupied the family almost since the start of the Civil Rights era. Last June, Mr. Gotti, now 24, pleaded guilty to torching the car of an unwitting motorist who made the mistake of cutting off an aging Bonnano family figure on Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, Queens. Mr. Gotti also admitted that two weeks after the road-rage episode, he and two associates \u2014 presenting a note that said they had a bomb \u2014 robbed $6,000 from a bank in Maspeth, Queens.\n\nHis sentencing, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, had the feeling of a familiar family dinner as several Gotti parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles converged on the eighth-floor courtroom, kissing each other\u2019s cheeks and showing their support for the defendant. John A. Gotti, the son of the former boss (who was serving a life sentence for murder when he died in prison in 2002), embraced one of the court sketch artists with genuine affection, telling his younger relatives that the woman had not only covered his trials (plural), but had also covered \u201cgrandpa\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside the room, the younger Mr. Gotti \u2014 bespectacled, his hair slicked, both arms sleeved with tattoos \u2014 sat beside his lawyer, Charles Carnesi, who had once defended his uncle.

He described an African-American boy in East St. Louis sticking out his elbows in \u201cthe universal gesture of primate territorial challenge.\u201d Defiantly using male pronouns in a piece about the trans actress Laverne Cox, Williamson wrote, \u201cRegardless of the question of whether he has had his genitals amputated, Cox is not a woman, but an effigy of a woman.\u201d Feminism, he wrote, is a \u201ccollection of appetites wriggling queasily together like a bag of snakes.\u201d He tweeted that women who have abortions should be hanged, later clarifying that while he has doubts about the death penalty, \u201cI believe that the law should treat abortion like any other homicide.\u201d\n\nIn some ways I appreciate Williamson\u2019s honesty in admitting where his anti-abortion agenda leads. More abortion opponents should be willing to acknowledge that treating abortion as murder necessarily means treating women as murderers. All the same, I understand why many people are furious that the storied Atlantic magazine would give a perch to a man who traffics in crude stereotypes, and who thinks that the nearly one-quarter of American women who have had abortions deserve to die. \u201cToo many men in power don\u2019t care,\u201d feminist Jessica Valenti wrote in despair. \u201cTo them, our lives and freedom are just abstract concepts \u2014 things to be debated rather than understood as a given.\u201d\n\nThe backlash against Williamson, in turn, has occasioned self-pity among some members of the conservative intelligentsia, who feel victimized by a concerted campaign to write them out of mainstream public life. In National Review, Williamson\u2019s friend and former colleague David French demanded, \u201cDecide now, progressives, do you want any serious intellectual media space where conservative and progressive ideas clash?\u201d\n\nPersonally, I do. But which conservative ideas?\n\nIn \u201cAge of Fracture,\u201d an intellectual history of the late 20th century, the Princeton professor emeritus Daniel T. Rodgers described how the salience of ideas in American politics took on \u201cnew breadth and intensity in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Novel forms of intellectual production and dissemination \u2014 more politically oriented think tanks, new journals of scholarly debate and opinion, more argumentatively structured media \u2014 now began to move ideas more aggressively into circulation.\u201d Ideology was obviously not the only thing that drove politics \u2014 money and group interests were, as ever, important. But to understand national politics, you had to understand certain conservative ideas.\n\nTrump put an end to that. The field of ideas has gone from being the ground on which politics are fought to a side in politics, which is why it\u2019s so difficult to find serious intellectual Trump defenders. Trump has resentments and interests, but not ideology; he governs more as a postmodern warlord than a traditional party leader. Few things signal the irrelevance of ideas to his presidency like the appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser. Bolton\u2019s relentless advocacy of regime change contradicts the isolationism Trump touted during the campaign. Trump called the Iraq war a \u201cdisaster\u201d; Bolton is one of few who continue to defend it. Yet Bolton\u2019s appointment isn\u2019t discordant, because he and Trump are both belligerent bullies, and in this administration stylistic similarities matter more than policy details.\n\nInasmuch as there are ideas bound up with Trumpism, they are considered too disreputable for most mainstream publications. An opinion section that truly captured the currents of thought shaping our politics today might include Alex Jones, the conspiracy-mad Sandy Hook truther; the white nationalist Richard Spencer; and CliffsNotes fascist Steve Bannon.\n\nMost supporters of liberal democracy, on the right as well as the left, realize that once we treat issues like religious freedom and the desirability of racial equality as matters for debate rather than as first principles, we are lost. But because there\u2019s now so little correlation between the political arena and the intellectual one, the question of which conservatives liberals ought to engage becomes subjective and arbitrary.\n\nWilliamson was hired at The Atlantic not just for being an energetic writer, but in the name of ideological diversity. \u201cIf we are going to host debates, we have to host people who actually disagree with, and sometimes offend, the other side,\u201d wrote Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg \u2014 no relation \u2014 in a memo to his staff. \u201cKevin will help this cause.\u201d\n\nBut Williamson, perhaps to his credit, doesn\u2019t really represent a \u201cside.\u201d His ideas \u2014 with their combination of laissez-faire capitalism and harsh moralism \u2014 are fairly marginal. If they\u2019re going to be defended, they should be defended on their own terms, not as representing an important tendency in our civic life. But on their own terms, they are very hard to defend.\n\nEditors can\u2019t escape the fact that, even when they want to broaden the conversation, their choices make a statement about where the parameters of acceptable argument lie. I\u2019d have thought that supporting the execution or mass incarceration of women by the millions would put a writer, even one capable of enjoyably caustic prose, well outside those boundaries. I\u2019d like to hear a serious argument about why it doesn\u2019t.

It\u2019s up to public health professionals and parents to prevent these interactions.\u201d\n\nOver all, about 72 percent of the victims were men, and most were between 35 and 64 years old. The Southeast had the highest number of deaths and the highest death rate, while the Northeast had the lowest.\n\nThe data has some limitations. It does not include fatalities from car crashes with deer and other animals. According to the C.D.C., that results in about 200 deaths a year. And causes of death may have been misclassified because of the limitations of information provided by death certificates.\n\nDr. Forrester emphasized that most deaths are not from encounters with wild animals. Dogs, cattle and horses are much more dangerous. Among non-domestic animals, bees, wasps and hornets present the greatest danger.", "title": "Afraid of Snakes?

He has sung dozens of small comprimario parts \u2014 the character roles of opera \u2014 but also starred in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d and Verdi\u2019s \u201cFalstaff.\u201d Some roles, including Raimondo, the chaplain in Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia di Lammermoor,\u201d he has done at the Met more than anyone else. He was onstage for the first \u201cLive From the Metropolitan Opera\u201d telecast and the company debuts of both Luciano Pavarotti and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who will celebrate his own 50th anniversary next season.\n\nBut on Saturday, after singing what will be his 1,672nd performance at the Met, Mr. Plishka, the ninth most prolific performer in the company\u2019s history, will call it a day.\n\nWhile Mr. Plishka, 76, tried to retire once before, in 2012, it didn\u2019t stick. But he said that this Saturday evening\u2019s revival of \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d \u2014 in which he is singing the small, scene-stealing comic roles of Benoit and Alcindoro \u2014 would really, truly be his last. In a conversation in his dressing room, he reflected on his half-century at the Met. Here are edited excerpts.\n\nNot many people have 50 years under their belts here.\n\nCertain types of voices can pull it off a lot easier. Those really high tenor voices \u2014 once you\u2019re up there, doing all those major tenor roles, it\u2019s hard to come back to Parpignol [a bit part in \u201cBoh\u00e8me\u201d]. But for a bass, there are a lot of roles right up the ladder that get you up to the top, and then there are ones on the way down. For a soprano, you\u2019re either the maid, or you\u2019re Tosca.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs human beings we all deteriorate \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use that word, but our bodies don\u2019t do what they used to do when we were in our 20s. The voice can\u2019t do what it used to do. But at that point, you are able to start to move into this character repertoire, this buffo [comic] repertoire, because you don\u2019t necessarily need this beautiful instrument. You need stagecraft. You need to be a character, to let go and be silly or make a fool of yourself. It added 10, 15 years to my career.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat were some of your favorite roles?\n\nWhen I finally got to do [Verdi\u2019s] \u201cDon Carlo\u201d \u2014 as Philip \u2014 at the Metropolitan Opera, in a televised version, that was the top of the hill. Where else can you go? But then, years later, \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d came along. I had sung Pimen, I had sung Varlaam \u2014 both other bass characters in the opera \u2014 but I had aimed for Boris later on because Boris is a dangerous part for your voice. It\u2019s a great acting part. You don\u2019t even need the great instrument \u2014 you can just act the whole thing. I\u2019m exaggerating, but there\u2019s a lot of truth in it. That was my next top of the hill. Until \u201cFalstaff,\u201d when I would go home at night after doing the role, and by 4 o\u2019clock in the morning I\u2019d miss him. I\u2019d miss being him. This guy just didn\u2019t give a damn what anybody else thought. He gave me a freedom.\n\nWhat were some of the challenges?\n\nI don\u2019t care what any singer tells you, you do not hear yourself. It really helps to have another pair of ears out in the auditorium that can tell you when you\u2019re singing correctly and when you\u2019re not. And I had that in my first wife, and my teacher, Armen Boyajian. I would get into something like Leporello [in Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d], and it doesn\u2019t go high. I t stays kind of low. The more rehearsals you do, it gets darker and darker, and they would come to the final dress and come back after the first act and say, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And I\u2019d know immediately. It\u2019s a trap a bass can fall into very easily: You try to listen to yourself and make it sound good to you, but it\u2019s only going just past the orchestra pit a little bit, and it dies out there. It\u2019s too thick, too woolly a sound. And then, when I would do the second act, I would change it, sing more what sounds to me like a tenor \u2014 very bright, very pointed \u2014 and they\u2019d come back at the end and say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do that in the beginning?\u201d The theater can pick up the sound and it becomes the sounding board, like the body of your cello.

And that uncertainty has reawakened old anxieties about the sincerity of his political promises. His next move on guns will test his relationship with one of the most loyal and powerful elements of his base.\n\nRepublican strategists say that movement in polling for tighter restrictions on gun sales has been notable among Republican voters, a shift that they say is because Mr. Trump has spoken out about it \u2014 he is probably the only major figure who can move Republican voters on an issue.\n\nBut the president\u2019s connection with gun owners and their culture \u2014 which is infused with a sense of mistrust and grievance that he both feeds on and shares \u2014 suggests that he will be loath to betray this group of people he has repeatedly promised, \u201cI will never, ever let you down.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who speaks regularly with the president as the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that he believed what is weighing on Mr. Trump now is \u201cless the N.R.A. than the Trump voter.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for Mr. Trump is that those are often the same thing.\n\nHe is facing pressure from lawmakers in both parties to go further in restricting weapons than the N.R.A. would like.

Gun owners tended to be cut from the same blue-collar cloth that held together Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituency. They gravitated toward his tough talk on defending the Second Amendment in the same way they did on other issues like crime, trade and illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cHe had this connection to people who felt like he cared about them, their well-being, their family, safety and security,\u201d Mr. Bossie added.\n\nIn guns, Mr. Trump found an issue very similar in its emotional pull to immigration. It appealed to voters who believed that Democrats ignored the concerns of people like them and were hostile to their beliefs and culture. It fed a sense that the government was pursuing policies that would ultimately hurt them. And at its most extreme, it fanned the fear that a seemingly unstoppable force was on the verge of snatching away life as they knew it \u2014 their understanding of what it meant to be American.\n\nThese sentiments appealed to Mr. Trump, who has always tended to believe in conspiracies, especially ones hatched to undermine him.\n\nAs simpatico as the relationship appears now, the N.R.A.\u2019s backing of Mr. Trump in May 2016 was not a universally popular move among the membership. First, it was highly unusual. The group typically waited until the general election was well underway before getting involved in a presidential campaign. Second, it irritated many members who felt that the N.R.A. was rushing toward an endorsement before the deep wounds of a bitter Republican primary had healed.\n\nUnlike many social conservatives and evangelical Christians who remained wary of Mr. Trump \u2014 some of them right up until Election Day \u2014 the N.R.A. decided early on that it had too much at stake in the election not to back Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponent, whoever that may be.\n\nEspecially significant for the group was the fact that gun rights were at a tipping point on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the landmark case that held that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep a loaded handgun at home for self-defense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough more than $30 million in spending to support Mr. Trump, the N.R.A.\u2019s political arm turned into a virtual \u201csuper PAC\u201d for him, attacking Mrs. Clinton in the same way Mr. Trump did \u2014 as someone who would leave women vulnerable to attackers in their home by taking away their guns and who botched the response to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nCurrent and former aides to Mr. Trump say that he loved the adoration that N.R.A. crowds would shower on him. After speaking at the group\u2019s annual meeting in Atlanta last year, one person who was with him described him as \u201clevitating\u201d with joy.\n\n\u201cYou came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\nGrover Norquist, the anti-tax activist who is also an N.R.A. board member, said the speech underscored for him that Mr. Trump had a relationship with gun owners unlike that of one he could recall with any other president.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.\n\nBut Spotify\u2019s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.\n\nIn a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept \u2014 like a CD or a download \u2014 but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it\u2019s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.\n\n\u201cIt all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,\u201d Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. \u201cFans wanted all the world\u2019s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy \u2014 for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly \u2014 while operating legally and paying royalties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMusic was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify\u2019s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.\n\nAt first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.\n\nThe free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.\n\nMusic executives involved in Spotify\u2019s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company\u2019s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.\n\nStill, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.\n\nOnce Spotify took hold \u2014 it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks \u2014 record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry\u2019s seasonal ups and downs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.\n\nYet even Spotify\u2019s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,\u201d said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have hits.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSpotify says its mission is to \u201cunlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art.\u201d But its dealings with artists are still delicate. An elite level of superstars like Taylor Swift and Adele have realized that they can still sell millions of CDs if they withhold their music from streaming, at least for a while. (Plenty of other stars, like Ed Sheeran and Drake, have embraced the format fully.)\n\nAnd many who are not household names, from independent musicians to major songwriters, say the complex economics \u2014 each click is worth just a fraction of a penny, to be divided among Spotify, labels, publishers and, finally, artists and songwriters \u2014 make it impossible for anyone other than a pop star to make a living from streaming.\n\n\u201cThe streaming model as it stands now is fundamentally stacked against middle-class artists and emerging artists,\u201d said Blake Morgan, an independent musician and a label owner who has been an outspoken critic of Spotify and Pandora, another streaming service. \u201cNinety percent of the revenue is going to 1 percent of the artists.\u201d\n\nTensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.\n\n\u201cSpotify has to communicate that they are the labels\u2019 No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn\u2019t necessarily include record labels.\u201d\n\nBut can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company\u2019s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cBecoming the world\u2019s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,\u201d Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the company\u2019s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.\n\nStill, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth \u2014 at the expense of profits. Spotify\u2019s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.\n\nMr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle\u2019s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.\n\n\u201cAll the good customers \u2014 even the new customers \u2014 he would give them free samples of the day\u2019s specials,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re having brisket today.\u2019 \u2018Have some coleslaw.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey came back and ordered more.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "The new legislation might do more harm than good, Mr. Litt said. For example, it could stop states from requiring that all credit reports be frozen by default \u2014 an arrangement that would put consumers in control of who gains access to their data. As it stands, consumers must contact each of the three bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 to initiate a freeze. Likewise, they must also contact the bureaus to lift the freeze, which is necessary when applying for a loan or, say, car insurance.\n\nThere are also several states where a freeze blocks not just lenders but also insurers and employers from access to your credit files. \u201cThose states would be overridden because this law would only extend to credit checks\u201d from lenders, Mr. Litt added.\n\nConsumers have little choice but to work with Equifax and its peers. Banks and other financial services firms feed consumers\u2019 personal data to the bureaus, which keep files on more than 200 million people. That data is then crunched to calculate personal credit scores.\n\nThere is no way to opt out of this system. Mortgage providers, credit card companies, mobile phone providers and others won\u2019t do business with you until they check your credit report at one or all of the big bureaus. If you freeze your file, these companies cannot get to it \u2014 and if they cannot get to it, they won\u2019t issue credit. That protects you if thieves obtain your personal information and try to open accounts in your name.\n\nThe Consumer Data Industry Association, the credit bureaus\u2019 trade group, did not oppose the language in the Senate bill. The big bureaus do not break out how much they collect in fees for initiating and lifting credit freezes, the association said.\n\n\u201cConsumers in every state will be protected by a strong federal law under this bill,\u201d Francis Creighton, president and chief executive officer of the association, said in a statement.\n\nBut consumer advocates do not believe it goes far enough. They would like a law that gave regulators \u2014 such as the Federal Trade Commission or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 the power to oversee data security at the big credit bureaus, which could include inspections and penalties for poor practices or digital breaches. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced one such bill this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch an approach would be proactive, rather than the currently reactive way of doing things, said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental premise is you want a regulator to supervise for data security at the credit bureaus and not just, \u2018We can take enforcement action after you messed up,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cThat is a different way of regulating than suing them after they\u2019ve lost everyone\u2019s data.\u201d\n\nAnother bill, introduced by Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, would essentially freeze credit reports by default. Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumers Union, said that bill would \u201cstop identity thieves in their tracks by freezing access to credit files unless the consumer gives their consent.\u201d\n\nThe current bill\u2019s free freeze provision was viewed as a bargaining chip \u2014 a little goody for consumers \u2014 in legislation that would roll back some of the banking regulations that were established after the financial crisis a decade ago. But there was also at least one nugget that would be good for the bureaus: A provision to provide free credit monitoring to active-duty members of the military would strip them of the right to take the agencies to court should something go wrong.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the House will pass the legislation, which means free credit freezes aren\u2019t guaranteed just yet. If the bill does not move ahead, states will be free to consider their own changes. Some states, for example, are considering legislation that would let consumers place a credit freeze at all three agencies by making a request at just one, Ms. Laitin said.\n\n\u201cState lawmakers pioneered credit freeze protection and have been quicker to take action compared to Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be allowed to continue to innovate so that consumers can more easily protect themselves from identity theft fraud.\u201d", "title": "After Equifax Breach, Credit Freeze Provision Comes at a Price", "authors": ["Tara Siegel Bernard"]}

Many commentators considered it a clear echo of the anti-Semitism that has plagued Russia\u2019s history since at least the 19th century.\n\nNachman Shai, an Israeli legislator, called the Russian leader\u2019s remarks a classic example of anti-Semitism. \u201cHis comments show that nothing has changed in viewing the Jews as responsible for all the world\u2019s evil,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis demands a strong reaction from the government of Israel.\u201d\n\nJonathan A.

Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi were joined by the top Democrats on the chambers\u2019 respective judiciary committees, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Jerrold Nadler of New York.\n\n\u201cWhile Putin\u2019s stance is not surprising, it is also simply unacceptable,\u201d they wrote in their letter.\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Mr. Putin\u2019s comment \u201cspeaks to anti-Semitic tropes that have spurred intolerance and ethnic violence for centuries, and it is disturbing that this type of anti-Semitism has seen a recent resurgence among populist, far-right leaders around the world.

Only then did he come out with the line about Ukrainians, Tatars and Jews.\n\nHowever, Mr. Putin\u2019s comment may well have been lost in translation.\n\nSpeaking in Russian to the NBC presenter Megyn Kelly, Mr. Putin spoke of \u201cRusskie,\u201d a term denoting ethnic Russians in opposition to other nationalities living in the country. Many Russian Jews have long self-identified as separate from ethnic Russians \u2014 a source of confusion among Americans who may miss the nuance.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came to America in 1991 and was asked at J.F.K. airport, \u2018Are you Russian?\u2019 I responded \u2018No, sir, I\u2019m Jewish,\u2019\u201d said Boruch Gorin, a senior aide to Russia\u2019s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, who has been supportive of the Russian leader. \u201cPutin\u2019s comments were lost in translation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Gorin noted that the Russian president rarely makes an effort to be politically correct, and in his speeches often intentionally separates ethnic Russians from the country\u2019s minorities. Mr. Putin is clued up on political sensitivities in the West, and often seems to delight in skirting right along the edge of what is acceptable to Western audiences.\n\nFor instance, knowing that gay rights is an important issue in the West but is viewed with broad distaste at home, Mr. Putin in 2004 made a dig that appeared to combine that distaste with an equal widespread aversion to popular uprisings.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the post-Soviet space, what concerns me are attempts to resolve political questions through extralegal means,\u201d he said at a news conference as a series of mass uprisings was sweeping the post-Soviet space. \u201cThe creation of a system of permanent revolutions, whether they be pink, or light blue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin flatly denied Kremlin involvement in the 2016 election interference in his interview with NBC.\n\n\u201cWhy have you decided the Russian authorities, myself included, gave anybody permission to do this?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe also said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if Russians had attempted to meddle in the election and said he would never extradite those charged to the United States to stand trial.\n\nThe issue is a fraught one for Mr. Trump. He has repeatedly called Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and views American conclusions about Russian meddling as a threat to his legitimacy as president. Democrats and some Republicans have blasted him for not responding to the Russian effort more aggressively.\n\nMr. Trump said last year that Mr. Putin had assured him the Russians did not interfere in the campaign. \u201cI really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 letter also sounds an alarm about this year\u2019s midterm elections, warning that despite Mr. Putin\u2019s claims, Russian efforts are ongoing and must be taken seriously before November.\n\n\u201cIt is extraordinary and confounding how little your administration is doing to counter Putin\u2019s campaign to undermine our grand democracy,\u201d the Democrats wrote.", "title": "After Putin Cites Jews, Democrats Implore Trump to Extradite Russians", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Matthew Luxmoore"]}

We had a special relationship, and the fans appreciated the way we played. We would show emotion, and they would show emotion back.\u201d\n\nThat was not always true in Kansas City, where hopelessness had sometimes reigned. In 1999, thousands of fans walked out of Kauffman Stadium in the middle of a game against the Yankees, protesting baseball\u2019s tilted salary structure. Some littered the field with fake $100 bills.\n\nThe Royals lost 97 games that season, just another in a sad string of gloom. Moore arrived in 2006 and finally hit on the winning formula for a team with a modest payroll and a spacious park: contact hitters, slick defenders, dominant relievers and short-term No. 1 starters acquired for prospects.\n\nIt was always supposed to be temporary. That is how it works in modern baseball, and why teams scramble to align their top prospects\u2019 peak seasons. If a bunch of young players mature at the same time, the team will probably get a few years of prime performance at affordable rates. When the players then get too expensive, most of them disperse.\n\nThe Royals have kept some of their core players; left fielder Alex Gordon is signed through 2019, and starter Danny Duffy and catcher Salvador Perez through 2021. Duffy, who earns $14 million this season, wanted more players to join them.\n\n\u201cI was hoping if one guy comes back, or two guys come back, maybe it\u2019ll spark another guy to take that and run with it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the majority of guys I came up with are in other jerseys or unsigned. It\u2019s tough to see those guys go, but that\u2019s the nature of the beast. You definitely wish them well.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCain spends his off-seasons in Norman, Okla., and attended the Oklahoma City Thunder game last winter when Kevin Durant returned as a member of the Golden State Warriors.

Kind of tough to see, but that\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n\nYet when Cain returns to Kansas City with the Brewers next month, he does not expect the same treatment. Some Royals fans in Arizona have already wished Cain and Hosmer well. Cain called Royals fans \u201cthe best fans in the world, for sure,\u201d and no one around the team believes the players tarnished their legacy by leaving.\n\n\u201cThey did so much for the game of baseball in Kansas City,\u201d said Gordon, who grew up in Nebraska and went to Royals games every summer. \u201cThey were a part of changing the culture. Guys are going to come and go, and it\u2019s not always their decision; it\u2019s just how it is. But for what they did in Kansas City, the Royals fans are always going to be grateful.\u201d\n\nWinning a championship does not guarantee a player a lifelong glow; Boston fans never forgave Johnny Damon for signing with the hated Yankees. But Hosmer and Cain left the American League and joined teams not known for spending.\n\nNeither the Padres nor the Brewers had ever given such a lucrative contract in free agency. Neither team has won a championship, either \u2014 and, incredibly, Hosmer and Cain are the only players on either team\u2019s 40-man roster who have ever played in the World Series. For both, setting an example is part of their job description.\n\nCain said that when Shields came to Kansas City from Tampa Bay, a regular playoff contender, \u201che showed us how to lead \u2014 and once he left, we all became leaders.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In doing so, they sped up their competitive timetable. They agreed on Cain\u2019s contract within hours of another bold move: a trade with Miami for Christian Yelich, a 26-year-old outfielder under contract for five more seasons.\n\nThe deals created a bit of a logjam for the Brewers, who also have Domingo Santana, who hit 30 homers last season, and the franchise pillar Ryan Braun in the outfield. The Brewers hope to find time for all the outfielders by sometimes using Braun at first base, where he could spell the slugging Eric Thames against some left-handers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really have any say over where you get traded, but I\u2019m excited to be here,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cTo be a part of an outfield with those guys, it\u2019s going to be special. It\u2019s exciting to go into the season expecting to win, hopefully for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Padres also added multiple veterans to their lineup, trading with Philadelphia for shortstop Freddy Galvis and with the Yankees for third baseman Chase Headley. San Diego has endured nine losing seasons in the last 10 years, but has hope in a slogan on Hosmer\u2019s clubhouse T-shirt.\n\nOn the front, beneath a Padres logo, it says \u201c#HotTalentLava,\u201d with \u201c= Major League Rock\u201d on the back. Scott Boras, Hosmer\u2019s agent, used those terms to describe the Padres\u2019 percolating farm system, which MLB.com ranks as the best in baseball. For Hosmer, it is a familiar feeling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many similarities to what I was a part of in Kansas City, as far as a group of prospects coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun. It\u2019s one thing to hear about all the guys, but now to finally get out on the field and see what these guys are about, it gets you fired up.\u201d\n\nMoore could have left Kansas City, too, if he had pushed the Royals\u2019 owner, David Glass, to allow him to interview for the Atlanta Braves\u2019 general manager job last fall. Before joining the Royals, Moore had spent 12 years with the Braves, who now have a thriving farm system and seem much closer to contending.\n\nYet Moore was content to leave the decision to Glass, who did not want to lose his team\u2019s architect. Moore\u2019s passion for the job has never waned, he said, even as he starts over.\n\n\u201cEvery team is special, regardless of the win-loss record,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you are leading in a relentless and focused way, it becomes exhausting, it becomes tiring, but that\u2019s the privilege of leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Royals had hoped to retain Hosmer as their leader in the clubhouse. But the Padres made a richer offer, and even if Hosmer had returned, the Royals still probably would have struggled. Their rotation was woeful last season, and Moore has been forced to chisel talent from the bullpen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo entice teams to take expensive veterans off his payroll, Moore had to trade Scott Alexander and Ryan Buchter, relievers who are young, effective and cheap. Alexander went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way deal that sent reliever Joakim Soria to the Chicago White Sox, and Oakland took outfielder Brandon Moss \u2014 who has since been cut \u2014 as a way to get Buchter.\n\nThose deals saved the Royals $14 million, and they replaced Hosmer by giving a one-year, $3.5 million contract to Lucas Duda, the former Mets first baseman whose errant throw in Game 5 of the 2015 World Series allowed Hosmer to score the tying run in the ninth inning.\n\nThat sequence is etched in Royals lore. After Cain took a full-count slider to draw a leadoff walk against Matt Harvey, he stole second and scored on a double by Hosmer. Moustakas moved Hosmer to third with a groundout, and Perez bounced a ball to third baseman David Wright, who threw to Duda for the out at first. Hosmer charged home, knowing that both Wright and Duda had erratic throwing arms.\n\nWith a good throw by Duda, the Mets would have won the game. But Hosmer\u2019s gamble paid off, embodying the will and urgency of a team that never cared about the odds. The Royals finished the night as champions, and their flag \u2014 planted by Hosmer, Cain and so many others in a proud alumni club \u2014 will always fly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re forever a part of Royals history,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe want all of our players, if they leave, to leave on a white horse.\u201d", "title": "After Reviving the Royals, Hosmer and Cain Try to Spark Other Teams", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner", "On Baseball"]}

He is now based in Washington, where he learns details about little-known episodes in Xinjiang by calling police stations and demanding answers from local officers.\n\nIn 2014, his three brothers were arrested, apparently in retaliation for his reporting. One brother, Tudaxun Hoshur, is serving a five-year sentence for endangering state security. Rexim Hoshur and Shawket Hoshur, who were released in 2015, were detained again in September and are being held at a re-education camp.\n\nMr. Hoshur has said he would not quit, despite the pressure, because so many people had taken great risks to pass along information from Xinjiang. \u201cI cannot leave,\u201d he told The New York Times in a 2015 interview at Radio Free Asia headquarters in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Hoja said in a statement posted online that her brother Kaisar Keyum, 43, had been detained in October, and that she had not been able to reach her parents, who are in their 70s, since late January.\n\nA relative of Ms. Hoja\u2019s in West Virginia told her that she had been warned against staying in contact with her. \u201cI am the reason that around 20 of my relatives were arrested by the Chinese police,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMr. Juma said his brothers Ahmetjan Juma and Abduqadir Juma had been detained in May.

Whatever you find out, let me know.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like a mystery. It turned out, though, that most of the geese \u2014 there were from eight to more than a dozen of them, according to people here \u2014 died during the baseball off-season, a team spokesman said. They had not been reproducing lately, because of age or predation, and the two that had survived were moved to a wildlife refuge, the spokesman said. (Also sent away were some opossums, which had been trapped.)\n\nThe move was made quietly enough that the woman responsible for introducing the geese to Steinbrenner Field \u2014 Terry Jenkins, a risk manager for the team who retired two years ago \u2014 learned of it from a reporter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised somebody didn\u2019t let me know,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they still have the pond, it\u2019s a disservice not to have them there.

The Embden geese laid dozens of eggs each season, but the eggs and goslings were easy prey for turtles that live in the pond. Opossums, raccoons, feral cats and hawks also made meals of the eggs.\n\nRetention ponds and thick grasses on some of the property\u2019s perimeter allow the Steinbrenner Field complex, built on swampland, to maintain remnants of that ecosystem. Two years ago, a raccoon that had climbed to the top of the screen behind home plate set off a pursuit by workers after it was knocked from its perch. It scrambled throughout the stadium before leaping from the top row to the plaza below.\n\nAs welcoming a sight as the geese might have been, they were not always easy to manage.\n\nGroundskeepers fed them grain, but the grass that lined the pond required more frequent resodding or reseeding, and their excrement needed to be removed.

The spokesman did not want to name the refuge because it was private, but he offered a clue: It was in Keystone, an unincorporated area north of Tampa.\n\nA (domestic) goose chase ensued.\n\nA call to a government agency turned up Wildlife Haven Rehab, where Brenda Baughman said she did not have any geese but had heard that another facility \u2014 Odessa Wildlife Rescue and Sanctuary, just down the road \u2014 took in some from the Yankees.\n\nA visit to the address provided promise. Nobody answered the bell at the walled property, but a peek inside revealed a zebra, a peacock, turtles and roosters. And then there they were: the white geese.\n\nAnother call was made.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nTHE LOST GIRLS OF CAMP FOREVERMORE\n\nBy Kim Fu\n\n249 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $23.\n\nBefore embarking on an overnight kayaking trip, five girls at a camp in the Pacific Northwest sing, \u201cAnd I shall love my sisters / for-ev-er-more.\u201d The camp promises a vision of wholesome sisterhood that seems unaware of the complexities of young girls\u2019 lives, a vision Kim Fu skillfully complicates in her new novel, \u201cThe Lost Girls of Camp Forevermore.\u201d\n\nThe girls are led by a veteran counselor whose decision to change their camping destination foreshadows the tragedy to come. Though Fu relates the girls\u2019 dramatic efforts to rescue themselves, her focus is on the aftermath of the trip. Siobhan Dougherty, who yearns to be \u201cmore like the heroines of the books she liked,\u201d wonders, of her fellow campers: \u201cWho would they become? What would they get to do and see? Who would they love?\u201d\n\nThe novel alternates between short chapters about the camping trip, which takes place in 1994, and longer, character-driven chapters about the girls\u2019 lives post-Forevermore. The result is a multilayered exploration of how class and culture inform the girls\u2019 actions and alliances during the trip, and how the trip then affects their relationships and choices in adulthood. Fu, the author of the novel \u201cFor Today I Am a Boy,\u201d is a propulsive storyteller, using clear and cutting prose to move seamlessly through time.\n\nBefore Forevermore, Isabel Wen had a \u201chappy child\u2019s narcissism, a solid belief her parents would return in the evening.\u201d For Andee Allen, a scholarship recipient with \u201cferocity in her eyes,\u201d Forevermore barely registers on her list of childhood traumas. Nita Prithi, who bullies Siobhan, is called a genius by her teachers and excels at school, but is socially awkward. Dina Chang, who dreams of being a movie star, remembers Forevermore as \u201cpurely sadistic torture, a punishment for nothing she could recall.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges to depicting so many characters in so relatively few pages. Siobhan, whose point of view shapes all the 1994 chapters, is most clearly rendered as a child. Andee\u2019s chapter is told from the perspective of her younger sister, Kayla, to whom Andee serves as a surrogate mother after their parents abandon them. While it\u2019s interesting to see the resilient, capable Andee through Kayla\u2019s eyes, Andee\u2019s interior life remains at a frustrating remove.\n\nIsabel and Dina, two Chinese-Canadian girls from the Vancouver suburbs, are the most fascinating and intricately drawn. They\u2019re the only campers who have contact with each other after Forevermore, and are brought closer when Isabel takes a college class with Dina\u2019s brother.\n\nFu\u2019s strongest writing is about Isabel, who, when rejected by a high school crush, \u201cfelt, for the first time, how ordinary she was. Saw in a flash of intuition the ordinary life before her, the ordinary, banal adulthood. \u2026 Her life in the audience.\u201d In college, Isabel dresses in \u201caggressively dowdy clothing,\u201d unlike her roommates, who are \u201cbetter at keeping whatever private darkness they carried to themselves.\u201d An encounter with an Asian fetishist is chilling: \u201cShe lay there, mute, convinced she was inflicting this violence on herself.\u201d Dina\u2019s obsession with beauty makes her feel sorry for Isabel, who she feels has settled for \u201ca dreamless existence so early in life.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a gesture toward catharsis when Isabel and Dina reconnect, but Fu smartly resists sentimentality. The adult Siobhan, a researcher in child psychology, studies children knowing what \u201cthey were truly capable of.\u201d In the one-way glass of the novel, we watch the girls of Forevermore from a series of angles, in all their private anguishes. We lean closer, unable to turn away.", "title": "After a Camping Trip, Five Girls\u2019 Lives Are No Longer the Same", "authors": ["Lisa Ko", "Kim Fu"]}

During a game in December, he ducked in and out of a treatment tent in a matter of seconds after he was sent there for a concussion evaluation. The Seahawks were hit with a $100,000 fine for evading the protocol. Wilson was also criticized in 2015 for suggesting that a brand of fortified water, in which he had invested, had helped to prevent a concussion during a playoff game.\n\nWhile baseball is not the contact sport that football is, the Yankees still are no strangers to head injuries. Catcher Austin Romine was sidelined with a concussion in 2013, as was infielder Stephen Drew in 2015.\n\nAnd last season, Jacoby Ellsbury missed a month with a concussion after crashing into the center-field wall at Yankee Stadium to make a catch. Ellsbury was allowed to remain in the game to finish the inning.\n\nFrazier\u2019s first collision Saturday came when he made a leaping catch in the first inning before falling and hitting the back of his head on the outfield wall. But his injury may have been the result of a second, lesser collision he had with the wall several innings later. His head did not hit the wall, but his shoulder did, leaving Frazier to wonder if the second collision was jarring enough to exacerbate the first.\n\nFrazier was not evaluated on the field, but was checked out when he returned to the dugout at the end of the first inning.\n\n\u201cI made it through the game and felt fine,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was frightening afterward. That\u2019s why you have to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nStill, Frazier admitted to feeling conflicted.

It calls for the game to be stopped and a player to be evaluated by a certified athletic trainer if there is an incident with a \u201chigh risk of concussion.\u201d\n\nManager Aaron Boone said there was some thought to removing Frazier from the game at the end of the first inning, but tests did not show any symptoms.\n\n\u201cI think we were comfortable with how we checked him out and checked in on him,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything in the immediate right there to suggest getting him out of the game.\u201d\n\nWhen the Yankees returned from Bradenton, Fla., after the game, Frazier\u2019s head began to hurt and he began to feel nauseated. He notified a trainer, who put him through a battery of tests: balancing on each foot with his eyes closed, looking at lights, reciting the months backward, remembering five words they told him at the beginning.\n\n\u201cI passed all that,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cIt was just the headaches.\u201d\n\nHe did not feel any better on Sunday or Monday. When Frazier arrives at the clubhouse each day, he typically eats three scrambled eggs with cheese, three pancakes and hash browns. In recent days, he barely touched his food. When he went outside, the sunlight was blinding.\n\nFrazier said the first time he was told he had a concussion was on Monday, when he was sent by the Yankees to a doctor outside the organization.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Tuesday, Frazier rode an exercise bike for 11 minutes to build his heart rate up. He felt O.K., so he then went to the batting cage to take some swings in a soft-toss drill, but he became dizzy tracking the flight of the ball.\n\nWhen he arrived at Steinbrenner Field on Wednesday morning, he did not feel any better. He sat at his locker with his forehead throbbing, comparing it to a migraine.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even sit in my living room without feeling like\u201d rubbish, Frazier said, using an expletive. \u201cI can\u2019t shake the headache all day.\u201d\n\nBut then he began to drink water. He felt well enough to ride the exercise bike again and take some more swings in the cage.\n\nHe reported afterward that his head remained clear.

If successful, his likely Republican opponent in the general election will be Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive with ties to former Gov. Chris Christie. Mr. Hugin\u2019s ability to tap his fortune to finance his campaign could make the contest expensive and possibly more competitive than expected.\n\nThe race could also turn nasty. At the rally, members of the state Republican Party handed out Monopoly-like cards with Mr. Menendez\u2019s face on a cartoon prisoner and a photo of Mr. Menendez and Mr. Melgen vacationing together.\n\nIf Mr. Menendez\u2019s corruption trial dampened enthusiasm among Democrats it could spell trouble for other Democratic candidates in November. Democrats across the country are looking to House races in New Jersey as opportunities to pick up seats as they seek to wrest control from Republicans, but Democrats in those races will need a strong turnout to stand a chance.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Menendez has a keen understanding of local politics, having climbed nearly every rung on the political ladder, from school board member to mayor to state senator to congressman to United States senator, a position he assumed in 2005, when he was appointed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine.\n\nHe has been re-elected twice, in 2006 and 2012, and has been a prolific fund-raiser, having raised $17 million for his 2012 re-election, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nMr. Menendez on Wednesday referred to his roots and a career that started in this city\u2019s school district as evidence of an American dream fulfilled.\n\n\u201cThat is the promise of America,\u201d he said, offering a subtle dig at Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cThat is the American dream.

He took over as president in 2000, after a decade in which Russia was devastated by financial crisis, twice. With his country\u2019s back against the wall, Mr. Putin in his early years pushed major economic reforms, including a simple flat tax and opening Russia to the world. His stated goal was to make Russia feel like any other European country. By the end of the decade, boosted by soaring oil prices, Russian per capita income had more than quintupled to over $11,000.\n\nThen, as so often happens to even the best reformers, success made Mr. Putin complacent if not arrogant. By 2010 Russia was a middle-income country, and to make the next step in development it needed to reduce its reliance on oil, which had provided $1.5 trillion in revenue over the previous decade. And it needed dynamic new private companies to replace the doddering state-owned oil and gas giants that still dominated the economy.\n\nInstead, the economic reformer of the early 2000s gave way to Putin the hyper-nationalist, stirring fears of a new Cold War. He is now widely seen as a geopolitical provocateur who has dispatched disguised soldiers to invade Ukraine and internet trolls to disrupt American and European elections, and who this month boasted of a new intercontinental missile capable of piercing Western air defenses \u201clike a meteorite.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Aggressive Abroad, Putin Is Cautious at Home", "authors": []}

As for her admission of being intoxicated during the encounter, legal experts said that it could cut both ways if the case goes to trial. On the one hand, the image of police detectives taking advantage of a young woman under the influence of drugs might build sympathy for her with a jury; on the other, her condition could easily be used during cross-examination to sow doubts about her story.\n\nThe woman\u2019s lawyer, Michael David, said the motion focused on minutiae, not the issues at the heart of the case. \u201cThey brutally raped her,\u201d Mr. David added. \u201cNow they\u2019re attacking her for points on the periphery.\u201d\n\nMuch of the filing\u2019s angry language was directed at the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, which, defense lawyers said, improperly suggested to the grand jury that the woman was a credible witness even though prosecutors knew she had altered her account several times.

It said airstrikes and shelling had caused at least 80 casualties, pushing the death toll over the past two weeks to 745, including 172 children.\n\nThe casualties on Monday reportedly included 12 victims of an attack with chlorine gas on the Hamourieh area of eastern Ghouta. Syrian state television dismissed the claims as a \u201cchlorine play\u201d by terrorist groups trying to provide Western countries a pretext to attack Syria.\n\nSyrian state media said seven people were injured on Monday morning in a mortar attack on a military hospital in Damascus by fighters holed up in eastern Ghouta who belong to the Nusra Front, a group affiliated with Al Qaeda, and their allies.\n\nThe Human Rights Council condemned abuses by all parties, but focused particularly on the intensive bombardment by Syrian government forces and their allies, including alleged use of chemical weapons. Those responsible for the offensive should be held to account, it said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe council\u2019s resolution represented deepening international frustration and indignation at the assault on eastern Ghouta by the government and its allies, including Russia. The offensive is one of the most ferocious in Syria\u2019s seven-year civil war, despite a Feb. 24 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a 30-day cease-fire and immediate access for humanitarian agencies. There are suspicions that the government once again used chemical weapons, in the face of international condemnation.\n\nSyria\u2019s state news agency, Sana, said on Monday that advancing government troops had taken control of around one-third of eastern Ghouta, after capturing farmland and several villages in the east of the enclave, and the towns of Utaya, Al Shifouniyah and Al Nashabiyah.\n\nLoopholes in the Security Council resolution allowed for military operations to continue against terrorist groups.

World Health Organization officials reported the items removed included all the trauma kits, surgical supplies, dialysis equipment and insulin.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd while the convoy brought medical staff into Douma, relief agency officials said there were no plans to bring any sick or injured patients out of eastern Ghouta.

As budget negotiations \u2014 which are conducted behind closed doors among the governor and three top legislative leaders, out of sight of even other lawmakers \u2014 unfolded over the past week, it became increasingly clear that the Legislature would punt policy issues such as gun control or bail reform to after the budget\u2019s April 1 deadline, in favor of financial considerations.\n\nRepublicans in the State Senate had fought hard against any new taxes and fees and were able to claim a win on that account, as well as on many deferred social policies.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, the spending plan had much to celebrate for the governor, coming in on time amid a $4 billion state deficit and the prospect of additional federal cuts. The Legislature began passing the key bills late Friday and into Saturday morning, before the looming deadline on a holiday weekend..\n\nInside the budget deal are some critical practical \u2014 and political \u2014 demands from Mr. Cuomo.\n\nTax experts had viewed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposed workarounds with skepticism, warning that many of the ideas were purely academic and had never been tried in practice. Others worried that the payroll tax workaround would be unpopular with New Yorkers, as it would result in lower gross pay, even if their take-home pay would ultimately remain the same.\n\nStill, the new tax policies \u2014 while limited \u2014 will allow the governor a credible argument that he is fighting for New York in the face of the White House and Republicans in Washington.\n\nThe governor also secured $250 million in new funding for the troubled New York City Housing Authority, making good on a promise he had loudly and repeatedly declared over the past few weeks. After three visits to public housing projects, he vowed not to sign the budget unless it included a \u201creal remedy\u201d for repairs at Nycha, where residents have faulted Mr. Cuomo\u2019s intraparty rival, Mayor Bill de Blasio, for deteriorating conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn an issue of vital local importance, the budget also includes $26.7 billion in school funding \u2014 a higher figure than either Mr. Cuomo or the Republican-controlled Senate had proposed in their own preliminary budgets.\n\nMr. Cuomo is facing particular pressure to burnish his progressive credentials: The actress and education advocate Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging him for the Democratic nomination for governor, has blasted him for what she called his \u201cmassive disinvestment\u201d in schools and in other areas that affect black and Hispanic residents.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the policies still drew criticism, with some women\u2019s rights advocates and employment lawyers calling their scope too narrow.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother policy agreement would ease state oversight of yeshivas, despite concerns among education advocates that the schools for ultra-Orthodox Jews, which offer both secular and religious education, leave their students with poor to nonexistent English and math skills.\n\nAssembly Democrats, who opposed easing state control, had cast the issue as the only one holding up a budget deal. The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, on Friday morning accused Senator Simcha Felder, who represents a large Orthodox Jewish constituency in Brooklyn, of essentially holding the negotiations hostage. Mr. Felder, a Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans and therefore allows them to sit in the majority in the Senate, often wields disproportionate influence in the Legislature.\n\nThe final compromise allowed for yeshivas, and other nonpublic schools, to argue that long hours of instruction \u2014 no matter the topic \u2014 could be used to satisfy state educational requirements.\n\nAssembly Democrats, meanwhile, had secured the governor\u2019s promise of another commission to consider a possible pay raise, a longstanding issue of contention for lawmakers who have not had a raise in nearly two decades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHopes for a congestion pricing plan, which has long been floated as a possible source of long-term funding for the sputtering subway system, were largely dashed. While Mr. Cuomo had commissioned a task force to develop a framework for charging cars that drive into the busiest parts of Manhattan, Friday\u2019s budget deal included only the first phase: a $2.75 fee on for-hire vehicles and a $2.50 fee on yellow cabs below 96th Street.\n\nLawmakers may still address issues that were left out of the budget, such as new protections for victims of childhood sexual abuse, during the remainder of the session, which runs through June. But the budget process is often regarded as the time of maximum urgency and leverage, when the continued operation of state government \u2014 and legislators\u2019 continued paychecks \u2014 hang in the balance.\n\nStill, Mr. Cuomo defended introducing even those social or policy measures that failed to gain traction during the budget process \u2014 including any major ethics changes, despite the recent conviction of his former friend and aide, Joseph Percoco, on federal corruption charges \u2014 saying he wanted to \u201cstart the conversation\u201d on things like early voting.\n\nThe pressures of an election year, when officials are wary of alienating key lobbyists and constituencies and seek to balance fiscal responsibility with flashy campaign promises, may also soon be brought to bear.\n\nA special election in April is also looming, which could allow Democrats in the Senate \u2014 where Republicans rule thanks to a collaboration with Mr. Felder and a group of eight rogue Democrats \u2014 to take a numerical majority. Mr. Cuomo has said in the past that he would work to unify Democrats to rule the Senate.\n\nBut on Friday night, he demurred on that promise, too, until after the Senate votes on the budget.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk politics after the votes are taken tonight,\u201d he said.", "title": "Albany Strikes Budget Deal That Sidesteps Trump\u2019s Tax Plan", "authors": ["Vivian Wang", "Jesse Mckinley"]}

Mr. Felder has been pressured to rejoin the Democrats, but has said that his decision to do so could come down to which party supports his efforts to get armed police officers in schools.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Of course, it makes sense to mandate vaccination for measles; the disease can be deadly and its vaccine is lifesaving. In the 1950s, before vaccination became available, there were at least 319,000 infections and 345 deaths from measles each year. More recently there was a measles outbreak at Disneyland in 2014. The 667 cases of measles in the United States that year occurred largely because of anti-vaxxers. Fortunately, no one died. Indeed, in the past 15 years there has been only one confirmed death from measles in the entire country. The Disneyland episode propelled states to change their laws to make it much harder for parents to refuse vaccinations for their children.\n\nPartly as a result, today the flu is much more dangerous than measles. Indeed, every year since 2004 there have been a minimum of 37, and as many as 171, pediatric deaths from the flu. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists flu and pneumonia as the eighth leading causes of death in the United States, immediately after diabetes.\n\nSo why do we mandate the measles vaccine but not the flu vaccine? Perhaps because the flu vaccine must be given every year and is sometimes, like this year, not that effective. However, this is all the more reason to impose a mandate.\n\nThe relationship between the effectiveness of the vaccine, the number of people who need to be treated and herd immunity is complex \u2014 and perhaps counterintuitive. The less effective a vaccine is, the more people you need to treat to produce herd immunity. For instance, if the vaccine is 80 percent effective, then vaccinating just 25 percent of the population provides effective herd immunity. But if the vaccine is only 30 percent effective \u2014 just short of this year\u2019s level \u2014 around 70 percent of the population must be vaccinated.\n\nOf course, some Americans hate government mandates, even when they are demonstrably beneficial. Rand Paul \u2014 a physician, no less \u2014 argued that mandatory vaccination is a violation of individual rights, claiming, \u201cthe state doesn\u2019t own your children.\u201d He called it \u201can issue of freedom.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | All Children Should Have to Get the Flu Shot", "authors": []}

If your friend has a common cold, she will be infectious for about three days after the onset of symptoms. If she has the flu, she will be infectious for about a week.\n\nThe best data we have on the infectivity of upper respiratory infections comes from volunteer studies, in which healthy individuals volunteer to be infected with viruses like influenza, the cause of flu, or rhinovirus, the most frequent cause of the common cold. Understandably, the number of such studies is small.\n\nThose studies show that symptoms are an undependable marker of infectivity. A more reliable guide is the natural course of infection, which can be divided into three phases: incubation (infectious without symptoms), symptomatic/infectious, and recovery (noninfectious with symptoms).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe incubation phase lasts about a day for influenza and may be just a few hours for the common cold. During this time, someone can spread infection, but because there are no telltale symptoms, there is little we can do to protect ourselves. We shake hands, spend time together in enclosed spaces, and do all manner of things that unwittingly increase the risk for disease transmission.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She is still growing, and she is definitely not ready to play a full schedule and at age 16. She is not allowed to play a full schedule. So we are trying to do more quality than quantity.\u201d\n\nHandling precocious success is a longstanding tennis conundrum, even if prodigies no longer dominate the women\u2019s game in their teens like they used to. Playing restrictions, designed to protect them, have kept prospects in their midteens from racking up too many ranking points. The game is now more physical, favoring more mature players, and also has become more team-oriented, favoring those who can afford a large support staff.\n\nAnisimova, the youngest player in the top 150 of the global rankings, is at no disadvantage in that last department, and the entourage also includes her Chihuahua Miley, who gets the star treatment but has also created the occasional travel problem.\n\n\u201cOnce we went to Hawaii, and my mom flew for six hours to California and she didn\u2019t know about the quarantine rules for Hawaii,\u201d Anisimova said. \u201cSo she had to fly back home another six hours with Miley.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThough Anisimova has been a champion-in-training for much of her young life and has been home-schooled from the beginning, her parents, both immigrants from Russia, have shown restraint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe latest example: Anisimova could have entered qualifying for the Australian Open this year, but she and her family chose to remain in the United States, working on her fitness and refining her game in an extended off-season.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make such a long trip, especially because I didn\u2019t get into the main draw of the Australian Open,\u201d Anisimova said. \u201cSo I decided to skip that one and have a real off-season.

He flunked the Foreign Service examination twice but was paid $30,000 for trying. He was then paid $40,000 more to apply to the C.I.A.\u2019s clandestine service. By then, the Americans were on to him.

But later, it turned out, she had affairs with two top F.B.I. counterintelligence agents in California, James J. Smith and William Cleveland Jr., and became a double agent for some 18 years, starting in 1984.\n\nMs. Leung was accused of feeding F.B.I. secrets to the highest level of the Ministry of State Security after filching them from Mr. Smith\u2019s briefcase. She was in jail or under house arrest for 21 months before accepting a plea deal that punished her with probation, community service and a fine.", "title": "Opinion | America\u2019s Other Espionage Challenge: China", "authors": []}

Polls in recent days have shown Democrats with around a 9-point average lead on the generic congressional ballot, which asks Americans which party they\u2019ll vote for in the coming election. Under ordinary conditions, a lead that size would be more than enough to net the 24 seats Democrats need to regain a majority.\n\nBut a big reality check is in order. Even the strongest blue wave may crash up against a powerful structural force in American politics: extreme gerrymandering. Pending court cases, including one scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on Wednesday (in which our organization filed an amicus brief), may change the terrain going forward. But no matter how the high court rules, its decision will almost certainly come too late to affect the 2018 vote.\n\nThat means most Americans will participate in this year\u2019s elections under gerrymandered congressional maps that were created in the wake of the 2010 Tea Party wave.

The bigger story may be the tech features and the improved dynamics from a new chassis that trims weight. There will, of course, be E-tron design studies from previous auto shows to examine, the line of Q5 and Q7 S.U.V.s, and the RS and R8 sports machines.\n\nPhoto\n\nBMW\n\nThe Bavarians will arrive in Geneva with a full complement of 5 Series and 7 Series sedans as well X Series S.U.V.s, M cars and i models. BMW is expected to have several surprises, but much of the attention will be lavished on the world premiere of the second-generation X4, the coupelike utility vehicle that gives away some practicality for fashion. Speculation, and anticipation, run high that a further development of the Z4 Concept, seen last summer at the Pebble Beach concours, will be unveiled. The show will also be a first opportunity for most mortals to see the Roadster version of the i8.\n\nFerrari\n\nOn the streets of a wealth center like Geneva, Ferraris are simply special, not especially rare. But their mystique elicits envious glances, so models like the 812 Superfast and Portofino (which replaces the California) can be expected to be at the center of a swarm of admirers, while more practical-minded oligarchs might flock to the GTC4Lusso. Still, it will be the new 488 Pista, pushed past 210 miles per hour by its 710-horsepower V8, that\u2019s surrounded by the fantasy-league racers.\n\nFord\n\nMass-market models will be the emphasis of Ford\u2019s display, including a Euro-edition of the new Edge, the new Ka+ Active and a sizable offering of updated models, including the Mustang. Show visitors may be walking right past all of those cars, though, on their way to the GT supercar, which will be shown in road and racing configurations.\n\nHonda\n\nThe latest Honda CR-V, which will be available as a hybrid, will share floor space with three concepts, the Urban EV, Sports EV and NeuV EV. They are worth a close look because Honda has committed to delivering a fully electric production model in 2019, and one of these may well be the basis for that E.V. There\u2019s some fast and noisy fun from Honda, too. The Civic Type R TCR, destined for the touring car racing series, will be showcased, as will the NSX GT3. Finally, a rugged edition of the Jazz (known as the Fit in the United States) will be introduced under the X-Road label.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHyundai\n\nThe all-hands presence of Hyundai in Geneva is a telling sign of the South Korean automaker\u2019s continuing ambitions. Several world premieres are on the automaker\u2019s schedule, the most important of which is the fourth-generation Santa Fe crossover. Hyundai\u2019s intentions to expand its market footprint may be more evident in the Kona subcompact crossover, which gets a fully electric version with a not-to-be-ignored 290-mile range. For anyone who\u2019s still not taking the company\u2019s green theme seriously, the Nexo fuel-cell vehicle could seal the deal. It\u2019s built on a new platform specifically engineered for zero-emissions hydrogen power. The Hyundai exhibit also offers an Internet of Things cockpit display and a technical breakdown of fuel-cell operation.\n\nPhoto\n\nJaguar\n\nThe reason it seems that years have passed since we first heard about an all-electric crossover from Jaguar is because it has been years. Revealed as a design study at the Los Angeles auto show in 2016, the I-394, a likely competitor for the Tesla Model X, makes its production debut, and goes on sale, just before the show opens. Built in Austria on a dedicated aluminum-intensive chassis with a twin-motor 394-horsepower drive system, the I-Pace will have a range of 240 miles. But while crowds cluster around that shiny new object, savvy show visitors can be taking in the delicious XJ sedan, F-Type sports car and F-Pace S.U.V.\n\nJeep\n\nAs the genuinely international brand of the Fiat Chrysler combine, Jeep continues to be a sales hit in markets well outside its American homeland. The Palexpo center will have samples of the Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Compass, and the new Wrangler.\n\nLamborghini\n\nThe Italian sports car specialist rarely resists bringing some new variation of an existing model to a showcase like Geneva, but the main attraction will be the 641-horsepower Urus, which the company calls a super sport utility vehicle (a slippery slope in nomenclature, to be sure). The 190-mile-an-hour Urus will be prowling city streets, but probably very few mountain trails, later this year.\n\nPhoto\n\nLand Rover\n\nThe days when a Range Rover represented the most elite of all S.U.V.s faded when the likes of Bentley and Lamborghini entered that market. So Land Rover will be showing a new model at the top of its line: the two-door Range Rover SV Coupe, to be built in a limited run of 999. The original Range Rover arrived as a two-door model, so this hyperluxurious new model, which seats four, will serve as a fitting tribute to the company\u2019s tradition.\n\nPhoto\n\nLexus\n\nWhat was an upstart luxury brand from the utilitarian Toyota company three decades ago will soon have five utility vehicles in its portfolio. The latest is the UX crossover, arriving at the Geneva show as a dialed-back version of the UX concept unveiled in 2106 at the Paris show. The UX takes on the distinctive stance of recent Lexus sedans, notably the LC, and would logically share a platform used by Toyota\u2019s C-HR and Prius. The Palexpo halls will also present the first European sightings of the new RX L and LF-1 Limitless concepts amid a display that includes the current LS, LC, RS and RX models.\n\nMaserati\n\nThe display for Maserati, which has a prominent entry in the luxury S.U.V. horse race, will be an important destination for many shoppers who want to consider the Levante. While there, the Ghibli, Quattroporte, GT and GTC will also be available to accept longing looks.\n\nMazda\n\nEuropean shoppers will get the first look at the wagon version of the Mazda 6 and the Kai and Vision concepts. Also available for inspection will be the current range of Mazda 2, Mazda 3, CX-3, CX-5 and MX-5 models, and the Skyactiv-X engine that the company will be rolling out as practical proof that electricity isn\u2019t the only answer to efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMcLaren\n\nMcLaren\u2019s ranking in the universe of supercar builders takes another step up with the Senna, its most muscular road car, with a 789-horsepower twin-turbo V8. Named for Ayrton Senna, who drove to three championships for the McLaren Formula One team, this beast will run up to 211 miles an hour. Admirers can look over the car, but shoppers may want to avoid the heartbreak: The entire planned production of 500 cars has already been sold.\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nThe flood of new models from Stuttgart in recent years shows no sign of abating, so anyone walking through the auto show displays will have lots to see. One sure to generate buzz is the AMG GT Coupe, a four-door version of the two-door sports car. A 4-liter turbo V8 will deliver 604 horsepower. The newest G-Class S.U.V., shown this year in Detroit, gets the AMG treatment with a 577-horse turbo-V8, but perhaps the most significant mainstream introduction will be a new A-Class hatchback. That will be in European showrooms this spring and eventually make its way to the United States.\n\nMitsubishi\n\nEven to devoted fans of green vehicles, the news that Mitsubishi has sold 140,000 plug-in-hybrid versions of its Outlander crossover may come as a surprise; it\u2019s been Europe\u2019s best-selling plug-in hybrid for the past three years. The 2019 edition has more power, more choices of four-wheel-drive modes and greater battery capacity. On display, too, will be the e-Evolution concept vehicle, a futuristic (if squat) all-electric performance S.U.V. whose name might be a hint that it\u2019s intended to fill the gap left by the death of the Lancer Evolution.\n\nPhoto\n\nPeugeot\n\nThe PSA Group\u2019s portfolio now adds the former General Motors subsidiaries of Opel and Vauxhall to the existing brands of Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and DS. With an updated Peugeot 508 hatchback and the new Rifter microvan, there\u2019s plenty to see this year. The French automaker describes the 508 as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201creserved,\u201d a combination that\u2019s pretty hard to square, but whatever. The Rifter departs from the usual packing-crate motif with a more French interpretation of the utility van, communicating an intent to instill urban appeal. There is a four-wheel-drive version, naturally, though that is just a design concept for now.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolestar\n\nAdd Volvo to the list of automakers starting E.V. sub-brands as a way to ride the Tesla wave of popular acclaim. Polestar, an existing nameplate that Volvo has used for performance models, is using the Geneva show to go public with the Polestar 1, a 600-horsepower plug-in hybrid coupe. The understated four-seater promises more than 90 miles of all-electric range and will start production in 2019.\n\nPhoto\n\nPorsche\n\nThe push to be a something-for-everyone automaker continues to advance at Porsche. Visitors will find Panamera variants, including the not-a-station-wagon Sport Turismo, and a 462-horsepower plug-in hybrid, alongside the Boxster, Cayman, Cayenne and Macan. But center stage will be the 2019 911 GT3 RS, powered by a 4-liter nonturbo engine of 520 horsepower, the most powerful naturally aspirated engine ever fitted to a road-legal Porsche.\n\nRam\n\n\u201cWait, did I get lost?\u201d That\u2019s what visitors who discover the hulking Ram 1500 pickup might wonder at Palexpo. FCA is not only flexing its truck muscle here. The 808-horse Dodge Demon will also be shown in this land of high-price gasoline.\n\nRenault\n\nBy the time the Palexpo center opens to the public, a still-secret design study that Renault says is \u201cfocused on shared urban mobility\u201d will have been unveiled. Likewise, much of the display will be devoted to upgrades of current models geared to city drivers. The Zoe, Europe\u2019s top-selling E.V., gets a more powerful motor, and the Captur and Scenic models are upgraded with a new 1.3-liter engine developed with Daimler.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToyota\n\nOne of the most-anticipated cars at this year\u2019s show is a touring coupe that\u2019s intended to fill the gap left by the cancellation of the much-loved Supra in 2002. Developed jointly with BMW, the new car \u2014 on display in Geneva as a racecar proposal \u2014 is expected to also become the next edition of the BMW Z4. There\u2019s more: Along with futuristic confections like the Concept-i and Concept i-Ride, Toyota will have the Aygo city car and Mirai fuel-cell model.\n\nVolkswagen\n\nSales setbacks resulting from VW\u2019s diesel troubles are not keeping it from looking ahead to a product line dominated by electric power. Leading that effort to change public perception will be the I.D. Vizzion, the latest in a string of I.D. concepts. This all-electric sedan is aimed at the autonomous future \u2014 it has no steering wheel or pedals.\n\nVolvo\n\nThere\u2019s no question about Volvo being on a roll, with enthusiastic receptions of its XC60 crossover and S90/V90 models. Beyond those favorites, Volvo adherents will be able to take in the sleek 2019 V60 wagon and XC40 crossover as well as the XC90 S.U.V. and V40 wagon.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nLocation: Palexpo Arena, Route Fran\u00e7ois-Peyrot 30, 1218 Grand-Saconnex, Geneva.\n\nOpen to the public: Thursday through March 18.\n\nHours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAdmission: Adults CHF 16 (about $17), children 6 to 16 and pensioners CHF 9.\n\nGeneva International Motor Show website: www.gims.swiss/en/.", "title": "Amid Optimism, Automakers Pack Geneva With What\u2019s Next", "authors": ["Norman Mayersohn"]}

My run with Mr. Williams cost me about $250 for an hour, which are comparable with the Squaw private lesson rate of $539 for a half day. Bigger name pros like Chas Guldemond or Ms. Anderson would cost more, around $499 an hour. But the draw of Stomp, in addition to the pros, is flexibility: It let me just choose an hour, and I could start any time I wanted, and go for as long as I wanted, and focus on exactly what I wanted.\n\nSkateboarding lessons and pro sessions offers cheaper and more varied options starting around $80 per hour. And the app is loaded with dozens of tip videos from pros like Mr. Cole showing how to pull off simple jumps and complex flips.\n\nAn app like this could seem disruptive to the lucrative ski schools run by world class mountains like Squaw Valley. But the resort has embraced Stomp as a partner through a revenue sharing agreement. (Plus, anyone using Stomp still needs a Squaw Valley lift ticket \u2014 pros and amateurs alike.)\n\nFor the athletes, the draw is twofold: many view their role as ambassadors of growing sports, and the app allows the opportunity to spread their knowledge. But Stomp also brought many of the top names, like Ms. Anderson, into the company as advisers, so they also have a part ownership stake in its success.\n\nThe app is still in its nascent stages. There are two planned weekends left for ski and snowboard pro sessions at Squaw Valley on March 17 and 18 and April 7 and 8 . For skateboarding, the lessons around Truckee and Oceanside are fairly regular, with more cities on both coasts set to open soon. Mr. Williams said they require at least six pros to sign up for a location before they flip the switch in the app for a locale.\n\n\u201cI have a way of breaking down tricks in a specific manner and people have always said, \u2018 hey you should def do something with that skill you have of breaking down tricks into little bitty pieces an explaining them to people\u2019,\u201d said Chris Cole, the pro skateboarder. \u201cAnd I was just waiting for the right application to do it.\u201d", "title": "An App That Helps You Ride Like a Pro \u2014 by Riding With a Pro", "authors": []}

He developed a fever, was admitted to a hospital in South London and died four days later.\n\nAn inquiry revealed someone had used a specially adapted umbrella to inject a pellet containing the poison ricin into his leg. The culprit was later identified as a Bulgarian spy, Francesco Gullino, a.k.a. Agent Piccadilly.\n\nTea, With Something Extra\n\nPhoto\n\nSometimes, the victim suffers terribly: Alexander V.

Putin\u2019s former bodyguard, began vomiting and having diarrhea after drinking a cup of tea at a Federal Security Service office in St. Petersburg on Sept. 11, 2004. He died at 42 two weeks later. According to a BBC radio documentary, a post-mortem revealed radioactive contamination in his body.\n\nWhy the former bodyguard was killed has never been publicly revealed.\n\nThe Men Who Would Not Die\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo figures stand out in assassination lore: Fidel Castro, the Cuban strongman, and Rasputin, the wild-eyed, deeply reviled monk who influenced Russia\u2019s last czar.\n\nThe attempts on Castro\u2019s life included:\n\n\u2022 A contaminated skin-diving suit: According to a summary of the C.I.A.\u2019s assassination plots, an American lawyer, James B. Donovan, was to give Castro a contaminated skin-diving suit while the two negotiated for the release of the Bay of Pigs prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe C.I.A. plan was to dust the inside of the suit with a fungus producing Madura foot, a disabling and chronic skin disease, and also contaminating the suit with tuberculosis bacilli in the breathing apparatus,\u201d the document states.\n\nThe lawyer chose instead to give Castro a clean skin-diving suit \u201cas a gesture of friendship,\u201d and the modified one never left the laboratory.\n\n\u2022 A booby-trapped seashell: C.I.A. experts were asked to consider packing a seashell with explosives, so that it could be left in one of Castro\u2019s favored diving haunts, rigged to kill him if he picked it up.\n\n\u201cIt was determined that there was no shell in the Caribbean area large enough to hold a sufficient amount of explosive which was spectacular enough to attract the attention of Castro,\u201d the documents say.\n\n\u2022 Fatal cigars: The plan was to put a botulinum toxin into a box of his favorite cigars. The cigars were delivered in 1961 \u2014 but never reached Castro.\n\n\u2022 Botulism, again: Marita Lorenz told Vanity Fair in 1993 that as Castro\u2019s lover in 1959, she was recruited to assassinate him by dropping two botulism-toxin pills into his drink. She had reservations, and then found out that by putting the pills in a cold-cream jar, she had spoiled them. She said the wily Castro had her all shook up, anyway:\n\n\u201cHe leaned over, pulled out his .45, and handed it to me. He didn\u2019t even flinch. And he said, \u2018You can\u2019t kill me. Nobody can kill me.\u2019 And he kind of smiled and chewed on his cigar \u2026 I felt deflated. He was so sure of me. He just grabbed me. We made love.\u201d\n\nRasputin, who had gained enormous influence in the court of Nicholas II with his claims to healing powers, survived several assassination attempts before an elaborate conspiracy unfolded in December 1916 to kill him once and for all.\n\nPrince Felix Yusupov invited him to Yusupov Palace in St. Petersburg, where he was fed cake laced with potassium cyanide and copious amounts of cyanide-spiked Madeira \u2014 but did not die.\n\nHe was shot, but ran. He was shot again and again. Some reports say the conspirators even stabbed him. Finally, he was thrown into a car and driven to Petrovski Island, where he was dropped into the Neva River and drowned.", "title": "An Assassin\u2019s Tool Kit: When Guns Are Not Enough", "authors": ["Yonette Joseph", "Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a"]}

A s black women began to take advantage of the opportunities opened by the civil rights movement, black men were hit first with deindustrialization \u2014 the loss of well-paying blue-collar jobs throughout large swaths of our nation \u2014 and then with a surge in incarceration unlike anything a democratic nation had ever seen. Black children bore the brunt of their parents\u2019 suffering. Many well-meaning Americans remained oblivious to a national tragedy.\n\nBlack men\u2019s disadvantage has shaped not only how they are perceived but the meaning of race as well. Racial disparities \u2014 in incarceration, unemployment, school failure \u2014 fuel racial bias, which ensnares black boys, rich and poor alike. Boys like my own go from cute and cuddly to strong and manly, and so become a threat in the eyes of many. The bias, subtle yet pervasive, compounds the disparities by undermining the relationships and hope that one needs to get, and stay, ahead. And so the cycle continues.\n\nBut it need not. We can disrupt the cycle of black disadvantage. What we\u2019ve lacked is the will to do so. We act as though economic inequality is inevitable, relegating poor children of all races to schools to which most parents would never choose to send their own children, schools often in neighborhoods where most would never choose to live. We segregate ourselves by race and class, and accept the inequality of opportunity that doing so breeds.\n\nSo many Americans profess to be blind to race, which ensures only that it will remain salient. So many worry more about appearing to be racist than working to remove the enduring taint of slavery and segregation.\n\nWe will find a way to undo intergenerational racial disparities when we find the will. And to find the will, we need to recognize what\u2019s at stake: The conditions that challenge us imperil the future of black boys and black families and the viability of the American dream itself.", "title": "Opinion | An End to the Class vs. Race Debate", "authors": []}

As he sought to keep the president from blowing up the international trade consensus precipitously, Mr. Cohn was targeted by trade skeptics on the right, like Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist. Breitbart News, once overseen by Mr. Bannon, regularly included an illustration of a globe next to Mr. Cohn\u2019s name to mock him as a globalist.\n\n\u201cPolicy differences are inevitable in any administration. That\u2019s why White House process is so important,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum and a Republican economics adviser. \u201cThe process on the tariff issue appears to have been both chaotic and stacked against Cohn\u2019s view.\u201d\n\nSkeptics of free trade did not mourn the news of Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure and suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican critics like Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hatch were on the wrong side of history.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWhile it seems that the tariff issue is reopening a fundamental schism between Trump and old-line Republicans, the average-guy voter Trump seems to aim at and do rather well with seems as happy as a clam with the tariffs,\u201d said Clyde Prestowitz, the author of \u201cThe Betrayal of American Prosperity.\u201d \u201cI guess my question is: Does Trump have a problem, or do the old-line Republicans who seem to be retiring at a rapid rate have a problem?\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s views on many issues have been flexible or evolved over the years, his belief that the United States was being shafted has been a core conviction going back decades, long before he first ran for president.

Mr. Trump threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, but backed off in favor of negotiations that so far have not yielded consensus. He has likewise suggested he would withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea but has not followed through.\n\nIn one of the most tangible actions he has taken, Mr. Trump slapped steep tariffs on foreign washing machines and solar energy panels in January, generating cheers from domestic manufacturers and protests from other business leaders. But he followed up days later with a reassuring speech to investors and corporate chieftains gathered in Davos, Switzerland, the ground zero for globalization and free trade, a speech written largely by Mr. Cohn.\n\nIn the end, though, Mr. Cohn could not head off the steel and aluminum tariffs, suggesting that the \u201cAmerica First\u201d side of the White House had finally prevailed over his resistance.\n\nLori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch and a longtime critic of trade deals, said the divide over trade crossed all sorts of traditional lines.\n\n\u201cThe division is not Trump vs. G.O.P.,\u201d she said, \u201cbut anyone contesting the trade and globalization status quo from the left or the right versus a shrinking but still powerful bipartisan elite defense of policies that have outsourced millions of middle-class jobs and pushed down Americans wages.\u201d\n\nBut Jason Furman, who was the chairman of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, said people on both sides of the issue were investing too much importance in it.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, is torn on trade,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all sides of the debate share a common misconception that trade is more important than it actually is for growth, inequality or jobs.\u201d\n\nEven so, as Mr. Cohn takes his leave, it has now become the defining fault line between a president and his party.", "title": "An Important Voice for Free Trade Proponents Goes Silent", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

She first visited the site last October and quickly struck upon the lead crystal motif, in part thanks to some imposing chandeliers in the palace.\n\n\u201cMozart spent a lot of time in Vienna and composed works for the lead-crystal glass harmonica,\u201d Ms. Philipsz said. Radio sets had crystal elements in the 1930s, and the radio was a vital propaganda tool for Hitler. \u201cAnd, of course, there was Kristallnacht,\u201d Ms. Philipsz said, referring to the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when synagogues and Jewish businesses in Germany and Austria were ransacked. It was an eruption of hate she also wants \u201cThe Voices\u201d to memorialize.\n\nThe museum wanted a work of art to make the public reflect on Hitler\u2019s speech from the balcony, but was wary of putting a sculpture there. Commissioning a sound artist solved the problem, but the museum\u2019s original idea of placing all of the speakers where Hitler spoke did not work for Ms. Philipsz, as it kept too much attention on the balcony.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThat felt wrong \u2014 I didn\u2019t want this to be about Hitler, but about the voices of all the people who had gathered there over the decades.\u201d So she also had speakers placed on the other side of the square. This, however, meant \u201cThe Voices\u201d could be heard only for 10 minutes twice a day, at 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m, in deference to the neighbors.\n\n\u201cI personally find the work a bit underwhelming, but it would have been unimaginable in Austria until the 1990s,\u201d said G. Daniel Cohen, a historian from Rice University in Houston currently in Vienna to write a book about attitudes toward Jews in postwar Europe. \u201cSuch attempts at national reflection have at the very least forced the far right to accept the existence of a taboo against anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday lunchtime, around 50 people were listening by the statue of Archduke Karl, one of the heroes the Heldenplatz honors. \u201cIt is a stirring experience,\u201d said Dagmar Friedl-Preyer, 57, a social worker, who had come to the square to hear the work. \u201cYou see the balcony and think of all that \u2018Anschluss\u2019 delirium, the sound makes all that well up.\u201d Her friend Josef Huber, a retiree, said he thought many Austrians would come to hear \u201cThe Voices.\u201d \u201cThe problem, of course, is those who want nothing to do with any of this \u2014 they won\u2019t come to listen.\u201d", "title": "An Invisible Artwork Reminds Austria of Its Nazi Past", "authors": ["Gerrit Wiesmann"]}

The Ohio bill is \u201cblatantly unconstitutional,\u201d said Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, which has challenged anti-abortion laws in the state. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a hard one.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision made abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability, which has shifted over time due to medical advancements in treating premature babies, but now occurs at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Any ban on abortion before that time \u2014 say, at 15 weeks, as would be the case under a law that was passed and legally blocked in Mississippi last week \u2014 is generally considered unconstitutional.\n\nThis rash of radically unconstitutional bills is appearing by design. The anti-abortion movement has been trying to pass pre-viability abortion bans, like the Ohio bill, hoping that efforts to overturn them would lead to a challenge of Roe v. Wade that would end with the 45-year-old decision\u2019s reversal in the Supreme Court.\n\nReproductive rights advocates say the various pieces of legislation are in keeping with the anti-abortion crowd\u2019s newfound optimism under President Trump, who has said he wants Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. Mr. Trump may get the chance to appoint a judge who will cast the deciding vote.\n\nAs Mr. Trump himself acknowledged during his 2016 town hall, banning abortions does not stop women from getting them \u2014 it just makes it harder for them to do so safely. If abortion were banned, \u201cYou go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places,\u201d Mr. Trump said, inarticulately but correctly noting that some women would be driven to back-alley providers.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason abortion rights supporters are so concerned about the Ohio bill. Another is that, even if the bill doesn\u2019t become law, it could pave the way for other, somewhat less extreme measures to pass, seeming reasonable by comparison. For instance, in 2016 John Kasich, the state\u2019s Republican governor, vetoed a bill that would have banned abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which could have effectively outlawed the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

One of the interesting things to talk about is what\u2019s been surprising to us. I knew that eight shows a week would be a challenge \u2014 and I\u2019ve had two performances so far, so I can\u2019t really say what that\u2019s like yet. But there are so many things that have shocked me about the process. The first preview is like a draft of the show, and we have six weeks to make it into a real show. So that really surprised me \u2014 the degree to which there will be changes.\n\nPhoto\n\nKELLI O\u2019HARA I\u2019m so used to the comfort of that. It\u2019s like a film actor is fine, because they have many, many takes of something.

Here, it\u2019s just hit the road and go!\n\nFLEMING I keep saying that to my colleagues! The first preview, I said, \u201cWell, [in opera] we would have opened by now, all the critics would be here tonight.\u201d Another thing that shocked me is the rehearsal process. There\u2019s a huge number of people in rehearsal, and evidently when we start running the show there\u2019ll be hardly anybody backstage. Whereas at the Met it\u2019s the opposite.\n\nO\u2019HARA Right! That was one of the biggest things here [at the Met] during \u201cMerry Widow,\u201d arriving in a dressing room that wasn\u2019t my home. On Broadway you make it your home, because you\u2019re there so much: You decorate, you bring your things from home, you put your pictures out. No one comes to that door. You walk yourself to the stage and you stand alone. You don\u2019t want to be touched. And you wait, and you prepare, and you focus.\n\nHere, I remember getting my makeup.

So the body amplifies the voice, with this kind of projection, and also breath pressure and support. And in music theater, it\u2019s the opposite. You really want the microphone to do that work of amplification, so you save yourself. You just couldn\u2019t do it eight shows a week.\n\nO\u2019HARA I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever adjusted my singing much [for microphones]. But I still try to sing with all of my body, and they adjust the mic down if they need to for me.\n\nFLEMING One good thing about the Met is the house absolutely favors high voices. It\u2019s something about the overtones, I think, that really carry in the house. So I always tell people don\u2019t be afraid, because if you allow the overtones to do their work, you\u2019re safe.\n\nPhoto\n\nYou can never sing to the wings, you can never turn away and sing on the stage of the Met.

The audience is an audience, the stage is a stage, the story is the story, and the singing is your singing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFLEMING People tend to think of opera as a very separate sort of genre. In fact the lineage between Rodgers and Hammerstein, for instance, and what I\u2019ve grown up in is very powerful. When operetta first came to New York that had a huge influence on music theater. One thing that I love is this notion that an opera house now, particularly around the country, can also perform these artistically aspirational music theater pieces. Those should be folded into what we present in an opera house because otherwise, frankly, we\u2019ve been presenting the same titles, the same small body of work, for literally a century. So we need to kind of get audiences interested more in new work. And this is a good way to do it.\n\nO\u2019HARA This is the other thing, and I\u2019ll just say it: In opera I\u2019m still playing the young girl. In musical theater, I\u2019m too old to play some of these roles. Which is heartbreaking for me.\n\nPhoto\n\nFLEMING But I think of Broadway as really loving its divas, and really celebrating women. You think of Patti LuPone, and some of the great artists who just continually go on \u2014 Bernadette Peters is taking over \u201cHello Dolly.\u201d And the audiences just crave these great leading women. It\u2019s a little harder in opera. It\u2019s a little bit to do with the voice and how it changes. But sometimes the repertoire that\u2019s left is sort of the roles that aren\u2019t the most sympathetic \u2014 you have the sorceress and the witch, and many comic roles.\n\nO\u2019HARA I think we\u2019re seeing it in movies, television, and we\u2019ll see it more in the writing on Broadway: that women of a certain age are going to start to have real stories, just like they\u2019re having in real life. As opposed to these kind of clich\u00e9d ones.\n\nRen\u00e9e, how did you find it going from that heightened opera talk, projecting and enunciating, to trying to be more natural and funny on Broadway?\n\nFLEMING I always said that I never could manage spoken accents \u2014 but I could sing in any language. I don\u2019t know what the disconnect was. But in fact I have really enjoyed working with this Maine accent [in \u201cCarousel\u201d], and trying to kind of fine-tune it and really find the colors in her voice.\n\nKelli, how is it to sing in Italian, instead of Oscar Hammerstein in English?\n\nO\u2019HARA I think that\u2019s the most difficult part for me. I haven\u2019t been perfecting these languages over the years. I think the accent is O.K. I\u2019m getting it, but it\u2019s just the agility with it.\n\nFLEMING You have the barrier of understanding, and being able to know, not just what you\u2019re saying but everyone else.

Schools in New Jersey, Michigan, California and Texas have reported a threat of violence, a scramble by police, a rush by school officials to secure a school and the ripples of fear that follow.\n\nCommunities find themselves navigating a fine, sometimes blurred, line between vigilance and overreaction. A high school in Westport, Conn., was evacuated after a student was overheard threatening a teacher. Worries over a toy gun caused a lockdown at three schools in Arlington, Tex. In Pensacola, Fla., a middle school went into lockdown after a rumor spread that there was a gun inside the school, terrifying students; the rumor turned out to be false.\n\nAttentive school administrators are facing a daily dilemma: Take every possible threat seriously and risk a needless disruption to the school day, a noisy police response and a crush of worried parents. Or, ignore what could be a real threat and risk the nightmare of your school becoming the next Parkland.\n\n\u2018The World Had Changed\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Fulton, a city of 3,300 people just across the river from Iowa, Tuesday morning began like any other.\n\nStudents showed up for classes at Fulton High, a low-slung brick building where a red sign in front heralds its team name, the Steamers.\n\nMr. Tennyson, a burly, gregarious former police officer known to his students as \u201cMr. T,\u201d was making his usual rounds through the hallways, passing rows of shiny lockers where students had fastened Post-its with inspirational messages. (\u201cTry to be a rainbow in someone\u2019s cloud,\u201d one read.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore he became a principal, Mr. Tennyson, 48, spent years as a school resource officer in suburban Chicago. He vividly remembers the day of the Columbine massacre in 1999, when he watched news reports from the high school where he was responsible for student safety.\n\n\u201cWe just thought, \u2018Oh my goodness, how could this ever happen in a school?\u2019\u201d Mr. Tennyson recalled. \u201cI knew that the world had changed.\u201d\n\nSince the Florida shooting, schools around the country have seen an uptick in threats, incidents of violence and false alarms reported in the media. A group that tracks such reports, the Educator\u2019s School Safety Network, says an average of 70 incidents have occurred daily in the weeks since the Florida shooting, as compared to a more typical pace, of about 10 to 12 incidents a day. Hard to measure, though, is how many of these incidents represent an increase in false alarms, due in part to heightened vigilance, and how many reflect a new surge in truly dangerous threats.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, when Mr. Tennyson read the messages on the worried Fulton High student\u2019s phone, he instantly knew who was involved. This high school is small \u2014 288 students \u2014 and the student who had handed over her phone told him that the messages were from Blake Dornbush, an 18-year-old who graduated from Fulton High last year and had played on the football team.\n\nIn the eyes of Mr. Tennyson, who knows all of his students, he and Mr. Dornbush had a great relationship. But it had been almost a year since they talked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with his life,\u201d Mr. Tennyson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s changed.

She was calm, she said later, reasoning that if the situation was truly dire, the school would have gone into full lockdown with even more extreme measures.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, though, other students began to grow nervous, she said.\n\n\u201cYou always think about what could happen,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the students waited, police went to Mr. Dornbush\u2019s home, a pale yellow house with burgundy shutters, where he lived with his parents. Nobody was home.\n\nMr. Dornbush\u2019s parents, called by police, told them that their son was at school. The Midwest Technical Institute in Moline, Ill., where he is studying welding, was a short drive down the river.\n\nAfter a while, Mr. Dornbush returned a call from police on his phone and drove up Route 84 from Moline under strict instructions from the officers. Trailed by unmarked police cars, he drove directly to the Fulton Police Department, where he was interviewed about the Snapchat messages, the police said. Lieutenant Pridemore said he arrested Mr. Dornbush, who was charged with two counts of felony disorderly conduct.\n\nMr. Dornbush was booked into the Whiteside County Jail, where he would remain until Wednesday afternoon, the authorities said, when he was released on $25,000 bond. Mr. Dornbush did not respond to messages, and a woman who answered the door at Mr. Dornbush\u2019s house on Thursday declined to talk. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.\n\nLieutenant Pridemore said that a recent breakup with the student who got the Snapchat messages may have been behind what had happened.\n\n\u201cHe knew what he did was wrong,\u201d Lieutenant Pridemore said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a great explanation for why he did it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018Threat Enough\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the Sunrise diner in Fulton on Thursday morning, as a waitress made the rounds and refilled coffee cups, one topic of conversation briefly dominated the room: the lockdown at the schools.\n\nMelissa Werner, sitting in a booth by a window, said that her son, Blake, is a 15-year-old sophomore at Fulton High. He seemed to be fine once the lockdown was over, she said, though he was shaken while it was happening. After what occurred on Tuesday, she gave him a stern reminder.\n\n\u201cI told my son, \u2018You have to watch every little thing that you say,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018People don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being serious.\u2019\u201d\n\nPolice said that before Tuesday, they had not had any contact with Mr. Dornbush, aside from a few traffic stops. They searched the Dornbush home and found no weapons.\n\nTod Goodell, a friend and former classmate from Fulton High, said he believed that Mr. Dornbush was harmless.\n\n\u201cI know Blake and I also know he would not hurt anyone,\u201d he said in a Facebook message. \u201cHe said what he said out of anger and I know he regrets it. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything he said he\u2019d do.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty of that \u2014 whether a threat will result in violence or amount to frightening, rash talk \u2014 has sent schools into lockdowns, again and again. Belligerent claims and rumors of violence spread instantaneously in the never-slowing flood of social media. In light of the Parkland attack and other school shootings, Lieutenant Pridemore said, there is no way that police now can risk overlooking a detailed threat.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer say, \u2018Aww, he didn\u2019t mean it,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Pridemore said. \u201cTimes have changed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDarryl Hogue, the superintendent of the school district, said he was satisfied that the incident at Fulton High was \u201cisolated, independent and definitely over.\u201d\n\nHe said he has no way of knowing whether someone will follow through on a promise of violence or not.\n\n\u201cI think of that all the time,\u201d Mr. Hogue said. \u201cWas it a real threat?

Shadowy, underground lenders have flooded the country with a staggering $15 trillion in credit, which threatens to hobble its economy.\n\nBeijing now appears to be taking a harder stance with the companies in need of a bail out. On Wednesday, Chinese authorities accused a founder of Anbang, who was the deal maker who bought the Waldorf Astoria, of bilking investors of more than $10 billion. In a country where courts tend to convict, the accusations raised the likelihood that the executive, Wu Xiaohui, could face life in prison.\n\nOfficials have also spent the past two years trying to contain the risk. Earlier this month, the Chinese government said it would merge the country\u2019s banking and insurance regulators in an effort to close regulatory loopholes.\n\nCentral to that effort is keeping a tighter rein on products like Anbang\u2019s Abundant Stability No. 10. Many small investors believe that means the government backs them. Anbang also calls them \u201cuniversal insurance products,\u201d making them sound conservative.\n\nThe truth is more complicated.\n\nAbundant Stability No. 10 is closer to what in China is called a wealth management product. Wealth management products on paper are not backed by the government, but state-run banks act as middlemen and sell them to small investors, giving many people the perception that they are. The salespeople often know little about what is backing them \u2014 or how the people ultimately behind them will pay the money back.\n\nAbundant Stability No. 10, for example, requires only a $4,600 investment over three years. In return, investors are promised a payout that is triple what Chinese savers might get by parking their money in a savings account. On the phone, salespeople at one state-run Chinese bank, China Merchants, said the payout could be even higher, perhaps 10 times what a savings account pays out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShen Gang, an Anbang spokesman, said that banks were an important channel for the company\u2019s insurance products and that the government takeover had not changed the operations of Anbang at all. \u201cAnbang has always been very stable on the financial front,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the selling of our products is a normal business activity.\u201d\n\nLi Yan, 48, a founder of a technology company, bought a universal insurance product from Taikang Insurance, an Anbang rival.

In November, they proposed tightening disclosure rules and stopping firms from guaranteeing payments to investors, among other steps.\n\nPhoto\n\nData suggest China is making some headway. The total outstanding balance of wealth management products issued by Chinese banks was about $4.7 trillion in 2017, up just 1.7 percent from a year before, according to China Wealth, a state-backed company that tracks China\u2019s wealth management products.

Fearing mass unrest, the ruling Communist Party has repeatedly instructed Chinese banks and local officials to cave in to angry investors, who have protested outside government offices after losing their investments.\n\nThe real test, according to Mr. Zhu, could come later this year, when wealth management products issued years earlier have to be paid back.\n\n\u201cNonperforming loans are going to be so severe that some of the weaker banks will be forced to face their Judgment Day \u2014 whether they are going to be bailed out or whether they are going to die,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the last five years or so, retail investors have poured money into wealth management products that enabled China\u2019s developers to circumvent laws to buy land, \u201czombie\u201d state-owned enterprises facing overcapacity problems to borrow, and debt-laden local government financing vehicles to take on more leverage.\n\nIn the case of Anbang, it helped the company raise money for trophy acquisitions such as the Waldorf Astoria.\n\n\u201cThey were just buying up assets, playing the markets and investing overseas, which, of course, isn\u2019t really beneficial to China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Christopher Aston, an associate consultant in Shanghai at Control Risks, a global risk consultancy, who is writing a book on his experience in a Chinese shadow bank.\n\nThe market is still booming for Anbang.

Without serious competition, W.W.E. has built a business that allows its stars to reach levels of opulence never before associated with wrestling, both in income and crossover appeal. A top star like John Cena can appear with W.W.E. one night and guest-host NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show the next morning. There are, however, only so many Cena-level spots available.\n\nNew Japan\u2019s rise has come, in part, from offering its performers more artistic freedom as well as additional avenues for income that are not always available to those working for W.W.E. For example, some wrestlers can negotiate with New Japan to also work for other promotions and to sell their own branded merchandise.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was injured during the Normandy invasion and hospitalized for six months.\n\nAfter his discharge, he joined his father, who had lately been selling fish and delivering ice, in a new sidewalk fruit and vegetable stall at Greenwich Avenue and Christopher Street (with a bathtub out back for rinsing the produce as it was delivered).\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1952, the younger Mr. Balducci married the former Nina D\u2019Amelio, who survives him, along with two of his four daughters, Marta and Andrea Balducci; his sister, Grace Doria; six grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His daughter Maria Murphy, who was known as Ria, died in 2006, and his daughter Dena Balducci died in a car accident in 1991.\n\nMr. Balducci took a hiatus from the food business in the mid-1950s to work for his father-in-law\u2019s Long Island masonry contracting firm, in Great Neck.

(Close had starred in the original Broadway production 22 years earlier, and time had not been kind to either her singing voice or the show itself.) But then, on the second-to-last day of the year, I went to a matinee of the recent revival of \u201cCats,\u201d also by Lloyd Webber, ending its year-and-a-half run that night. (The original Broadway production of \u201cCats\u201d ran for 18 years, making it the longest-running musical in Broadway history until it was eclipsed by the still-running \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d written by \u2014 who else? \u2014 Andrew Lloyd Webber.) Surrounded by enthusiastic fans, some of whom had come in costume, I sat through the frantically charmless first act before bolting for the exit at intermission. At least I got to hear \u201cMemory.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps I am not the ideal reader for Lloyd Webber\u2019s memoir, \u201cUnmasked,\u201d the first of what the composer suggests will be two volumes. But as someone who has long been a devoted theatergoer (and can knowledgeably debate, for instance, the finer points of the Angela Lansbury versus Tyne Daly versus Bernadette Peters productions of \u201cGypsy\u201d), I have a grudging admiration for someone who once had four shows running simultaneously on Broadway, tying a record that had been held by the legendary Rodgers and Hammerstein. And the original cast album of Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d was certainly in heavy rotation during my youth, as was its hit single, \u201cI Don\u2019t Know How to Love Him.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Lloyd Webber has worked over the years with some of the most compelling characters in musical theater \u2014 among them Harold Prince, Patti LuPone and Cameron Mackintosh \u2014 and I was hoping for some good dish, particularly on LuPone, the \u201cEvita\u201d star with whom Lloyd Webber later had a famous feud after he fired her from the Broadway production of \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d and replaced her with Close.\n\nBut, alas, Lloyd Webber doesn\u2019t appear to be much interested in dishing the dirt in this volume \u2014 at least not in the tradition of most kiss-and-tell theatrical memoirs, including LuPone\u2019s own, which doesn\u2019t shy away from naming names and settling scores. (LuPone spends two full chapters bitterly recounting the \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d tale, and Lloyd Webber points out that she once said \u201cEvita\u201d was clearly written by a composer \u201cwho hates women.\u201d)", "title": "Andrew Lloyd Webber, Hotheaded Perfectionist", "authors": []}

The public affairs office arranged a phone call to discuss the case, a common practice in the federal government when officials believe that a journalist has only part of the story.\n\nIn the Journal story, a person described as close to Mr. McCabe pushed back on the notion that he had tried to shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the person described a tense conversation with the Justice Department in which Mr. McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to keep investigating.\n\nThe article was a negative one for the Clinton campaign \u2014 not Mr. Trump. It was published just days before the election, after the F.B.I. reopened its investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The article, including the F.B.I. disclosures, made it clear that some agents saw evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation that was worth investigating.\n\nMr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Under the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, he ascended through several senior leadership jobs, and it was clear that he was being groomed for the bureau\u2019s No. 2 position. His rise angered some rank-and-file agents.

{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "Was he leaking information to damage Mr. Trump?\n\nNot as far as anyone can tell. The story at the heart of the case was published in The Wall Street Journal in October 2016, just days before the election as the F.B.I. raced to review newly discovered emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s server. The Journal revealed a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to handle a separate Clinton investigation, one into her family\u2019s foundation.\n\nMr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials \u2014 known as \u201cbackground calls\u201d \u2014 are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.\n\nThe Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case \u2014 a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.\n\nDid the White House fire Mr. McCabe?\n\nNo. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.\n\nAnd he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.\n\nOn the eve of Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a \u201cbad actor.\u201d Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.\n\n\u201cThis distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president\u2019s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe.\u201d \u2014 Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabe\n\nWhy was he fired so quickly?\n\nThat is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.\u2019s disciplinary office are kept confidential.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,\u201d Mr. Bromwich said.\n\nWhat\u2019s the president\u2019s beef with Mr. McCabe?\n\nMr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a \u201closer.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism have merit?\n\nYes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife\u2019s campaign donations.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties.\n\nWhat does this possibly have to do with Russia?\n\nLike so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nMr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe argues that the Trump administration is trying to discredit him as a potential witness. The real target, Mr. McCabe said, is Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mr. Trump\u2019s team seemingly gave credence to that argument last weekend when the Daily Beast asked for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer for a comment on Mr. McCabe\u2019s firing and he responded with a call to end the Mueller investigation.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched \u2014 including the Russia investigation. Mr. McCabe\u2019s allies have come to his defense.\n\nWell, he did lie, right?\n\nWhat we know right now is that Mr. Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr. McCabe \u201clacked candor.\u201d And career officials \u2014 not Trump appointees \u2014 recommended dismissal. Mr. Sessions accepted that recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.\n\nMr. McCabe denies being untruthful. He says he answered every question honestly and, when he was misunderstood, he reached out to the investigators to correct the record.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to assess the allegations, or Mr. McCabe\u2019s defense, until the inspector general\u2019s report is released. That is expected sometime this spring. Mr. McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public.

In person, however, he is humble and thoughtful, if tightly coiled, with the taut, sinewy body of a long-distance runner and zany green eyes.\n\nWe meet at Mr. Griffiths\u2019 airy beachside home in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, where he lives with his wife, Jill, 56, who co-writes and edits his books, and their daughter, Sarah, 17. (He also has a daughter, 24-year-old Jasmine, from a previous marriage.)\n\nWith its sweeping views over the ocean, the house is built in a familiar Australian style \u2014 floor-to-ceiling glass windows leading out to a terrace and lap pool \u2014 but there are hints that this isn\u2019t just any suburban abode. On the mantel sits an eclectic assortment of oversized toys: a Bambi; a retro red clown, mouth agape; and a giant Kewpie doll.\n\nPhoto\n\nThese knickknacks are important imagination kickers; much of Mr. Griffiths\u2019 time is spent trawling junk stores. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something slightly creepy. Like that frog,\u201d he points to a manically grinning frog sitting between the Bambi and the clown.\n\nHis garden studio is a child\u2019s paradise, albeit with a warped sense of humor. There are compact plastic dinosaurs whose heads have been ripped off and replaced with those of baby dolls; a full-sized skeleton dressed in a mortarboard cap and gown; and several, as Mr. Griffiths puts it, \u201ckiller\u201d koalas \u2014 soft toys adorned with fangs, bloodshot googly eyes and crimson claws, created from hairclips. Towering over it all is a 6-foot-high model of a tree house.\n\n\u201cA lot of kids entertainment is pitched down. It\u2019s pretty tedious,\u201d Mr. Griffiths scoffed, shaking his head. By contrast, he begins with an idea that amuses him as an adult. \u201cWe credit the children with intelligence,\u201d he said, speaking of himself and Treehouse illustrator, Mr. Denton, \u201cwriting to them as equals and saying, in effect, \u2018Hey, we think this is really funny and want to share it with you!\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Griffiths chafes at the idea that children\u2019s books need to have purpose or be instructive. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of our stories?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point. That\u2019s the point. To read a book and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the past he has courted controversy and a fair amount of poo-pooing (pun intended) of his work, which at times has been seen by some at best as noneducational and at worst as dangerous.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis books have been removed from libraries, schools and shops over fears that children might copy behavior in them. There was \u201cThe Day My Butt Went Psycho!,\u201d about an army of backsides that aim for world domination via a toxic giant fart. That one was, he remarked, \u201crude enough to get people hot under the collar,\u201d and a deliberate reaction to the conservatism Mr. Griffiths felt was devouring children\u2019s literature at the time. \u201cI was delighted,\u201d he said of the fuss. \u201cKids do not read fiction as if they\u2019re a manual for living. They go to books because they\u2019re the opposite.\u201d\n\nMr. Griffiths is culturally astute: He counts Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d as a major influence, alongside \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\u201d Salvador Dal\u00ed, \u201cPunch and Judy\u201d (\u201cit\u2019s so transgressive, so violent\u201d) and \u201cThe Magic Pudding,\u201d a tale of \u201cchaos and anarchy.\u201d His love of literature is (literally) imprinted on his body. Both arms are tattooed heavily with characters from the books he has read and loved, including his own.\n\nAs such, he can sound a bit defensive about his reputation. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said of the butt books, it\u2019s \u201ca hero\u2019s journey. There are a lot of literary references. It\u2019s quite sophisticated absurdist fiction.\u201d But, he added, all critics see are \u201cbums and farts.\u201d\n\nThe Treehouse series was an attempt to \u201cget away\u201d from the bum genre, he admitted. \u201cWe had done every possible violation. So we said we\u2019ll just write a book about not being able to write a book \u2014 and we\u2019ll live in a tree house.\u201d\n\nThe result is what can only be described as the dream home for 9- and 10-year-olds. There are no parents (or rules). Terry and Andy spend their days eating ice cream served by a robot called Edward Scooperhands, getting tattoos in the A.T.M. (Automatic Tattoo Machine), or performing \u201copen shark surgery\u201d on their pet fish. Less crude than earlier books, there are still plenty of adult allusions to keep parents amused.\n\nPhoto\n\nBorn in 1961, Mr. Griffiths was raised in Melbourne by his midwife mother and industrial chemist father. Growing up a \u201cwild, dissolute youth\u201d he devoured horror comics, listened to David Bowie and took long bush walks.\n\n\u201cI remember my dad asking: \u2018Why do you always have to be different?\u2019 He wanted me to be interested in football and cricket,\u201d he recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis sense of agency changed when he was 10 and was given a rusty typewriter, which he still prizes today. The ability to make words out of nothing \u2014 to \u201ctake any silly idea you\u2019ve got and make a book\u201d \u2014 fascinated him. Soon, he was selling a \u201cjoke magazine\u201d to other kids for 3 Australian cents a pop. As an adult, he had stints as a punk singer and a taxi driver. When he gave up teaching, \u201cmy parents went: \u2018Ugh, we almost had a respectable son!\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the last two decades, Mr. Griffiths has worked closely with Mr. Denton (\u201cwe\u2019re like long lost brothers\u201d) and his wife, Jill, whom he met in 1996. The fictional Treehouse series reflects their roles in real life. \u201cTerry is always off with the fairies or painting a cat yellow, and Jill solves problems. There is,\u201d he said with admiration, \u201cno hiding from Jill,\u201d who is down-to-earth, warm and nurturing.\n\nThe series still touches on bodily functions, such as bubbles made of burps, but Mr. Griffiths also explores bigger ideas that appeal to him. Many are existential: In one book, Professor Stupido, the world\u2019s greatest un-inventor, un-invents the universe (Terry, thankfully, draws it back). In another, Terry and Andy travel back in time to different eons.\n\nAs his Treehouse books make their way into the lives of a generation of children around the world Mr. Griffiths himself may seem to have grown up. But he remains at once wickedly puerile and endlessly curious. \u201cThe child inside never went away,\u201d he said, gazing lovingly around his studio.", "title": "Andy Griffiths, the Down-Under Kids\u2019 Author Known for His Butt Jokes, Now Builds and Builds on His Hit \u2018Treehouse\u2019 Series", "authors": ["Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore"]}

With the S.P.D.\u2019s decision to enter the government, the AfD will now become the strongest opposition force in Parliament, a largely symbolic but important position that is viewed as providing a check on those in power.\n\nThe past weeks have seen the S.P.D.\u2019s popularity plunge even further, with the party losing as much as another five percentage points in some surveys and dropping behind the AfD in popularity in the eastern states.

But with the Social Democrats who campaigned against more money for the military set to take over the finance ministry in the new government, there is little hope that this will come to pass. What\u2019s more, the coalition agreement also demands that every additional euro spent on defense be matched by foreign development assistance, which further narrows the wiggle room to beef up the military.\n\nTo be fair, in recent years Berlin has shown more readiness to deploy its army abroad, sending it into Mali, Iraq and the Baltics. But after two decades of spending cuts, the German military has reached a breaking point. Four years ago, it drew global derision when soldiers carried broomsticks instead of machine guns during a NATO exercise because of a shortage of equipment.\n\nThe situation is no better today.

But many Western partners increasingly see this as an easy excuse.

In the South, private religious schools emerged so that white families could dodge sending their children to learn with blacks. At newly integrated schools, fostering collegiality and visibility among students and working toward a more inclusive future was rarely a passionately promoted agenda. You cannot get a good education if you disappear from yourself. Being visible and present is crucial to embracing knowledge.\n\nI graduated from Garrison relatively invisible. I don\u2019t even remember my junior high graduation dress. And then it was time to go to high school.\n\nWestern High School was an all-girls public school near Baltimore\u2019s most cherished historic buildings. When I crossed the threshold for the first time, I saw down the long hallway a petite, elegantly dressed woman with perfect posture. Her diction, as she called out directives, could have cracked crystal. Moving a few steps closer, I saw that she was a Negro and later learned that she was a vice principal. Not unusual now, very unusual then. As I walked a few steps beyond her, I heard, \u201cAren\u2019t you a Smith?\u201d I turned. \u201cYou look just like your mother \u2026 and your father.\u201d\n\nThat was the legendary Essie M. Hughes. She\u2019d been a Latin teacher and had taught generations of Negro children, including my parents and aunts and uncles, in one of the two Negro high schools during the \u201940s and \u201950s. She saw me. I saw her seeing me. Within five minutes of my entering the new school, my invisibility in education was over.\n\nHomeroom seating was alphabetical. In front of me sat a white Jewish girl whose mother was a violinist in the Baltimore Symphony. Until then, the symphony\u2019s musicians were, to me, white and black dots I\u2019d struggled to magnify through binoculars. Yet, when my new classmate and I glanced at each other for the first time, I felt as though I\u2019d known her for a lifetime. The girl behind me, also white (and Catholic), was hilarious. As far as I was concerned, undiscovered forms of hilarity were always welcome.\n\nI like September. Even though it required going back to school, it always filled me with optimism. And my birthday falls in that month. That first year, the violinist\u2019s daughter gave me a book of poems and a card. She signed the card \u201cLove, Ruthie.\u201d She was the first white person in my life who used the word \u201clove\u201d in relation to me. We became close friends, counseling each other until our last gasps of adolescence.\n\nUnlike Garrison, Western was not toxic. I credit its leadership. A commanding triumvirate indeed: Miss Kell, the principal, was a white woman over six feet tall who looked like a mix of George Washington and a Eudora Welty character. Mr. DeWolff, the other vice principal, was a white man with a disability at a time when there were no sloping curbs or much else to aid mobility. Miss Hughes was well traveled, fluent in several languages. She\u2019d grown up when segregation was the norm in much of Baltimore and the surrounding areas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn spite of their personal battles, or perhaps because of them, they provided contours around which dividing lines melted. I experienced the fractured and often bloody \u201960s in an intellectual environment where many voices were heard, many cultures seen. It wasn\u2019t just being visible to myself that made education intoxicating. It was paying attention to the world in the company of those who had different histories, and who followed different paths, that turned on the lights for me.", "title": "Anna Deavere Smith: The First Time a White Person Wrote \u2018Love\u2019 to Me", "authors": ["Anna Deavere Smith", "The First Time"]}

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Other Labour lawmakers seemed worried, too.\n\nThe crisis deepened with news on Thursday of the resignation of Christine Shawcroft, the chair of Labour\u2019s internal disputes panel, after the leak of an email suggesting that she had lent support to a council candidate suspended after accusations of anti-Semitism.\n\nComing after criticism of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to blame Moscow for the poisoning attack on a Russian former spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England, the issue has recharged a bitter argument about his leadership. That, in turn, has led Mr. Corbyn\u2019s supporters to complain of a politically motivated plot to destabilize his position because of his left-wing politics.\n\nBut there is little doubt that the atmosphere in the Labour Party has changed. A veteran of left-wing struggles, Mr. Corbyn learned his politics fighting apartheid in South Africa and campaigning against what he saw as Western militarism and neo-imperialism. While many of those battles have been won, the plight of the Palestinians remains a sore point on the left, one deepened by the hard-line policies of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAt the same time, the Labour Party\u2019s membership has grown bigger and more diverse, while Momentum, a campaign that promotes Mr. Corbyn\u2019s radical brand of politics, has emerged as a powerful force, tilting the political balance further to the left.\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s party has faced allegations of anti-Semitism. In 2016, one lawmaker, Naz Shah, was temporarily suspended for sharing a graphic showing an outline of Israel superimposed on a map of the United States, suggesting the relocation of Israel to North America.\n\nWhen the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone \u2014 a longstanding ally of Mr. Corbyn \u2014 tried to defend Ms. Shah, he instead poured gasoline on the flames by arguing that, in 1932, Adolf Hitler \u201cwas supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\u201d\n\nAfter that crisis, Mr. Corbyn commissioned an inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti, a leading human rights campaigner, which concluded that Labour was not overrun by anti-Semitism but acknowledged that there was an \u201coccasionally toxic atmosphere\u201d in the party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mere fact that the party was having such a discussion would have been all but unthinkable in days past.\n\n\u201cLabour has a very strong tradition of support for Zionism and Israel,\u201d said June Edmunds, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Sussex. That, she added, was \u201cbased on the formative impact of the genocide of the Jews on the postwar generation as well as the view that Jewish nationalism represented a form of anti-colonialism.\u201d\n\nOpinion began shifting after the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, though it was the Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 that generated sharper criticism of Israel alongside growing sympathy for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Ms. Edmunds said. Events in Gaza and Israeli settlement policy have only added to those feelings.\n\nCriticism of Israeli policy is, of course, not the same thing as anti-Semitism, though, as Ms. Edmunds put it, \u201cthere can be overlaps \u2014 within Labour and other parties \u2014 between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nAnd anti-Semitism in wider society has deep roots, as the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, acknowledged in evidence to a parliamentary select committee inquiry into the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe had a shameful record until very recently, in historical terms,\u201d he said, \u201cEngland was the first European country to expel Jewish people, in 1290, with their exile lasting for 350 years.\u201d\n\nNowadays, the insidious anti-Semitism of the British establishment has given way to something more overt. Reported anti-Semitic incidents in Britain have increased, the select committee report noted, accelerated by social media. Ms. Berger has released a snapshot of some of the abuse she has received, including Twitter posts likening her to a pig and calling for her head to be put on a spike. One read, \u201cwaking up and remembering you\u2019re a Jew must be a horrid start to one\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the majority of anti-Semitic abuse and crime \u201chas historically been, and continues to be, committed by individuals associated with (or motivated by) far right-wing parties and political activity,\u201d the report said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Though the story went nowhere, it was remembered by the Jewish community, Mr. Pollard said, adding that \u201cCorbyn\u2019s first statement about freedom of speech genuinely shocked people.\u201d\n\nOther Corbyn controversies have often involved Israeli policy, on which there are different opinions in the Jewish community. But, Mr. Pollard said, \u201cThis mural was classic old fashioned anti-Semitism, nothing to do with Israel at all.\u201d\n\nMr. Pollard said he thought that Mr. Corbyn was indifferent to anti-Semitism, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t see it as \u2018proper racism\u2019 because most Jews are \u2018part of the ruling elite.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Sue Lukes, a member of the pro-Corbyn Jewish Voice for Labour group, said that she knows the Labour leader from their activities in North London politics and that she could vouch for him. \u201cDo I think he\u2019s an anti-Semite? Absolutely not,\u201d she said, describing his Facebook comment on the mural as a \u201cgenuine mistake he was happy to admit to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Lukes and other Corbyn supporters say they detect a plot by internal enemies to undermine a charismatic, left-wing leader.\n\n\u201cThe timing is not coincidental; there has been a lot of talk about what the people who oppose Jeremy Corbyn are likely to do next,\u201d she said, adding that they \u201cmay be thinking that it is quite a neat way to stir things up a bit.\u201d\n\nMs. Luke, whose grandparents died at Auschwitz, said she believed that Labour needed to deal better with complaints of anti-Semitism, adding that the digital era had brought new people into political activism, some of whom were susceptible to internet conspiracy theories.\n\nBut she said she still saw the protest against Mr. Corbyn as politically motivated. \u201cFaith and community leaders should not be interfering to unseat the leader of a political party, or skew the outcome of the elections,\u201d she said, suggesting an intention to damage Labour\u2019s standing in coming local elections and to increase pressure on Mr. Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\n\nStewart Wood, a member of the House of Lords and former aide to the previous Labour leader, Ed Miliband, agreed that Mr. Corbyn was not anti-Semitic \u2014 indeed, for such a committed anti-racist it is \u201ca horrific accusation,\u201d he said \u2014 but he acknowledged that \u201ca few elements inside the left of our party have drifted into it in the past few years.\u201d\n\nUnder the Labour former prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr. Corbyn and his allies felt themselves outcasts in the party, and \u201cthe culture of the tribe of outsiders is to support each other, instinctively,\u201d Mr. Wood said.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Mr. Wood added, \u201cnow that he is leader, the admirable instinct to support people who were with him in the tough times as an outsider can sometimes end up hurting his leadership by giving the impression that he is prepared to tolerate the intolerable.\u201d", "title": "Anti-Semitism Accusations Taint Labour Party, Once Home to U.K.\u2019s Jews", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"]}

To most of us, at least for now, the notion that Mr. Rich, who was fatally shot on a Washington street in 2016, was murdered by Democrats because he was leaking emails to WikiLeaks is absurd. Mr. Rich\u2019s family, on Tuesday, filed a lawsuit against Fox News for promoting the conspiracy story.\n\nBut in the alternative universe of the alt-right, that theory was taken as truth, not because the ranks of the alt-right have found logic in such stories but because those stories feed the larger narrative of a debauched world of liberalism that needs cleansing by fire. The lies are too valuable to the larger movement.\n\nFor Jews, this is personal. Had ordinary Germans and Poles and Ukrainians and Austrians and Frenchmen not played along, had they continued to shop in Jewish establishments and visit Jewish doctors, the Final Solution may, just may, not have been quite so final. To stand up to creeping totalitarianism, we needn\u2019t throw ourselves under the tank treads. We just need to not play the game.\n\nAnd refusal to play that game can be collective.

The German people largely stayed silent, shunning both factions. That anarchic moment always comes to mind when I watch the black-clad, masked antifa protesters preparing for their showdowns with the khaki-wearing alt-right. Antifa cannot be allowed to represent the most vibrant form of resistance, not if the great mass of the American electorate is to join in.\n\nWhen I was in high school in Georgia, I went to a small leadership retreat sponsored by Rotary International. Around a campfire, the other kids passed around a Bible and took turns reading \u2014 from the New Testament, of course. My dread grew as the Good Book drew nearer. Would I hide my Judaism, read a passage on the teachings of Jesus and pretend, or do something, anything, else?

But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.\n\nWith the rise of streaming, the old Hollywood system is cracking. With plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018, Netflix has committed to a strategy of offering something for everyone, and other companies have been tempted to try their luck in an increasingly crowded field. There were 487 scripted shows released last year, a number that will rise to more than 500 in 2018. To keep up with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have thrown money at new projects, while marquee cable players like HBO and FX are focused on holding their place in the market.\n\nAfter a hotly contested bidding war, Apple opened its wallet to sign Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston to star in a series about a morning TV show.

Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.\n\nOf the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.\n\nSchool districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.\n\nStill, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.\n\nPhoto\n\nApple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market.

Defying his mother\u2019s warning he looked at his father\u2019s battered remains when they washed up on a Brittany beach and was deeply shocked. \u201cMy mother cried all day, and I heard her sobbing at night,\u201d Mr. Le Pen writes. Later, he made a farcical attempt to join a resistance unit in Brittany. \u201cMy first war decoration\u201d was a \u201cmagisterial slap\u201d from his outraged mother when he returned home, Mr. Le Pen writes.", "title": "Approaching 90, and Still the \u2018Devil of the Republic\u2019", "authors": []}

But then his DNA overtook the entire Isle Royale wolf population, leading to a climb in inbreeding and genetic defects that proved to be devastating. As of this winter, Isle Royale may be down to its last wolf.\n\nAdding new individuals to a threatened population can also introduce disease or swamp local adaptations.

Sometimes old childhood animosities resurface and guide decisions later in life. Other times spouses point out the flaws in sibling relationships, bringing long-simmering tensions to a head.\n\nThe Dispute Begins\n\nWith the McKees it was a case of two against two, with the brothers who had remained in Jonesboro on one side and their sister and her husband who had made their life in Atlanta on the other.\n\n\u201cThe first visits were incredible,\u201d said Mr. Noel who grew up in affluent Fairfield County, Conn., a world away from a small southern town. \u201cI was stunned at what a close family this was. They all lived next to each other,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nHow the unraveling occurred depends on who is doing the telling. Only Mr. and Ms. Noel were willing to discuss their case. Neither of the brothers, nor their shared attorney, G.S. Brant Perkins, agreed to be interviewed. But voluminous court documents filed in the case clearly lay out both sides.\n\nNot long after Mr. Noel arrived in Jonesboro, he said, he became suspicious that his mother-in-law was being overcharged by her advisers. His initial concern was a homeowners policy, which Mr. Noel said \u201cinsured every last knife and fork\u201d and charged accordingly. He said Jack McKee, who had been given power of attorney by his mother in 2004, gave him permission to help Mrs. McKee with her finances. Jack McKee\u2019s depositions make no mention of such an arrangement.\n\nSanders McKee, the eldest sibling who eventually became a co-trustee of the estate, had a different recollection in his deposition. He said he had been excited to see his sister pregnant and meet her husband. But, he testified, Mr. Noel quickly inserted himself into family matters. On one occasion, according to Sanders McKee, Mr. Noel went into the local branch of Liberty Bank and demanded their mother\u2019s financial information.\n\nIn this telling, Mr. Noel was denied the documents he sought and escorted out.\n\nMr. Noel called the account ludicrous.

They seem unflappable.\u201d\n\nDr. Damour, who has spent her career talking and listening to teenagers, said she believes the Parkland teens are showing the world the potential of their peer group. \u201cThose of us who live with teenagers and are around them can see something that is different about this generation,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is still much to learn about the postmillennial cohort \u2014 social scientists haven\u2019t even agreed on when this generation begins, although there seems to be a consensus forming that the year 2000, give or take a few years, is a good place to start. But data collected from various health surveys already show that today\u2019s teens are different from previous generations in many ways.\n\nMany risky behaviors have dropped sharply among today\u2019s teens. Cigarette smoking among teens is at a historic low since peaking in the mid 1990s. Alcohol use has also declined significantly \u2014 the number of teens who have used alcohol in the past 30 days is down by half since the 1990s. Teen pregnancy rates have hit historic lows, and teens over all are waiting longer to have sex than their parent\u2019s generation. Teen driving fatalities are down about 64 percent since 1975. Some of that is attributed to safer cars, but teen crashes have declined between 10 and 30 percent in states with tiered licensing systems, and teen drunken driving has dropped while teen seatbelt use has increased.\n\nWhile most health researchers celebrate these changes in teen health, some scientists think the trends suggest a lower level of maturity among today\u2019s teens. Perhaps teens are safer simply because their reliance on social media and smartphone use means they are getting out less. In September, the journal Child Development published a study by Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University, noting that there is a decline in a number of \u201cadult\u201d activities among today\u2019s teens. In seven large, nationally representative surveys of eight million American adolescents from 1976 to 2016, fewer adolescents in recent years are having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, driving, working for pay and going out without their parents.\n\n\u201cThe big picture is that they are taking longer to grow up,\u201d said Dr. Twenge, whose latest book is \u201ciGen: Why Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy \u2014 and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While they are physically safer than past generations as a result, rates of teen depression and suicide are on the rise. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMuch of this deterioration can be traced to their phones.\u201d\n\nBut a number of social scientists and adolescent health researchers disagree with that conclusion. While teen depression and suicide rates are worrisome, there is no causal link to show those trends are the result of smartphones and social media. In fact, a literature review by Unicef researchers in December found that moderate use of digital technology tends to be beneficial for children\u2019s mental well-being, while no use or too much use is associated with a \u201csmall negative impact.\u201d The larger issues that affect a child\u2019s well-being are family functioning, social dynamics at school and socio-economic conditions, the report concluded.\n\nDon Tapscott, author of \u201cGrown Up Digital,\u201d said he believes today\u2019s teenagers are better communicators than any previous generation. \u201cThey didn\u2019t grow up being the passive recipients of somebody else\u2019s broadcast,\u201d he said. \u201cThey grew up being interactors and communicators.

It has, however, risen in importance as wage growth \u2014 why it has been slow, and when that might change \u2014 has emerged as a pre-eminent issue in Washington and on Wall Street. Congressional Republicans, their eyes on the fall elections, are seeking evidence that their recently passed tax cuts are making an impact on paychecks. Federal Reserve policymakers are looking for signs that the tightening labor market is causing inflation.\n\nFinancial markets tumbled a month ago after the data showing strong wage gains heightened fears that inflation would pick up, forcing the Fed to hasten interest-rate increases. The report released on Friday had the opposite effect: Stocks rallied on the prospect that strong job growth could continue without causing the economy to overheat.\n\nPhoto\n\nRobin Brooks, chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group, said the market volatility over wages a month ago was \u201cway premature.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarkets are completely overreacting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically have steady-as-she-goes mediocre wage inflation.\u201d\n\nAll economic figures come with significant uncertainty. It is common for different measures to disagree about the pace of job growth, consumer spending and other key indicators. But wages pose a particular measurement challenge. Surveys, the source of much economic data, can be unreliable because people often err in recalling the details of their income, or they may decline to answer questions about it. Companies, for their part, track how much they pay their employees but not necessarily how many hours they work, at least for those who are salaried.\n\nThe measure that tends to get the most attention from investors and the media is average hourly earnings, a figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of each month\u2019s jobs report. The figure, based on a survey of employers, is timely and easily understood: simply the total amount that companies paid workers in a given period, divided by the hours those employees worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the familiarity of the average hourly earnings figure, however, economists say that it is among the least reliable indicators, especially in the short run. The monthly data is prone to distortions because of bad weather or quirks of the calendar (even an oddly timed holiday can skew the numbers). The measure is also affected by trends like the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising health care costs and the spread of contract work \u2014 long-run shifts that affect average earnings in subtle but significant ways.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But these indicators have their own problems, including smaller sample sizes. And almost all are released at a significant delay.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that there is no perfect measure of wage growth,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm. \u201cThere is no right answer; there never will be a right answer.\u201d\n\nThe best way to deal with the conflicting signals, economists say, is to look at a range of indicators \u2014 or to average them together \u2014 and to ignore short-term fluctuations in favor of longer-term trends. Taken together, the various measures suggest that wage growth has been weak but has crept upward gradually as the economy has improved.\n\nFocusing on the long run, however, does not solve another problem that increasingly concerns economists: signs that data about Americans\u2019 earnings and income is getting less reliable. Most government statistics, for instance, have failed to adapt to the rise of the so-called gig economy and other trends that are changing the relationship between companies and workers. The hourly earnings measure in the monthly jobs report excludes Uber drivers and similar contractors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of these measures do very well with nonstandard work arrangements,\u201d said Katharine Abraham, a University of Maryland economist who recently led a government commission that studied how data might inform public policy.\n\nMoreover, Americans are increasingly refusing to respond to government surveys. The response rate to the monthly Current Population Survey, the data source that underlies the unemployment rate and many other key statistics, has eroded in recent years. Of the households that do respond, about a third refuse to provide information about their earnings, a rate much higher than for most other questions. Similar problems have affected other government and private-sector surveys.\n\n\u201cEvery measure of data quality that we look at seems to have declined over time,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, a University of Chicago economist who has studied falling response rates.\n\nEconomists who have studied the issue say that aggregate statistics, like the overall median hourly wage, remain reliable. But falling response rates are a bigger problem when it comes to studying high or low earners, or specific demographic groups. And the shrinking sample sizes make it harder to distinguish between true patterns and statistical noise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGovernment statisticians are trying to find ways to improve the data, perhaps by supplementing surveys with records from Social Security records, tax filings or other sources. But such records pose logistical and potentially legal hurdles, and often are not available on a monthly or even quarterly basis.\n\nThe private sector, too, is looking for solutions. The payroll processing firm ADP recently began releasing a quarterly report on earnings based on data it collects from 330,000 American employers.\n\n\u201cTo really get down to the details with surveys is hard,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, who heads the ADP research group that produces the report. \u201cThis is where the private data comes into the picture.\u201d\n\nIndependent economists said that data from private sources like ADP showed promise, but could not replace government statistics.

People younger than 50 will be expected to work, or to train or search for jobs; attend school full time or volunteer \u2014 80 hours a month. Kentucky and Indiana are imposing the requirement on people younger than 65 and 60, respectively. But Arkansas\u2019s plan has harsher consequences for not meeting the requirement: those who do not comply for three months out of a year will be locked out of coverage until the following year.\n\n\u201cThis is not about punishing anyone,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving people an opportunity to work. It\u2019s about giving them the training they need. It\u2019s about helping them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder.\u201d\n\nSo far, only one other state, Massachusetts, has joined Arkansas in seeking permission to roll back its Medicaid expansion, and make the program available only to people with incomes below the federal poverty level: $12,060 for a single person, or about twice that amount for a family of four. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, states that chose to expand Medicaid had to provide it to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of that level: $16,642 for a single person.\n\nBut if the Trump administration allows Arkansas to scale back its Medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the Obamacare expansion went too far. Other states may be tempted to expand Medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. The federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nThe Arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.\n\nMr. Hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But that could end up costing the federal government more money \u2014 another reason the Trump administration may be slow to approve it. President Trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as \u201cfailing\u201d and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The state uses federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor \u2014 an alternative that conservative Republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. About 285,000 people are now enrolled in the Medicaid expansion.\n\nCindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on March 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they\u2019re meeting it each month. In June, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its Department of Workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.\n\nKentucky, for its part, is sending out the first notices about its work requirement this week and plans to start rolling it out in July. Indiana will not roll out its work requirement until next year.\n\nLike Kentucky and Indiana, Arkansas will exempt people who qualify as \u201cmedically frail\u201d from the work requirement, as well as those who are pregnant, in treatment for substance abuse, in school full time or caring for children or someone incapacitated. Nor will those who qualified for Medicaid before the Obamacare expansion \u2014 children and disabled or elderly adults \u2014 be subject to it.\n\nOnly people from the ages of 30 through 49 will be subject to the requirement this year, and state officials have estimated that about 60 percent of them \u2014 59,714 out of 98,632 \u2014 either work already or will qualify for exemptions.\n\nYounger enrollees, down to the age of 19, will be subject to the work requirement starting next year.\n\nThe National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advocacy group that has already sued to stop Kentucky\u2019s work requirement, said Monday that Arkansas\u2019s also \u201cappears well outside the bounds of the limited authority\u201d that the Department of Health and Human Services has to change Medicaid provisions.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s work requirement program, beyond being legally suspect, will disproportionately harm the most underserved populations,\u201d said Jane Perkins, the program\u2019s legal director.", "title": "Arkansas Wants to Shrink Medicaid.

Most people think that this is a bad thing but some might like it. There are many people in college that are too afraid to go out and try to meet new people at a bar but those people are perfectly comfortable when that can have a conversation before their fist date, whether it\u2019s over an app or over text message. In the opinion article that relates to this question Caleb Keyes of Otterbein University, Class of 2018 said that \u201cIn high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded \u2026\u201d Some people are just more comfortable using dating apps than trying to meet strangers, and that is something that we are going to have to accept as technology becomes a bigger part of our lives.\n\nVictoria Jackson from Wilmington thinks dating apps are shallow:\n\nConstantly in media false ideas of relationships are portrayed. Often times, we conjure up this idea that dating is supposed to come naturally, feel comfortable, and be dreamy. But then we go out in the real world and are faced with the hard truth that dating is anything but what it seems to be in the movies. I\u2019m sure the makers of dating apps thought they were doing everyone a favor, but what they seem to be doing according to Madeline Apple, is \u201c[killing] the college dating scene. Because it\u2019s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it\u2019s become harder to actually meet anyone.\u201d Tinder is an incredibly shallow dating app. You could probably spend hours swiping on \u201cpotential matches\u201d, only those \u201cmatches\u201d don\u2019t lead to many relationships. If you see something you like, you swipe right. It\u2019s not like you get to know that person before you decide that they\u2019re worth swiping for. I personally think that emotion has been taken out of the equation of dating. A perfect example, from what I\u2019ve heard from many users of Tinder, is it\u2019s not geared towards dating, when someone swipes right, they\u2019re not thinking about what your interests are, they\u2019re thinking about how they can get you to spend the night. On another token, on dating websites, people are able to say however they feel. Often times, what they say online, contrasts what they\u2019d say in person, which is usually an awkward experience. Dating online has caused us to forget how to socialize.\n\nNikki Tinnerello from Wilmington warned about catfishing:\n\nDating apps as we all can agree on have definitely changed the way people connect and find love \u2026 or well maybe just hookup. As the article mentioned, Tinder has been popularized as just a one night stand kind of ordeal, I mean how often do you hear someone say, \u201cI fell in love at first swipe!\u201d The idea of Netflix and chill less of a meme now than it is just plain reality. In my opinion apps such as Tinder have taken the reality away from love, turning deep connections and long conversations to get to know one another into shallow meetups. And to top it all off you gotta add in the factor of catfishing, it\u2019s hard to trust and meet someone you don\u2019t even know is real, which could not only lead to heartbreak, but something much more dangerous.\n\nKaley Nesselroade from Wilmington said real connections were lost:\n\nI believe that texting is an important aspect of getting to know somebody. A lot of times people are more comfortable behind their phones and are more willing to express their feelings through text message than face to face. However, texting also comes with miscommunication due to the lack of personal interaction of hearing the intention behind the words used. I agree with the article that \u201cDating apps may have killed the college dating scene.\u201d By using an app like Tinder, and endlessly swiping left or right, people are unable to form real connections. They get caught up in the excitement of it all which makes finding a long lasting relationship that much harder. For me personally, I would never see myself using a dating app. I realize that some people find their soulmate and live happily ever after, but the chances of that over the internet is just too unrealistic. I would prefer meeting someone in the old fashioned way by just letting it happen. Social media has a way of taking out the personal interaction that is necessary to develop a meaningful relationship. If I lived in an era where I could only text or call someone, I would be perfectly happy.\n\nBrooke from Wilmington thinks people need to redefine dating by putting phones down and looking around instead:\n\nTechnology today has defined how we as a society \u201cdate\u201d. I think that it has affected how we communicate with others for better and for worse. While technology can be incredibly helpful for people in long distance relationships, I think there is an aspect of dating that you lose by only getting to know each other through your phone. I\u2019ve heard my parents talk about \u201chow things were different back in my day, we had to go out and socialize\u201d, and I think that there is a great truth to this. It\u2019s bad enough that social media dictates our lives, and it\u2019s even worse when we substitute swiping left or right for meeting people face to face, real human interaction. When you are talking to someone via social media or your phone it becomes so easy to hide who you really are behind the illuminated screen. It\u2019s so much harder to go deep beneath the surface of the \u201cu up?\u201d conversations online and this is causing people to have falsified ideas of what dating and relationships are supposed to look like. I think our society needs to redefine dating by putting down our phones and taking a look around everything and everyone right in front of us.\n\nJames C from North Carolina said face-to-face was best:\n\nTechnology has affected dating tremendously. Instead of having to actually go outside and try to find the right girl or guy, people can just sit down and use their phones. This is definitely not how relationships should be formed. Technology has made what is supposed to be a loving and caring connection to a person become emotionless. If you can\u2019t already tell this is what Tinder and other dating applications have done to people looking to find a meaningful relationship. Anybody can act great and seem like a great guy or girl when they put down fake things and lie about themselves online, but when it is in real life it is special. Nothing in the world of technology will ever bring two people together more than being face to face with one another. Technology has made dating so much worse, and should not be a factor in who you find for a relationship.\n\nMichael DiCenzo from North Carolina said even texting had changed how couples interact:\n\nI strongly believe that technology has affected dating. The app Tinder has ruined the whole experience of trying to find that right fish in the sea. This is also causing people to be preyed on by social media creeps. Even texting has ruined the experience of meeting up with someone and asking how their day was. Even if you go out on a date now a days, you see couples just staring into their phones. Couples are becoming brain dead to what true love really means. Technology makes everyone on a quick conversation format; How are you today and bye. Friendships are not what they were used to be either. In my opinion we should put it down go find that special someone like how it was meant to be. Adrianna dimone from Wilmington, N.C., said tech dating is awkward: When technology is the way, you first meet someone it tends to be awkward in person. It is so much easier to say whatever over the phone or in text, and usually you feel more shy or uncomfortable in person. The example for the writer of the passage explaining how in college she used tender, how she says all the people you see on there see you to. When she was to go out in public people recognized her and she felt embarrassed because all tender is for is to some company your feeling lonely but can usually the connection or first look at each other your eyes lock with theirs. You feel comfortable with them but also talking over the phone leaves out so much from seeing what you love most about that person, from their smile or to the way they play with their hands when their nervous.\n\nBrennan Litzinger from Wilmington said overuse of technology could lead to cheating:\n\nI definitely think technology affects dating and relationships. Anyone can make a profile on an online dating app and the person you meet could be totally different than who you were texting in the app. I believe that it could worsen relationships because if couples are just sitting down and watching Netflix, they aren\u2019t actually talking. I think this could hurt their relationship in the long run. Couples are also more likely to cheat in my opinion with the overuse of technology in their relationship. As the article said, \u201cSomeone I was dating made a friend online which developed into something more, and I was blindsided by it.\u201d I know that technology is a necessity in this day and age, so I think you and your partner should have an agreement on how to use it.\n\nElliott O\u2019Deen from North Carolina thinks people only show the best parts of themselves online:\n\nEverything changes over time. The way people hang out, the clothing people wear, the cars people drive. With time technology will get more and more advanced and we should be able to utilize it but not depend. If you abuse the easy swipe left or right, you might miss someone or not see who a person actually is because everyone is a different person online and only shows the best parts of themselves. If someone has little quirks and cute things they do that they are embarrassed of, that you think are cute, you might never know that and see the real them because you never had a real conversation. If you can\u2019t talk to people and talking to people online helps you and you carefully pick who to swipe on, you might actually find someone. Some people are introverted and would rather talk online first and others are extraverted and not need the assistance of an app. I think people should meet up more and hang out face to face and actually get to know people before they make assumptions but also use what we have because, yes, some people go on 4 dates a week and never establish real connections and others need an app to find people just like them.\n\nEmily Duran from Rhode Island said technology played too big a role in dating today:\n\nPersonally, when it comes to dating I find that technology plays too big of a role. Apps such as Netflix have become a new way of dating. Many couples decide to do things including technology such as Netflix dates, or begin to communicate on social media platforms more often then real life. I find that technology can have both negative and positive effects to relationships. For one, it can help make communication easier, but at some points can also detract from in life communication. I think there needs to be a balance between what we leave to technology, and what we should leave to face to face interactions. However it\u2019s not all negative because dating apps can help bring two people together who might not have been able to meet before.\n\nSydney Durner from Wilmington said all dating was uncomfortable:\n\nAny type of dating can be extremely nerve-racking. There are so many expectations that come with dating. Technology has made it easier to meet new people who live near you and have similar interests to you. Although, online dating is highly casual as opposed to someone you have known for a while and see very often. As one of the articles mentions, \u201cthe same snap asking to \u2018hang out\u2019 sent at 2 p.m. can have a completely different meaning when sent at 2 a.m. Most online dating apps meant for young people, such as tinder, are tailored for the \u201chooking up\u201d crowds, people who want someone to be with, but not for long. These relationships are very casual. They are great for meeting new people, but most \u201ctinder relationships\u201d don\u2019t seem to workout. Technology is a great way to communicate with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or potential love interest that you don\u2019t get to see very often. Yes, you do have the occasional missed text, like Kasey Roper mentions, but if you can\u2019t see this person every single day, texting, snapchatting, calling, and video calls make up for those lost hours and can bring the two of you closer.\n\nEmilia Cordon from Wilmington said online dating was less honest:\n\nI am not a huge proponent of online dating but still see, and reap, the benefits of technology as a means of communication whether we are friends or more. It is a great way to talk to people, because nowadays everyone is busy and can\u2019t always meet. Online dating is the exception. It leeches the true meaning of dating by putting it an algorithm and letting it rip. People are meeting on these sites by the dozen, and quantity is not the same as quality. Rather than opting for a dating site, just meet people and make connections. Sure, not everyone will be relationship material, but at least you are meeting people and probably making friends. Another problem is that people are less intimidated online which does more harm than good. It means that people are less likely to be honest and more likely to feel comfortable behind the mask of the internet. This is scary because you can speak to someone online and think you know them, then see them in person and doubt this. This is a horrible feeling and really makes a person think, is your relationship isolated to the internet or actually more. Relationships are to be made in person, supplemented by the internet, not the other way around.\n\nMonalene Delo from Wilmington said online dating broadened the dating pool for everyone:\n\nDating in today\u2019s world can be very stressful. Meeting people and being social can be intimidating. There are so many apps to meet people. Social media has become the new outlet to meet people. As referenced in the article it is more common to ask someone you like for their Snapchat, then it is to ask for their phone number. We are in a different time with dating. It is a lot different then it use to be. There are definitely a lot of pros and cons, with so many risks. On one hand it gives us great opportunities to meet new people and increase our connections in society. On the other hand we don\u2019t know who is a genuine person just trying to meet someone nice and someone that could be a danger. Interactions with people can be way different online than in person for numerous reasons. One being that it is easier to say things behind a screen than in person. Dating has never been easy, I don\u2019t think that there will ever be a time when it\u2019s going to be easy to put yourself out there. Also mentioned in the article is how social media has transformed the dating scene, which is very true. I think the current dating world we are living in gives us a lot of opportunities to meet people, which is exciting. Because people never use to meet anyone other than someone that lived near them. Overall I do think that it has improved relationships.\n\nTucker G.

(Dozens of people died in the 1919 riot in Chicago.)\n\nThe Chicago Commission on Human Rights (formerly the Mayor\u2019s Commission on Race Relations), which was established after the June 1943 Detroit riot, urged newspaper editors to play down the discord, including an August 1947 attack on black veterans in the Fernwood Park neighborhood and a November 1949 riot that broke out in the Englewood district over rumors that African-Americans were looking to buy in the neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThanks to television, the violence burst into full view in July 1951, when a crowd of at least 2,000 and possibly as many as 5,000 whites in the suburb of Cicero attacked an apartment building after one black family had moved into one of its 20 units. Later that decade, schools, playgrounds, parks and beaches became the sites of racial conflict.\n\nAmbitious programs, billed as \u201curban renewal,\u201d in South Side neighborhoods like Hyde Park-Kenwood and Lake Meadows reinforced segregation. Black politicians, like Representative William L. Dawson, the first African-American to be named chairman of a congressional committee, were muted in their opposition to such projects, partly because they were beneficiaries of the patronage of the city\u2019s entrenched Democratic machine.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs deprived cities of vital tax revenues, exacerbating the problems of the poor neighborhoods.\n\nProfessor Hirsch likened the process of ghetto creation and maintenance to the \u201ccontainment\u201d policies that sought to curb communist expansion abroad during the Cold War. He insisted that the urban crises of the 1960s and \u201970s had not been the fault of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs, which some characterized as liberal excesses, but rather had originated in decisions made a generation earlier.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe compounded shortcomings of slum clearance, urban renewal and segregated high-rise public housing resulted not from an unfettered liberalism\u2019s social experimentation during the civil rights era, but, rather, from a conservative reaction more emblematic of the 1950s and the Cold War,\u201d Professor Hirsch wrote in 1997 in a new foreword to the book.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe \u2018second ghetto\u2019 did not just happen.

We work with something that is intangible \u2014 that direct experience.\u201d\n\nVisitors to Artechouse become part of the display. \u201cIf it\u2019s working right, it\u2019s working like a good dance partner,\u201d Mr. Covington said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want someone just mimicking your moves, but to respond to you and surprise you back, so you wind up in a give-and-take dance.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis kind of activity demands a big space like Artechouse, which provides lighting systems and 17 hanging projectors hidden carefully from the public eye.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe elusive combination of art and technology is enticing in this era of the selfie. \u201cThese big, bold, immersive installations are ones that have a sense of wonderment about them and that notion of spectacle, that sense of being overwhelmed by the work, is very conducive to a social media presence,\u201d said Edward Saywell, chief of exhibitions strategy and gallery displays at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.\n\nAs museums around the world are grappling with what their role is and how to attract new audiences, it comes down to making connections with visitors, he said. \u201cThe power of art is to wake us up \u2014 it is to change us.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, art schools have exploded with a new group of artists who are doing interactive art of a digital nature, said George Fifield, director of Boston Cyberarts, a gallery that regularly includes interactive art in its exhibitions. \u201cAt its best, with this art form, the audience never knows about the computer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about the computer. The art is interacting with your own body and making magic happen.\u201d\n\nMuseums should be \u201ccreating a sense of wonder not just conveying information,\u201d Mr. Covington said. \u201cWe think that is the future of all museums \u2014 not just Artechouse.\u201d", "title": "Artechouse Lights Up Washington\u2019s Museum Scene", "authors": ["Kerry Hannon"]}

But a hodgepodge of state laws govern tax collection, meaning there isn\u2019t a simple solution for municipalities that are now left out.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor example, sales tax rules based on the location of the seller may be impossible to enforce if the company has no physical presence in that jurisdiction. And smaller online retailers can escape collecting sales taxes in more places than Amazon does \u2014 even when they use Amazon to sell their products.\n\nAmazon is facing increasing scrutiny over its tax policies. Despite being one of the largest retailers in the country by revenue, Amazon pays relatively little in federal income tax, largely because of its low profit margins. Until several years ago, Amazon also collected little in state sales taxes, and in most states still does not collect taxes on goods sold on its platform by third parties. (Amazon collects taxes on such third-party sales in Washington State, and agreed this month to begin doing so in Pennsylvania.) The company has also faced criticism for requesting tax incentives from state and local governments to lure Amazon facilities, including its planned second headquarters.\n\nMr. Davis, however, said his findings were less the fault of Amazon than of state tax systems that don\u2019t require, and in some cases don\u2019t allow, online retailers to collect local taxes. He said states rushed to strike deals with Amazon without always ensuring that local governments would benefit as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been overshadowed by the state issue,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller dollars at play, but for these communities, it\u2019s dollars that matter.\u201d\n\nAmazon sometimes collects taxes where other online retailers do not. In Chicago, for example, Amazon collects local taxes because it has warehouses and other facilities in Illinois; online retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the state generally don\u2019t have to collect taxes there.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In most states, taxes are based on the location of the buyer, and retailers are required to collect local sales taxes alongside state taxes. But in some states, including New Mexico, taxes are based on the location of the seller, meaning there is no mechanism for collecting taxes from sellers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in the area. Other states have other legal quirks that affect local tax collections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose loopholes have existed for years, but their significance has grown greatly with the rise of online retail, said Scott Peterson, vice president of government relations as Avalara, a company that helps retailers calculate and collect sales taxes.\n\n\u201cThis huge hole that exists in the sales tax structure has been known for a long time,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cTheir laws have not kept up.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA pending Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., could change the legal landscape, but not necessarily simplify it. Depending on the outcome, the case could pave the way for states to require companies to collect sales taxes even if they don\u2019t have a location in the state. But local governments in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states still wouldn\u2019t be able to collect taxes without help from their legislatures.\n\nLocal government officials in many parts of the country say the rise of tax-free online shopping has had a big impact on their budgets. Albuquerque, for example, relies on the sales tax \u2014 or what is known in New Mexico as a gross receipts tax \u2014 for nearly two-thirds of its general fund revenue, which totaled about $500 million last year. The city\u2019s finance department estimates that it lost out on $5 million in tax revenue on Amazon purchases in 2016, although calculations are difficult because of a lack of available data. Lost revenue from other online retailers adds millions of dollars more.\n\nMr. Keller, the mayor, said Amazon benefited from city services, such as the roads used by delivery trucks carrying its packages and the police officers who makes sure packages aren\u2019t stolen. But unlike local retailers, the company doesn\u2019t chip in.\n\n\u201cThis is the fundamental way we fund American society, and thanks to technology they found a way to opt out of that,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting a free ride.\u201d\n\nFor businesses, the practical effect of that free ride is probably small, at least outside of a handful of high-tax jurisdictions. Local sales taxes add just 1 or 2 percent to prices in most cities, not enough to sway most shoppers\u2019 decisions. But retailers said the tax was a matter of fairness: Why should local businesses be at a disadvantage, however small, against a much larger, out-of-town rival?\n\n\u201cThe 2 percent doesn\u2019t drive someone from my place to Amazon, but it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said Richard de Wyngaert, owner of Head House Books, an independent bookstore in Philadelphia. \u201cI just feel that if not all businesses, why any business? If we don\u2019t all pay taxes, why should any of us? To me, it\u2019s ludicrous. There is a social contract with your citizens.\u201d\n\nCandelora Versace, who with her husband runs a custom jewelry shop in Santa Fe, N.M., said that her customers frequently buy gemstones online, then come into the store to have them put into settings.

In 2017, more than 5,700 rentals hit the market \u2014 the most units in a year since 2008, said Nancy Packes, the real estate consultant. And the future pipeline shows no signs of slowing: About 6,100 units are expected this year, followed by almost 9,600 in 2019.\n\nMs. Packes, whose clients include Brooklyn developers, said the surge in supply is cyclic, with the glut clearing out by 2019 or 2020. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the trees, not the forest,\u201d she said about growth skeptics, noting that demand remains strong, fueled by a strong job market and population growth.\n\nFor renters accustomed to Manhattan prices, Brooklyn can still seem like a relative bargain. After concessions, the median rent price in Manhattan was $3,168 in February, Mr. Miller said; in Brooklyn, it was $2,632.\n\nEileen Norton, 28, who works for IBM\u2019s Watson Health division, is in a two-year lease at the Hub for a one-bedroom apartment, where she lives with her boyfriend Kevin Gallagher, 29, an accountant.

Sandwiched between those two sapphire elements, the components of the skeleton movement, made of solid gold or colored brass, are visible from all angles.\n\n\u201cThe sapphire elements are cut like a gemstone to let the light bounce off their facets,\u201d Mr. Rosillo said. \u201cThis is the closest a watch case has come to a princess-cut diamond.\u201d\n\nThe BR-X1 Skeleton is the fourth in a series of sapphire watches that Bell & Ross has produced, \u201cfor the love of the art,\u201d as Mr. Rosillo put it. The experiments appear to have paid off, as all the previous models have sold out, even though prices ranged from 450,000 euros (today, $551,180) for the BR-X1 Chronograph Tourbillon Sapphire produced in 2016, to \u20ac59,000 for the BR-X2 Tourbillon Micro-Rotor.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised to see the watches sell at these price points because that is not our core business,\u201d Mr. Rosillo said. \u201cBut we were addressing a new type of client who wants a watch that is unique and yet is discreet about how much is on his wrist.\u201d The brand\u2019s watches generally sell for less than \u20ac5,000.\n\nThe new BR-X1 Skeleton is available in an edition of six, the single rose-gold version priced at \u20ac450,000, and five with brass movement components in different colors, priced at \u20ac350,000 euros each.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe blue version of the watch will be displayed at Baselworld but is available exclusively online at Mr. Porter, and its buyer may have the option of being flown privately to Geneva to collect the watch and meet Mr. Rosillo and the watchmaker who worked on the timepiece.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOwning this watch will be a complete experience in luxury from start to finish,\u201d Mr. Rosillo said.\n\n\n\nOther watchmakers also hope to impress buyers and collectors with their creations using the translucent material.\n\nCartier\u2019s R\u00e9v\u00e9lation d\u2019une Panth\u00e8re, introduced in January, has 900 loose beads suspended in oil inside a watch case made of its patented sapphire glass. When the watch is tilted, the beads slowly slide down, mimicking the action of an hourglass, to reveal the panther\u2019s head image against the black, red or green lacquer dial.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis watch was five years in development to achieve the falling of the beads in reaction to the movement of the wearer\u2019s wrist,\u201d said Pierre Rainero, Cartier\u2019s director of image, style and heritage. \u201cWe obtained two patents for this piece: one for the sapphire and the other for the fluid inside that is completely invisible and regulates the speed with which the beads drop inside the case.\u201d\n\nIn the 1930s and \u201940s, Cartier was admired for its desk clocks in which the mechanism seemed to float inside a sapphire case, using a technique invented in the 19th century. This year, Louis Vuitton took that technical prowess a step further with its Tambour Moon Myst\u00e9rieuse Flying Tourbillon, in which the tourbillon seems to float inside the clear case and the crown has no visible connection to the winding mechanism.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat is new here is that both the movement and the winding mechanism are invisible,\u201d said Hamdi Chatti, vice president of the house\u2019s watches and jewelry division. \u201cAll their components are made of sapphire.

The timepiece, introduced in January, was inspired by the Can-Am racecars of the 1960s and \u201970s and made in collaboration with the Finnish watchmaker Stepan Sarpaneva.\n\n\u201cThe sapphire glass was designed like the windshield of a car,\u201d said Charris Yadigaroglou, head of communication at the Swiss watchmaker. \u201cIt is an intrinsic element of the case; it is cut flush with the sides and not encased, so that it can be integral part of the timepiece.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cthe sapphire inside works as an optical prism to transmit the reading of the hours and minutes onto the \u2018headlights\u2019 display of the watch and not the face.\u201d\n\nOne pioneer in sapphire use, Richard Mille, has long been working on improving the shock resistance of the crystals and lessening their weight, as seen in his RM 056 Sapphire Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph, introduced in 2012, and both the RM 56-01 and RM 56-02 models. The sapphire in the latter required more than 1,000 hours of machining and polishing, a process that caused so many crystals to crack that it was limited to 10 pieces, priced at $2.02 million each.\n\nThis year, Mr. Mille has tackled a new challenge with the RM 53-01, designed in partnership with the Argentine polo player Pablo Mac Donough.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mac Donough was in Geneva in January for the introduction of the RM 53-01 at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie.

It would also reduce the number of political appointees.\n\nThe proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Department of Labor. The department proposed to take over adult and unemployed worker programs run by the Labor Department, and to redirect the funding for those programs to federal Pell grants so that unemployed workers can enroll in higher education and vocational programs. The department would acquire an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d program from the Labor Department, as well as a program that helps reintegrate ex-prisoners.\n\nDetails of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees.

It said the money was a foreign political donation intended to affect the outcome of a referendum or election, and therefore banned.\n\nBut so far it does not appear that any anti-abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations, despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf, particularly in the United States.\n\nOne American group, the Pro-Life Action League, told an Irish newspaper in 2012 that anti-abortion groups were raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Irish anti-abortion groups like Youth Defence, which has been linked to far-right movements in Europe.\n\nYouth Defence did not respond to a request for comment. The Pro-Life Action League\u2019s executive director, Eric J. Scheidler, said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti-abortion movement over several decades, and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign.\n\nThe Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which picketed The Irish Times, receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight. \u201cWe are an educational body,\u201d Dr. Engela said.\n\nHe denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote, and asserted that some of the volunteers were full-time activists with their own sources of funding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome commentators argue that anti-abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion-rights groups.\n\nTheresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork, said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums, particularly on issues like the European Union. Over the last decade, even as support for the abortion ban has waned, concerns about possible outside interference have risen, she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSiobhan Mullally, of the Irish Center for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway, said the problem of undeclared foreign funding went beyond the abortion debate, and was \u201calso a question about how charities are funded in general.\u201d\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, long a major power in Ireland, was the main driver in the 1983 referendum. The church also opposed, successfully, a referendum in 1986 that would have legalized divorce. In the decades since, however, its social and moral authority has been gravely weakened by a number of scandals, most notably clerical child sex abuse.\n\nThe church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women\u2019s health. They are also turning to social media tools.\n\nAfter recent revelations about the misuse of Facebook data to sway Britain\u2019s referendum on European Union membership in 2016, and the United States presidential election later that year, fears are growing similar tactics might be used in the referendum campaign.\n\nThe Save the 8th Campaign, an anti-abortion group, has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy, to help run its campaign.\n\nKanto Systems\u2019s founder, Thomas Borwick, was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain, and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign, and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th, which said that Kanto would be performing \u201csome data analytics for us\u201d but would not be engaged in \u201cany voter profiling or voter targeting.\u201d\n\nJohn McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, said that in the Irish electoral system, which does not have online voter rolls, individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible. \u201cIn terms of targeting advertising at individual voters, we couldn\u2019t do that even if we wanted to, which we don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign, Ireland\u2019s largest umbrella anti-abortion group, has retained uCampaign, a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign, the National Rifle Association, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave. (Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment.)\n\nThe Transparent Referendum Initiative, a small group of Irish technology advocates, said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters. This month, the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook. It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum, 55 with anti-abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights.\n\nPolitical advertising is banned on Irish television and radio, but the online world is a different matter.\n\n\u201cThere is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money, that is not going through any official regulated campaign, in order to influence an Irish vote,\u201d said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system. And it\u2019s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques, and Facebook doesn\u2019t have to tell us who\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nResponding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters.\n\nA spokeswoman for Facebook\u2019s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising, and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content.

Skelos, a Republican who was the Senate majority leader. Both men are being retried after their convictions were overturned on appeal last year.\n\nIn June, another former Cuomo ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University\u2019s Polytechnic Institute, is to go on trial in yet another corruption case. The trial of Mr. Kaloyeros, who the governor once said was \u201cas close as I\u2019ve ever come to dealing with a genius,\u201d involves bid-rigging in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signature upstate economic plan, the Buffalo Billion.\n\nThere are some indications that the Percoco trial has hurt Mr. Cuomo\u2019s popularity. A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-February found him with an approval rating of 47 percent. A whopping 63 percent said Mr. Cuomo should not run for president, including almost half the respondents from his own party.\n\nMr. Cuomo has scrupulously avoided talking about the trial, saying he respects the legal process. He has held noticeably few public events in recent weeks, and has mostly avoided unscripted questions from the press.\n\nDemocratic strategists said the corruption case was all but assured to be part of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s national introduction, should he run for president, especially if Mr. Percoco were to be found guilty.\n\nThose looking to paint Mr. Cuomo as being ethically challenged have the benefit of an indelible catchword from the trial: \u201cziti,\u201d the much-used code word that the prosecution contends Mr. Percoco and his fellow conspirator used to describe the under-the-table payments he received while serving as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign manager and senior aide.\n\nHere in New York, even before the jury returns its verdict, a collection of government watchdog groups have issued a scathing assessment of what-we-learned-at-trial, calling out \u201cstunning failures in New York\u2019s ethics oversight system\u201d under Governor Cuomo. The groups also demanded answers to a series of questions raised by the trial, including why \u201cso many high ranking officials were allowed to conduct business through personal emails,\u201d something illustrated, again and again, during testimony.\n\nPhoto\n\nIndeed, the trial reinforced the Capitol\u2019s shoddy reputation for ethics, something Mr. Cuomo promised to fix when he first ran for governor in 2010. Even then, however, the governor seemed willing to take advantage of donor\u2019s generosity: testimony at trial showed that Mr. Cuomo, in the closing days of that campaign, used a private plane from a company, Competitive Power Ventures, r later accused of bribing Mr. Percoco. An executive with another company involved in the scandal, COR Development, a Syracuse-area developer, wooed Mr. Cuomo with talk of Corvettes at a fund-raiser for him, knowing his affinity for those sports cars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Percoco trial also shed light on the use of sometimes shadowy limited liability companies to flood money into state campaigns, including those of Mr. Cuomo, who has been a major beneficiary of the so-called \u201cL.L.C. loophole.\u201d In one instance, the government\u2019s star witness, Todd R. Howe, showed how COR, a company with business before the state, purposefully split contributions \u2014 and used nondescript names on the L.L.C.s \u2014 to hide their origin.\n\nWhile those activities were legal, the disclosures have been met with glee by the governor\u2019s opponents, in particular the beleaguered state Republican Party.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s most outspoken Republican opponent, State Senator John DeFrancisco, said the trial illustrated how Mr. Cuomo \u201chas sold his office to the highest bidder, engaging in shakedown schemes, exchanging government contracts for millions in campaign donations.\u201d Mr. DeFrancisco wrote last week, \u201cSo pathetic, it would make Boss Tweed blush.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, has asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law, and has requested the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to also investigate.\n\nMr. Cox, whose party has not won a statewide election in New York since 2002, saw parallels between Mr. Cuomo\u2019s guilt-by-association and that of former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose proximity to the bridge-closing scandal known as Bridgegate helped dent his national profile.\n\n\u201cThis is the end of Governor Cuomo\u2019s political future,\u201d Mr. Cox said at a news conference last month before the steps of Federal District Court in Manhattan, where Mr. Percoco is being tried.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Among Democrats, no serious primary challenger has yet emerged, though two women, the former Syracuse mayor, Stephanie Miner, and the actress Cynthia Nixon, have publicly toyed with running.\n\nBut if his ambitions extend to the White House in 2020 \u2014 and Mr. Cuomo has increasingly framed his agenda in national terms \u2014 the trial, especially if it ends in a conviction, threatens to muddy his core argument that he can be a capable and trusted custodian of the state, or especially, the country.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of things typically emerge either soon after he first announces or soon after he gains traction,\u201d Mr. Tulchin said. \u201cAssuming he gains any.\u201d", "title": "As Jurors Decide Fate of Key Cuomo Ally, Political Verdict May Be In", "authors": ["Jesse Mckinley", "Shane Goldmacher"]}

But he has since moderated his stance, outlining a more piecemeal approach. Any changes, he said in a recent interview, would rely on money that the M.T.A. already has in its budget, rather than an infusion of cash from the city or state, as is the case with the subway.\n\nMr. Byford has convened a working group inside the M.T.A. to develop strategies to improve bus service and promised to provide specifics in the coming weeks. \u201cWe have to get it right,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the most significant bus initiatives in recent years has been the introduction of buses with designated lanes, all-door boarding and kiosks to pay at before boarding. The service, known as select bus, has been installed on 15 routes over the past decade, where travel times have dropped as much as 25 percent, according to the city. Twenty new routes are planned over the next 10 years, a pace that frustrates advocates.\n\n\u201cThe city and the M.T.A. together lay siege to a bus route, and they spend two or three years doing that and the need for better bus service is much more urgent,\u201d said Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for the Transit Center, a research group.\n\nShowing his interest in buses and how they work, Mr. Byford rode one recently as it lurched down Lexington Avenue and outlined his priorities for the system. They include expanding the traffic light syncing program, encouraging the police to step up enforcement to keep bus lanes clear, dispatching buses in a more even and rapid succession and allowing more riders to pay before they board.

White House officials said that in the coming weeks, the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies would announce more agreements on energy cooperation, infrastructure and economic development in Central American countries, aiming at stemming the flow of migrants, through Mexico, into the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true \u2014 Jared has been a positive influence,\u201d said Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Washington. \u201cOur dialogue is not limited to the White House. However, if we didn\u2019t have that dialogue with Mr. Kushner, the relationship would be much worse off.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Kushner, progress on Mexico would be a bright spot in what has been a difficult stretch. He was recently stripped of his top-secret security clearance and faces a hostile reception from Palestinians to his Middle East peace plan after Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. His future in the White House is regularly scrutinized, though he has told colleagues he is not going anywhere.\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s aides acknowledge his work could be overshadowed by a breakdown in talks over Nafta. The two countries are in the final stages of negotiations, with officials from both sides putting the odds of a deal at no better than 50-50. Then there is the relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which has fallen apart twice during angry telephone exchanges over who should pay for the wall.\n\nThis month, Mr. Trump dispatched Mr. Kushner to Mexico City to mend fences with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto after their latest clash prompted the Mexican leader to cancel a visit to Washington.

These agreements, however useful, cannot repair the damage done by Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory words about Mexicans crossing the border or his demands that Mexico underwrite the wall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for a long time, without all the acrimony, without all the attacks, without the president saying that Mexicans are terrible people,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said.\n\nAt the heart of Mr. Kushner\u2019s involvement with Mexico is the relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Videgaray, a close adviser to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto who, as finance minister, brokered Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico City during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Kushner was thrilled with that visit, particularly since campaign officials feared it could turn into a public-relations disaster for their candidate. It went less well for Mr. Videgaray, who was forced to resign after the Mexican news media savaged the meeting and his role in arranging it. (He later returned as foreign minister.)\n\nMr. Kushner and Mr. Videgaray got to know each other during the transition and have talked regularly since. During Mr. Trump\u2019s first phone call with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the two leaders had a rancorous exchange over trade and the wall but agreed that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Videgaray should draft a statement putting a positive spin on their conversation, according to a transcript that was leaked to The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to hand the Mexico portfolio to Mr. Kushner generated tension with the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, who objected to the president\u2019s 37-year-old son-in-law taking on what he saw as his duties. On his most recent trip to Mexico, Mr. Kushner raised more hackles in the State Department by excluding the American ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, from his meeting with the president.\n\nMr. Kushner, aides said, wanted to have a more intimate meeting and besides, they noted, Ms. Jacobson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, is stepping down. He did include Kimberly Breier, a State Department official recently nominated as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.\n\nGiven Mr. Tillerson\u2019s dismissal and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, who has been nominated to replace him, Mr. Kushner will have to contend with a forceful new player in the diplomatic ranks. But his biggest hurdle to improved relations between Mexico and the United States may be the political calendar in both countries.\n\nMexicans will vote for a new president on July 1, likely removing Mr. Kushner\u2019s friend, Mr. Videgaray, from office. Americans will vote in midterm elections in the fall \u2014 the pressure of which, analysts said, could lead Mr. Trump to revive the disparaging language about Mexico that first necessitated Mr. Kushner\u2019s diplomatic rescue mission.", "title": "As Ties With Mexico Fray, Kushner Works Quietly to Mend Them", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}

Mr. Cohn was the \u201cit boy\u201d of the Trump White House early on until he mildly criticized the president\u2019s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Within days Mr. Avenatti prepared to challenge the deal \u2014 which stipulated that disagreements would be argued in secret before a confidential arbitrator \u2014 arguing it was not valid because Mr. Trump did not sign it. (Mr. Avenatti on Sunday pointed to a clause that said the agreement was \u201cvalid and binding\u201d when \u201csigned by all parties.\u201d)\n\nA suit that Mr. Avenatti filed on Tuesday evening in Los Angeles County Superior Court included a nugget of news: Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer had initiated \u201ca bogus arbitration proceeding\u201d against Ms. Clifford to \u201cshut her up.\u201d\n\nThat appeared to force an error at the White House the next day, when the president\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had been avoiding engagement in Ms. Clifford\u2019s story, said that an arbitration proceeding \u201cwas won in the president\u2019s favor.\u201d That led to news that Mr. Cohen had acquired a temporary restraining order against Ms. Clifford in late February.\n\nMr. Avenatti has been a regular presence on television, arguing that the restraining order and the original deal are both legally flawed, and making allegations aimed at undermining Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.\n\nFor instance, on Friday, Mr. Avenatti shared with NBC News and then ABC News that Mr. Cohen had conducted some negotiations with Ms. Clifford in 2016 on his Trump Organization email account. That, Mr. Avenatti told NBC, was at variance with Mr. Cohen\u2019s previous statement that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign were \u201cparty to\u201d the agreement with Ms. Clifford. Mr. Avenatti also suggested that the email cast doubt on Mr. Cohen\u2019s assertion that he paid Ms. Clifford out of his own pocket.\n\nWhether Mr. Trump ever reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and the extent to which he struck the deal in consultation with Mr. Trump, goes to the center of complaints the watchdog group Common Cause has made to the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department alleging that the payment was an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nAfter Mr. Avenatti\u2019s comments, Mr. Cohen broke his relative silence about the case by telling ABC News that he drew on his own home equity line of credit to secure the $130,000 for Ms. Clifford. And The Washington Post quoted him over the weekend as saying, \u201cMr. Avenatti\u2019s actions and behavior has been both reckless and imprudent as it opens Ms. Clifford to substantial monetary liability, which I intend to pursue.\u201d", "title": "As \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Prepares Stormy Daniels Interview, Lawyers Wrangle", "authors": []}

There have been many causes of the turbulence this month and last. Investors initially were fearful that the economy was getting too strong, and that rising wages might cause inflation, which would push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster than investors previously had expected. Those concerns have partly faded as recent economic data showed that inflation remained in check.\n\nMore recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.\n\nA growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.\n\nNow, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy.

We had no TV in the house when the kids were little (1967-1985), begrudgingly got one and kept it in the basement when they were teens, and then abandoned it when they left the nest.\n\nBut now \u2026 with more time on our hands and (we like to think) some great things to watch, we want to make up for lost time. A 30-60 minute show is a great interlude before bedtime! But we simply do not know where to begin.\n\nWe are torn between \u201ccatching up\u201d with shows that portray our generation (like \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d) or \u201cmoving forward\u201d with shows that are popular with younger folks now \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which would require a great deal of watching if we wanted to catch up.\n\nIn summary: Advice, please, for formerly TV-averse baby boomers.\n\nDear Formerly TV-Averse,\n\nI don\u2019t even like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d that much, but I think you should give it a try, especially if you\u2019re inclined toward fantasy stuff in general. There are currently 67 episodes, which maybe sounds like a lot, but even if you only did a few a week, that\u2019s barely a trimester\u2019s worth of viewing.\n\n0\n\nThe best reason to watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d isn\u2019t that it\u2019s good, it\u2019s that it\u2019s often fun to engage with. When it\u2019s in season, it is the show people want to talk about, and trading theories and gripes and hopes is like being in a large, joyous, dorky club. Water cooler shows barely exist anymore, but this is one of them. I like the discourse; I like the disagreements; I like pestering my one friend who is a \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d obsessive with my questions about exactly who everyone is.\n\nIf you care not at all about ephemera, or you dislike gruesome violence, then I hereby grant you total dispensation from having to care at all about \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s never been a better time to catch up on TV, and the great news is that we\u2019re all doing it. Younger folks are watching \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cMad Men\u201d for the first time, too. \u201cThe Office\u201d is somehow popular with teenagers. People tell me all the time that they\u2019re finally getting around to watching \u201cThe Wire.\u201d I can\u2019t stop talking about \u201cER\u201d and recommending it to every person I know who hasn\u2019t seen it before. (And even to those who have.)\n\nSo where should you start?\n\nStart with \u201cFrasier.\u201d \u201cFrasier\u201d is smart and funny and easy to watch, and even though it debuted in 1993, it\u2019s remarkably timeless. You can also come and go from it as you please; if you get tired of it, just move on to different show \u2014 it\u2019s not as if some lingering cliffhanger will haunt you. It\u2019s also weirdly zeitgeisty, with a surprisingly robust Twitter presence.\n\nBuild yourself a balanced breakfast. \u201cFrasier\u201d is the comedy to start with, but you need a drama, too. For that, let\u2019s move ahead in time a little to \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a superb lawyer show that debuted in 2009. Its spinoff, \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d is currently airing (well, streaming on CBS All Access), and it is pretty good, too.\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll be able to tell if you want more of the same, or something different. More shows like \u201cFrasier\u201d? Well, \u201cCheers\u201d for starters (it\u2019s where Kelsey Grammer\u2019s Frasier character was introduced), and then \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Other good lawyer shows? Try \u201cDamages,\u201d or if you want something quicker, \u201cGoliath.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s never a bad idea to visit the HBO catalog: \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cDeadwood,\u201d \u201cEnlightened,\u201d \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show,\u201d \u201cIn Treatment,\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under.\u201d\n\nIf what you really want is series you can start and finish in a short period of time, embrace the mini-series. Watch the classic 1981 \u201cBrideshead Revisited,\u201d which is 11 episodes. Or try the recent British mini-series \u201cNational Treasure,\u201d which is just four. If you like documentaries, you have to watch both \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d series.\n\nFinally, free yourself of any kind of pressure or worry that there\u2019s a single \u201cbest\u201d way that you\u2019re in danger of not following. Did you watch something you liked? Then congratulations, you won.\n\nRead more: I Grew Up Without TV.

Drug makers have had less success lobbying in other parts of the world.\n\nI asked Novo Nordisk about this. Anthony Anderson, who plays Dre, has diabetes in real life and is the company\u2019s paid spokesman. His story is compelling. Not only did he struggle coming to grips with the disease, but his father died of complications from diabetes a decade ago.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we felt was important was it needed to be natural and it needed to tell his story, but it also needed to be medically accurate,\u201d said David Moore, a senior vice president at Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe had individuals from our medical affairs really review the script, in the context of this is what a conversation would really sound like with a clinician.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nABC declined to comment.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I feel about a drug company\u2019s collaborating on a sitcom script, though it\u2019s a little weird that the story and the commercials ran together. More important, it probably doesn\u2019t help the soaring cost of prescription drugs. Companies spend more than $6 billion a year on this kind of advertising, according to Kantar Media.\n\nAdvertising budgets are by no means the biggest factor in drug costs. There is blame to go around.\n\nDrug companies are stretching out their patent protections by seeking approvals for existing drugs to treat different diseases. There is also no nationwide body negotiating drug prices as you\u2019ll find in other countries, and insurers are often looking out for themselves rather than patients. Sometimes buying a drug with insurance is even more expensive than without it, or insurers refuse to cover the cost of a generic drug.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They also change with public health trends and research and development investments.\n\nThe closer a patent gets to expiring, the less enthusiastic companies can get about advertising. Hence the era of erectile dysfunction commercials for Viagra and Cialis yielded to omnipresent spots for Humira and Enbrel, used for rheumatoid arthritis and a range of other conditions.\n\nGroups like the World Health Organization and Public Citizen have raised concerns. The drug industry, as you might imagine, wants to keep advertising.\n\nCommercials \u201ccan benefit health care professionals, as well as patients,\u201d said Holly Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, in an email.

When England won the Ashes, a competition between England and Australia, in 2005, the English player Marcus Trescothick later admitted that he had applied saliva to one side of the ball after sucking mints. That tactic is thought to affect the flight of the ball by making one side slightly shinier.\n\nAnd when Australia last hosted South Africa in a series in 2016, the South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was caught sucking mints and then using his saliva to polish the ball on one side, again to try to alter the flight and bounce. He was later fined his match fee.\n\nThe incidents highlight how hard it is to eliminate ball-tampering, which is notoriously difficult to prove \u2014 adding saliva is legal, but doing so while sucking mints is not.\n\nSome have suggested that the laws should be revised, perhaps by legalizing some aspects of treating the ball, like using saliva after sucking candy or mints, that are especially hard to police.\n\nYet the actions of Bancroft \u2014 and, especially, Smith in instructing him \u2014 are seen as falling well beyond the normal ambiguity of the law. The Australians\u2019 actions amounted to nothing less than flagrant cheating.\n\nEven worse, perhaps, is the sense of what it revealed about the team, adding to simmering concerns about how far the Australian side are prepared to go in pursuit of an edge. During the recent Ashes victory against England, Australia came under criticism for what is known as sledging \u2014 the cricket equivalent of trash-talking \u2014 and for bowling the ball hard into the ground to make it bounce in the direction of the opponent\u2019s head.", "title": "Astonishing Admission of Cheating Rocks Australian Cricket", "authors": []}

It was also just a few weeks after the queen of England bestowed upon Ms. de Havilland, whose estranged and equally famous sister Joan Fontaine died in 2013, the title of dame for her service to drama.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen \u2018Feud\u2019 was first being publicized, but before it went on the air, I was interested to see how it would portray my dear friend Bette Davis,\u201d Ms. de Havilland wrote in an email. \u201cThen friends and family started getting in touch with me, informing me that my identity was actually being represented on the program. No one from Fox had contacted me about this to ask my permission, to request my input, or to see how I felt about it. When I then learned that the Olivia de Havilland character called my sister Joan \u2018a bitch\u2019 and gossiped about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford\u2019s personal and private relationship, I was deeply offended.\u201d\n\nThe last time Ms. de Havilland had a case before the California Court of Appeals was in 1944. Risking her career, she sued Warner Bros. to get out of her contract, which she had signed in 1936. She had been suspended for refusing parts assigned to her, a common ploy among studio bosses to keep their stars in line, with the missed time tacked on to the length of her deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was 28, a brunet ing\u00e9nue from English stock, raised in what she has wryly called \u201cthe most aristocratic village in the prune belt\u201d of Northern California. In the 1930s alone, she had starred with the swashbuckling Errol Flynn in six films, including \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood,\u201d and was lent out to David O. Selznick for the role that would make her an American treasure: Melanie Hamilton in \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d\n\nShe won then, tipping the scales of studio autocracy and strengthening a California labor statute. The so-named De Havilland Law prohibits the enforcement of a personal services contract beyond seven years.\n\nThree quarters of a century later, Ms. de Havilland is hoping for another victory. \u201cFeud,\u201d she claims, as a work of historically convincing fiction, falsely exposes her as a hypocrite \u2014 \u201cwith a public image of being a lady and a private one as a vulgarity-using gossip,\u201d violating Ms. de Havilland\u2019s hard-earned reputation for \u201chonesty, integrity and good manners.\u201d\n\nThese are qualities that may seem quaint in the age of Twitter. But the legal action arrives during a content boom that has sent writers \u2014 and big-league actors and producers \u2014 raiding recent history sometimes before it has pickled, looking for figures and epochs to refashion as entertainment.\n\nPhoto\n\nCourts have overwhelmingly supported First Amendment protections for movies and TV shows about figures and subjects in the public interest. But Ms. de Havilland is undaunted.\n\n\u201cA large part of the reason I decided to move forward with my action against Fox is that I realize that at this stage of my life and career I am in a unique position to stand up and speak truth to power \u2014 an action that would be very difficult for a young actor to undertake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believe in the right to free speech, but it certainly must not be abused by using it to protect published falsehoods or to improperly benefit from the use of someone\u2019s name and reputation without their consent. Fox crossed both of these lines with \u2018Feud,\u2019 and if it is allowed to do this without any consequences, then the use of lies about well-known public figures masquerading as the truth will become more and more common. This is not moral and it should not be permitted.\u201d\n\nMs. de Havilland agrees to interviews sparingly, often mentioning her love of Champagne, and has never cooperated with an official biography. Hollywood chroniclers have described relationships with Mr. Flynn, John Huston and Howard Hughes, but she has remained regally mum, in contrast to her voluble friend Ms. Davis, who died in 1989.\n\nMs. de Havilland\u2019s memoir, \u201cEvery Frenchman Has One,\u201d published in 1962, is about being an American new to France, where she moved in 1955 after marrying her second husband, Pierre Galante, then the editor of Paris Match. She continued to work in movies while raising two children: a daughter Gisele, her child with Mr. Galante; and a son, Benjamin, from her first marriage to the novelist and screenwriter Marcus Goodrich. Tracey Jackson, a longtime friend, calls her \u201calmost Garboesque\u201d in her protectiveness over her private life.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen came \u201cFeud.\u201d\n\nA lavish piece of early 1960s period dish, it had considerable pedigree in its Oscar-winning leading ladies, Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis and Jessica Lange as Joan Crawford, and Mr. Murphy, whose portfolio of prestigious docudramas includes \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d and \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace,\u201d both part of his \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d serial.\n\n\u201cFeud\u201d explores Ms. Davis\u2019s and Ms. Crawford\u2019s longtime hatred for each other and their uneasy alliance during the making of \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,\u201d the 1962 horror movie that finally united them onscreen. Directed by Robert Aldrich, it was a surprise hit in a Hollywood being slowly subsumed by the counterculture, featuring a sadistic Ms. Davis in Kabuki makeup mentally torturing her paraplegic sister, played by Ms. Crawford.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor her performance, Ms. Davis received her final Best Actress nomination, evidently sending the spurned Ms. Crawford on a furious campaign of Oscar-night, anti-Bette subterfuge. (One cannot imagine Frances McDormand and Meryl Streep clashing like this.) In the end, Ms. Davis lost to the absent Anne Bancroft for \u201cThe Miracle Worker,\u201d and a triumphant Ms. Crawford strode onto the stage to accept the statuette in Ms. Bancroft\u2019s honor.\n\nMs. de Havilland\u2019s character is used as a framing device for the Davis-Crawford cage match that unfolds in \u201cFeud,\u201d opening the series with the lines: \u201cFor nearly half a century, they hated each other, and we loved them for it.\u201d Ms. Zeta-Jones is posed on a love seat at the 1978 Oscars, giving an interview. \u201cFeud\u201d meticulously copied the black dress and sheer caftan the real Ms. de Havilland wore to the Oscars that night, as well as her glittering pendant and blond coif. This physical copycatting is behind Ms. de Havilland\u2019s right-of-publicity claim. Her claims of false light relate to the interview itself, which she says she never gave.\n\nTo prevail, Ms. de Havilland will have to convince a jury not only that the interview was fabricated, but also that it includes sentiments that the writers of \u201cFeud\u201d either knew were false or profferred in reckless disregard for the truth, causing economic damage to her reputation and \u201cemotional distress.\u201d Lawyers for Ms. de Havilland and FX are also engaged in a byzantine fact-check over Ms. de Havilland\u2019s use of coarse language in other scenes, most notably in reference to her sister, Ms. Fontaine.\n\nMs. Smith maintains that her client, at a minimum, should have been consulted about the project ahead of time. \u201cShe would have considered, what was their proposal?\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAre they proposing to compensate her? They would have found out that certain things were not true. Because they didn\u2019t even try, in their arrogance and hubris, they didn\u2019t take what we would argue are reasonable steps to find out what was true, and what wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe network says that Ms. de Havilland\u2019s consent was not needed, because \u201cFeud\u201d falls squarely under protected speech around fictional works in the public interest. Additionally, it contends that her portrayal is positive. \u201cWhile I understand Ms. de Havilland alleges that she was portrayed as a gossip, the opposite is true,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, who declined to comment for this article, in a declaration attached to FX\u2019s defense. \u201cShe is portrayed as a wise, respectful friend and counselor to Bette Davis, and a Hollywood icon with a unique perspective on the past.\u201d\n\nLast August, the network filed a motion to dismiss the case under California\u2019s anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, which allows for the quick dismissal of lawsuits that want to chill free speech. One month later, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Holly Kendig issued her ruling: While \u201cFeud\u201d arose from protected speech, Ms. de Havilland had adequately shown enough cause to deserve her day in court, with the suit fast-tracked because of the plaintiff\u2019s advanced age.\n\nPhoto\n\nLegal observers were surprised.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual for this type of case to proceed past anti-Slaap,\u201d said Jennifer Rothman, a professor at Loyola Law School and the author of a forthcoming book called \u201cThe Right of Publicity: Privacy Reimagined for a Public World.\u201d If the de Havilland decision were allowed to stand, Ms. Rothman said, \u201cthen that upends the film industry, the TV industry, the video game industry. Anyone who is trying to make stories based on true events with real people are not going to be able to do so without permission.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Ms. de Havilland has the backing of the Screen Actors Guild, considerable forces have amassed against her. The Motion Picture Association of America and the streaming behemoth Netflix, which just signed Mr. Murphy to an exclusive producing deal reportedly worth $300 million, filed an amicus brief urging the appellate court to reverse the trial judge\u2019s decision\u2014an unusual alliance in a universe of legacy companies fending off big-monied new media, but perhaps necessary to squash a uniquely sympathetic plaintiff.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Further, they cite a vintage Warner Bros. blooper reel in which Ms. de Havilland lets forth with, \u201cOh, Christ, son of a bitch,\u201d after flubbing a line on the set of the 1946 film \u201cDevotion,\u201d in which she played the author Charlotte Bront\u00eb.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. de Havilland insists that the clip and others like it, which live on via YouTube, are exceptions. \u201cLooking back at my younger self, I wish I had been more guarded in my language,\u201d she told the court. \u201cBut these outtakes or bloopers are just that, mistakes and errors, not language that I did or would use in discussing other friends or family in a normal, polite, private or public forum.\u201d\n\nAs for the suggestion that Ms. de Havilland never publicly gossiped: \u201cPlaintiff gave many other television and print interviews in which she commented on other actors,\u201d according to FX\u2019s defense. \u201cIn an Academy of Achievement video interview, she criticized British actor Ralph Richardson: \u2018He would do rather naughty things. He was a glove flapper.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn its clearest form, the right of publicity, an offshoot of privacy law, is meant not as a tool of censorship but to enable celebrities and other public figures to protect their images from false or unauthorized endorsements of products. In California, a hub of entertainment where the law is most hotly contested, the issue hinges on whether the person\u2019s identity has been transformed \u2014 in other words, used as \u201cthe raw materials\u201d for creative expression \u2014 or merely co-opts the \u201csum and substance\u201d of the person wholesale.\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause the makers of \u201cFeud\u201d admitted that they wanted to make the appearance of the de Havilland character as real as possible, Judge Kendig said, her likeness was not transformed, leaving the mini-series open to a right of publicity claim.\n\nOn her right-of-publicity website in the last month alone, Ms. Rothman has tracked claims against \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d brought by an actor from the movie \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d and one by the estate of the jazz legend Thelonious Monk against a microbrewery making Brother Thelonious beer. In California cases like Ms. de Havilland\u2019s, are measured against a 2001 state Supreme Court ruling that established the transformative test to begin with.\n\nIn that case, the owners of the post-mortem rights of the Three Stooges sued a celebrity lithographer, Gary Saderup, for selling T-shirts bearing the comedy trio\u2019s images. The court found that Mr. Saderup was liable because his drawings were too imitative, failing to \u201ctransform\u201d the Stooges\u2019 likeness. (In its ruling, the court drew a distinction between Mr. Saderup\u2019s literal depiction of the Stooges and Andy Warhol\u2019s transformative screen prints of Marilyn Monroe.)\n\nMs. Rothman believes right-of-publicity law is more urgently needed in cases of catfishing and revenge porn, where the victims aren\u2019t celebrities or inherent publicity seekers.\n\nThere is precedent on both sides. Lawyers for Ms. de Havilland point to the Stooges case as well as a 2011 California appellate court ruling that found in favor of the band No Doubt, which sued the video game publisher Activision for violating the terms of a licensing agreement in the game Band Hero.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawyers for FX are more partial to a 1979 State Supreme Court decision disallowing a post-mortem right-of-publicity claim against a fictionalized TV movie about the life of Rudolph Valentino. Or an appellate court\u2019s 2016 denial of a claim brought by former Army Sgt. Jeffrey Sarver, an explosive ordnance disposal technician who sued the makers of the Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d\n\nAs in \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d case, \u201cFeud\u201d \u201cis a docudrama, and therefore scenes are dramatized \u2014 i.e. transformed,\u201d the defense motion in de Havilland reads. Besides, Ms. Zeta-Jones wasn\u2019t even in enough of the mini-series to merit inclusion in the show\u2019s opening credits.\n\nAsked via email if her retirement from acting was a decision she came to with ease or difficulty, Ms. de Havilland said: \u201cI would like to answer your question with another: How many roles of significance are written for women of advanced years?\u201d\n\nAs \u201cFeud\u201d chronicles, she replaced Ms. Crawford on the \u201cBaby Jane\u201d follow-up, \u201cHush \u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte\u201d (though not before she either did or didn\u2019t tell the director, Mr. Aldrich: \u201c\u201cDarling, you know how much I hate to play bitches. They make me so unhappy.\u201d).\n\nBy the \u201970s, and \u201980s, Ms. de Havilland was down to sporadic mini-series, disaster movies and TV guest spots. In 1981 came an episode of \u201cThe Love Boat.\u201d The last movie she appeared in, for British TV, was in 1988.\n\nIt\u2019s a sadly familiar story about how Hollywood treats its female elders, something that Mr. Murphy kept pointing to as motivation for covering the Crawford-Davis story.

Just as the fairs can educate visitors about artists, they can seduce them into paying too much or buying too quickly. But experienced collectors advise caution for newcomers, saying it\u2019s better to wade in slowly.\n\nOn the other side, the mix of money and a broad audience has made fairs important not just to young artists and gallery owners but to some of the top artists and dealers in the world.\n\nThe David Zwirner Gallery, with spaces in New York, London and now Hong Kong, will show and sell work at 20 fairs around the world this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re educating the world about our program, but we\u2019re also getting to know the buyers in each market,\u201d Kristine Bell, a senior partner at Zwirner, said.\n\nThaddaeus Ropac, who operates five galleries in Europe, said he often used fairs to highlight different works by an artist he was showing in one of his galleries. Last year, he mounted a show of works by Georg Baselitz, a German painter and sculptor, in one of his Paris galleries. At the same time, he sold pieces by the artist from different points in his career at several fairs.

And then everyone departs, as if leaving town at night with the big top.\n\n\u201cWhen we started, there were maybe six fairs,\u201d said Nicole Berry, executive director of the Armory Show, which is in its 24th year. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a fair somewhere in the world every weekend.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Armory Show, spread over more than 250,000 square feet, will include about 200 galleries from 31 countries and sell art priced from several thousands of dollars up to millions, Ms. Berry said.\n\nOpinion about fairs among art advisers \u2014 those people who guide the hearts, minds and wallets of top collectors \u2014 is split.\n\n\u201cA fair offers the opportunity to see as much work as possible in a short amount of time,\u201d said Ashley Carr, a co-founder of the Modica Carr Art Advisory in New York. \u201cThat has its benefits for people who are incredibly busy and can\u2019t go to galleries every weekend or can\u2019t travel to shows.\u201d\n\nShe creates a plan for her clients so they can make the most of their time, looking at art, talking to the gallery owners and sometimes meeting the artists.\n\nBut Lisa Schiff, an international art adviser who has consulted for the actor Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s foundation, takes a different view. \u201cI don\u2019t like fairs because it\u2019s a pileup of merchandise,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Schiff cautioned collectors, particularly new ones, not to buy at an art fair. That same atmosphere that creates excitement makes it hard to properly assess an artist, she said. But she acknowledged the convenience, comparing the experience to ordering online as opposed to shopping at a smaller business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI usually end up doing a lot of business at fairs even though it\u2019s not my intention,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Lumpkin, who sits on the board of the Studio Museum in Harlem, had several pieces of advice for a first-time fairgoer or buyer. Avoid being taken in by any hype around an individual artist, he said: \u201cBuy with your eyes and not with your ears.\u201d\n\nAttendees also need to strike a balance between impulse and hesitation. On the one hand, he said, people should not be afraid to wait and follow up after the fair if they see something they like. On the other hand, he said, \u201cif you see something good and like it, jump on it before it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s those types of conflicting emotions that make fairs exciting but also risky for buyers prone to quick decisions. The lead sponsor of this year\u2019s Armory Show is Athena Art Finance, which specializes in lending quickly to collectors buying art.\n\n\u201cClients, literally in front of the painting, text me a picture and say, \u2018How much would you lend me if I bought this painting?\u2019\u201d said G. Andrea Danese, president and chief executive of Athena.\n\nThe answer is less than the purchase price. \u201cThe sale price isn\u2019t so relevant to us \u2014 it\u2019s inflated,\u201d Mr. Danese said. Generally, if the work is by a known artist with a sales history, the firm takes 20 to 25 percent off the price and then lends about half that amount.\n\nThe company, which has been open for about three years, has $180 million in loans outstanding, ranging from four months to five years.\n\nBut that type of financial engineering is at the top of the art fair market.\n\nMr. Lumpkin, who attended a private reception on the opening night of the Art Show this week, said he still appreciated the fairs for the openness they projected in the otherwise rarefied world of high-priced art. He called them \u201cone of the few democratic arenas where anyone can, in theory, walk in and buy something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, the reality is that a lot of the best work is already presold or on reserve when the fair opens,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd just because you can afford to buy a work of art doesn\u2019t mean the gallery will sell it to you,\u201d because galleries often want their artists\u2019 work in the hands of respected collectors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for an afternoon, at least, an art fair lets you dream. \u201cEnjoy the people-watching,\u201d Ms. Schiff said, \u201cand the food.\u201d", "title": "At Art Fairs, Keep an Open Mind, but Watch the Wallet", "authors": ["Paul Sullivan", "Wealth Matters"]}

It seemed at first that Mr. St. Hubert might mount an insanity defense, but two psychiatric evaluations concluded that he was competent for trial. He is charged with second-degree murder and with attempted murder.\n\nAt the trial, in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, Mr. St. Hubert, 31, sat beside his lawyer each day, mostly stone-faced and wearing a rosary. It was the victim\u2019s loved ones who often showed emotion. When gory photographs of P.J.\u2019s body and the elevator\u2019s bloody floor were introduced as evidence, the children\u2019s relatives gasped aloud and wept.\n\nThough the early investigation progressed in fits and starts, by the time the trial began, the prosecution had amassed a trove of evidence. That included four separate witnesses who claimed they had seen Mr. St. Hubert leaving the building where the stabbings occurred and cellphone records that placed him in the area at the time of the attacks. There was also the DNA connecting him to the knife and the testimony of Mikayla, now 11, who said that Mr. St. Hubert had suddenly assaulted her and P.J. after they were chatting in the elevator and refused his order to shut up.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He reminded the panel not only that the defendant\u2019s DNA had been discovered on the handle of the weapon, but also that a set of matching knives had been found at the homeless shelter where he had been living when the children were attacked.\n\nBut it was only toward the end of his presentation that Mr. O\u2019Connor addressed the issue of a motive. The jurors, who will be on a break next week, will not begin deliberations until April 9, but as Mr. O\u2019Connor prepared to leave the case in their hands, he said that Mr. St. Hubert had \u201ca generalized intent to harm society\u201d and wanted \u201cto put the fear of God in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was out there to kill,\u201d he said.", "title": "At Brooklyn Trial, a Motive in Child\u2019s Murder Remains Elusive", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

When I get three or four of these volunteers on the same morning, it invariably means that while I was sleeping other people were reading the advance press on an incipient opening that sounds both unusually enticing and intimidatingly expensive.\n\nThe most recent rush of volunteers, it turned out, was inspired by the arrival in December of a Manhattan branch of the Beijing-based restaurant DaDong.

For japchae, chewy sweet-potato glass noodles the color of fading photographs are tangled with wood ear mushrooms, skinny strips of carrot, darkened spinach and cabbage still holding its crunch.

The production\u2019s choreographer and the only woman onstage, she used five supporting male dancers who often appeared bare-chested. She, at her most gracious and skillful, did a great deal with shawls. But you could believe that, as the program says, she first formed an independent flamenco company in 1998. For her, everything seemed to be happening for the thousandth time.\n\nMr. Carmona\u2019s show, \u201c\u00cdmpetus,\u201d suffered from the same overproduction. Some sections featured a scrim, with Mr. Carmona in front and his colleagues behind; others presented Mr. Carmona as just one of the troupe. Lighting, by David P\u00e9rez, often gave absurd emphasis to the slightest change of personnel onstage, as when one woman left the stage (sudden darkness on that side before her exit) and then, a few seconds later, returned with castanets (whereupon the stage light was transformed).\n\nBut whereas Ms. Yerbabuena\u2019s production values express the often synthetic nature of her presentation, Mr. Carmona\u2019s merely distract from the force of his dance theater. In his early 30s, he contains a number of contradictions. His troupe is called Ballet Flamenco Jes\u00fas Carmona, and it\u2019s not hard to identify several ballet-derived ingredients \u2014 as in the partnering, arm positions and lightness of one male-female pas de deux. Nonetheless, Mr. Carmona\u2019s general emphasis is brilliantly percussive, his rhythms often develop an exciting irregularity, and, though he uses the upper body well (both in his own dancing and his colleagues\u2019), he usually avoids any balletic refinement. He\u2019s fond of series of rapid single pirouettes, but one of his fortes is the way he does these with his torso thrillingly angled way off the vertical.\n\nA detail that increasingly entranced me was the simplicity of Mr. Carmona\u2019s hands. Often, keeping wrists, thumbs and palms still, he would just move the four fingers softly to the beat: a wonderfully gentle effect from a dancer who at first seemed so flamboyant.

He told them to look for a ledger, noting which stamps were used for which decorations, as well as proof sheets of the stamps\u2019 designs.\n\nA treasure hunt followed and, along with the ledger, they finally discovered a large box full of cards listing the medals and the corresponding stamps attached with wire. \u201cIt felt like Christmas,\u201d Ms. Hemmerle, 34, said with a smile.\n\nThe most striking jewels in the anniversary collection \u2014 which has nine earring designs, a bangle and a brooch \u2014 are the Pegasus earrings. They depict the winged horse of Greek mythology in pav\u00e9 diamonds, flying gracefully across a night sky of midnight-blue anodized aluminum.\n\nThe Pegasus motif originated with a tiny iron stamp once used for the arts medal of the Maximiliansorden, an order established in the 1800s by King Maximilian II of Bavaria to recognize outstanding achievements in science and art. Hemmerle started making the decoration in 1905, and the medal, held by a maximum of 100 people at any time, is one of only two it still produces for the Bavarian government.\n\nLike most of Hemmerle\u2019s creations, the earrings started with a rudimentary sketch. Despite the modernity of its aesthetic, Hemmerle rejects computer-aided design. \u201cThe lines all look the same if created by computer, no matter the house designing them,\u201d said Christian Hemmerle, 37.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, the Hemmerles trust their 22 artisans to interpret what they want into hard metals and gemstones. \u201cOur sketches are a language that the goldsmiths must decipher. They\u2019re our hieroglyphics,\u201d said Ms. Hemmerle, who was born in Egypt.\n\nPhoto\n\nHer birthplace inspired an Egyptian collection by Hemmerle in 2012, and, in October, the house will present a second anniversary collection based on its hoard of ancient Egyptian faiences, at the art and jewelry event Tefaf New York Fall.\n\nSince 1904, Hemmerle\u2019s headquarters and shop has been on Maximilianstrasse, which commands some of the highest commercial rents in Germany and is home to international luxury companies including Cartier, Gucci and Dior.\n\nThe workshop, on a quiet street nearby, houses its goldsmiths and stone setters. Inside, the jewelers\u2019 benches were designed to be broader than traditional ones to maximize their flexibility for work, and drills can be attached with magnets for easy use.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The difference here is that the tool was created by Sebastian Hepp, a Munich-based artist and metalsmith who creates only one such piece every four years. Its elongated, rigorously minimalistic lines resemble a Donald Judd sculpture, but then, Mr. Hemmerle said, \u201cbeauty has no limitations.\u201d\n\nThere is a close relationship between the Hemmerles and their craftsmen. \u201cHow our creations come to life depends heavily on the talent in the workshop,\u201d Mr. Hemmerle said.\n\nGoldsmiths are assigned to create pieces of jewelry, depending on their skills in such areas as intricate filigree or working with a particular metal or kind of wood. And they work on pieces from beginning to end, rather than passing them along a production line.\n\nDiscussions between the artisans and the Hemmerles are constant, so designs evolve along the way (\u201cCreation is a process,\u201d Ms. Hemmerle said.)\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen it came to fixing the diamond-studded Pegasus to the rear of the earring, for example, questions arose about how to disguise the connection. The solution was to depict the constellation of Pegasus on the reverse, blending the connection into the star pattern.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile this collection was linked to the anniversary, the Hemmerles usually stand by the tenet that creativity cannot be forced and don\u2019t approach their output from a seasonal or commercial point of view.\n\nWhatever is ready goes to the next show they are presenting at, whether in March at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht; the Netherlands, best known as Tefaf; or in October at the London design show PAD. Mr. Hemmerle recently became the only jeweler appointed to Tefaf\u2019s board of trustees, following some restructuring.\n\nMr. Hemmerle, who trained at the Gemological Institute of America in New York and as a diamond cutter, said the company had long benefited from the German system of apprenticeship, which involves a three-and-a-half-year placement. Hemmerle\u2019s head work-master joined as an apprentice and he now sits alongside the latest apprentice, who has been learning all aspects of goldsmithing and Hemmerle\u2019s signature techniques.\n\n\u201cWe invest in our trainees so we want to keep them,\u201d Mr. Hemmerle said, noting that an advantage of creating one-of-a-kind jewels was that the job continued to be stimulating, so they were more likely to stay.\n\nHemmerle has come a long way from its founding in 1893 by Josef and Anton Hemmerle, brothers who took over a goldsmith\u2019s company that specialized in medals and dealt in antique jewelry. Despite having only the Munich shop, it has many private collectors around the world because, in part, of its participation in the international art shows.\n\nMr. Hemmerle said the critical thing was to have a vision shared by the entire family. \u201cWe\u2019ve always agreed that we want to create one-of-a-kind jewelry that will hopefully one day be exhibited in museums,\u201d he said \u2014 and the house\u2019s works are part of the permanent collections at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nHe added with a smile, \u201cI found an old advertising card that said, \u2018We produce ornaments; we work in enamel; and we make repairs for cheap prices.\u2019 We\u2019ve pivoted a little bit since then.\u201d", "title": "At Hemmerle, Medals Inspire an Anniversary Collection of Jewelry", "authors": ["Rachel Garrahan"]}

The Mets reached the 2016 wild card game despite DeGrom, Matz and Harvey having had surgery that year.\n\nThe closest the Mets ever got to having all five starters in the same rotation was last season, but Matz, now 26, landed on the disabled list with an elbow injury a week before the season began. Syndergaard, Wheeler and Harvey joined him there later in the season.

But it was dropped from the 1960 general census (there was no census in 1965) and relegated in 1970 to a longer list of questions that were asked of a small minority of residents. After 2000, the question was asked only on the American Community Survey, a separate mandatory poll of a fraction of the population that is conducted more frequently than the census.\n\nCritics noted that the citizenship question was added at the last minute \u2014 the deadline for proposing new questions for the 2020 head count is April 1 \u2014 and that it sidestepped the years of vetting undergone by every other question that will be asked. This month, they added, President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign used the addition of a citizenship question in an emailed fund-raising appeal.\n\nMr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that adding the question was a \u201creckless decision to suddenly abandon nearly 70 years of practice.\u201d He argued that the move \u201cwill create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would make impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars.\u201d\n\nIn a seven-page announcement released late Monday, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the secretary of commerce, foresaw those concerns, and sought to allay them. Decades of experience with citizenship questions on earlier censuses and other surveys, he stated, indicate that including it on the 2020 form would not deter people from volunteering to be counted. And he noted that other democracies, from Australia to the United Kingdom, routinely ask about citizenship in their head counts without any difficulty.\n\nMr. Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, acknowledged that both outside experts and leaders within the bureau had been opposed to the change.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Pruitt has been averse to science and fact from Day 1. Last fall, he announced that scientists who receive or had received federal research grants would be barred from serving on the agency\u2019s nearly two dozen scientific advisory committees. The purpose, he said, was to eliminate conflicts of interest; the real purpose, it soon became clear, was to create vacancies that he could fill with industry experts and state officials pushing for lax regulations \u2014 people whose own conflicts of interest would be left unexamined. As Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists noted at the time, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s claim that federal funding should exclude scientists from an E.P.A. advisory board while industry funding should not exclude them was on its face absurd.\n\nThough the E.P.A. is the epicenter of denial, avoiding inconvenient truths is common practice elsewhere in the administration. Last year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reassigned Joel Clement, the department\u2019s director of policy analysis and top expert on the impact of climate change in the Arctic, to an accounting job (Mr. Clement resigned in protest). Mr. Zinke also ordered the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine to cancel two studies that conflicted with the administration\u2019s goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production. One was examining the health risks of people living near surface coal mining sites in Appalachia; the other sought ways of strengthening the department\u2019s oil and gas safety inspection program.\n\nEven the official vocabulary of global warming has changed, as if problems can be made to evaporate simply by describing them in more benign terms. At the Agriculture Department, for instance, staff members are encouraged to use terms like \u201cweather extremes\u201d instead of \u201cclimate change.\u201d Web pages about global warning have been removed, edited or buried throughout the government. Last week, lest there be any confusion in the hinterlands, E.P.A. staff members in regional offices received a list of talking points instructing them to tell people that \u201cclear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity\u201d on global warming. This is vintage Pruitt: Sow doubt whenever possible about established science.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers have reinforced this bias. His latest budget called for big funding cuts and in some cases elimination of programs aimed at protecting human health and building resilience against the effects of climate change \u2014 among them the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s coastal research program and the Energy Department\u2019s energy efficiency and advanced technology programs. Congress wisely denied these cuts, thanks to hard work by Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House. Whether their efforts do anything to change the mind-set of Mr. Trump and his lieutenants remains to be seen.\n\nMr. Pruitt is widely believed to be positioning himself for a run for governor in his home state, Oklahoma; he also seems to covet the attorney general\u2019s office, and, astoundingly, is said to harbor presidential ambitions. But he and Mr. Zinke are unlikely to go anywhere soon, and as long as they have the support of the denier in chief, we can expect more disrespect for science and its practitioners.", "title": "Opinion | At Pruitt\u2019s E.P.A.: No Studies, No Data, No Rules", "authors": []}

But Mr. Trump was put off by the fact that Mr. Flood, a Republican, had represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, and Mr. Flood has made clear that he will not represent the president if Marc E. Kasowitz, his brash longtime personal lawyer, has any role in the effort.\n\nMr. Trump also tried to recruit Theodore B. Olson, a well-known Republican lawyer, but Mr. Olson has said he would not be representing the president.\n\nThe first phase of legal work for Mr. Trump in the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was led by a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. That work, which in part involved the production of documents and the arrangement of interviews with White House officials, has been largely completed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second phase, which is now focused on the question of a presidential interview with Mr. Mueller, had been led by Mr. Dowd. One reason Mr. Dowd quit was that, against his advice, Mr. Trump was insistent that he wanted to answer questions under oath from Mr. Mueller, believing that it would help clear him.\n\nMr. Dowd had concluded that there was no upside and that the president, who often does not tell the truth, could increase his legal exposure if his answers were not accurate.\n\nRoger Cossack, a seasoned legal analyst, said the key to successfully defending a high-profile client under immense scrutiny was to have a cohesive legal team with a consistent strategy.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn these types of cases, you need highly competent lawyers and a client who will listen and follow their advice,\u201d Mr. Cossack said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have both, you have what we\u2019re seeing here: chaos and disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a client who clearly thinks he has a better idea of how things should work than the lawyers who, from time to time, have told him things he doesn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is looking for the guy who can say, \u2018I know how to handle Mueller, I know you think he is bad, and we\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 Problem is you can\u2019t find that lawyer because no one will be able to do that.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president say the upheaval in the legal team was inevitable.

As a result, his legal and public relations strategies have been out of sync, with the president at times publicly contradicting his lawyers, and the White House often finding itself flat-footed in the face of new disclosures about the Russia investigation.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision has also exposed many of his aides, leaving them deeply enmeshed in an inquiry that is likely to cost them tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.\n\nBut while Mr. Trump has struggled to find lawyers, his family and his close associates are being represented by some of the country\u2019s top legal talent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has hired Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who recently got the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, after a lengthy court fight.\n\nThree prominent current and former White House officials \u2014 the former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn \u2014 are being represented by William A. Burck, who turned down the chance to represent the president. Mr. Burck, a former federal prosecutor, represented FIFA in its legal problems in the United States and has worked for high-profile witnesses in federal investigations, including Maureen McDonnell, the wife of a former Virginia governor.\n\nThe turmoil in Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team started within weeks of the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Kasowitz pushed for an adversarial approach to the special counsel, which the president was poised to follow. But Mr. Kasowitz clashed with Mr. Kushner, and he was soon pushed aside after a series of missteps and embarrassing incidents.\n\nThe president then hired Mr. Cobb, a veteran Washington lawyer, to lead efforts within the White House, as well as Mr. Dowd, who was put in charge of his personal legal team. They advocated a strategy of cooperation, telling the president that the sooner he gave Mr. Mueller\u2019s office what it wanted, the sooner his name would be cleared.\n\nWhile Mr. Cobb had told the president that the investigation would be over by now, it seems to be accelerating. Mr. Mueller is still looking into a wide range of matters related to Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate activities, his 2016 campaign, his associates and his time in office.\n\nMr. Trump, hoping to bolster his team, met with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing in recent days but, according to two people told of details about the meeting, did not believe he had personal chemistry with them.\n\nThere were also significant conflict-of-interest issues, but Mr. Trump could have waived them if he wanted. Ms. Toensing is representing Mark Corallo, who was the spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team in 2017 before they parted ways. Mr. Corallo has told investigators that he was concerned that a close aide to Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, may have been planning to obstruct justice during the drafting of a statement about a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign.\n\nMs. Hicks\u2019s lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion, and White House aides said Mr. Corallo\u2019s assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether to go ahead with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.\n\nMr. diGenova had been expected to serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on Mr. Mueller. Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president, a theory with little supporting evidence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn\u2019t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,\u201d he had told Fox News in January.", "title": "At a Crucial Juncture, Trump\u2019s Legal Defense Is Largely a One-Man Operation", "authors": ["Michael S.

Mekies, who is to join Ferrari in September in a technical role, added, \u201cIt was an open-minded approach, to look at everything, all possible concepts.\n\n\u201cSo we looked at full canopies \u2014 a fighter-jet style of the canopy; we looked at a roll bar in front of the drivers, and a partial roll bar just in front of the monocoque.\n\n\u201cSome of these concepts made it to the track. For instance, with the GP2 cars, we used a roll bar in front of the drivers, in order to not only protect them but also assess visibility.\u201d\n\nIt was determined that a driver needed to be protected from an object as large as a complete wheel assembly, weighing 44 pounds and traveling at 140 miles an hour.\n\n\u201cThis was the driving factor of all the concepts,\u201d Mekies said. \u201cAll our testing was based around that.\n\n\u201cAs we progressed the work, what we realized is that in asking for a structure to be as strong as what we were looking for, it had massive benefits in a number of other areas and potential accidents, other than a simple wheel strike,\u201d such as car-to-car contact or a car hitting a tire or concrete wall.\n\n\u201cHaving chosen the load, the testing conditions involved a full-scale dynamic test where we projected a wheel assembly at the structure, and observing the behavior, or not, of that structure, in two respects: Does it fail? And is it able to deflect a wheel away from the driver\u2019s head?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout development, and before making a final decision on which device to use, Mekies and the F.I.A. were aware of the impact the structure would have on the sport.\n\nAfter its initial introduction at a preseason test in 2016, the halo was almost universally derided, in particular for its aesthetics.\n\nSo Red Bull developed its own prototype, the aeroscreen, which struggled in tests conducted by the F.I.A. before the team abandoned the idea.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe F.I.A. had planned to introduce the halo for the start of the 2017 season, but decided to look at other options, forcing a delay.\n\nAt last year\u2019s British Grand Prix, and after relatively successful tests, a system known as the shield was fitted to the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel during a practice session. During that short test, it was discovered that the device offered less protection than the halo.\n\nSo the halo was adopted, but criticism remains.\n\nToto Wolff, the head of the Mercedes team, recently said he was \u201cnot impressed with the whole thing.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s a massive weight on top of the car, and you screw up the center of gravity massively. As impressive as the statistic is that you could put a bus on top of it, this is a Formula One car.\u201d\n\nMekies said making a decision \u201cwas not an easy process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason why is because you have many different sensitivities when it comes to how safe the sport needs to be; is the danger part of the thrill of watching it?\u201d he said. \u201cThen there were the aesthetic considerations of bolting a new structure on an open cockpit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFrom an aesthetic point of view, it was something so new \u2014 and we didn\u2019t target aesthetics then, we targeted function and maximum safety \u2014 the initial reaction was very mixed.\n\n\u201cBut once we showed it to people \u2014 and perhaps we should have done more, and much earlier \u2014 the ways in which it would be beneficial in an accident scenario, then we started to receive more support.\u201d\n\nBut the device has created difficulties for the teams.\n\nAndrew Green, the technical director of Force India, claims it has cost his team \u201cin the hundreds of thousands, if not the millions\u201d of dollars to put on the car because it has forced teams to make other changes to their cars. The system itself costs just $16,000.\n\nThe team is still working on the aerodynamics of the halo, which has \u201ca significant downstream effect, especially around the wing area,\u201d Green said.\n\nAnother effect has been on weight. While the F.I.A. increased the overall minimum weight of this year\u2019s cars by 13.2 pounds to 1,618 pounds, the weight of the halo, along with the mountings to attach it to the car, totals 26.5 pounds.\n\n\u201cThe weight limit did go up, but by not nearly as much as the installation weight of the halo, which put additional stress on all the other parts of the car.\n\n\u201cThe other area we had to bear in mind is that we have to hit a weight distribution target, so we faced a big challenge, with the architecture of the car changing right up to the last minute.\u201d\n\nWhatever the discontent among teams, the halo is now a fixture in Formula One. Although the halo is the first head protection device approved by the F.I.A., it is unlikely to be the last.\n\n\u201cThere is no direction we will not pursue,\u201d Mekies said. \u201cIt could be a canopy, or maybe automatic deployment of the safety structure, if you want to look further.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn terms of research and development, that is very much our job, to look at different styles of things.

Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "The Business\n\nIn late December 2015, about four months after the Swiss authorities had flagged the shipments from Thomas Mann, Al Jazeera released an explosive documentary called \u201cThe Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers.\u201d A retired professional hurdler from Britain had worked with the news organization to penetrate the world of illicit sports doping while carrying a hidden camera.\n\nAn intriguing name was tucked into the Al Jazeera documentary. Underground chemists spoke with reverence of a Svengali who produced and sold them high-quality sports drugs. His name was Thomas Mann.\n\nA chemist explained in the documentary how fastidious he had to be when ordering performance-enhancing drugs from Mann: \u201cIf you even use the wrong language with him, saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to use this,\u2019 right away, boom, you\u2019d be kicked off.\u201d\n\nInvestigators pulled at Thomas Mann\u2019s internet veil and found that he was using an alias, a name perhaps borrowed from the famous German novelist. He called his business Authentiquevie (French for \u201cauthentic life\u201d); another forum, DatBTrue, provided a menu of his peptides and hormones, accompanied by detailed explanations of each drug. Four-star customer testimonials piled up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTom carries it and is the only guy I trust to deliver actual peptides and not useless vials,\u201d read one.\n\nHis business model, according to investigators, was clever. They believe he operated the DatBTrue forum, a go-to place for savvy discussion of peptides. When an athlete on the forum would inquire about obtaining peptides, Moorcones, using a different name, would steer the athlete to Thomas Mann. So he was sending potential customers to himself.\n\nMoorcones, in the guise of Thomas Mann, or Tom Mann, would then rigorously vet the customers to make sure they were who they claimed to be and would be trustworthy clients.\n\nIn the one year that Moorcones was under investigation, he had $1 million in sales.\n\nMoorcones\u2019s business was a raging river in a much larger doping ecosystem. The demand for performance-enhancing drugs extends to every corner of professional and amateur sports, and well beyond. Name any sport, and chances are good that someone playing it has been caught doping in the past few months.\n\nThen there are wealthy users who flock to anti-aging medical clinics in search of youthful elixirs. They find doctors who will prescribe peptides and human growth hormone. The patients take all of these in hopes of adding muscle mass, smoothing wrinkles and reclaiming body definition and sexual vitality.\n\nMoorcones served both ends of this market, from athletes to the aging. All came to his online forum in search of the latest wonder drug.\n\nMoorcones purported that his products were intended for lab use only. In a 2014 email, he wrote: \u201cI have the following batches available for in vitro purposes only. Peptides: Modified GRF (1-29) (2mg) @ $35/vial; $31/10 vials.\u201d But a cursory reading of his customers\u2019 online comments indicated that they were not being used that way.\n\nDr. Todd B. Nippoldt, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., spoke to the scientific and health consequences of unregulated and illegal use.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese people are carrying out quite sophisticated experiments on themselves at doses that far exceed anything in a lab,\u201d Nippoldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable and dangerous.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEmergence of Peptides\n\nThe original wonder drug of sports doping was steroids, and it remains the gold standard for athletic cheaters. There is nothing, doctors and athletes say, quite like the muscle-firing boost provided by synthetic testosterone.\n\nSteroid use peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, and records set during that era were Popeye-like. Olympic records usually fall every few Games; some records set during the steroid era have stood untouched for decades. This is no less true of Major League Baseball, where swollen sluggers made a mockery of the record books in recent decades.\n\nThen testing for steroids improved and some sports toughened their rules against doping. Steroids became a riskier play. But that did not stop cheating. Block one back alley, and sophisticated chemists scurry down another. The aim, always, is to find ways to build muscle mass, burn fat, aid recovery and increase the ability of the body to expand its aerobic capacity. This underground world soon turned its eyes toward human growth hormones and peptides, strings of amino acids and the building blocks of proteins.\n\nSome peptides trigger reactions in the body similar to those of anabolic steroids. Others, known as secretagogues, stimulate the human pituitary gland to release excess growth hormone. A well-regarded scientific study in Australia found that growth hormone helped sprinters improve their times by 4 percent. As a typical 100-meter race is won or lost by hundredths of a second, a 4 percent improvement would represent a considerable advantage.\n\nThe Al Jazeera documentary underlined that peptides had become a prime ingredient in a cheater\u2019s performance cocktail. The documentary caught Taylor Teagarden, a major league catcher, saying on hidden camera that he had taken peptides and never been caught. (Major League Baseball remedied that oversight and suspended Teagarden for 80 games a few months after the documentary was released.)\n\nDr. Robert Salvatori, an expert on growth hormone at Johns Hopkins, noted that athletes were quite shrewd about the effects that drugs have on their bodies. History demonstrates that they often recognize the performance-boosting power before the medical community does.\n\n\u201cIt took scientists until 1996 to prove the muscle-boosting powers of steroids \u2014 which athletes knew years earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are running way behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeeking to learn more about the latest tactics in sports doping, I went to Phoenix to meet with Cody Bidlow, a former professional sprinter and personal coach. A year ago, the United States Anti-Doping Agency discovered that Bidlow had ordered peptides from Moorcones\u2019s website. He received a four-year suspension.\n\nA lean and muscular fellow, Bidlow described for me how he came to use peptides. He had been a sprinter at Grand Canyon University in 2015 when he sustained a hamstring injury. He was no potential Olympian. He simply wanted to run a few more races, so he asked around at elite gyms for a quick doping fix.\n\n\u201cI had always been around people who used peptides and H.G.H.,\u201d he said, although he declined to name names. \u201cIt sounded like peptides are super-effective.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(The head of Switzerland\u2019s antidoping organization told me that his agency\u2019s tests have shown that 80 percent of the peptides advertised on the web are adulterated or outright fakes.)\n\nThen Bidlow learned of Thomas Mann\u2019s site, which was refreshingly professional. And Mann\u2019s peptides were real. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t \u2018bro science\u2019; he is a pure brainiac,\u201d Bidlow said. \u201cHe would post scientific studies breaking down how a peptide worked.\u201d\n\nWe sat in a coffee shop as Bidlow gave me a tutorial on peptides. He described which worked, which were difficult to detect and which were not worth the trouble. He said coaches and athletes \u2014 particularly sprinters \u2014 were enamored of something called insulin-like growth factor-1, known as IGF-1. It promotes healing and builds muscle in a fashion similar to anabolic steroids. IGF-1 occurs naturally in the body, and antidoping tests struggle to distinguish the natural from the synthetic.\n\nNo sprinter or baseball player has ever tested positive for IGF-1. Do not take that to mean no sprinter or baseball player has ever used it; they just haven\u2019t been caught.\n\nThe antidoping world has occasional successes. In 2015 and 2016, Dodgers pitcher Josh Ravin, Indians outfielder Marlon Byrd and Braves pitcher Andrew McKirahan tested positive for peptides. Major League Baseball suspended all of them.\n\nBut the case of the retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez is more typical. Anthony Bosch, who said he supplied Rodriguez with drugs, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that his witch\u2019s brew included peptides. Rodriguez was suspended by baseball, but not because he failed a drug test. The league connected him to doping through an investigation it started only after a news report broke the story of Bosch\u2019s company, Biogenesis.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018No Legal Foothold\u2019\n\nFaced with the limits of testing technology, antidoping officials and investigators have asked the Food and Drug Administration and Congress to tighten laws and crack down on peptides and growth hormone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Drug Enforcement Administration officials, the problem lies with the weak wording of the laws that currently govern peptides.\n\n\u201cIf I catch you with heroin, it\u2019s a controlled substance and illegal \u2014 that\u2019s easy,\u201d said Douglas W. Coleman, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.\u2019s Phoenix Division. \u201cIf I find human growth hormone, I have to build a case to show that it\u2019s significantly outside what it can be prescribed for.\n\n\u201cPeptides are more difficult still. There\u2019s really no legal foothold.\u201d\n\nThe F.D.A. holds clearer regulatory authority; its officials could write tougher regulatory language and crack down on peptides and growth hormone. But agency investigators have paid scant attention to this black market. I asked, repeatedly and over many weeks, to speak with an F.D.A. official about the regulation of peptides and growth hormone.\n\nIn the end, an agency spokeswoman sent a boilerplate email.\n\n\u201cThe F.D.A. takes seriously its mission to protect the health of the American public,\u201d wrote the spokeswoman, Theresa Eisenman. \u201cThere are many complex factors involved in how cases involving the sale or distribution of illegal products are investigated and ultimately prosecuted.\u201d\n\nHer email cited three successful peptide prosecutions involving four people during the past three years. Each of the offenders received a light punishment.\n\nSeeking a more detailed explanation, I called a former top F.D.A. official. He spoke on condition of anonymity, as he remains involved with these issues in the private sector. He described the F.D.A.\u2019s stance as defensible. It has a small staff of about 200 agents, and they focus on plagues like tainted and counterfeit drugs, which endanger thousands of unsuspecting customers. The societal impact of peptides and growth hormone is far less severe, clearly.\n\nThe former official described the world of illicit peptide and hormones as caveat emptor \u2014 buyer beware. \u201cIf rich patients and athletes are going to anti-aging clinics or the web in search of unregistered drugs, they know the risk,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe decision to downgrade prosecutions has all but decriminalized the mass distribution and use of powerful and untested drugs for athletes.\n\nThat deeply frustrates those who are trying to stamp out chemical cheating by athletes. Jeff Novitzky once served as a top investigator for the Food and Drug Administration, and he was the lead investigator in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative case, in which he helped uncover doping by some of the biggest names in American sports.\n\nNovitzky now is a senior official with Ultimate Fighting Championship, the mixed-martial arts circuit. He is charged with cleaning up that sport, and sees governmental foot-dragging everywhere he looks.\n\n\u201cFor officials to complain that these are difficult, high-pressure prosecutions is a cowardly excuse,\u201d Novitzky said. \u201cThe ease with which athletes, teenagers, anyone, can purchase and buy these powerful hormonal substances is mind-boggling.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Athletes\n\nInvestigators discovered that Moorcones was shipping his products from a U.P.S. store wedged between a supermarket and real estate office on the suburban frontier of Queen Creek. Video surveillance revealed that Moorcones\u2019s septuagenarian parents often went with him to mail his parcels.\n\nEventually investigators obtained Moorcones\u2019s customer list of more than 8,000 names. It was a rich hunting ground. Investigators found the names of pro athletes and forwarded the information to their leagues.\n\nMajor League Baseball ended up suspending two minor leaguers. The National Football League was another matter. The Al Jazeera documentary had named six players as likely dopers, and the N.F.L. penalized not a single one. The Moorcones investigation yielded more names, which were shared with the league. The N.F.L. has penalized none of the players.\n\nTrack and field athletes, weight lifters and wrestlers are another matter. The United States Anti-Doping Agency has jurisdiction over these sports and can punish athletes who violate doping protocols.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUsada handed down a raft of penalties to Moorcones\u2019s customers. Jason Young, a 35-year-old discus thrower and coach from Lubbock, Tex., who competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, was suspended, as was Nick Mossberg, a pole-vaulter who competed at the 2012 United States Olympic trials and planned to try again in 2016. The investigation also netted a wrestler from Colorado and a weight lifter who graduated from M.I.T.\n\nAll acknowledged ordering peptides from Tom Mann. None of these athletes had tested positive.\n\nBidlow and Mossberg, the pole-vaulter, had worked and trained at Altis, an elite athletic training campus in Phoenix. Numerous Olympic athletes train there under the tutelage of coaches with global reputations.\n\nI called the recruiting director at Altis, Andreas Behm, who also coaches the sprinters and hurdlers. Bidlow and Mossberg, he said, had simply \u201cgone rogue.\u201d The elite training center, he insisted, had no larger problem with doping.\n\n\u2018Losing a True Hero\u2019\n\nThe investigation of Moorcones stalled last year. The United States attorney in Phoenix had taken a hard look and given up because a federal agency \u2014 the F.D.A. or the D.E.A. \u2014 was not willing to bring a case. His distribution of peptides, they apparently decided, was not worth prosecuting. A lawyer for Moorcones demanded immunity for his client.\n\nMoorcones shut down his website and claimed online that he was ill. Worried customers speculated that his own drugs had sickened him. \u201cI feel for the guy,\u201d one customer wrote. \u201cThe community of illegal experimental medicine is losing a true hero.\u201d\n\nOther clients speculated correctly that Mann was under investigation; they began to worry that their names had fallen into the hands of law enforcement. They were correct.\n\nMoorcones politely bid everyone goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed serving everyone through the years,\u201d he wrote on his Authentiquevie site.\n\nWithin months, investigators noticed that one of Moorcones\u2019s prominent, high-volume customers had taken his business to a dealer in Florida, where anti-aging clinics peddling peptides and hormones grow like sugar cane. Other clients turned to an oft-investigated but still active peptide trafficker in Louisiana.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was still much investigators did not understand about Moorcones\u2019s operation. He distributed such massive volumes of illicit substances, but they were never able to determine the source of the drugs. Was he purchasing them from somewhere and reselling to athletes, or was he somehow manufacturing them himself? And were his parents aware of what they were shipping?\n\nBack on the edge of the desert in Arizona, I persuaded Moorcones to keep the door open another minute or two. \u201cPeople all have their own agenda,\u201d he told me.\n\nI allowed that this might be true. Any story grows more complicated when you hear both sides, I said. Why not tell me yours?\n\nHe smiled faintly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the person to give it to you anyway.

Today, 58 percent of immigrants live in the North, compared to 26 percent in the Center, 12 percent in the South and 4 percent on the two major islands. In Northern Italy, foreigners represent 11 percent of the population, against 4 percent in the South.\n\nThe Italian North is also worried about taxes and red tape.

Firmdale\u2019s first New York property, Crosby Street Hotel, in Soho, opened in 2009 and is considered to be among the city\u2019s most fashionable accommodations. The company\u2019s co-owner and design director, Kit Kemp, has a flair for creating unique hotels, and the Whitby, too, is a place with serious design personality: each of the 86 rooms is individually decorated, and original art by contemporary artists from around the world adorns both guest rooms and public spaces.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Whitby is on 56th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.

A native of San Diego, she attended U.C.L.A. and then started working as a registrar at the Pasadena Art Museum; she stayed at the institution for five years.\n\nAt one point a curator was fired, and there were few others to fill in. \u201cIt was a tiny staff, and I just started doing shows,\u201d said Ms. Haskell, who was an assistant curator by then. Her first show was Claes Oldenburg, \u201cObject Into Monument,\u201d in 1971.\n\nMr. Oldenburg, who has been the subject of many exhibitions since, said in an email that the collaboration with Ms. Haskell remained close to his heart. \u201cI still keep the book available in my studio and look it at frequently,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d", "title": "At the Whitney, a Champion of American Art", "authors": ["Ted Loos"]}

A 1914 brochure celebrating the store\u2019s expansion said, \u201cThe 12th floor of the new addition has been given over in its entirety to the use of the employees.\u201d Separate dining rooms served men and women, and a physician and two nurses oversaw a large medical suite and surgery. Also, in a sign of those times, there was a men\u2019s smoking room.\n\nThe store, which originally opened in Lower Manhattan in 1865, closed its Midtown flagship in 1989. Ten years later its premises, gutted and rebuilt, were occupied by the City University of New York Graduate Center. Nothing remains of the onetime hospital, said Tanya L. Domi, a spokeswoman for the Graduate Center.\n\nWelfare services for department store workers began with John Wanamaker, a brickmaker\u2019s son born in 1838 who turned a struggling Philadelphia haberdashery into a department store empire built on creative advertising and selling strategies. But Wanamaker was not just focused on making money. He wanted to keep his workers healthy and happy, and so in an era of rapacious capitalism, child labor and male privilege he introduced half-day-Saturdays off, medical benefits and a retirement system. He made sure that the store abided by Pennsylvania\u2019s ban on hiring of boys younger than 13.\n\nHis competitors soon followed with medical facilities, employee exercise and lunchrooms, educational training, vacation programs and medical clinics.\n\nWhen Macy\u2019s on West 34th Street expanded in 1924, the new 16th floor included an employee dental clinic with chairs for six dentists.\n\nThe James McCreery & Co. dry goods store on Broadway at East 11th Street boasted a rooftop restaurant and sun parlor said to be the first of its kind anywhere. Stewart & Company built a similar amenity for workers in Baltimore and stocked it with newspapers, magazines and inspirational books \u2014 and a sewing machine. At the Kaufmann & Baer store in Pittsburgh, women relaxed on the sun roof, while men played basketball in wire cage courts.\n\nAs far back as 1896, the Siegel-Cooper store on Sixth Avenue between West 18th and 19th Streets (then the largest store in the world, now home to TJ Maxx and Bed Bath & Beyond, among others), established an employees association that bought a summer home in Long Branch, N.J., where the 825 female employees could vacation free each year for a week.

Investigators were continuing on Monday to sort through his computer hard drives and other evidence.\n\nBefore Mr. Conditt died, a federal criminal complaint was filed against him, charging him with unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. A federal magistrate judge in Austin sealed an affidavit by investigators that would be expected to summarize their reasons for charging Mr. Conditt. It was unclear when that affidavit would be unsealed.\n\nInvestigators have said that Mr. Conditt used his cellphone to record a video in his vehicle after a confrontation with the police in Round Rock, a suburb near Pflugerville.

In one 24-hour period, the Austin police responded to 420 suspicious-package calls, all false alarms.\n\nHundreds of local, state and federal agents and officers were hunting the serial bomber for days. The state deployed a Pilatus high-altitude surveillance airplane equipped with a thermal imaging system. Mr. Conditt was tracked to a hotel parking lot in Round Rock, and when he drove away in his red Nissan Pathfinder, the police followed him and confronted him; the chase ended in a ditch off Interstate 35, where one Austin SWAT officer fired his weapon and Mr. Conditt set off his bomb.\n\nA justice of the peace in Williamson County, Dain Johnson, said on Monday that Mr. Conditt died by his own hand. \u201cThere is no final report yet, but the cause of death is suicide,\u201d Judge Johnson said. \u201cHe had multiple shrapnel injuries from the bomb.\u201d", "title": "Austin Bombing Suspect\u2019s Housemate Called a Person of Interest", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A judge allowed reporters into an Australian courtroom on Wednesday to hear witness testimony during a pretrial hearing for Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican\u2019s third-highest-ranking priest, in a high-profile sexual abuse case that has largely unfolded behind closed doors.\n\nCardinal Pell has been accused of \u201chistorical sexual offenses,\u201d meaning they took place decades ago, but the details of the criminal complaint have not been made public. For the past 10 days the court has been closed to the public as those accusing Cardinal Pell were questioned via video conference.\n\nIn general, Australian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States. Such cases are often subject to the country\u2019s contempt standards, and other legal restrictions, which prohibit journalists from reporting on details of criminal allegations.\n\nThe hearing, which is expected to run for at least another week, will determine if Cardinal Pell, the most senior member of the Catholic Church to face such accusations, will stand trial.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCardinal Pell had been accused in hearings before Australia\u2019s Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse of mishandling misconduct cases against clergy members while he served as the leader of the Archdioceses of Melbourne and Sydney. Then allegations surfaced that he had himself been involved in abuse beginning early in his priesthood and continuing until he became archbishop of Melbourne. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.\n\nPhoto\n\nPope Francis last year gave Cardinal Pell, the Vatican\u2019s de facto finance chief, a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense. The cardinal\u2019s rank and the nature of the allegations could make the case precedent setting, and it threatens to undermine the pope\u2019s promise to weed out sexual abuse in the Church.", "title": "Australian Court Hears Public Testimony in Cardinal Pell Abuse Case", "authors": ["Adam Baidawi"]}

At several points, Mr. Richter mentioned that he and Mr. Sheridan had known each other for a long time.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring several hours of testimony, Mr. Richter pressed Mr. Sheridan on apparent inconsistencies in his testimony, at one point suggesting that the cardinal\u2019s robes were made in such a way that events alleged to have taken place at a Melbourne cathedral could not have happened.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also argued that \u201cacts of appalling seriousness\u201d alleged to have occurred on a mountaintop, on an altar and at a 1978 screening of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d could not have happened, citing inconsistencies in the accuser\u2019s timeline.\n\nIt was on this point that Ms. Wallington questioned Mr. Richter\u2019s own proposed timeline, leading him to further argue his case with her.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t shout at me, Mr. Richter,\u201d Ms. Wallington said softly.\n\nIt was then that Mr. Richter asked the magistrate to \u201cdisqualify herself from further hearing this matter, on the basis of a biased view of the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour application is refused,\u201d replied Ms. Wallington.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Richter accused the journalist Louise Milligan of omitting key reporting in a television report on the accusations and a book she published last year, \u201cCardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell.\u201d\n\nThe court had previously heard that statements some complainants gave to the police differed somewhat from those given to Ms. Milligan during her reporting. As is common in such cases, her book was removed from bookstores in the state of Victoria, where the trial is taking place.\n\n\u201cShe distorted what went to the public,\u201d Mr. Richter said of Ms. Milligan\u2019s coverage. \u201cI would put to her that she distorted it even more in her book, so as to poison the public\u2019s mind against Cardinal Pell,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI completely and utterly reject that,\u201d Ms. Milligan said.\n\n\u201cOf course you would,\u201d said Mr. Richter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Milligan later pushed back on Mr. Richter\u2019s characterizations of some accusers, saying that abuse victims were unfairly \u201ctorn apart by people like you\u201d in courts.\n\nMr. Richter later described some of Ms. Milligan\u2019s documented exchanges with her sources as \u201ccharming, if not flirtatious,\u201d which she dismissed as insulting.\n\n\u201cI think that is an absolutely sexist assertion,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Australia Letter Newsletter Damien Cave, our new Australia bureau chief, shares insights on global news, local recommendations and feedback from readers in this weekly newsletter.

Last year, Australia agreed to pay $53 million in damages to migrants who said they had suffered abuse in the camps.\n\nMr. Dutton has been a staunch defender of the offshore detention policy, and he has argued that Australia should not accept refugees who would be a burden on the country\u2019s social safety net.\n\nIn January, Mr. Dutton blamed African migrants for a rise in crime in Melbourne, claiming in an interview that residents of the city were afraid even to go to restaurants at night \u201cbecause they\u2019re followed home by these gangs.\u201d\n\nCritics of the government said that those remarks were intended to scare voters before an election and that official crime data showed no such correlation with immigration.\n\nAccording to government statistics, more immigrants to Australia are born in South Africa than in any other African country. As of 2016, 181,400 Australian residents were South African natives, according to the latest census.

The rally, hosted by the bar\u2019s owner, Heinz Pollischansky, carried the message that restaurant and bar owners opposed the ban.\n\nBut Vienna\u2019s gastronomy scene is split over the question. The famous coffee houses on the city\u2019s tourist trail have already banned smoking, in anticipation of this year\u2019s deadline.\n\nOthers, like Caf\u00e9 Hummel, a family business, have invested thousands of euros in separating smoking and nonsmoking areas \u2014 and paid fines after complaints from nonsmoking guests for failing to contain the smoke.\n\nChristina Hummel, the manager, is the third generation in her family at the helm of this classic Viennese establishment. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here since 1935, and since 1935 it was smoking,\u201d said Ms. Hummel, who is not a regular smoker but enjoys a cigarette with a glass of wine.\n\nLast year, Ms. Hummel had enough of the complaints and fines and declared her cafe fully nonsmoking. She said she immediately lost many regulars, about 5 percent of the annual clientele, and others cut back on orders. But the decision allowed her to turn to a new clientele.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cTimes change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to look toward the future.\u201d\n\nA sign of those changing times is Caf\u00e9 F\u00fcrth, a small venue that shares its central space with two offices and its own coffee roasting operation.\n\nThe owner, Helmut Haller, 30, was on his day off, trying out a new coffee machine and a concoction of iced espresso with blood-orange lemonade. A far cry from the classical coffeehouse proprietor, Mr. Haller said he followed trends in the United States, Australia and Britain and never allowed smoking.\n\n\u201cGlobal coffee culture is a nonsmoking culture,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he said he placed his business in the Viennese cafe tradition, which provided a meeting point for great figures of fine arts, literature and philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn Austria we\u2019re slower with change,\u201d he said of his country\u2019s position between Germany and the Balkans.\n\nHe said that both some residents and visitors had their minds set on a certain idea of Vienna, described with the German word \u201cGem\u00fctlichkeit,\u201d which translates as a broad feeling of comfort or cosiness.\n\nBut even many smokers who enjoy a chance to light up see in the ban an opportunity to set themselves free.\n\nOne was Philippe Mayer, a 41-year-old musician with blond dreadlocks who had settled into the dimly lit smoking room of Caf\u00e9 Europa, in central Vienna, after dropping off his daughter at kindergarten.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a reward for waking up early,\u201d Mr. Mayer said.

Reese Witherspoon, as the impatient Mrs. Whatsit, and Mindy Kaling, who quotes Rumi and OutKast as Mrs. Who, are the others; they were chosen partly for their offscreen acumen as producers reshaping Hollywood.\n\nIt was Ms. DuVernay\u2019s multicultural casting ideas \u2014 \u201cHamilton\u201d was a reference \u2014 that helped sell her vision to Disney. \u201cOnce she presented it like that, it was one of those things where you couldn\u2019t see the film any other way,\u201d said Tendo Nagenda, the executive vice president for production for Walt Disney Studios, who sent Ms. DuVernay the script. \u201cAnd little did she know that the desperation on my part to make sure she did it went to an all-time high.\u201d\n\nMr. Nagenda \u2014 who was raised in Los Angeles by a Ugandan father and a mother from Belize \u2014 added that he saw it as part of his mission at Disney to broaden the narrative.

There\u2019s little chance it will be a phenomenon like \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d Mr. Nagenda said, but that film \u2014 and the marketing lessons it taught \u2014 may unlock new theatergoers. \u201cAudiences are responding to stories in which they feel they are represented and have a voice, and where the film itself is cognizant of that,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think our film has a lot of that.\u201d\n\nMs. DuVernay was careful to note that \u201cWrinkle\u201d is not broad fare like a Marvel superhero movie; it\u2019s intended for 8- to 12-year-olds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever do anything like this again,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd so, given the chance, she put her stamp on it, using locations not far from where she grew up in Lynwood, Calif.: She shot in West Adams, a historic black district in Los Angeles; and Crenshaw High School, nearby, stands in for Meg\u2019s James Baldwin Middle School in the movie.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Coogler did something similar, setting part of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d in Oakland, Calif., near his home. It\u2019s a way, Ms. DuVernay said, of claiming a bit of identity in a studio film, a move that directors \u201cwho are privileged enough to see themselves in films all the time\u201d may not need to make. In her hairstyle and clothes, Meg is based on Ms. DuVernay\u2019s niece, a K-pop fan and skateboard-loving 13-year-old in Alabama.

Ms. DuVernay thought of Meg as just a regular kid who finds her potential, but to Ms. Reid, she is a superhero: \u201cShe is an African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough,\u201d she said. With that realization, \u201cshe just taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThe inclusive casting of Meg and the three guides got the attention, but Ms. DuVernay spent as much time obsessing over the role of Calvin, Meg\u2019s friend, played by the Australian actor Levi Miller. She chose him, in part, she said, \u201cbecause that was so powerful, to show a white boy following a black girl through the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that,\u201d Ms. DuVernay continued. \u201cI mean, I have a crew of thousands of people, and it\u2019s not lost on me that I have white men coming up to me all day long like, \u2018What do I do?\u2019 And in my early career, there\u2019s some white men that have a problem with that, a problem with even asking me what to do, and taking my direction and believing that I know what I\u2019m saying, because they have no context for even seeing it.\u201d\n\nAs the instigator of multiple diversity initiatives in Hollywood, Ms. DuVernay keeps giving them examples. Her ability to shape messages (she started out as a film publicist), her ease and clarion honesty in sharing complicated, personal truths, is rare.\n\nSitting in her new office, she crumpled quickly when the father-daughter part of \u201cWrinkle\u201d came up. Ms. DuVernay\u2019s stepfather, who helped raise her, died after a brief and sudden illness in 2016, as she was about to start work on the movie. It was as if he had disappeared without warning \u2014 just as Alex Murry, the father in \u201cWrinkle\u201d (played by Chris Pine), does.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI felt that so deeply as I was making the film,\u201d she said, \u201cthis girl who literally cannot wrap her mind around the fact that he\u2019s gone, and the moment when they say he could still be here \u2014\u2014.\u201d She broke off, crying.\n\nHer stepfather\u2019s name was Murray Maye. All throughout production, when there was a script note or a lighting change for Mr. Pine\u2019s character, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to say Dr. Murry, as crew members did; she referred to him only as \u201cthe father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like the film is looking for him in a way,\u201d she said, in tears. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t care what anybody thinks about it. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t feel pressure about the whole first, blah blah blah. I know it\u2019s $100 million for the studio. They\u2019ll be fine. Ryan\u2019s made sure of that for me.\u201d (She and the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director are close.) \u201cSo, you know, this means a lot to me, and I know it\u2019s going to mean something to some people. Some people will see it, see all the things we put in there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Winfrey did. \u201cI grew up in an era where there was absolutely zero, minus, images\u201d of girls like her in pop culture, she said. \u201cSo I do imagine, to be a brown-skinned girl of any race throughout the world, looking up on that screen and seeing Storm, I think that is a capital A, capital W, E, some, AWESOME, experience,\u201d she added by phone. \u201cI think this is going to be a wondrous marvel of an experience for girls that in the future they will just take for granted.\u201d\n\nThe entertainment press made much of the fact that Ms. DuVernay had never worked with special effects (which is rarely belabored when male directors make the same leap). But neither had Ms. Winfrey. \u201cMy first time being hung from the ceiling!\u201d she said. She found getting up and getting down so nerve-racking that she asked the crew to just keep her rigged up. \u201cThe crew\u2019s going to lunch, and they\u2019re like, well we can\u2019t leave you hanging! I go, \u2018Oh yeah, you can!\u2019\u201d she said. (She stayed up there. Just picture it.)\n\nMs. DuVernay, though, \u201cwas in her element,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said, recalling that when she observed the huge cranes with the camera, \u201cand there\u2019s Ava, in her dreads and her sneakers and her vest and her jeans, surrounded by lots of big guys and lots of big machinery, saying, \u2018Cut, stop, let\u2019s take that again,\u2019 it just would make my heart swell, that she had taken on something that was this enormous, and was managing it so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrinkle\u201d is a very girlie movie; at one point, a character is saved from a fall by a field of gossipy flowers. And Ms. DuVernay is warm and girlie, too \u2014 at our meeting, we talked about the joys and pitfalls of fake eyelashes; crying, she peeled hers off. \u201cI like clothes, I like makeup, I like looking at pretty dresses,\u201d she said. Onscreen, the Mrs. characters change costumes at every appearance: Ms. Winfrey described her look as \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s aunt from another planet.\u201d\n\nAnd none of these glitter-tinged fantasies subtract from Ms. DuVernay\u2019s own mission, that cultivation of new perspectives and realities. To her, \u201cSelma\u201d and \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d share a foundational message: \u201cCivil rights work and social justice work take imagination, to imagine a world that isn\u2019t there, and you imagine that it can be there. And that\u2019s the same thing that you do whenever you imagine and insert yourself in a future space, or in a space where you\u2019ve been absent.\u201d\n\nTo imagine a world where a girl like Meg can fly was \u201csuper-emotional to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then to be able to make it so, even on camera for a little while, for two hours \u2014 to change the world for that small amount of time, it\u2019s very powerful. It\u2019s addictive.\u201d", "title": "Ava DuVernay\u2019s Fiercely Feminine Vision for \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019", "authors": ["Melena Ryzik"]}

I\u2019m just going to do my own.\u2019\u201d She posted her creation to Instagram and was flooded with messages from people wanting to buy it, including Chance the Rapper. She declined to sell it, which only stoked demand further. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about making money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was about taking a piece of history and reworking it into something nobody else could have.\u201d\n\nLatest Project: In January, the Museum of Modern Art enlisted Ms. Nirui to make a limited-edition hoodie for the closing of its exhibit \u201cItems: Is Fashion Modern?\u201d The hoodies were based on Maison Margiela\u2019s numerical logo, and were given out to museumgoers for free.\n\nNext Thing: While Ms. Nirui is planning more hoodies (she declined to name the designers she is collaborating with), she is branching into zines and other creative forms.

As the use of satellites transforms from a national and military-led enterprise to one dominated by businesses, governments worldwide are playing catch-up with the rules and regulations that apply. It\u2019s now possible for a private enterprise with headquarters in the United States to launch Argentine satellites from New Zealand\u2019s soil.\n\nThe gaps in international regulations and coordination became clear recently when a California-based start-up, Swarm Technologies, launched four tiny satellites called SpaceBees on an Indian rocket, over the objection of the Federal Communications Commission. Among other things, the F.C.C. is responsible for making sure satellites are trackable by the government\u2019s Space Surveillance Network to minimize the chance of collisions. The SpaceBees were so small (about 4 inches by 4 inches by 1 inch) that the network could not regularly track them, though a private tracking service, LeoLabs, says it has been tracking them since the launch.\n\nSeveral new space start-ups are planning enormous \u201cmega-constellations\u201d of hundreds or even thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit (about 100 miles to 1,250 miles in altitude) in the next decade, and these too will challenge the regulatory framework.

Just straight brute force, every time she asked,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she thought it would help, or if it would make me play better, or what. But after a while, it really would make me feel better. It was like I could suddenly talk with people about this secret that had been eating at me for years.\u201d\n\nWilson also confronted a separate vulnerability before her teammates this season. On Feb. 1, South Carolina lost at home to UConn, 83-58. Wilson felt distracted and shot only 4 for 18 from the field. Afterward, she apologized publicly to her teammates. It has sometimes been difficult, she said Sunday, to focus on carrying her team while looking ahead to the W.N.B.A. and preparing for graduation.\n\n\u201cI felt awful,\u201d Wilson said of the loss to UConn. \u201cThat was just not me.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Where does all this science get us? Bach\u2019s notations bear witness to a life of conservative Lutheran observance.\n\nWithin Calov\u2019s scripture verses, there are many small printing errors that would doubtless go undetected by even the most biblically literate reader. Yet time and again Bach has restored text that was far from clearly missing, or has changed perfectly plausible sounding, but in fact unattested, wording to the standard Lutheran rendering. None of these corrections stem from the list of errors printed in Calov\u2019s appendix.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome biblical scholars have concluded from this that Bach acted like an astute textual critic, poring over Calov\u2019s volumes and painstakingly comparing them, line by line, with other Lutheran Bibles. But there\u2019s a simpler and more likely scenario, fully grounded in conservative 18th-century social and religious practices.\n\nPicture the people of Bach\u2019s household on free evenings, gathered in their living room for the activity of reading aloud. The children take turns reciting from a family Bible for practice in reading and elocution, not to mention spiritual edification. The patriarch follows along in his magnificent Study Bible, in part to make sure there\u2019s no passage-skipping from the lectors, and in part to allow him to reach for his inkwell whenever he spots, compared with what he\u2019s just heard, an error in Calov\u2019s scriptural verses.\n\nTellingly, in something akin to what linguists call a mondegreen, Bach at several passages apparently misconstrued what the children \u2014 in this reconstruction of the scene \u2014 had said, and emended a scriptural verse\u2019s legitimate Lutheran rendering to a similar-sounding but unattested wording. At Isaiah 16:8, Luther\u2019s text reads: \u201cits vine-branches are scattered, and over the sea.\u201d Bach caught sight of Calov\u2019s obvious typographical error \u201cFesser,\u201d but he evidently misheard a lector\u2019s utterance of the correct wording, and thus emended Luther\u2019s intended \u201cFeser\u201d (vine-branches) to the biblically unattested \u201cF\u00e4\u00dfer\u201d (wine-casks).\n\nThe Calov volumes also provide insight into Bach\u2019s professional and personal concerns, showing that he understood himself less as a modern artist than as a preacher who was following his religious vocation. An annotation in Latin that the Crocker Laboratory physicists have filed under \u201cdefinite Bach entries\u201d makes for especially poignant reading, as it takes note of manifold passages in the Bible\u2019s Solomonic literature speaking of how to find godly solace in a world that is hostile to people faithfully pursuing their divine callings. Sundry administrative records indicate that Bach often fell into trouble over philosophical differences with his employers about the place of music in worship and in education.\n\nOnly a handful of Bach\u2019s entries in Calov concern music, and these have received the most extensive \u2014 indeed, typically the only \u2014 attention from biographers. Leading writers have striven to explain these marginalia as progressive. In truth, all of them straightforwardly reflect conservative Lutheran thinking. What they share as well is a premodern interpretive approach called \u201ctypology,\u201d whereby events and principles in the era of ancient Israel act as \u201ctypes\u201d or \u201cshadows\u201d for their correlated \u201cantitypes\u201d or \u201csubstances\u201d in the era of Christianity. Typology was looked upon less as a scholarly path to intellectual understanding than as a doctrinal path to spiritual comfort.\n\nPhoto\n\nCiting one of Bach\u2019s annotations on music as key progressivist testimony, John Eliot Gardiner, in his 2013 biography \u201cBach: Music in the Castle of Heaven,\u201d wrote: \u201cBach understood that the more perfectly a composition is realized, both conceptually and through performance, the more God is immanent in the music. \u2018NB,\u2019 he wrote in the margin of his copy of Abraham Calov\u2019s Bible commentary, \u2018Where there is devotional music, God with his grace is always present.\u2019 This strikes me as a tenet that many of us as musicians automatically hold and aspire to whenever we meet to play music, regardless of whatever \u2018God\u2019 we happen to believe in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat a lovely, modern idea! Alas, no aspect of it could possibly have been part of Bach\u2019s understanding.\n\nLutherans like Bach certainly would have condemned as a grievous sin of idolatry any notion that the essence of a piece of music is, or turns into, the essence of God. And Bach\u2019s somewhat cryptic note is not even about the less heretical notion of God\u2019s possibly just \u201cdwelling\u201d within music, either. Its language plainly echoes more particularized orthodox Lutheran observations about God and music that were laid out in Johann Gerhard\u2019s \u201cSchool of Piety\u201d (1623), one of many books of practical theology listed in Bach\u2019s estate inventory.\n\nThus the impetus behind Bach\u2019s remark was not progressivist but doctrinal. The Old Testament text Bach commented on presents the \u201cshadow\u201d: At the sound of the priestly music, the \u201cGlory of the Lord\u201d inhabited the Jerusalem Temple. Bach\u2019s marginal note points to the orthodox Lutheran understanding of the \u201csubstance\u201d: At a rendering of devout music, the \u201cGrace-Presence\u201d of God will always inhabit the hearts of Christian believers, whose bodies, according to the New Testament, are \u201ca temple of the Holy Spirit.\u201d Bach had worked with these very tenets earlier in his career, when he composed glorious musical settings of them in his Cantata No. 172, \u201cRing Out, Ye Songs.\u201d\n\nBeside another significant passage in Calov, Bach wrote, \u201cA splendid demonstration [\u2018Beweis\u2019] that music has been mandated by God\u2019s spirit.\u201d Christoph Wolff\u2019s magisterial biography, \u201cJohann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician\u201d (2000), identifies Bach\u2019s use of \u201cBeweis\u201d here as an approving nod toward the term\u2019s centrality in the progressive methodology of scientific empiricism, a methodology that was held already during Bach\u2019s lifetime to be applicable also to theological principles.\n\nBut the noun \u201cBeweis\u201d was also used frequently, from the 16th through 18th centuries, in the same conservative way it\u2019s used in Bach\u2019s note: for the \u201cdemonstration\u201d of theological principles through study of biblical revelation alone. Bach\u2019s music likewise employs the word \u201cBeweis\u201d in its conventional pre\u2011Enlightenment, nonscientific sense. A recitative in his \u201cChristmas Oratorio\u201d proclaims that a believer\u2019s heart should safeguard the biblical account of the miracle of Christ\u2019s birth \u201cas a sure demonstration [\u2018Beweis\u2019]\u201d of salvation.\n\nBach was contractually answerable for choosing the liturgical poetry he set to music, and modern-day critics, in a bit of wishful thinking, often proclaim that his theologically conservative choices were designed simply to please his employers. But on this biographical question, the Calov volumes turn out to be acutely instructive. The sentiments expressed in Bach\u2019s vocal music are continually paralleled in his Calov notations. Most of his vocal music was composed from the 1710s to 1730s, whereas his Calov notations were entered in the 1730s and 1740s. In view of the fact that almost all the private notations come well after the public compositions, Bach obviously subscribed to the sentiments expressed in his vocal music.\n\nBoth Bach\u2019s music and his Calov notations put powerful stress upon: (1) contempt for human reason, along with the exalting of biblical revelation as the proper arbiter of truth; (2) disparagement of notions of human autonomy and achievement, along with the exalting of dependence on God, including for one\u2019s position in the social hierarchy; (3) contempt \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 for Judaism, Catholicism and Islam, along with the exalting of orthodox Lutheranism; (4) disdain for foreigners, along with the exalting of German faithfulness and goodness; and (5) the emphatic exalting of monarchical power, as authorized not by the people but by God. Nowhere in Bach\u2019s music or Calov notations are these sentiments contradicted.\n\nIn short, Bach, in his unswerving religious conservatism, was living and working very much at odds with the progressivist currents of his day, and ours. While we\u2019re arguably free to make use of him and his music in whatever new ways we find fitting, we ought also to be on the ethical alert for casting Bach in our own image.", "title": "Bach Was Far More Religious Than You Might Think", "authors": ["Michael Marissen"]}

Just like everything else in Manhattan there are plenty of complications, including streets that split in two, end unexpectedly or funnel you and your car into irreversible, borough-exiting bridge and tunnel maneuvers. But the idea of running back and forth is key to solving this puzzle.\n\nWhat about avenues, the roads that run up and down the borough, from Battery Park to Inwood?

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "This drives premiums up, making insurance still less attractive to the healthiest people. That, in turn, causes many to drop out, producing the fabled \u201cdeath spiral\u201d in which only the least healthy people remain insured. But at that point, private health insurance may no longer be viable, because annual treatment costs for serious illnesses often exceed several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nMost nations have solved this problem by adopting universal coverage financed by taxes. The United States probably would have followed this approach except for a historical anomaly during World War II. Fearing runaway inflation in tight labor markets, the American government imposed a cap on wages.\n\nBut the cap didn\u2019t apply to fringe benefits, which employers quickly exploited as a recruiting tool. Employer health plans proved particularly attractive, since their cost was a deductible expense and they were not taxed. Before the war started, only 9 percent of workers had employer-provided insurance, but 63 percent had it by 1953.\n\nTo be eligible for favorable tax treatment, companies were required to make their plans available to all employees, which mitigated the adverse-selection problem. People would lose insurance if they lost their jobs, which inhibited labor mobility, but since employment relationships were relatively durable in the postwar years, this arrangement worked well enough.\n\nBut after peaking at almost 70 percent in the 1990s, employer coverage began declining in the face of stagnating wages and rising insurance costs. By 2010, only 56 percent of the nonelderly American population still had workplace health plans.\n\nEven so, because more than 100 million Americans still had such plans and were reasonably satisfied with them, the Obama administration opted to build health reform atop the existing system. In addition to allowing people to keep their existing employer coverage, Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and established exchanges in which people without employer plans could buy insurance.\n\nAt the outset, Obamacare had three central features:\n\n\u2022 Insurers could not charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u2022 Those without coverage had to pay a penalty to the government (the \u201cmandate\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Low-income people would be eligible for subsidies.\n\nThe first two provisions were necessary to prevent the death spiral, and government couldn\u2019t mandate insurance purchases without adding subsidies for the poor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nDespite a bumpy rollout and some frustrations over shrinking choices and rising prices at health care exchanges, Obamacare was working remarkably well by most important metrics. Program costs were much lower than expected, and the uninsured rate among nonelderly Americans fell sharply \u2014 from 18.2 percent in 2010 to only 10.3 percent in 2018.\n\nThis progress is now imperiled.\n\nThe mandate \u2014 by far the program\u2019s least popular provision \u2014 was repealed as part of tax legislation passed in December 2017. And because economists predict that its absence will slowly rekindle the insurance death spiral, we\u2019re forced back to the policy drawing board.\n\nThe most common response has been to call for a variant of the single-payer systems employed by most other countries, which promise dramatic reductions in health costs.\n\nThe United States spends far more on health care than any other nation, yet gets worse outcomes on most measures. In part this is because administrative and marketing expenses are much lower under single-payer plans. But by far the most important source of savings is that governments are able to negotiate much more favorable terms with service providers. Virtually every procedure, test, and drug costs substantially more here than elsewhere.\n\nAn American hospital stay, for example, costs more than twelve times as much as one in the Netherlands. The single-payer approach also sidesteps the thorny mandate objection by covering everyone out of tax revenue.\n\nA June 2017 poll showed that 60 percent of Americans said the government should provide universal coverage, and support for single-payer insurance rose more than one-third since 2014.\n\nYet a move to a single-payer system faces the same hurdle that shaped Obamacare: Millions of Americans would resist any attempt to take their employer-provided plans away. And although single-payer health care would be far less costly overall, it would be paid for by taxes \u2014 the most visible form of sacrifice \u2014 rather than by the implicit levies that underwrite employer coverage.\n\nFrom a purely economic standpoint, the increased tax burden is irrelevant. It\u2019s a truism that making the economic pie larger necessarily makes it possible for everyone to get a larger slice than before. And because the gains from single-payer insurance would be so large, there must be ways to make everyone come out ahead, even in the short run.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker, for example, has proposed the introduction of Medicare Part E (Medicare for Everyone), which would allow anyone to buy into Medicare, regardless of age. The program\u2019s budget would be supported in part by levies on employers that don\u2019t offer insurance.\n\nThe cost savings inherent in this form of single-payer coverage would lead more and more firms to abandon their current plans voluntarily. Gradually, the age for standard Medicare eligibility also would fall until the entire population was covered by it. The Center for American Progress has now introduced a similar proposal.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to realize that there are attractive paths forward. In no other wealthy country do we see people organize bake sales to help pay for a neighbor\u2019s cancer care.

Facebook and internet penetration in the country is still around 30 percent. It\u2019s just as likely that this violence was organized not only through Facebook and WhatsApp but also through phone calls and words exchanged across a neighbor\u2019s fence. Facebook and WhatsApp are growing fast in Sri Lanka, but they are only a small part of an extremely polarized media world dominated by television and radio. Anti-minority hate speech, particularly against the Tamil minority, has been part of the Sri Lankan political landscape for decades. Now, it\u2019s Muslims, not just Tamils, who have become the target.\n\nWe have been conducting surveys and qualitative research on how people use mobile phones and the internet around the region for more than a decade. We recently focused on Myanmar to understand better how hate speech spreads. Social media use has grown at a stunning rate in Myanmar since 2014, at the same time that anti-Muslim violence linked to Buddhist chauvinist groups has escalated.\n\nWe noticed that people usually first encountered false stories in \u201caffinity circles\u201d \u2014 messages sent through Facebook or WhatsApp groups. Within those circles, the messages appear as a communication from a trusted friend or relative. Because many people belong to multiple affinity circles, the hate-speech messages would jump from one circle to another, in each case appearing as from a trusted person.\n\nIn other words, the human factor, not the platform alone, is important. This pattern is consistent with recent research about how falsehoods spread. A study by Sinan Aral at MIT analyzing about 126,000 Twitter \u201ccascades\u201d showed that false stories spread faster and further than true ones, perhaps because of their novelty, and that human beings \u2014 people passing along messages to their friends \u2014 were more important than bots.\n\nWhen mob-related violence does occur, the government relies on tactics developed during the colonial era: preventing the formation of mobs, usually through curfews, which stop people from gathering in public spaces.

There is a natural next step to using innuendo and the manufacturing of reasons to justify racism and xenophobia \u2014 namely to drop the facade altogether. Bannon is urging the adoption of an irrational bias against racial minorities, immigrants and foreigners, one that does not require reasons, even bad ones, to support it. And he recommends presenting such irrationality as virtuous.\n\nAccepting Bannon\u2019s advice requires rejecting empathy for already embattled groups. Some might view that as acceptable, preferring to weigh only statistical arguments in deciding what to do about, for example, immigration policy. But taking Bannon\u2019s advice also requires rejecting any recognizable practice of giving plausible reasons for holding a view or position. To proudly identify as a xenophobe is to identify as someone who is not interested in argument. It is to be irrationally fearful of foreigners, and proudly so. It means not masking one\u2019s irrationality even from oneself.\n\nBannon\u2019s rhetorical move of transforming vices based on irrational prejudice into virtues is not without historical precedent. Hitler devotes the second chapter of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d to explaining how his time in Vienna as a young man transformed him into a \u201cfanatical anti-Semite.\u201d To be fanatical is, by definition, to be irrational. To be an anti-Semite is to have irrational prejudice against Jews. Hitler presents his transformation into a fanatical anti-Semite positively. It is, in Hitler\u2019s rhetoric, not only a good thing to harbor irrational hatred of Jewish people. One should do so fanatically. Such fanatical irrationality is, in Hitler\u2019s rhetoric, virtuous.\n\nOf course, comparing rhetoric and policies are two different things. No recent far-right movement in Europe or the United States has enacted the sort of genocidal policies that the Nazis did, and no such comparison is intended. But history has shown that the sort of subversion of language that Bannon has engaged in is often deeply intertwined with what a government will do, and what its people will allow. Bannon\u2019s own cheer to the National Front members \u2014 \u201cThe tide of history is with us and it will compel us to victory after victory after victory\u201d \u2014 shows clearly enough that he does not mean his efforts to end in mere speech.\n\nIn the 20th-century scholar Victor Klemperer\u2019s \u201cLanguage of the Third Reich\u201d there is a chapter titled \u201cFanatical.\u201d In it, Klemperer reports that the Nazis regularly inverted the meanings of ordinary words, in just the way that Bannon recommends: by turning vices or negative ideals into virtues. (This point is well-known enough to have been the basis of a famous comedy sketch, \u201cAre we the baddies?\u201d) To be sure, it was not only the Nazis who chose to invert the valence of words that were negative because of their connection with unthinking irrationality; some American slavery abolitionists called their own beliefs in the moral wrongness of slavery fanatical.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "To Tuchman, folly begins with the most fundamental of things: an outsize and self-destructive will to power. Both the governors and the governed can overreach, convinced of their own rectitude and righteousness. \u201cChief among the forces affecting political folly is lust for power, named by Tacitus as \u2018the most flagrant of all the passions,\u2019\u201d Tuchman wrote. \u201cBecause it can only be satisfied by power over others, government is its favorite field of exercise,\u201d or what she calls the \u201cparamount area of folly because it is there that men seek power over others \u2014 only to lose it over themselves.\u201d In this light, President Trump and his alt-right coterie are not something new under the sun but another chapter in the oldest of human dramas: the tension between appetite and the common good, between ambition and common sense.\n\nThere is a lesson here not only for the president but for the people \u2014 particularly the people who chose to support him in 2016 and who stand with him now, apparently come what may. \u201cPersistence in error is the problem,\u201d Tuchman wrote. One of the more troubling features of popular political life is blind tribal loyalty \u2014 the refusal to acknowledge that your chief or your kind could be wrong. A perennial issue, this reflexive defensiveness is especially pronounced at the moment. But the historically literate voter, like a historically literate decision maker, need not be captive to previously held opinions at all times and at any cost. \u201cThere is,\u201d Tuchman wrote, \u201calways freedom of choice to change or desist from a counterproductive course if the policy-maker\u201d \u2014 or, in my view, the voter \u2014 \u201chas the moral courage to exercise it. He is not a fated creature blown by the whims of Homeric gods. Yet to recognize error, to cut losses, to alter course, is the most repugnant option in government.\u201d And in the mind and heart of a fervent voter who was determined to send a message to Washington that business as usual was not working. The question now, more than a year into business as unusual, is whether those who supported the populist insurgency of 2016 will honestly assess its effectiveness in 2018 and in 2020. \u201cWooden-headedness\u201d in the Oval Office, alas, begins in the voting booth.\n\nHow do we stop marches of folly? Tuchman was thoughtful on the question, realizing that history was not a panacea. \u201cWhole philosophies have evolved over the question whether the human species is predominately good or evil,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI only know that it is mixed, that you cannot separate good from bad, that wisdom, courage and benevolence exist alongside knavery, greed and stupidity; heroism and fortitude alongside vainglory, cruelty and corruption.\u201d\n\nThat observation appeared in a 1981 collection of her essays titled \u201cPracticing History.\u201d Perhaps her least known work, it is engaging and wise, and in it she took a proportionate view of the human condition. \u201cAmid a mass of worldwide troubles and a poor record for the 20th century,\u201d Tuchman wrote, \u201cwe see our species \u2014 with cause \u2014 as functioning very badly, as blunderers when not knaves, as violent, ignoble, corrupt, inept, incapable of mastering the forces that threaten us, weakly subject to our worst instincts; in short, decadent.\u201d\n\nIt was, she argued, an easy, if unhappy, case to make at the time. (As it is now.) \u201cA century that took shape in the disillusion which followed the enormous effort and hopes of World War I,\u201d Tuchman wrote, \u201cthat saw revolution in Russia congeal into the same tyranny it overthrew, saw a supposedly civilized nation revert under the Nazis into organized and unparalleled savagery, saw the craven appeasement by the democracies, is understandably marked by suspicion of human nature.\u201d", "title": "Barbara W.

Ms. Burns stuck to places within her price range. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tempt myself,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWithin weeks, Ms. Burns saw the first place she liked, an alcove studio in a 1939 building on a pretty block in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. It was asking $349,000, with monthly maintenance of $400. At the open house, she talked to some neighbors, who were \u201call superfriendly and engaging,\u201d she said.\n\nThe studio, which was in great shape, had a sunken living area, a separate kitchen and a built-in bookshelf sectioning off the sleeping alcove.\n\nIt had been on the market for a month, and the price had fallen, so \u201cI felt confident I could put in a slightly lower offer and they would bite,\u201d Ms. Burns said. She bid $330,000. But someone else had the winning bid at $340,000.\n\nShe found another promising alcove studio on Ocean Parkway in Kensington. The location, on a thoroughfare, was less appealing, but the 1965 building, called Caton Towers, had a similar close-knit feel, with children running a bake sale in the lobby.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis apartment was listed at $279,000, with maintenance of $600 a month. Ms. Burns offered $308,000. She was at a work conference, and stayed in touch with Ms. McQueen throughout the day as the seller negotiated, but it went to someone else for $315,000.\n\nShe was more disheartened after losing out on this second co-op. She checked listings multiple times a day, but rarely saw anything new. \u201cI felt I had memorized every listing,\u201d she said, and many of them seemed to be in terrible condition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut then, another studio in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens appeared, in a 1927 building, for just $199,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$500s and a monthly assessment of around $150. Ms. Burns immediately had Ms. McQueen contact the listing agent, who already had an offer in hand. \u201cThat was crazy,\u201d Ms. Burns said. \u201cIt was listed mere hours before.\u201d\n\nShe left work to see it, and loved what she found: a sunny, boxy sponsor unit, just renovated, with plenty of closet space. She immediately offered $250,000.\n\nHaving been outbid twice, she said, \u201cI knew it was a good find. I would rather go in aggressive up front.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe offer was accepted. Relieved, she arrived in the fall, having measured everything \u2014 including distances between electrical outlets \u2014 so she could plan the space. Her parents, who had done plenty of work on their own Arts and Crafts house in Worcester, Mass., helped her install curtains and some light fixtures.\n\nHer mother, a ceramic artist, also made a planter to hang in the bathroom. But it soon fell into and damaged the bathtub. \u201cI think we didn\u2019t install it correctly,\u201d Ms. Burns said. To repair the tub, she used the contractor who did the renovation for the sponsor.\n\nUsing her own sense of d\u00e9cor, she added a room divider with plantation shutters and is now collaborating with her mother to design wallpaper for the kitchen. She also built a coffee table from a slab of wood and four hairpin legs.\n\n\u201cI love living by myself and being able to decorate and style the place exactly as I want to,\u201d Ms. Burns said. \u201cOwning is what I needed in order to tackle my biggest design project yet.\u201d", "title": "Becoming a First-Time Buyer in Brooklyn", "authors": ["Joyce Cohen", "The Hunt"]}
{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "Although the ritual itself has an incalculably long history, the term \u201csexual harassment\u201d has only been around since the mid-1970s, when activists at Cornell University coined it during a consciousness-raising session. It was MacKinnon\u2019s book, though dense and academic, that brought the idea broader attention, charting a course for the legal system to more effectively handle instances of harassment as cases of sex discrimination, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As far back as the 19th century, women were occasionally able to reap monetary damages through the courts if men touched them inappropriately in public, but tort law was an inadequate means of addressing harassment claims, MacKinnon believed, because it personalized injuries that were inflicted socially and ecumenically.\n\nLawyers who had tried to apply the civil rights statute to these claims had largely failed, in part because courts struggled to process what was essentially discriminatory about a practice that could theoretically victimize anyone: How could you ever know that a woman was subject to harassment because she was a woman, rather than, say, an individual who happened to be female? MacKinnon\u2019s approach was rooted in the theory that sexual harassment realized and reiterated women\u2019s inequality, that it locked women into a kind of dependence and failure.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was not until seven years after the arrival of MacKinnon\u2019s book, though, that the Supreme Court recognized sexual harassment as a Title VII violation. The case was Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson and it had little nuance. In it a bank teller had charged that a company vice president had coerced her into having sex with him repeatedly, that he had touched her in public and raped her. Here the court ruled unanimously that harassment resulting in a hostile work environment was discriminatory and unlawful.\n\nIn a recent essay in The New York Times, MacKinnon celebrated the #MeToo movement, acknowledging that it was able to achieve what sexual harassment law, despite its sporadic victories, could not: a unified movement against an intractable brand of predation. Accusers were suddenly believed. Why the revolution finally got the reception it deserved has still not entirely been sorted out, but it seems clear that a war waged from the vantage point of legal theory was bound to have a harder time than a war waged from the modern media.\n\nThe 1970s and \u201980s witnessed various efforts to expose and address the dark and dangerous habits of American intimacy. Movements against domestic violence and child abuse, for example, had meaningful allies in popular culture. In 1984, \u201cThe Burning Bed,\u201d a television movie based on the true story of a Michigan housewife, Francine Hughes Wilson, who lit her husband on fire while he was sleeping, in retaliation for years of brutality, was viewed by 75 million people. The movie was crucial in transforming public understanding of spousal abuse: Shelters for battered women began opening around the country; the police began to take the issue more seriously; women who killed battering partners, and children who killed battering parents, were understood to be victims of a destructive syndrome that often gave them judicial reprieve.\n\nBest-selling thrillers like \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d and \u201cWhen the Bough Breaks\u201d took on child abuse and molestation, and by the 1990s we began to see the spread of community notification laws that required convicted sex offenders to register. The law followed in a sense what narrative awakened first.\n\nThe movement against sexual harassment had something else, however: a mass-market antagonist in the empire of Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan magazine, which preached a feminism of patriarchal compliance. Brown encouraged young women to work hard, build careers and run companies, but to accomplish it all by coddling the men they worked with and finding sexual freedom along the way. In \u201cSex and the Office,\u201d Brown\u2019s sequel to her loopy best-selling instructional \u201cSex and the Single Girl,\u201d she delivered a playbook for the way young women should understand male bosses that included lessons in making them feel godlike. Colleagues were potential sexual partners and the cubicle was Tinder: \u201cThough it may seem to the untrained eye that you are selflessly working on office projects together, what you are really doing is sinking into them like a cobalt treatment so that you may make off with them after work.\u201d\n\nThe book appeared in 1968 and in 2004 was reissued with an enthusiastic blurb from Donald Trump. In the 1990s, Brown\u2019s brand of feminism, dependent on the idea that women needed to work within the structures available to them, gained a new currency and held on for a long time. MacKinnon, of course, believed that the structure itself was the problem, a notion that for more than three decades has largely been received as benighted and fusty.

In one of the most pivotal moves, Mr. Wang helped set the stage for a takeover of HNA by company insiders and their families \u2014 a change that transferred control of a state-backed company into private hands.\n\nIn recent years, HNA emerged seemingly out of nowhere to become one of the most prolific dealmakers in the world, spending billions of dollars on acquisitions in real estate, finance and logistics. Investors and regulators in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere have been trying to understand the ambitions, operations and finances of the global behemoth \u2014 and the players who have helped shape the company, including Wang Wei.\n\nThose questions have taken on more urgency as Chinese authorities press the country\u2019s most aggressive acquisitors to pare back their debt. In a dramatic move, the Chinese government last month seized control of the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City and other multibillion-dollar properties around the world.\n\nIn the current climate, HNA, which has amassed about $90 billion in debt, is reversing course and selling off assets. Other pending deals by the company remain in limbo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnderstanding HNA is difficult. The conglomerate controls a vast network of public and private companies, subsidiaries and affiliates spread across the world. Scores of them have business ties to the friends and family members of the company\u2019s senior executives.\n\nA review by The Times found that few, if any, of those personal ties were disclosed to stock and bonds investors of the company\u2019s affiliates. Typically, investors want to understand such dealings, which could create conflicts of interest.\n\nWhether Wang Wei was ever formally employed by HNA or its predecessor, Hainan Airlines, is unclear. A review of hundreds of company filings going back to the mid-1990s turned up only a handful of mentions of him by name, and none indicate that he is the younger brother of a top HNA executive. In some cases \u2014 like the early negotiations for the Oki Golf deal \u2014 the private investment firms of Wang Wei, or those of other relatives, operated behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cThese transactions are carefully reviewed to ensure that they were in all respects beneficial to HNA,\u201d Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer for HNA, said in an email. \u201cWorking with a business partner who is known to the company and its leadership allowed the parties to work collaboratively from a position of trust and cooperation and, in so doing, achieved even greater results.\u201d\n\nCalls to Mr. Wang\u2019s homes and offices were not returned.\n\nFor years, Mr. Wang was largely unknown as a businessman in China. He granted few media interviews and rarely posed for photographs. Even on Hainan Island, where he worked for more than a decade, he was mainly known for running a company that was trying to produce Cuban-style cigars.\n\nThen roughly a decade ago, Mr. Wang appeared as a major investor in one of China\u2019s biggest property companies, Dalian Wanda. Records show that in July 2007, he bought a sizable stake in the family holding company of Wanda\u2019s chairman on the same day that a company controlled by the son of a member of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo took a stake in one of its subsidiaries. Another one of Wang Wei\u2019s investment firms bought a big stake in the Three Gorges Bank, in the city of Chongqing, in about 2008.\n\nThe roots of his wealth, though, are tied to HNA and Hainan Airlines.\n\nAfter his brother Wang Jian helped found the state-backed Hainan Airlines in the early 1990s, the younger Mr. Wang became one of the company\u2019s frequent business partners. He set up joint ventures and other businesses to provide services to the airline, including advertising and leasing. He also helped the carrier move into golf, resorts and property development.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2010, Mr. Wang set up more than 30 companies that did business with HNA and its affiliates, according to corporate filings. One company, a software services firm called eKing, was acquired by HNA, which later sold a piece to private investors for $500 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn some deals, Mr. Wang started out managing a project on behalf of HNA before quietly taking ownership through another entity.\n\nIt happened with West Coast Golf.\n\nIn October 1996, Hainan Airlines invited some of the world\u2019s leading golf course designers, including a team working for the golf legend Jack Nicklaus, to help build an 18-hole golf course on a 350-acre plot of oceanfront property in Haikou, the capital of Hainan. When construction began, the winning design team was introduced to Wang Wei.\n\n\u201cHe would attend all the meetings,\u201d said O\u2019Brien McGarey, the president of the Dye Designs Group of Denver, which won the design competition. \u201cI never really understood what his role was, but I knew he was Wang Jian\u2019s younger brother.

But Wang Wei was involved in the planning. Mr. Wang eventually gained control of the development through one of his businesses, the Sunny Bay Development Company, according to corporate filings.\n\nToday, the development site is home to one of the island\u2019s most expensive tourist destinations \u2014 the Park Hyatt Sanya Sunny Bay Resort and a collection of luxury villas that each sell for more than $7 million. Caleb Wang, chief executive of the HTW Tourism Group, said that in 2005 his company bought a majority stake in the development site from Wang Wei.\n\n\u201cHe is still a small shareholder,\u201d said the chief executive of HTW, who is not related to Mr. Wang. \u201cI\u2019ve only met him once. He was here for the opening of the Park Hyatt.\u201d\n\nWang Wei also has ties to one of HNA\u2019s biggest shareholders.\n\nBeginning around 2000, a company managed by Mr. Wang built a stake in one of the airline\u2019s largest investors, a company called Hainan Qixing, with other HNA insiders that included his brother. The participation of HNA insiders does not appear to have been disclosed in public filings. Regulators in China and elsewhere often require disclosure of so-called related party deals involving senior executives or members of their families.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough Qixing, Mr. Wang and company insiders restructured the state-backed airline into a privately held parent company called the HNA Group. A large portion of HNA\u2019s shares were then shifted offshore, to Pan American Aviation, a company registered in the Cayman Islands, according to a review of corporate filings in China and Hong Kong.\n\nIn recent months, United States regulators conducting a review of HNA acquisition have pressed the conglomerate to explain its corporate ownership structure, according to court papers filed in an American lawsuit.\n\nAs HNA grew into a global powerhouse, Wang Wei went global, too.\n\nWhen Hainan Airlines was expanding, it needed to procure goods like jet fuel, aircrafts and spare parts from foreign companies, including Boeing, General Electric and Mitsubishi of Japan. Hainan Airlines formed a series of companies inside and outside China to help source these goods and ship them into the country, for a fee.\n\nOne of the companies set up to work with the airline was the Hainan HNA Import & Export Company, a firm partly controlled by Wang Wei, his brother Wang Jian and a group of their longtime business associates, according to corporate records. The import company, in other words, gave the Wang brothers an interest in the company\u2019s purchase of overseas goods, giving them a stake in a business that apparently was not disclosed to investors in Hainan Airlines, a listed company.\n\nMr. Wang\u2019s ties to HNA and its top executives run deep. In 2007, he bought what is now a $5 million residence near Seattle from a company controlled by HNA\u2019s co-chairman, Chen Feng. Then, Mr. Wang\u2019s daughter registered two limited liability companies in the city.\n\nOne of those companies helped West Coast Golf initiate talks to acquire the Oki Golf properties.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, one of Mr. Wang\u2019s associates asked for help locating golf facilities in the United States, according to Mr. McGarey, the Denver-based golf course designer who had begun working with Wang Wei in the mid-1990s.\n\nMr. McGarey said that he had negotiated an agreement, which included a \u201csuccess fee,\u201d and then signed a contract with Mr. Wang\u2019s West Coast Golf. The document, he said, was reviewed by HNA lawyers on behalf of West Coast Golf. Soon after, he was put in touch with Mr. Wang\u2019s son-in-law in Seattle, Mike Ji. They began scouting golf courses in Washington State.\n\nWhen they settled on Oki Golf as a prospect, Mr. McGarey brought in two advisers to help with the assessment of Oki\u2019s courses: Dan Conway and Don Lewison.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTogether, they approached Scott Oki, the former Microsoft executive who owned Oki Golf.\n\n\u201cI got a hold of Scott Oki. He lives across the street from me,\u201d Mr. Lewison, a Seattle real estate broker, recalled. \u201cWe met in my house, over coffee and doughnuts. I told him we had a friend who had Chinese clients, and he told me he might want to sell to them.\u201d\n\nNegotiations got underway quickly \u2014 but by the end of 2015, the American advisers said the talks appeared to have gone nowhere.\n\nThen in October 2016, Oki Golf announced that it had agreed to sell a collection of courses to the HNA Group for $137 million in cash. Mr. Oki and HNA declined to comment on the deal.\n\nMr. McGarey said he and the two advisers were cut out of the deal \u2014 and the fees promised in the contract with West Coast Golf.\n\n\u201cHis son-in-law Mike Ji called me after the deal was announced, and said, \u2018HNA was the buyer, and it had nothing to do with Wang Wei.\u2019\u201d Mr. McGarey recalled. \u201cI was furious.

Moscow is fully complicit in Mr. Assad\u2019s murderous campaign against the primarily Sunni opposition, which has now reached new levels of depravity with the indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Ghouta, a suburban area outside Damascus. Moscow\u2019s alliance with Mr. Assad and Iran in slaughtering Sunnis risks alienating Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Turkey. It also will inflame Russia\u2019s own Sunni Muslim population and their brethren in Central Asia and the Caucasus, lighting the fuse for more terrorism directed at Moscow.\n\nMr. Putin insists that any Russians now fighting on the ground in Syria are guns for hire. But American intelligence believes that the man who controls them is Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a prominent oligarch close to Mr. Putin who takes his orders from the Kremlin and is one of the 13 oligarchs recently indicted in the United States\u2019 special prosecutor\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling the 2016 election. Irregular or not, the Russian fighters in Syria increasingly find themselves in crossfires of their own making, including an ill-advised attack on American-backed anti-Islamic State forces in eastern Syria. When American air power came to their defense, as many as 200 Russians may have been killed. Mr. Putin swept the debacle under the rug to avoid acknowledging the deaths at home \u2014 having repeatedly declared mission accomplished \u2014 or risking direct conflict with the United States.\n\nSyria may not be Russia\u2019s new Afghan quagmire yet, but its quicksand is sucking Russia in deeper and deeper.\n\nMeanwhile, whatever national pride Mr. Putin piqued in seizing Crimea is getting old, and the region\u2019s needs make a consistent claim on Russia\u2019s treasury. Worse, his intervention in Eastern Ukraine has precipitated many of the very developments Mr. Putin sought to prevent.\n\nNATO is more energized than it has been in years \u2014 not because of President Trump\u2019s browbeating, but in response to Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression. The alliance now has forces on regular rotational air, land and sea deployments along Russia\u2019s border, and its budget is increasing, in part with a sustained infusion of funds from the United States. The European Union has revived the idea of strengthening its own defense capacity, spurred on by Mr. Putin\u2019s threats and Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetorical retreat from America\u2019s commitment to Europe\u2019s defense. Europeans are getting more serious about energy security. They are multiplying new routes, connections and sources for fuel and renewable power. That\u2019s making it harder for Mr. Putin to use oil and gas as strategic levers.

But he said he did not \u201cspend a lot of time thinking about race, quite frankly,\u201d when asked if he felt responsibility as the most prominent African-American in an overwhelmingly white administration.\n\nStill, Mr. Carson said that he was trying to soften Mr. Trump\u2019s tone. \u201cI have moderated my own speech because I recognized that when I say things in an inflammatory manner, that\u2019s not particularly helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cI have made it known to everyone in the administration, including the president.\u201d\n\nThe power dynamic in the relationship, however, is clearly tilted. Mr. Trump shot down Mr. Carson\u2019s choice for deputy secretary, Rick A. Lazio, a former Long Island congressman who savaged the president during the campaign.\n\nAt around the same time, the White House press office also rejected the secretary\u2019s request to appear on CNN and then told him to clear all media appearances, much to Mr. Carson\u2019s annoyance, aides said.\n\nHe often simply seems out of the loop \u2014 telling senior staff members at a gathering last spring that the president had given him assurances that HUD\u2019s budget would not be cut at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongressional Democrats have also proved to be a problem.

That\u2019s a new secretary I haven\u2019t seen!\u201d Mr. Williams said after the secretary raised his voice during a televised town-hall-style meeting recently.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut that forcefulness has often been absent in his dealing with staff members. His first six months in office were marked by damaging infighting and the departure of dozens of experienced people.\n\nMr. Carson\u2019s first chief of staff, Sheila Greenwood, a HUD veteran, clashed with Lynne Patton, a former officer with a charitable foundation run by Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric, who was given a top department job without any consultation with the secretary.\n\nTheir conflict came to a head when Ms. Greenwood rejected Ms. Patton\u2019s request for an Amtrak ticket from Washington to New York, ordering her to take a shuttle flight at a cheaper contracted rate. Ms. Patton told associates she was offended, then paid for the train ticket out of pocket. To alleviate the tension, Mr. Carson arranged for Ms. Patton to be transferred to HUD\u2019s New York City regional office, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nMr. Carson complained about her behavior \u2014 and requested her apology this year when she called a White House reporter \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d on Twitter \u2014 but he has not taken more serious disciplinary action, and Ms. Patton still enjoys the protection of her friends in the White House.\n\nTo the consternation of some staff members, Mr. Carson has leaned heavily on his family, especially his wife, Candy \u2014 who occupied a space in Mr. Carson\u2019s office suite for much of his first year in office, said a Carson confidant.\n\nA former chief administrative officer in the department, Helen Goff Foster, has filed a complaint with the federal whistle-blower agency, the Office of Special Counsel, alleging that she was demoted and transferred after she refused Mrs. Carson\u2019s request to circumvent a rule capping redecorating expenses for Mr. Carson\u2019s office to $5,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Carsons, through a HUD spokesman, denied her claim. But shortly after, someone in Mr. Carson\u2019s office decided to pay a small Baltimore company $31,561 to replace his dining room table, chairs and hutch. The secretary did not know about the purchase, according to his spokesman, Raffi Williams. After the spokesman said last week that Mr. Carson had no plans to reverse the decision, Armstrong Williams said two days later that the secretary was trying to cancel the order.\n\nIssues involving Ben Carson Jr., the secretary\u2019s son and a Maryland-based businessman, have proven equally troublesome. Mr. Carson invited him to a Baltimore listening tour last summer, despite a warning from department lawyers, during one of his daily briefings, about a potential ethics problem.\n\nIn response to the lawyers, Mr. Carson summoned his son and his wife, a government contractor, to ask if they were doing anything wrong \u2014 then left the decision of whether they planned to attend up to them, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. They did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with ethics,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cHere is a rather unique situation, Ben is somebody who is integrally important to me, and wants to help. I\u2019m not going to just say no because it looks this way or that way.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are ethically pure.\u201d\n\nSuch questions, Mr. Carson believes, are a distraction from his grand vision of HUD as a ladder out of dependency for the working poor. Increasingly, he is staking that legacy on a single program, the so-called EnVision Centers project.\n\nOver the next three to five years, Mr. Carson hopes to establish more than 3,000 of the centers to provide low-income families, especially young people, with one-stop access to educational, job training, mentorship and health care services. But Ms. Greenwood argued that Mr. Carson\u2019s team was not experienced enough to make it work, and it soon became apparent that there was little appetite in the White House for more than a pittance in funding \u2014 $2 million over the next year.\n\nIn response, Mr. Carson has turned to charitable foundations for funding. But he has not proved to be the best pitchman, according to a dozen attendees at a January meeting with potential donors at HUD headquarters. He began with a libertarian lecture, extolling the genius of the 19th-century robber barons who created the country\u2019s philanthropic charities. They had spared the country from \u201cEuropean socialism,\u201d he said.\n\nOne skeptical foundation officer countered by asking the secretary where \u201cthe public\u201d part of the public-private partnership was coming from. Another asked, \u201cWhat does this have to do with public housing?\u201d\n\nBut his audience, mainly composed of community development specialists who believe that the government has an enduring moral responsibility to help the poor, was most put off by Mr. Carson\u2019s assertion that the goal of EnVision was to put HUD out of business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with encouraging safe, inviting places for youth to grow,\u201d said Adrianne Todman, chief executive of the Washington-based National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. \u201cBut it is time for us to focus on the \u2018H\u2019 in HUD \u2014 \u2018housing.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Ben Carson of HUD on His Vexing Reign: Brain Surgery Was Easier Than This", "authors": ["Glenn Thrush"]}

The team\u2019s third-base coach, Glenn Sherlock, who handles the catching instruction, said the catchers\u2019 past preparation was good but in need of taking the next step. By talking more about the art of pitching, the goal is to help the catchers develop the confidence of the pitching staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting through the game and not discussing it,\u201d Sherlock said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of discussion about effectiveness and pitch selection this season.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBy studying the information and presenting it, d\u2019Arnaud said he would have faster recall and better memorization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll help us learn the information better,\u201d d\u2019Arnaud said. \u201cNot only do we hear it, but we\u2019ll have to say it.

Dickey trade, has been injured and much maligned, and Plawecki, a compensatory first-round pick in 2012, has developed slowly.\n\nPhoto\n\nStatistically, both are average major league catchers, a hard truth about their grueling position. Last season, the league average catcher posted a .720 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, the lowest of all the nonpitching positions, according to FanGraphs.com. Including strong finishes to the 2017 season by both, d\u2019Arnaud posted a .735 O.P.S. over 112 games, and Plawecki notched a .764 in a third as many appearances.\n\nDefensively, though, d\u2019Arnaud is considered a better pitch framer and receiver than the analytics give him credit for. But he and Plawecki have room for improvement, especially in preventing stolen bases, another Mets weakness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting more out of them, especially a team like this and Mickey\u2019s philosophy on pitching,\u201d said the Hall of Fame catcher Mike Piazza, who spent a few days late last month in his annual role as a Mets spring training instructor. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with challenging yourself to take the next step.\u201d\n\nDuring their roster overhaul in the off-season, the Mets did not upgrade at catcher, preferring the potential of their in-house options to the cost of adding a new player.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe final month and a half of a disappointing 2017 season offered the Mets some hope that a combination of d\u2019Arnaud and Plawecki might just work. After the team let the veteran backup Rene Rivera go as part of its late-season sell-off, d\u2019Arnaud and Plawecki platooned and flourished.\n\nPerhaps it was the competition or the regular rest, but d\u2019Arnaud hit .297 with six home runs and 20 runs batted from Aug. 19 on. Plawecki hit .303 with three home runs and 12 walks in the same period.\n\nThe Mets plan to play either catcher based on the matchups this season, and neither player said that would be an issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competition, but a friendly competition, where we can turn it into a positive and benefit from it,\u201d Plawecki said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit there and wish bad things on each other.

We can expect advisory firms like Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and other participants \u2014 not to mention our own political parties themselves \u2014 to pounce on this new vector for political messaging and take direct aim at our open political discourse.\n\nDespite these myriad risks, industry professionals seem to have turned a blind eye to the oncoming specter of A.I., likely because they are optimistic about its commercial potential. The leading internet firms are offering free A.I. courses for their brightest engineers; are developing plans to integrate A.I. across their leading brands and products; and are staffing up with brilliant philosophers, ethicists and technocrats to deflect nosy regulators and win over the merchants of information. In his interview with The New York Times last week, Mark Zuckerberg even went so far as to describe A.I. as the antidote that will cure the internet of such negative externalities as hate speech and election interference. What internet firms are not transparent about, though, is the degree to which they plan to integrate A.I. into their principal profit-generating engine: digital advertising.\n\nConsider the scale and complexity of the advertising ecosystem. Global internet firms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Google collectively enjoy billions of active users who on average spend more than two hours on these platforms every day. Each user might be shown hundreds or thousands of digital display ads \u2014 or \u201csponsored\u201d content \u2014 within that time. People in the industry leverage an intricate web of ad agencies, exchanges, networks, demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms to manage the delivery of those ads around the clock.\n\nBut if you could remove those people from the equation, you could quietly turn a $100 billion digital ad industry into a $1 trillion persuasion machine.\n\nTo be clear, algorithms have long been part and parcel of the industry. Organizations like the Russian government and Cambridge Analytica were taking advantage of them simply by virtue of using social media for political communications. But the sharp uptick in industry research and development in A.I. over the past year strongly suggests that this new technology will soon be brought to bear in digital advertising. This will increase the speed of ad mediation, inundating users with content finely tuned to their personal desires. It will abet the seamless and accurate development of \u201clook alike\u201d audiences, enabling advertisers to upload their customer lists and automatically send ads to like-minded people that they do not already know. And it will enable automated contingency-based marketing, allowing clients to programmatically trigger certain kinds of content to be shared in the moments after real world events transpire.", "title": "Opinion | Beware of A.I. in Social Media Advertising", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "Now, with their forthcoming report, the Republicans on the committee have turned their focus to attacking the substance of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe special counsel is examining three core issues: Did Russia attack the 2016 elections to aid Mr. Trump; did Mr. Trump or members of his campaign collude with the Russians to do so; and did Mr. Trump or others obstruct the investigation of these matters? The committee majority report, which has yet to be released but which members of the majority have begun to tease out in recent days, is an attempt to defang the first question, finding against all evidence that the Russian attack was not intended to help Mr. Trump (though a few members of the majority, including Representative Trey Gowdy, have been more equivocal). And the majority report endeavors to gut the second question, declaring the absence of collusion altogether.\n\nIt would be a grave error to think the committee will stop here, especially its chairman. There is nothing in Mr. Nunes\u2019s record to suggest that he will let up in the face of opposition, whether from the stray dissenters within his own (still largely compliant) ranks who have emerged, or from the outside. The so-called \u201cNunes memo,\u201d although widely considered a flop, was just the first in a series that he has said he plans to issue.\n\nHaving assailed the first two prongs of the Mueller investigation, we can now expect Mr. Nunes and his colleagues to turn to the third, and the one perhaps most perilous to the president: obstruction of justice. The president and his supporters have argued that his constitutional power to direct the Justice Department and the F.B.I. and to fire their personnel means he cannot as a matter of law be held accountable for obstructing an investigation. That is wrong; the Supreme Court has held that those presidential powers may be curtailed, and American law is replete with examples of obstruction prosecutions of officials for abusing their undoubted official powers.\n\nMr. Nunes and his committee majority have demonstrated little regard for such niceties, and we fully expect them to weigh in on the side of the president, and against accountability. Should Mr. Mueller move to compel the president to testify by obtaining a grand jury subpoena, for example, look for them to back arguments circulated by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers that the special counsel has not met the threshold for such a step. The fact that Mr. Mueller has accumulated compelling evidence of obstruction is unlikely to give the committee majority pause.", "title": "Opinion | Beware of Devin Nunes\u2019s Next Move", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "Your rules should revolve around added sweeteners, rather than the natural ones in fruits, vegetables and dairy. It\u2019s not that the added ones are so much worse (despite what you may have heard about high-fructose corn syrup). Many researchers believe that sugar is sugar. But people don\u2019t generally overeat natural sugars. Have you ever inhaled five apples in one sitting?\n\nThe online guide has many more details, but here are a few rules to consider:\n\nFix your breakfast. It\u2019s the most sugar-packed meal, and it doesn\u2019t need to be. Eggs, fruit, nuts, plain yogurt, plain oatmeal and traditional pita bread are delicious \u2014 and free of added sugars. If you\u2019re pressed for time, boil a dozen eggs, refrigerate them and grab one or two in the morning. A sign of a good breakfast plate: It has an array of natural colors.\n\nRedo your pantry. Steer clear of staples \u2014 like sauces, crackers and breads \u2014 with unnecessary sugars. There are plenty of unsweetened alternatives, like Victoria\u2019s pasta sauces, French\u2019s Yellow Mustard, Maille Dijon mustard, Saltines, Triscuits and some Trader Joe\u2019s tortillas. Once you spend a little time reading ingredient lists, the unsweetened staples can become your defaults. Trader Joe\u2019s is an especially good place to shop, but supermarkets work, too.\n\nEliminate soda. Just get rid of it. Soda and sports drinks are essentially liquid sugar, and are the largest source of added sweeteners in the American diet. Switch to flavored seltzer or, if you must, diet soda. The health effects of diet soda still are not clear, but it seems considerably less bad.\n\nWhip portion inflation. Restaurant desserts are often family-size servings marketed as individual portions. The marble-loaf cake at Starbucks, for example, has more sugar than most adults should eat in an entire day. Your grandparents didn\u2019t eat desserts like this. When you eat out, think of every dessert as a serving for two. It\u2019s better to put some in the garbage than on your waistline.\n\nThe best news about sugar is that Americans are finally catching on. Sales of regular soda are plunging. Some food brands are starting to brag about not adding sweeteners. For a long time, we didn\u2019t even realize what Big Sugar was trying to do us. Now we do \u2014 and we can fight back.", "title": "Opinion | Big Sugar Versus Your Body", "authors": []}

The current push involves one such rule, which requires banks to hold a certain level of capital on their balance sheets based on their total asset size, regardless of how risky those assets are. For instance, cash or customer deposits held at the Federal Reserve are treated the same as riskier assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds. The rule, known as the supplementary leverage ratio, is aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big risks without properly preparing for a disaster.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Senate bill, sponsored by Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, would create a small exemption. As it is currently worded, it would most likely apply to just three banks, all of which take deposits primarily from large asset managers and other banks, rather than Main Street customers, and are known as custody banks.\n\nThe three custody banks \u2014 Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust \u2014 would, when calculating how much capital to hold on their balance sheets, be able to set aside deposits they received from other banks and immediately gave to the Federal Reserve or another central bank for safekeeping.\n\nJennifer Hendricks Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Bank of New York Mellon, said in an email that the exemption was structured in a way that \u201crecognizes the unique business model of the custody banks.\u201d\n\nCitigroup and JPMorgan argue that the exemption is not fair. They say that since they, too, take deposits from other banks and stash them at the Fed, they should get the same relief \u2014 even though that is not the primary focus of their business. Lobbyists for the two banks are hoping to persuade lawmakers to change the bill to allow all banks that accept custodial deposits to take advantage of the exemption, according to people familiar with the banks\u2019 efforts who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss those efforts.\n\n\u201cAs Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,\u201d a Citigroup spokesman said in an email on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpokesmen from JPMorgan and State Street declined to comment.\n\nWhether the language is broadened or not, the presence of a carve-out has made supporters of the law\u2019s original capital requirement nervous. They say its purpose is to keep banks from convincing regulators that certain products aren\u2019t dangerous when they may ultimately pose a risk.\n\n\u201cThis is not a tweak,\u201d said Sheila C. Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u201cThis could be a very significant weakening of bank capital rules.\u201d\n\nMs. Bair and others who support keeping capital requirements unchanged for big banks point to lessons from the 2008 crisis that demonstrated how financial panics can change the risk profile of certain kinds of assets. For instance, before the crisis, many banks held securities that appeared safe and backed by highly rated mortgages, but they were actually backed by loans whose borrowers were at risk of default. Synthetic bonds and other similar products that received Triple-A ratings before 2008 became nearly worthless when the panic hit, bringing the country\u2019s financial system to the brink of collapse. The role of the leverage ratio enshrined in Dodd-Frank is to ensure that, next time, such miscalculations are impossible.\n\nPhoto\n\nAaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped write Dodd-Frank as chief economist for the Senate Banking Committee, said changes to the leverage ratio could create a \u201cslippery slope\u201d in which banks start arguing for more exemptions, effectively blunting the rule\u2019s power. Banks could start arguing that other kinds of assets, like cash and United States Treasury securities, should not count.\n\n\u201cOnce you start picking one thing or another to remove, where does it end?\u201d Mr. Klein said.\n\nThe prospect of a lobbying fight is spooking smaller banks, which have been waiting years for a legislative vehicle that would relax restrictions on them, including requirements that they undergo regular stress tests. The bill\u2019s success hinges on the support of Democrats who may balk at voting for legislation that is seen as helping the industry\u2019s biggest players.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said in congressional testimony last Tuesday that he favored changing the way the entire leverage ratio is calculated, which would naturally benefit the three custody banks, without making any special exceptions for them.\n\nAn aide to a Democratic senator who supports the legislation insisted that no changes would be made to benefit big banks like Citigroup.

But a disturbing trend has convinced me that we\u2019re protecting very little of real importance with our current approach.\n\nFrom Hawaii to Brazil to Britain, the establishment of large marine protected areas, thousands of square miles in size, is on the rise. These areas are set aside by governments to protect fisheries and ecosystems; human activities within them generally are managed or restricted. While these vast expanses of open ocean are important, their protection should not come before coastal waters are secured. But in some cases, that\u2019s what is happening.\n\nNear-shore waters have a greater diversity of species and face more immediate threats from energy extraction, tourism, development, habitat degradation and overfishing. If we leave these places at risk, we\u2019re not really accomplishing the goal of protecting the seas.\n\nAs the United States undertakes an alarming rollback in environmental protections, other countries are making news by safeguarding remote expanses in efforts to meet or even surpass commitments to the United Nations to protect 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. We should not continue applauding countries that are simply drawing a line around relatively empty waters where protections are neither essential nor most effective to meet a target. Instead we need to do the harder work of safeguarding the most threatened regions of the ocean \u2014 the coastlines \u2014 even if they\u2019re smaller.", "title": "Opinion | Bigger Is Not Better for Ocean Conservation", "authors": []}

The biological clock is a thing! To say that there aren\u2019t periods in my life where I\u2019m governed by my hormones would be a lie and if that makes me \u2018antifeminist\u2019 then I guess I am. Because that\u2019s my experience of my body.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Piper, the play also resonates because it isn\u2019t just about the particular hell of in vitro fertilization. \u201cIt\u2019s also about a relationship burning out, the pressure of the modern world on a relationship,\u201d she said. Currently, Ms. Piper is seeing Johnny Lloyd, the former frontman of Tribes. But when the show opened in 2016, she had just gotten divorced from the actor Laurence Fox, the father of her sons, Winston, 9, and Eugene, 5. Was that something she was drawing on?\n\n\u201cThere will be things that happen in your life that inform the decisions you make as an actor,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething will connect. But once you put an audience in front of it, you hand it over.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, however, Ms. Piper\u2019s private life has often been the story. She grew up in Swindon, in the south of England, and moved to London when she was only 12, to go to stage school. By 15, she was a pop star, and in 1998 became the youngest artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the British charts, with the bratty single \u201cBecause We Want To.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a real musician,\u201d she now concludes, frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard industry, and in the \u201990s, you worked inappropriate hours. I was so young, I just burnt out really quickly.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, the #MeToo campaign has rung bells. \u201cThere were definitely areas I found challenging \u2014 nothing criminal, just an overall energy. We were winning awards for being sexy teenagers. I became quite cynical about it quite quickly.\u201d\n\nHer first marriage, at 18, to the radio D.J. Chris Evans, also made headlines, thanks to a 16-year age gap. But around the time of their separation in 2004, Ms. Piper\u2019s career regenerated: She was cast as the companion Rose in the BBC\u2019s rebooted \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt came out of the blue, that opportunity, and it was an amazing one,\u201d Ms. Piper said. It\u2019s a role she\u2019ll never quite shake. Today, she meets teenagers named after Rose, though unthinkingly adding a rose emoji to an Instagram post recently sent the internet into a tizzy, with fans predicting a \u201cDoctor Who\u201d comeback \u2014 a rumor she\u2019s quick to scotch.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore recently, Ms. Piper has made a reputation for herself as one of Britain\u2019s finest stage actors, in Lucy Prebble\u2019s \u201cThe Effect,\u201d and Richard Bean\u2019s phone hacking scandal satire \u201cGreat Britain.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople look at someone who\u2019s willing to be naked in their soul,\u201d Mr. Stone said of watching her perform. \u201cYerma\u201d is set in a glass box, which helps. \u201cBut I use glass walls a lot, and I\u2019ve never had an actor that was so willing to go so warts and all \u2014 that\u2019s her great beauty.\u201d\n\nMs. Piper is also in David Hare\u2019s crime thriller \u201cCollateral,\u201d now on Netflix. \u201cThat was a great female part, because she\u2019s wild,\u201d Ms. Piper said of her role as a spiky young mother with a drug habit. But she points out that, too often, film and TV roles for women are just boring.\n\nThis frustration led to Ms. Piper\u2019s latest reinvention: as a writer. She\u2019s written her own film, due to shoot this year, as well as having a TV series in the pipeline. Both are dark comedies, both about women in their 30s; both will star Ms. Piper.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe movie, \u201cRare Beasts,\u201d is about \u201cwhat it really feels like to be a modern woman moving through female emancipation, and how that affects our relationships with men,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens if this movement divides men and women?\u201d\n\nThe TV series will center on a woman who\u2019s been hacked and has her private life exposed, but it also looks more broadly at the pressures of being a woman her age. Ms. Piper had noticed friends questioning their lives, asking \u201cwhat have I not achieved and where\u2019s my family and will I ever own a home and what\u2019s my mental health like?\u201d\n\nIt is written with Ms. Prebble, who became a close friend after they met working on the TV series \u201cSecret Diary of a Call Girl\u201d in 2007. \u201cWe\u2019re like sisters,\u201d Ms. Piper said, cracking her wide, irresistible smile.\n\nMs. Prebble was equally effusive. \u201cI love her,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cWhen my life fell apart a couple of years ago she took me into her home. In your 30s as a woman it feels like everything has to break or survive. And the people who are there, the people who show up, are the women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir shared creative preoccupations \u2014 the fragility of relationships, the gap between men and women, the failure of life\u2019s promises as we age \u2014 all chime with those Mr. Stone found within \u201cYerma.\u201d And that may be another reason Ms. Piper is so keen to return to this exceptional role, readily admitting, \u201cI\u2019m still not over it.\u201d", "title": "Billie Piper Hasn\u2019t Looked Back Since She Left the Tardis", "authors": ["Holly Williams"]}

Just like any other child. White children, too, deserve \u2014 and need \u2014 to see black characters that revel in the same human experiences that they do.\n\nReal diversity would celebrate the mundane \u2014 like a little kid going out after a snowstorm \u2014 rather than the exceptional.\n\nOne of my first books, \u201cEarly Sunday Morning,\u201d about a little girl overcoming her jitters as she prepares to sing her first choir solo, was roundly rejected by editors when I pitched it back in 2003.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "The Huggins oeuvre is the essence of the man himself: brief, to the point, technical, adaptable, unfussy and, beneath it all, quite generous.\n\nWhile serving as an undergraduate manager for Fordham\u2019s basketball team, Zak Boisvert discovered Huggins\u2019s literary output. He immediately ordered a four-pack.\n\n\u201cWhen I was first getting into coaching, they were absolute gold,\u201d said Boisvert, who is now an assistant coach at Army.\n\nOne book explained to Boisvert a crucial defensive principle: that if a defense forced the ballhandler to one side of the floor and then rotated to deny passes back to the top of halfcourt, the court essentially shrank, giving the defenders a huge advantage, since they had less open space to cover.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe standard coach\u2019s book is co-written or ghostwritten and covers an abstract and more broadly applicable concept such as leadership. There are Tony Dungy\u2019s \u201cPrinciples, Practices and Priorities of a Winning Life\u201d and Urban Meyer\u2019s \u201cLessons in Leadership and Life From a Championship Program,\u201d for instance.\n\nHuggins has produced his obligatory coaching memoir (1995\u2019s \u201cPressed for Success\u201d), but his other books have titles like \u201cSet Plays to Score,\u201d \u201cPress Breakers\u201d and \u201cMotion Offense: The Principles of the Five-Man Open Post.\u201d\n\nIf other coaches\u2019 books are the equivalent of slick pinstripe suits, Huggins\u2019s are like those plain pullovers he famously wears to games. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, there aren\u2019t any coaches who have produced the same amount of books,\u201d Trevor McLean, a former youth coach in Australia who now runs the Basketball for Coaches website, said in an email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHuggins wrote the books himself, often while flying Comair, a now-defunct Midwest regional airline, to and from games and recruiting visits while at Cincinnati. His style is spare and technical. There are diagrams and occasional flourishes of whimsy that reveal Huggins\u2019s roots in the Ohio River Valley and his identity as a true basketball nerd.\n\nFrom \u201cFast Break\u201d:\n\nEd McClusky (who I feel may be the greatest coach of all time) told me many years ago that every time the ball was passed he was looking for a mismatch or an advantage for the offense.\n\nFrom \u201cCoaching the Matchup Press\u201d:\n\nIf our opponent has a distinct size advantage, we may adjust our press so that once the ball is entering the offensive half-court area of the floor, it is necessary for them to flash their big people up to the top of the circle or high on the wings to relieve the pressure we are applying to the guards. Again, this strategy will make them play to their weakness and away from their strength.\n\nFrom \u201cSpecial Situations\u201d:\n\nIn the last five years at the University of Cincinnati, we have played 88 games decided by 10 points or less. We have averaged six games a year that have come down to a single possession of the basketball! How many of your games next year will be decided by a few possessions? Will you have prepared your team to play with relaxed confidence when those opportunities arise?\n\nTheir overarching philosophy, which can be seen in West Virginia\u2019s aggressive full-court defenses (which have earned the program the nickname Press Virginia) as well as their acuity at offensive rebounding, is deceptively simple: Give your team as many chances to score as possible, and your opponent as few.\n\nHuggins traces most of his basketball philosophy to his father, Charlie, a longtime Ohio high school basketball coach, and his father\u2019s mentor, the aforementioned western Pennsylvania high school coach named Ed McClusky.\n\nHuggins\u2019s father and McClusky both ran what was then a rare form of the motion offense \u2014 in basketball terms a 1-1-3. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they invented it, but they were one of the few doing it,\u201d Huggins said.\n\nAt first, Huggins self-published the books, but soon he connected with Coaches Choice, a house in Monterey, Calif., that specializes in such books. It is run by Jim Peterson, who helped write the former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh\u2019s celebrated book, \u201cFinding the Winning Edge,\u201d a favorite of football coaching geeks.\n\nTechnical football books are more popular than technical basketball ones, Peterson said. \u201cBasketball coaches, they want you to write a book on how to recruit another seven-footer,\u201d he said. Coaches Choice sells a few hundred copies of Huggins\u2019s books every year, primarily through Amazon.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe gets $250, $300 every six months from us, and has for 20 years,\u201d Peterson said. (Huggins\u2019s base salary is $3.75 million, per USA Today\u2019s database.)\n\n\u201cThey sold better at Cincinnati,\u201d Peterson added, \u201cbecause he actually tried to sell them.\u201d\n\nJerry Krause, Gonzaga\u2019s director of men\u2019s basketball operations (and a fellow Coaches Choice author), praised the Huggins collection for its emphasis on motivation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the thing that he is the best at is getting players to play hard and getting them to play hard on defense, and second, getting them to play unselfishly together. It\u2019s laced through his books that if you can get kids to play hard and play together, the X\u2019s and O\u2019s will take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly, Army\u2019s Boisvert said that for all the technical acumen Huggins delivers, the larger theme is adaptability.\n\n\u201cHe has one about the press he ran at Cincinnati,\u201d Boisvert said. \u201cBut the one he does at West Virginia is so different. And that speaks to: The great ones, they change.\u201d\n\nThere is an obvious risk to Huggins\u2019s writing down all his basketball thoughts: giving the opposition your game plan. There is a famous scene in one of Huggins\u2019s favorite movies, \u201cPatton,\u201d in which Gen. George S. Patton Jr. sniffs out his foe Erwin Rommel\u2019s battle plan by poring over one of his books. \u201cRommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\u201d Patton declaims as his tanks decimate the German army. Huggins said he rewatches \u201cPatton\u201d about once every three months.\n\nHuggins\u2019s father used to fear demonstrating his plays in front of coaches whom he would later play, Huggins said.\n\n\u201cThat was a different era,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cIn my era, we were on television more than Homer Simpson. People saw it. It wasn\u2019t some secret.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPatton\u201d scene that sticks with him, he added, is when Patton, who believed people came back to life in new bodies, visits the site of an ancient battle and tells an aide that he was there.\n\n\u201cI like when he talks about reincarnation,\u201d Huggins said. \u201cHow he\u2019s seen the battle before.\u201d", "title": "Bob Huggins Is March\u2019s Author-in-Residence", "authors": ["Marc Tracy"]}

Ms. Brown told Ms. Scialfa\u2019s husband, Bruce Springsteen, that the first time she came to New Jersey she slept in the Livingston Mall to get tickets to see him, and sat in the last row.\n\n\u201cAnd here I was in his S.U.V. driving to New York for the 12/12 concert,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m with Patti and Bruce and their daughter who is a doll, and the phone rings and I hear Bruce on the phone saying, \u2018Bobby, no, oh Bobby that\u2019s too bad.

Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.\n\nThe Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.\n\nThe reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe company also suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.\n\nBut it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL\u2019s elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.\n\nThe profiles would be used to \u201cidentify the personality traits of individuals\u201d in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. \u201cIndividuals can be targeted with the right message,\u201d it said.\n\nThe agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton\u2019s campaign to direct people \u201ctoward the FB app.\u201d Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network\u2019s profiles. The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research, and users were not aware of its true purpose.\n\nMonths later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about how much you spend. It\u2019s also about how smart you spend,\u201d the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.\n\n\u201cOne way we\u2019re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm\u201d \u2014 Cambridge Analytica \u2014 \u201cto provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile.

His attitudes kept him from the position of secretary of state under Mr. Bush when it was made clear to the president that he could not be confirmed.\n\nNow, in his emeritus years, Mr. Bolton has been given one last chance to pursue his extreme ideology, but this time with proximity to the one person who could make it reality.

He had both a rigorous science background and 20 years of home-brewing experience, including experimentation with soy sauce, which is also made with a type of koji.\n\nMr. Doughan moved to Brooklyn in 2016, and last September they started outfitting their soaring space in the Industry City warehouse complex in Sunset Park. (Kura refers to a warehouse where products like sake are traditionally made.) Their fellow tenants now share the roasted-chestnut-and-mushroom perfume of Aspergillus oryzae, or koji, growing on steamed, polished rice.\n\nThough it has the alcohol content of wine, sake is brewed more like a beer: Rice implanted with koji mold is slowly mixed with yeast, water and more steamed rice, then fermented for several weeks. It\u2019s usually pressed to remove most but not all of the solids, after which it can be aged or filtered further.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe heart of the monthlong process is culturing the koji, Mr. Doughan said. It\u2019s a multiday, labor-intensive undertaking that begins when he shakes flakes of mold over mini-mountains of washed and steamed rice grown specifically for sake-making.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Doughan and Mr. Polen plan to start with more traditional sake styles \u2014 still new to most Americans \u2014 using their taproom to highlight how they\u2019re made. There, they serve shiboritate, or freshly pressed sake, and orizake, a pre-pressed sake still cloudy and creamy with microscopic particles of rice. They even let customers buy a clay mug of moromi, a thick, tart drink with still-discernible grains straight from the fermenting tank. (Mr. Doughan eventually plans to also make more experimental styles, he said, citing the dry-hopped sake made by Setting Sun Sake Brewing Co. in San Diego.)\n\nJohn Gauntner, the Tokyo sake educator who is considered one of the foremost English-language experts on the drink, appreciates their initial focus on the basics. Brooklyn Kura\u2019s sake was \u201cvery, very good,\u201d he wrote in an email, but he was \u201cmost impressed that the brewer there wants to get his process down first, reproducibility, and then work on tweaking it to make it better.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThough Mr. Polen attended Mr. Gauntner\u2019s sommelier seminars, Mr. Doughan is mainly self-taught, with previously unavailable help from YouTube videos and WhatsApp discussions with Japanese brewers.

A company called SakeBrooklyn is working to find a space by the beginning of next year, and the Japanese producer Asahi Shuzo will soon break ground on a large-scale brewery in Hyde Park, N.Y. near the Culinary Institute of America, which will work with them to develop a sake education program.\n\nIt\u2019s all evidence of the drink\u2019s growing presence in the United States, said Timothy Sullivan, a sake educator and a founder of the new American Sake Association.

Eventually, years later, they come to a halt in New York.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s here, when Bibi is in her early 20s, that her father dies, leaving her \u201camong the loneliest of this pitiful world.\u201d As she watches the light fall in stripes on her father\u2019s coffin, she decides that she will take on a new identity: She will now be known as Zebra, a name that \u201crepresents ink on paper,\u201d making her \u201ca martyr of thought.\u201d Thus armed, she will embark on yet another journey, returning to the places she once visited as a refugee \u2014 inspired not by a need for self-discovery but by a thirst for vengeance. Outraged when confronted with the misfortunes of exiles and the complacency of nonexiles, she believes she has a duty to \u201cmirror back to this miserly universe its own terrible distortions.\u201d This is Zebra\u2019s quest: \u201cI, a modern literary inventor, was going to walk the void of my multiple exiles causing trouble, discombobulating the world.\u201d Her map will be literature, \u201cthe only true form of cartography in the world,\u201d and she will begin her mission in Catalonia.\n\nIn this ferociously intelligent novel, Van der Vliet Oloomi \u2014 who came to the United States from Iran with her family when she was a child \u2014 gradually brings her orphaned heroine to the realization that literature (Zebra calls it the \u201ccorpse of my past\u201d) may not be enough to sustain her. So when a \u201csurprisingly good-looking\u201d Italian philologist named Ludovico Bembo (Ludo, for short) meets her at the Barcelona airport, he shoulders her suitcase full of books and shakes her determination to exist via thought and abstraction, to paraphrase (as Zebra does) the French philosopher and literary theorist Maurice Blanchot. Sex with Ludo she welcomes without hesitation, seeing it as a way to \u201cannihilate each other through hot passion,\u201d but she recoils from any emotional connection. She\u2019s \u201cantilove,\u201d she tells him, and if pushed will \u201cretreat into the Matrix of Literature.\u201d Yet as she stubbornly pursues her literary \u201cGrand Tour of Exile,\u201d she finds it increasingly difficult to conduct her expedition solo.\n\nWith intricacy and humor, Van der Vliet Oloomi relays Zebra\u2019s brainy, benighted struggles as a tragicomic picaresque whose fervid logic and cerebral whimsy recall the work of Bola\u00f1o and Borges. In her first novel, \u201cFra Keeler,\u201d a psychological thriller about a man who buys a house and is obsessed with the circumstances of the previous owner\u2019s death, she showed similar acuity and dark wit; here, however, she immeasurably expands her terrain. Literature, as Zebra\u2019s father has observed, is \u201ca nation without boundaries\u201d and for this high-minded heroine, \u201clandscape and literature are entwined like the helix of DNA.\u201d But the pilgrimage she undertakes in \u201cCall Me Zebra\u201d teaches her to raise her eyes and register the reality of the people who exist in her present, not just those who survive in the pages of her past.", "title": "Brainy and Benighted, Lost in the Books of Bola\u00f1o and Borges", "authors": ["Liesl Schillinger", "Azareen Van Der Vliet Oloomi"]}
{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "While other young brands may draw their inspiration from city streets or club scenes, Ernest W. Baker, a new men\u2019s wear label, takes its name \u2014 and some aesthetic guidance \u2014 from an unlikely place: the designer Reid Baker\u2019s 91-year-old grandfather. A former Detroit ad man, Ernest W. Baker is the brand\u2019s muse \u2014 and Reid and his co-designer, Ines Amorim, create clever riffs on the kind of classic American suiting found in his wardrobe. Recently, they even studied his journals from the \u201970s and \u201980s, for inspiration.\n\nFounded in 2016, the brand is an amalgamation of western American influences and Old-World European style, drawn from the founders\u2019 heritage: Baker grew up in Utah and Amorim in a small town outside of Porto, Portugal. The result is off-kilter tailoring that feels simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary. The designers reinterpret traditional men\u2019s wear fabrics \u2014 tweed, velvet and cotton shirting \u2014 with surprising, often cropped, silhouettes.\n\nThe designers begin each collection with a cast of characters inspired by their cinematic interests. These are especially visible in the brand\u2019s fall/winter 2018 offering, which recently won the brand a place on the shortlist for the LVMH Prize. The pieces include a sharply cut brown leather trench coat, chunky mustard-yellow knitwear and a purple velvet suit with kick-flare pants. \u201cThe overall design is simple,\u201d says Amorim, \u201cbut we want the looks to be memorable. We think of small details from the \u201870s and \u201880s and put them into the pieces, to give them an old feel.\u201d\n\nImage Ines Amorim and Reid Baker. Credit Courtesy of Ernest W. Baker\n\n\u201cWe kind of let our inspirations come naturally,\u201d adds Baker. This most recent collection, for example, started with the designers\u2019 immersion in the world of David Lynch. \u201cWe watched \u2018Blue Velvet\u2019 and then the whole \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 series, which brought in that Western element.\u201d", "title": "Brand to Know: A Men\u2019s Wear Line With a Nostalgic Bent", "authors": []}

For example: A moss-green mohair peacoat, from the fall/winter 2018 collection, looks classic apart from its sculptural toggles. The biomorphic shape of the fastenings was inspired by the English sculptor Barbara Hepworth \u2014 a tribute to the designers\u2019 mother, who is, as Hepworth\u2019s was, a math teacher.\n\nThe brand also showed a navy blue sleeveless jacket made from fireproof fabric. The Lurrs, who founded the label in 2017, are inspired by their dual Swedish-Kurdish nationality, and the flame-retardant garment was a statement about the indestructibility of identity. \u201cAs a teenager growing up in Sweden, you just want to be like your friends \u2014 but you never lose being a Kurd,\u201d says Dilan, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThe fact that the mechanism has no ideology is fundamental,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cMy thesis is that the mechanism operates in all elections at all levels of government in Brazil, everywhere. Companies that are big clients of the government, usually construction companies but also big commercial banks, finance them all, either legally or through secret slush funds.\u201d\n\nIn return, whoever is in power \u201chires those companies to perform services, and the companies inflate the contracts heavily, with kickbacks either to individual politicians or their parties.\u201d\n\nVirtually all of the 20-odd parties with seats in the Brazilian Congress have been stained by the scandal, soon to begin its fifth year. One president has been impeached; her predecessor has been convicted of corruption and money laundering; and her successor is being investigated by the real-life equivalents of the prosecutors and police officers that Mr. Padilha portrays.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBrazil is very interesting as a case study, in the sense that the corruption is not in the politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe corruption is the politics.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe creators and cast of \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d went into the series knowing that they were taking on a weighty and controversial topic. Supporters of the nominally left-wing Workers Party, which was in power from 2003 to 2016 and was the main focus of early phases of the investigations, vociferously maintain that their leader, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (and the one convicted of corruption and money laundering), is the object of a witch hunt. Some even allege that the judge overseeing the Car Wash investigations is a C.I.A. plant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from the generation born during the dictatorship, when all of civil society was united in opposition to the military, so I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this,\u201d said Elena Soarez, who wrote the script of \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d with Mr. Padilha. \u201cThe country has been riven, with families divided and lifelong friends quarreling, and that makes this a special challenge to write.\u201d\n\nRather than focus on politicians and business magnates, the series revolves around three fictionalized characters: a well-connected and morally warped money launderer and two tenacious police investigators, an older man and a younger woman. Though the intricacies of the Brazilian legal and political system may not be familiar to foreign viewers, the series\u2019 political thriller format \u2014 cast and creators referenced works like \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 certainly will be, as will be the idiosyncrasies of the main characters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed watching noir detectives, and now I finally get to play one, a guy who is fighting against his external and internal demons,\u201d said Selton Mello, cast as the investigator Marco Ruffo. \u201cRuffo is an obsessive in a search for justice, an almost solitary figure amid the machinery of corruption, a kind of Quixote with a lot of personal dramas.\u201d\n\nThroughout his international career, which began in 2002 with \u201cBus 174,\u201d a documentary which used a bus hijacking to examine how Brazil\u2019s criminal justice system treats the poor, Mr. Padilha has focused on the related issues of crime, justice and violence. scrutinizing both those who mete it out and those who are on the receiving end. Regardless of where, what language or in what medium he has worked, whether in a pair of \u201cElite Squad\u201d movies about SWAT-like teams in Rio, his 2014 remake of \u201cRoboCop,\u201d or in \u201cNarcos,\u201d the police have always been central to the stories he tells.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFor the state to sustain itself, there must be some repressive force that it manages and controls,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the police are not a detail, they are an essential feature of any complex society. They offer a glimpse into all kinds of social systems, because they are very, very much on the edge, the fringe of society, where institutions meet.\u201d\n\nIn \u201c7 Days in Entebbe,\u201d a new feature film that opened March 16, Mr. Padilha offers a variation on some themes he first raised in \u201cBus 174,\u201d this time with a hijacked airplane instead of a bus. In the new film he shows not only the workings of the Israeli army and political establishment, but also the motivations of the terrorists who in 1976 seized an Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris with 248 passengers aboard, nearly half of them Israelis or Jews of other nationalities, and had it flown to Idi Amin\u2019s Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Entebbe crisis ended violently, with soldiers of the Israel Defense Force storming an airport terminal and rescuing more than 100 of the hostages: All of the German and Palestinian terrorists were killed, as well as the leader of the Israeli commandos (the older brother of Israel\u2019s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu), four of the hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers. Though the Entebbe raid is often described as one of the most spectacular military missions of modern times, Mr. Padilha sees it as an ultimately Pyrrhic victory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the operation succeeded,\u201d he said, \u201cit played into the hands of people who thought that everything can be solved by violence,\u201d which in turn contributed to the persistence of conflict in the Middle East.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe Mechanism\u201d tells a much less familiar story, but Mr. Padilha and his collaborators are convinced that the series, which contains an optional voice-over in English and minimal violence, will travel well. As if to prove his point, during an interview in the lounge of a New York hotel last month, an American guest who had been eavesdropping and was fascinated by what she was hearing interrupted the conversation to ask Mr. Padilha the name of his series and when she would be able to watch it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d she told him.\n\n\u201cCorruption is a universal theme, and that is going to generate empathy everywhere,\u201d said Caroline Abras, who plays the police investigator Verena Cardoni. \u201cPeople the world over, in all of the countries this is going to be seen, will understand what is going on.\u201d\n\nOf course, since Mr. Padilha wrapped the first eight episodes of \u201cThe Mechanism,\u201d the Car Wash scandal has taken even more unexpected turns, which he recognizes would be ideal fodder for future seasons. The generalized disgust with the political class, for instance, already seems to be having an effect on a presidential election scheduled for October. Possible candidates include a former army parachutist famous for his stridently alt-right views and the host of a weekend TV variety show who has never held public office but has 13 million Twitter followers.\n\n\u201cNobody knows how this is going to turn out,\u201d Mr. Padilha said. \u201cBrazil is at a crossroads, and everything is up for grabs. It\u2019s a crazy situation, but it\u2019s my role as a political filmmaker to tackle these issues.\u201d", "title": "Brazil\u2019s Jaw-Dropping Corruption Scandal Comes to Netflix", "authors": ["Larry Rohter"]}

You\u2019d need to get the zoning designation changed.\n\nNew York adopted the nation\u2019s first citywide zoning laws in 1916. In 1975, voters approved a new City Charter that gave neighborhoods a stronger voice in determining land use. It was a rebuke to the actions of the urban planning czar Robert Moses, whose aggressive (and largely unchecked) decades-long building spree destroyed the character of dozens of neighborhoods \u2014 if not the neighborhoods themselves.\n\nThese new provisions stipulated that any change in zoning would require public hearings and several levels of nonbinding review. This procedure is called the uniform land use review process, or Ulurp (pronounced \u201cYOU-lurp\u201d).\n\nA typical Ulurp review takes six to eight months. First, the local community board, the borough president and the city planning commission weigh in on the proposal.\n\nAll of these entities\u2019 recommendations, however, are advisory. It is the City Council that holds the power to approve or reject the Ulurp request. What\u2019s more, council members tend to defer to their colleague who represents the area affected.\n\nBecause zoning changes are often contentious, officials now usually work with the community and interested parties to agree on a deal before Ulurp begins. In November, the City Council approved a sweeping rezoning to East Harlem, nearly two years after community discussions began; and the process is playing out right now near the Gowanus Canal for the second time in 10 years.", "title": "Breaking Down the City\u2019s Rezoning Process", "authors": ["Keith Williams"]}

Nine works created in Berlin will form the basis of the tour, with newly commissioned ones added at subsequent stops, until the presentation includes more than 20. It will return to Berlin in September 2019.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the beginning of the wave, not even the crest yet, of what\u2019s coming,\u201d Mr. Meehan said in a telephone interview. In addition to virtual reality and augmented reality, what is now emerging is \u201cspatial technology where everyone is experiencing something together,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview in Amsterdam, Mr. Eno said that he saw \u201cBloom: Open Space,\u201d which had a limited five-day run here last month, as \u201cthe beginning of an experiment\u201d with these new technologies. It is based on \u201cBloom,\u201d a 2008 smartphone app Mr. Eno created with Mr. Chilvers, which also generates bubbles and tones when the phone\u2019s screen is pressed.

One piece, \u201cKazakhstan,\u201d for example, was written to accompany the artist Asif Khan\u2019s 360-degree movie, \u201cWe Are Energy,\u201d in the British Pavilion at the World Expo in Kazakhstan.\n\nLike Mr. Barri, Mr. Eno says he feels that musicians are only beginning to explore the potential of immersive tools.\n\n\u201cPhilosophically, in terms of our understanding of what it is, we\u2019re right at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also technically, it is difficult. There\u2019s a slightly awkward imbalance between the complexity of the system and the simplicity of the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will change, of course,\u201d he added. \u201cThe technology will become more and more transparent, and using it will become less difficult.

Critics say the British authorities took only modest countermeasures after Russian agents poisoned a former MI6 informant in 2006 with the rare isotope polonium 210.\n\nThe prime minister, who as home secretary resisted an open inquiry into Russia\u2019s role in that case, is under pressure to show more resolve this time. The March 4 nerve agent attack on Sergei V. Skripal, once an informant for Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service, and his daughter, Yulia, exposed untold numbers of bystanders to risk around public spaces in the city of Salisbury. Traces of the poison have been found at a pub and a pizza parlor visited by the Skripals.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that Mr. Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia,\u201d Mrs. May said in the House of Commons. \u201cThe government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal.\u201d", "title": "Britain Blames Moscow for Poisoning of Former Russian Spy", "authors": []}

While there is significant overseas demand for the notes, the perception in Britain is that the \u00a350 is used mostly for money laundering, tax evasion and in illicit transactions. Some shops, fearing a costly mistake with a counterfeit, refuse to accept them.\n\nThe contretemps occurred as Britain is increasingly moving away from cash and becoming reliant on credit and debit cards and digital payments. Card transactions accounted for more than half of retail purchases for the first time in 2016, according to the British Retail Consortium, and the Treasury predicted cash would be used for only 21 percent of payments by 2026.\n\nAdvocates for keeping the \u00a350 were few and far between, but champions of the copper-colored coins were fiercely vocal as soon as the idea of abandoning them was announced. Charities raised concerns about losing pennies, which are almost exactly the size of the American cent, because they rely on them for donations, often collected at shops or on the street.\n\n\u201cCertainly cash is still a very significant form of fund-raising for charities.

Lavrov of Russia to visit had been withdrawn.\n\nShe added that no British ministers or royals would attend the World Cup in Russia this summer, that Britain would \u201cincrease checks on private flights, customs and freight,\u201d and that it would \u201cfreeze Russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of U.K. nationals or residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance,\u201d Mrs. May said of Russia. \u201cTheir response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events.

Mrs. May identified the chemical as a Novichok, a class of extremely deadly nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Britain was sending samples of the toxin to the chemical weapons organization for verification, the British prime minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe country has tried to marshal support from international organizations, an effort potentially complicated by Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, disputes within NATO, and the reluctance of President Trump to denounce Mr. Putin. Despite those tensions, several of Britain\u2019s European allies have been quick to express solidarity over the attack on the Skripals, who remain hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nDonald Tusk, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that he stood with Mrs. May on what he called a \u201cbrutal attack inspired, most likely, by Moscow,\u201d and said he was prepared to put the matter on the agenda for the council\u2019s meeting next week.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Britain called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the attack, and delivered a statement to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, decrying Russian aggression in Ukraine and Georgia, the country\u2019s involvement in the Syrian civil war, and civil rights abuses within Russia, as well as the nerve agent attack.\n\nMr. Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, was imprisoned in 2006 for selling secrets to the British. In 2010, he was sent to Britain as part of a spy swap. He and his daughter were found unresponsive on a park bench in the cathedral city of Salisbury on March 4.\n\nThe use of an exotic poison in an attempt on his life has echoes of the assassination in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent and vocal critic of Mr. Putin, who was poisoned in London with a radioactive isotope. A British investigation concluded that the killing was not only carried out by Russian agents, but was probably approved by Mr. Putin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Berezovsky\u2019s death in England in 2013, an apparent suicide by hanging, is one of those that critics have insisted should be investigated further.\n\nThe police said that they had no reason to believe the death of Mr. Glushkov was suspicious, but that they were being especially cautious in light of recent events.", "title": "Britain Expels 23 Russian Diplomats Over Ex-Spy\u2019s Poisoning", "authors": ["Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a"]}

Just six weeks ago, Britain rolled out a new campaign to stem the flow of dirty money into its real estate sector, presenting an unnamed political figure, reportedly from Central Asia, with the first-ever \u201cunexplained wealth order.\u201d The order requires the target to present a court with evidence that the property was purchased with legal funds. If that fails, the state can seize the asset.\n\nUnexplained wealth orders could most easily be used against government officials, whose incomes are clearly insufficient for them to purchase billion-pound London properties, said Ben Cowdock, a researcher at Transparency International. The orders would be difficult to use against wealthy businessmen with multiple income streams, he said.\n\nMrs. May also promised on Wednesday to introduce legislation similar to the Magnitsky Act in the United States. That act allows American officials to deny visas to Russians implicated in human rights violations and freeze their assets. In 2012, when Congress passed its legislation, the British government chose not to follow suit, arguing that it had sufficient sanction powers.\n\nMrs. May said she was also ready to freeze Russian state-owned property that had been used in attacks on British soil, a category potentially broad enough to include Aeroflot planes that carried assailants to Britain, Mr. Bond said.\n\n\u201cIt is intended to say, \u2018We will go after anything that isn\u2019t nailed down,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOne concern for Britain is whether the measures would jeopardize British business interests in Russia \u2014 in particular, its flagship oil producer, BP, which owns a 20 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil and gas giant.\n\nAnti-Putin activists and investigative journalists here have long urged a crackdown on oligarchs\u2019 lavish holdings, whose ownership is often concealed by layers of offshore transactions.

Ames, a career C.I.A. officer who turned out to be a double agent, United States officials expelled a senior Russian diplomat, Aleksandr Lyskenko, whom they called a top officer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. According to the State Department, Mr. Lyskenko was \u201cin a position to be responsible\u201d for Mr. Ames\u2019s activities as a very productive mole.\n\nAlthough Mr. Ames\u2019s treachery was almost certainly the most damaging breach of American intelligence since World War II \u2014 Moscow executed several operatives whom he had betrayed \u2014 Washington\u2019s response was considerably less severe than it would have been in Soviet times. In the years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Clinton administration, eager to encourage friendly relations and reform, supported the new government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. Before Mr. Lyskenko was told to leave the country, in February 1994, the Americans even gave the Russians the option of voluntarily sending him back home.\n\n1986: A Mass Expulsion\n\nFifty-five Soviet diplomats were expelled by President Ronald Reagan in November 1986 in an effort to curb espionage activities. Similarly, the authorities in Moscow ordered 260 Soviet employees of the United States Embassy in Moscow to stop working.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was the largest number of diplomatic officials to be expelled by the United States at once.

That same day, a department official wrote back, saying that the city had not sanctioned the mural (\u201cThis graffiti should NOT have been on the handball wall\u201d) and admitting she had no idea who painted it.\n\nTaking this as tacit permission, H&M shot footage of a model in its new line of apparel using the graffiti as a backdrop.

The house was in a safe neighborhood, roomy with a swing set in the backyard. Before the storm, she was even planning an addition. Other days, she knew moving was her only choice. Both options were expensive. Selling meant taking a big hit: She paid $183,000 for the house six years ago and figured it was not worth much more than half of that now. But for as long as they lived in their temporary apartment, she was paying rent and a mortgage. FEMA gave her about $16,000, but the renovation bids were all around $70,000.\n\nBy the time the four-bedroom house passed a mold test in February, Ms. Micu was thinking that she might split the difference.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "This is the essence of p\u00e9tillant naturel, though it is now done with intention, often with the help of modern refrigeration equipment, and without shattered glass.\n\nUp until about 15 years ago, this sort of sparkling wine was pretty rare, the method having largely given way to two more modern techniques. One, the method used for Champagne and many other top sparkling wines, requires a finished still wine to be bottled with a little yeast and sweetness. Within the sealed container, a second fermentation begins, which creates the sparkle. This method can yield wines of gorgeous complexity, refinement and finesse.\n\nThe second, the Charmat method, is a technique for making inexpensive sparklers in quantity by doing a second fermentation in pressurized tanks. Of course, the cheapest way to make sparkling wine is to simply pump still wine full of carbon dioxide as you would Coca-Cola. These are more carbonated alcohol delivery beverages than they are wine.\n\nThe modern renaissance of p\u00e9tillant naturel traces back to the early days of natural wines, a genre of minimalist grape-growing and winemaking that over the last 15 years has grown from a small, scattered collection of producers to a niche that has become increasingly popular and influential, though endlessly contentious.\n\nThe Loire Valley, a center for natural wine, was also home to many early p\u00e9tillant naturel revivalists. It was hardly intended to be a movement. Rather, it was a delicious beverage for enjoyment with friends.\n\nBut what is delicious has a way of catching on. This informal, unpretentious sparkling wine, which can be made from an untold number of grapes in styles ranging from hazy, unfiltered and full of sediment to clean-as-a-whistle, has caught on all over the winemaking world.\n\nYet it\u2019s not quite \u201cthe new ros\u00e9.\u201d It\u2019s not being made in industrial quantities, nor has it achieved brand-name status in supermarket aisles. It has ridden the wave of interest in natural wines, which will never be a mass-market phenomenon, no matter how important they are to discerning consumers nor how influential they have been to the wine industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNoting the widening availability of p\u00e9tillant naturel, the wine panel recently tasted through 20 bottles from seven countries, just a cross-section of what is available in retail markets. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Kimberly Prokoshyn, the head sommelier at Scampi, a new restaurant near Union Square, and Caleb Ganzer, managing partner and wine director at Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Lower Manhattan.\n\nWhat was most obvious in our tasting was the high level of quality. This was surprising, not because I associate natural wines with inconsistency but because every type of wine has its share of lemons.\n\nThe flaws in some natural wines glare more because they are not typical in the modern age, when technology and artifice can eliminate issues like excessive volatile acidity or barnyard aromas that come from unwanted yeast strains. But to me, the tedious insipidity of many processed wines is just as much a flaw.\n\nYet these p\u00e9tillants, an almost completely random category where anything goes, showed very few flaws. They were not only easy, approachable and refreshing, the best had resonance, depth and length. And they were diverse.\n\nSome were simply straightforward easy drinking, but others were nuanced and complex, a description rarely associated with p\u00e9tillant naturel. Some seemed raw, as if the producer had captured in the bottle the transformation of juice into wine. Others had a yeasty, bready weight that is seen more often in Champagne.\n\n\u201cThey are not just a gimmick,\u201d Florence said. Kimberly said she was struck by the texture, rawness and pleasing eccentricity of the wines.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had such a preconceived notion of p\u00e9tillant naturel as an easy sparkling wine,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was great diversity.\u201d\n\nCaleb called them \u201csessionable,\u201d a beer-culture term connoting beverages low enough in alcohol and intensity to permit them to be consumed in quantity while maintaining coherence. Indeed, as near as we could tell after the tasting, only one of the 20 bottles touched 13 percent alcohol \u2014 moderate in today\u2019s world \u2014 and many were under 12 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur favorite was from California, the 2016 Cobolorum from J. Brix, made entirely from riesling grown in Santa Barbara County. It was full of flavor and absolutely delicious.\n\nLike some of the more hands-off p\u00e9t-nats, this was cloudy, almost hazy. As with any p\u00e9tillant naturel, or Champagne-style sparkler, after the yeasts are finished with their fermenting duties, they die, leaving sediment in the bottle.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn Champagne, and in some p\u00e9t-nats, the sediment is disgorged, a process of maneuvering the sediment to the neck of the bottle and then ejecting it. But some of the more natural p\u00e9t-nats avoid this step, which can leave a hazy appearance. There is no harm in this; the dead yeast, or lees, can improve the flavor and texture and also can act as an antioxidant. But you might want to keep the bottle standing up so the sediment settles.\n\nOur No. 2 bottle, the lively, deep and resonant 2015 Rurale from Melsheimer in the Mosel region of Germany, was also largely riesling, 80 percent, with the remainder johanniter, a grape I had not knowingly encountered before. No. 3 was the savory, refreshing and bone dry 2014 from Laurent Barth in Alsace, made of a combination of auxerrois and pinot noir.\n\nP\u00e9tillant naturel can sometimes be a bit sweet if the fermentation ends before all the sugar in the wine is consumed. Almost all the wines in our tasting were dry, but our No. 4 bottle, the 2016 Pi\u00e8ge \u00e0 Filles ros\u00e9 from Les Capriades in the Touraine region of the Loire Valley, was not. This wine, made mostly of gamay, was sweet yet juicy and refreshing because it was so well balanced.\n\nThe range and textures of these wines were fascinating. The 2016 Pet Sounds from Jess Miller in the Eola-Amity Hills of the Willamette Valley, made entirely of pinot noir, was creamy and rich, much weightier than some of the others, yet spicy and savory.

Many were clearly aperitif wines, though a few could accompany a meal. I felt that a dish featuring cheese would suit either option. And because a scintilla of sweetness lingered on the palate with some of them, I selected Roquefort for top billing. The pungent, salty cheese is often served with sweet wines. I tamed it with some cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and spread it on pastry in a riff on the Alsatian tarte flamb\u00e9e. I included bacon but swapped in leeks for onions and added walnuts, often a partner for Roquefort. Though tarte flamb\u00e9e is frequently made with pizza dough, I used a quick pie pastry instead.

It funds virtually all of the nation\u2019s subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net \u2014 especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe program has been increasingly important in the aftermath of the Great Recession. As home building declined sharply and millennials entered the work force, the number of renters surged by about one million a year \u2014 the largest increase since the baby-boom generation came of age in the 1970s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.\n\nRents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe program works like this: The federal government allocates tax credits that are eventually awarded to affordable-housing developers. The credits are then transferred to corporations \u2014 usually banks \u2014 in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.\n\nThe tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco, the tax law will reduce the growth of subsidized affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next decade, compounding an existing shortage.\n\nMs. Cantwell\u2019s provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.\n\nStill, even if the increase in tax credits was made permanent, only about 30 percent of the decline in affordable housing due to last year\u2019s tax cuts would be restored, according to Novogradac\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, the firm\u2019s managing partner. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a large shortage of units that aren\u2019t going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.\u201d", "title": "Budget Deal in Congress Includes Help for Affordable Housing", "authors": ["Conor Dougherty"]}

He kicked his drug habit while immersing himself again in classical music.\n\nLater he became a member of the Houston Symphony and received a series of performance grants. He played on the debuts of new works by Cage, Stravinsky and other prominent composers and eventually landed a spot in the prestigious Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 1971, he moved to California, lured by the thriving studio work there. He was hired by the California Institute of the Arts and became the principal bassist for the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. He spent almost 30 years as the principal bassist in the Warner Bros. Studio Orchestra, and recorded with pop stars like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton and the Eagles.\n\nAs with so many virtuoso musicians a level below stardom, much of his work was unattributed. Mr. Neidlinger liked to tell the story about the night when he was awakened after midnight by an assistant to Ms. Streisand. He went to the studio, he said, and helped her finish writing the song \u201cEvergreen,\u201d which became the theme song of her 1976 movie \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and a hit as a commercial release.\n\n\u201cShe never gave me any publishing on it,\u201d he said, referring to a credit that would allow him to collect royalties. \u201cIf she had, I\u2019d be living in Monaco or something.\u201d\n\nBut to some degree Mr. Neidlinger took business into his own hands; in 1979 he started a small record label, K2B2, with the saxophonist Marty Krystall.

{"date": "2018-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "It decided the answer lay in the Old Curiosity Shop. Back in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Rome, Mr. Bulgari had picked the name of Charles Dickens\u2019s novel in hopes of attracting well-heeled British and American tourists in the Eternal City. \u201cSotirio Bulgari didn\u2019t want to only attract Italians,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cHe already knew then that he wanted Bulgari to be international.\u201d\n\nBut rather than a Victorian cabinet of curiosities, his was a paean to objects collected on his travels: jewelry, of course, but also silver buttons, glass perfume bottles and objects etched with the Islamic and Byzantine motifs that then were all the rage. The Old Curiosity Shop was a temple for the inquisitive, imaginative and well-traveled \u2014 and a profile that, more than a century later and some 300 boutiques on, was not far from the Bulgari customer of today.\n\nSo the New Curiosity Shop was born, playing on Mr. Bulgari\u2019s founding ideas of discovery and inspiration, most notably by changing the shop\u2019s theme, d\u00e9cor and products every six months. \u201cBulgari has over 130 years of history, and with each change, we can reveal a piece of this history in a younger, modern way,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s about curiosity \u2014 and curiosity is never static.\u201d\n\nVisitors to the shop first encounter a stylish mirrored gold bar, its surface doubling as a touch-screen interface to information about the Bulgari brand. During a visit in February, customers were seated around it, casually trying on jewelry, watches and handbags they had taken from the displays and glass drawers. (There are shop assistants but they don\u2019t seem to spend a lot of time guarding product-filled vitrines, like the salespeople of yesterday.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn one drawer was an archive picture of Mr. Bulgari; in another, a piece from Bulgari\u2019s heritage collection: a round gold cigarette lighter from the \u203280s.\n\nHanging above was an impressive, custom-made chandelier by the Murano glassmakers Venini \u2014 which took eight people to install \u2014 and hip dance music played.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBehind the bar was a room Ms. Schwarzer called \u201cItalian hospitality,\u201d where \u203240s-era Guglielmo Ulrich tables and chairs, upholstered in funky contemporary fabrics, offered a place to have a drink while browsing Bulgari books, or signature collections like B.zero1 rings or ceramic Serpenti watches.\n\nThe third, and final, room was dedicated to personalization \u2014 that millennial power word \u2014 where visitors can order customized Bulgari handbags. The choice of leathers, clasps and straps are stored in a wall of brass-fronted cabinets that, again, are open to all.\n\nIt was exciting to think that in six months, the entire shop will look entirely different.\n\nThe debut theme was Mirabilia, Latin for marvels, interpreted by Bulgari in futuristic, outer-space decorations. Nestled among the products were handmade paper artworks of planets and astronauts, which Bulgari commissioned from the young Italian artist Mauro Seresini. And there was an installation of furniture and the whimsical black-and-white portrait plates by Maison Fornasetti.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo increase the sense of exclusivity, Bulgari also will be creating one-off collections for each theme.\n\nMirabilia\u2019s selection included a necklace and ring set of diamonds, blue topaz and tanzanite in its Divas\u2019 Dream style, which was displayed alongside the handwritten label: \u201cOnly in R*me Exclusivity.\u201d\n\nAlso sold only in the shop: a special Condotti10 jewelry line featuring a pink-gold bracelet and matching ring with interior design elements from both the flagship and New Curiosity Shop: graphic circles, stars and squares set in diamond pav\u00e9, malachite and mother-of-pearl.

The chances of vets making the basketball team are slim. So, come curl. If we can tell them, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a trip to the U.S. Open in New York that could be fully funded for you because you\u2019re a veteran, come on up and play and learn the sport,\u2019 they\u2019ll be hooked.\u201d\n\nRick Adams, the United States Olympic Committee\u2019s chief of Paralympics, agreed that infrastructure and support for veterans across the nascent stages of an athlete\u2019s development were beneficial, but he hesitated to say that could be parlayed into an increased presence on the American team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility, but most of the time what you find is that they may not have been in a sport for a long time,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a balance between someone who\u2019s been participating for a long period of time and someone who\u2019s been in the military for a long time and then they\u2019re in a situation where they\u2019re Paralympic-eligible and take up a sport.

It is unlikely that the wheelchair curlers, who have yet to medal since the sport was added in 2006 and finished in last place here out of 12 nations, will receive more money than in the past. And so Schieber, to improve the team\u2019s fortunes in the future, might be more likely to recruit as many military veterans as possible: He knows that they\u2019d be more likely to afford the expenses to compete.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m looking at two athletes that are absolutely equal, does it fall into my mind that the veteran may have the better opportunity for funding and may be long-term a better athlete down the road?\u201d Schieber said. \u201cYou hate to say it.

If these people see the administration as unequipped to handle an emergency, they owe the country a firsthand account of our vulnerability. But there is, at least, a certain logic to the argument made in their defense. That logic, however, only holds for those who remain on decent terms with Trump. Which means that if there\u2019s one person who has no excuse for not speaking out, it\u2019s Tillerson, once one of the most powerful private citizens in America, now humbled and defiled by his time in Trump\u2019s orbit.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Tillerson holds Trump in contempt and disagrees with large parts of his agenda. After Charlottesville, Tillerson refused to say that the president\u2019s words represented American values. (\u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d he told Fox News.) In office, he struggled to save the Iran nuclear deal and opposed Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Jared Kushner\u2019s \u2014 support for a blockade of Qatar by other Arab states. After his ignominious firing, he gave a live address in which he didn\u2019t even mention the president\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cRex is never going to be back in a position where he can have any degree of influence or respect from this president,\u201d my Republican source said. Because of that, the source continued, \u201cRex is under a moral mandate to do his best to burn it down.\u201d That would mean telling the truth \u201cabout how concerned he is about the leadership in the Oval Office, and what underpins those concerns and what he\u2019s seen.\u201d\n\nIn this case, patriotism and self-interest point in the same direction. Before entering this administration, Tillerson was a vastly more respected businessman than Trump; as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, he presided over what The Times described as a \u201cstate within a state.\u201d Now the first line of his obituary will be about a year of abject failure as the country\u2019s lead diplomat, culminating in a humiliation fit for reality TV.\n\nThe only way he will ever change that is by joining those who would bring this despicable presidency down. If Tillerson came out and said that the president is unfit, and perhaps even that venal concerns for private gain have influenced his foreign policy, impeachment wouldn\u2019t begin tomorrow, but Trump\u2019s already narrow public support would shrink further. Republican members of Congress like Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, might be induced to rediscover their spines and perform proper oversight.\n\nLast year, Axios\u2019s Allen and Jim VandeHei half-jokingly called the insiders trying to circumscribe Trump the \u201cCommittee to Save America.\u201d Now the committee, having failed, is disbanding.

Blocking the bus lane, \u201cis selfish, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Byford said in a recent interview aboard a bus that was forced to swerve in and out of a designated bus lane to avoid parked vans and idling taxis.\n\n\u201cI get that people have to deliver things, but the bus lane should be for the buses, period,\u201d Mr. Byford said, adding that the transit agency is developing a plan to improve bus service that may include adding front-facing cameras mounted on buses, a measure that other cities have taken to strengthen enforcement of bus-only lanes.\n\nIncreasing the number of bus and bike lanes, but under-enforcing the rules to keep them unimpeded, \u201cis one of these programs that ratchets up New Yorker sincere cynicism about government doing the right thing,\u201d Mr. White said.\n\nTo gather actual data on how often blockages occur, Mr. Bell downloaded 10 days of publicly available video from a Department of Transportation camera mounted on a traffic light at the corner of 145th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Then he fed over 2,000 images of different types of vehicles, like trucks, buses and cars into his computer, training it to identify what exactly was blocking the way. In the case of bus stops, for example, Mr. Bell adjusted the computer program so that it was able to differentiate between buses that are supposed to be there from vehicles that were sitting there illegally.\n\nHis work took about three weeks. After the programming was complete, it took the computer about a day to crunch though the 10 days of footage. Mr. Bell\u2019s program only measured the percentage of time the lanes on his test block were obstructed, but from that he said he was able to extrapolate actual numbers and calculated about 850 vehicles blocking the bike lane and over 1,000 in the bus lane.

Seattle Slew had the same kind of breeding, and he ended up becoming a good stallion.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor Made is all in on promoting its star, whether California Chrome succeeds as a stallion will be determined in the years to come, as his first runners will not hit the track until 2020. A stallion\u2019s fee is initially determined by his own accomplishments and pedigree, then later by how his foals sell, and ultimately, by how his progeny run.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first two stages are largely speculative, and while the last one is not, it takes years to determine. For example, the most expensive stallion in North America is Tapit, who has wildly outperformed expectations. He first stood for $15,000 before dropping to $12,500 because his popularity waned. When his runners hit the track though, he became the leading sire in the country and now he commands $300,000. Tapit is also an exception to the rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe number of stallions that actually make it are probably 1 out of 15, and there might be 3 out of 15 that look like they are going to make it,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is a very emotional business. It changes easily, and it is all about having the momentum at the right time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Made is aware that California Chrome\u2019s fans are still invested in his story, and it is part of an initiative called Horse Country, a nonprofit started in Kentucky by farms, equine medical clinics, and other equine attractions looking to offer experiences to the public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Today, visits with California Chrome and American Pharoah, who is at Ashford Stud, are two of the most common requests.\n\nAccording to Horse Country officials, more than 8,600 fans have come to Taylor Made, and most are there to see California Chrome. This led to the creation of another tour called The California Chrome Experience, which guarantees meeting both the horse and some of his first foals. It is almost sold out.\n\n\u201cI think people were so compelled by California Chrome because of his underdog story and his longevity,\u201d said Anne Hardy, the executive director of Horse Country. \u201cHe was on the track longer than we typically see champions racing now. People love a special way to connect authentically, and that the Taylors would be so open to welcoming guests in so close is exceptional.\u201d\n\nThe Taylors want to help the sport grow, and California Chrome\u2019s popularity is a way to get people to the farm to see behind the scenes. With that in mind, they also partnered with adventure magazine True.Ink to offer fans a chance to vote on a broodmare to be covered by California Chrome with an opportunity to buy into the resulting foal.\n\nAccording to True.Ink, more than 600 people joined the project, which is called The People\u2019s Horse, in an effort to breed the world\u2019s first crowdfunded racehorse. The chosen mare, Colerful Bride, will deliver in April.\n\n\u201cHorse racing for the most part in America is boiled down to brief moments,\u201d said True.Ink\u2019s founder Geoffrey Gray. \u201cThere is the Kentucky Derby and mint juleps and celebrities, and then the year turns. But there is so much more to a horse\u2019s life, and there is more to the experience.\n\n\u201cNot only is this project a way to get people involved in horse racing, but it is another way to be part of California Chrome\u2019s legacy. It is a way to be part of the California Chrome family, only in this version, the family is going to be a lot larger than normal.\u201d", "title": "California Chrome Was a Winner, but What About His Kids?", "authors": ["Amanda Duckworth"]}

San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \u201cAbout 15 years ago we recognized that there\u2019s a broader definition called an atmospheric river, and those happen all over the planet.\u201d\n\nFor non-scientists, atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually.\n\n\u201cIf you look from space from a satellite, it does look like a sinuous river,\u201d said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A. \u201cIt\u2019s a colorful term, and it\u2019s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers, not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms.\n\nThe source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands, hence the playful \u201cPineapple Express.\u201d Not everyone agrees, though, that this storm falls under that category.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this one a Pineapple Express. The storm is coming from the West, but the tail of this atmospheric river didn\u2019t come from Hawaii, it came from east of Hawaii,\u201d Mr. Ralph said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this. The modern term is atmospheric river.\u201d\n\nNomenclature aside, Mr. Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue. Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard, it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County. The forecast is severe, and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides.\n\n\u201cThe forecast is for a really, really big rain,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity.

But it was just the start of a season for California teams with some high-profile additions to show off.\n\nAs everyone remembers, the last baseball season ended at Dodger Stadium, where the Houston Astros squeezed the life from the home team in Game 7 of the World Series. The Dodgers cut ties with the goat of that series \u2014 the twice-thrashed starter Yu Darvish, who signed with the Chicago Cubs \u2014 but retain a strong roster in pursuit of their first championship in 30 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThree of their California neighbors made some of the splashiest additions of the off-season. The San Francisco Giants traded for the cornerstones of two faraway teams, acquiring third baseman Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays and outfielder Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nThe San Diego Padres \u2014 rarely big spenders \u2014 gave out the richest contract on the free agent market, lavishing $144 million on an eight-year deal for first baseman Eric Hosmer, who won a World Series title and four Gold Gloves for the Kansas City Royals.\n\nIn Anaheim, the Los Angeles Angels scored a coup when Shohei Ohtani, a pitching and hitting sensation from Japan, chose them over the field. Ohtani had a rocky spring training, but he started at designated hitter in Oakland on opening day Thursday and is scheduled to make his pitching debut against the A\u2019s on Sunday. The Angels have still not won a playoff game with the sublime Mike Trout on their roster, but they\u2019ll try to change that with help from Ohtani and new infielders Ian Kinsler and Zack Cozart.\n\nThe A\u2019s have finished in the American League West cellar in each of the last three seasons, and two of their most promising young pitchers \u2014 Jharel Cotton and A.J. Puk \u2014 learned in spring training that they needed Tommy John surgery. Even so, the A\u2019s made a few additions, including catcher Jonathan Lucroy and right fielder Stephen Piscotty, who could help them move up a spot or two.\n\nAs for the Dodgers, they will most likely face tougher competition in the National League West than the Padres and the Giants \u2014 especially after the Giants lost their ace, Madison Bumgarner, to a broken finger on his pitching hand last week. The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies both won wild cards last season, and could challenge the Dodgers\u2019 attempt to win their sixth division title in a row.\n\nOf course, for the Dodgers, winning the division is not the goal. The best pitcher on the planet, Clayton Kershaw, can opt out of his contract after the season. For all his individual success, Kershaw is missing the one thing Johnny Podres, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Fernando Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser all captured in Dodger blue: a championship ring.\n\nCalifornia Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

It\u2019s rare that a city has that kind of civic deadline. It\u2019s really an ideal time frame. It\u2019s long enough to take on some ambitious projects, but not so distant that it feels too abstract and too far-off. We have housing and transit funding in hand that was approved by voters, so bringing that all together and leveraging it is key.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge for L.A. right now?\n\nHousing and homelessness are No. 1, there\u2019s no question about that. We have an affordability crisis and a homelessness crisis on our hands. I think the mayor is really committed to building as much housing as possible. We also have a re-embrace of the public realm.

Human Rights Watch has described the meeting as a \u201cdance with dictators.\u201d\n\nAttendees include Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the Thai junta, who seized power in a coup in 2014 and has postponed elections indefinitely; and Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticized for inaction in the face of a brutal military campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority.\n\nParticular outrage has coalesced around the presence of Mr. Hun Sen, who has spent the past six months methodically jailing or exiling his political opponents and critics, in advance of elections scheduled for July.\n\nElaine Pearson, Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said that Australia should be doing more to oppose abuses in the region but that the country appeared to be holding back in an effort to jostle for position with China. Australia has also been constrained by a widely criticized deal it made in 2014 to send refugees trying to reach its shores to live in Cambodia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s almost a race to the bottom with China in terms of human rights, and that\u2019s exactly the wrong approach,\u201d Ms. Pearson said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe summit meeting also comes as a small but impassioned proxy battle for political supremacy in Cambodia has been playing out in Australia.\n\nAfter nearly being voted out in 2013 by a new opposition party that counted many overseas Cambodians among its supporters and funders, the Cambodian People\u2019s Party of Mr. Hun Sen, which has held power in some form since 1979, began to aggressively target the diaspora.\n\nIn 2015, the prime minister\u2019s eldest son, Hun Manet, a senior figure in Cambodia\u2019s military, was placed in charge of a new effort to drum up support in countries including Australia. Since then, he has made multiple visits to Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nSpeech by Cambodians abroad has also come under increased scrutiny at home. In September, the country\u2019s opposition leader, Kem Sokha, was jailed on charges of treason, and his party was later dissolved by court order. The primary evidence in both cases was a speech to supporters in Melbourne in 2013.\n\nMr. Lim, a dual citizen, was barred from Cambodia two years ago for calling its government \u201cbeastly,\u201d and he has been threatened with arrest if he returns.\n\nJulie Heckscher, an official at the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said at a Senate hearing on March 1 that the government had informed Cambodian officials that threats of violence toward protesters on Australian soil were \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nMr. Lim, who peppers his Cambodian-accented speech with distinctly Australian words like \u201ccrikey,\u201d clearly relishes his new role as an international mischief maker. But beneath the showmanship, he appears genuinely concerned at what he says is a concerted effort by Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party to co-opt and threaten Cambodians abroad.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Cambodian People\u2019s Party has opened an Australian branch of its uniformed youth corps, and has ordered Cambodia\u2019s ambassador in Canberra to double as a political organizer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor his part, Mr. Lim recently helped arrange political asylum in Australia for Bou Rachana, the widow of a government critic who was assassinated in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, in 2016. Since she arrived in late February, Mr. Lim said they had both received a crudely worded death threat in Khmer, the language of Cambodia, which they reported to the Australian police.\n\nMr. Lim was studying in Australia on a scholarship when Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Diplomatic relations between the countries were cut off, and he took a job drilling metal in a boat factory to make ends meet. Back home, his parents died of starvation under the brutal Communist regime.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 1996, he became the first Australian of Asian descent elected to a state Parliament\u2019s lower house.\n\nFor years, he refrained from overtly supporting any side in Cambodian politics, and he even welcomed Mr. Hun Sen during a visit to Australia in the early 1990s. But he said that recent political developments had forced his hand.\n\n\u201cThe Labor left just loved him, and when he visited, many of them turned up for him in one of the local restaurants, and people just mobbed him like a movie star,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cHe was such an orator, and now look at him \u2014 he has become such a monster.

Mr. Ek said Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s threats had galvanized the community.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to impose his tentacles of violence on all of us, and we feel it is completely unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ek said he wanted to teach his children that they had the right to speak freely, and even to deface the image of the Cambodian prime minister if they wished.\n\nFor Ms. Bou, the widow, the stakes felt higher. Although she and her five sons are still settling into their new life in Melbourne, she said she had been determined to attend the protest, where she addressed the crowd with a bullhorn.\n\n\u201cI had never gotten a chance to do this, to express my personal feelings,\u201d she said.", "title": "Cambodia\u2019s Ruler Dared Australians to Burn His Effigy, So They Did", "authors": ["Julia Wallace"]}

Earlier this month, he told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had never obtained or used Facebook data \u2014 a statement that the firm itself has contradicted in recent days.\n\nBut it was Monday\u2019s broadcast by Channel 4 News in Britain that appeared to push the board of Cambridge Analytica to move against Mr. Nix. Channel 4 spent months investigating the company, and sent a reporter to pose as a prospective client from Sri Lanka, secretly filming the encounters with Mr. Nix.\n\nThe most damning footage was captured in January when Mr. Nix, sitting in a hotel bar in London, suggested the firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of working behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Nix said.\n\nInside Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Nix, the scion of a wealthy family who attended Eton College, the exclusive secondary school, had a reputation for lashing out at staff members, and for aggressively pursuing deals.\n\nChristopher Wylie, a data expert who worked at the firm in 2013 and 2014 and helped develop its voter-profiling technology, said in a recent interview that he kept memberships at a number of exclusive strip clubs near Pall Mall in London at the insistence of Mr. Nix, who often entertained clients from African and Caribbean countries there.\n\n\u201cWhy would I have these memberships?\u201d said Mr. Wylie, who is gay. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them.\u201d\n\nChannel 4 followed up Tuesday with a second part of its investigation that focused mainly on Mr. Nix\u2019s claims that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the election of Mr. Trump \u2014 a claim that many inside the Trump campaign have disputed.\n\nThe Channel 4 report also included allegations first reported by The Times this past weekend that Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of foreigners to work on election campaigns in the United States could have violated American election laws.

The companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure, and their operations are deeply intertwined.\n\nMr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell \u2014 it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.\n\nNeither the Mercer family nor Mr. Bannon has publicly commented since the reports in the Times and The Observer.\n\nFacebook, too, has sought to avoid the spotlight but also found itself under a similarly unwelcome glare.

Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and had no involvement in the European Union referendum that ended with a victory for those who support withdrawal, or Brexit, from the bloc.\n\nMr. Wylie\u2019s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss, Alexander Nix, who has recently appeared before the same committee twice. Mr. Wylie said a cluster of pro-Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company, Aggregate IQ, which provided them with SCL\u2019s store of data.\n\n\u201cI think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company\u2019s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States, because Aleksandr Kogan, the scientist who collected it, made regular return trips to Russia.\n\n\u201cPut a key logger in Kogan\u2019s computer in Russia and you\u2019ve got everything,\u201d Mr. Wylie said.

But what\u2019s done is done.\u201d\n\nHe was caustic on the subject of his former boss, Mr. Nix, who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries. He recalled that once, they were late to a meeting because Mr. Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for $283,000.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people, they need something to keep them occupied. They need projects.

And sure enough, that\u2019s what has happened.\n\nDays after Mr. Joyce\u2019s resignation, Michaelia Cash, the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative Liberal Party, was being interrogated in a hearing (unrelated to the Joyce scandal or intra-office sex) when she declared that Bill Shorten, leader of the opposition Labor Party, has been the subject of rumors for years concerning (presumably sexual) relationships with his female staff members.\n\nThis outburst could only have occurred in the context of the Joyce matter. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, made this explicit when he defended Ms. Cash in a radio interview: \u201cWe\u2019ve sat here taking a morals lecture from Bill Shorten in relation to Barnaby Joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there\u2019s a history of problems in Bill Shorten\u2019s personal life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be lectured by the Labor Party really sticks in the craw.\u201d\n\nBut the truth is that the \u201cmorals lecture\u201d came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor\u2019s response throughout Mr. Joyce\u2019s travails has been studiously amoral, focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds, or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce\u2019s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash\u2019s comments a politically meaningful smear.\n\nThe real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It\u2019s that within this new political culture, Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair, and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors, and politicians have a duty to investigate them.", "title": "Opinion | Can Australia Regulate Intra-Office Sex?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "By then, other geneticists had established that a specific form of one gene affects how people metabolize caffeine. That gene, prosaically called CYP1A2, controls the expression of an enzyme that affects the breakdown and clearance of caffeine from the body.\n\nOne variation of the CYP1A2 gene prompts the body to rapidly metabolize caffeine. People who have two copies of this variant, one from each parent, are known as fast caffeine metabolizers; the drug gives them a quick jolt and is gone.\n\nBy most estimates, about half of us are fast metabolizers.\n\nAnother variant of the gene slows caffeine metabolism. People with one copy of this version and one of the faster-metabolizing type are considered to be moderate metabolizers, whereas people with two copies of the slow-metabolizing variant are, of course, slow caffeine metabolizers.\n\nAbout 40 percent of us are thought to be moderate metabolizers, with the remaining 10 percent being genetically slow metabolizers.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. El-Sohemy and his colleagues published a study in JAMA showing that slow metabolizers had a heightened risk of heart attacks if they frequently drank coffee, compared to people who were genetically classified as fast caffeine metabolizers. The scientists theorized that the drug, which can constrict blood vessels, hung around and produced longer-lasting \u2014 and in this case undesirable \u2014 cardiac effects among the slow metabolizers.\n\nBut few large experiments had focused on how people\u2019s CYP1A2 genetic profile might influence their athletic performance after swallowing caffeine.\n\nSo for the new study, which was published this month in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, Dr. El-Sohemy, together with his graduate student Nanci Guest and other colleagues, decided to ply about 100 willing, young, male athletes with various doses of the drug. (The study was funded in part by Nutrigenomix, as well as Coca-Cola and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; the funders did not influence the results, Dr. El-Sohemy says.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe scientists swabbed the men\u2019s cheeks, analyzed their CYP1A2 genes and, based on which variants each man carried, categorized them as fast, moderate or slow caffeine metabolizers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before one ride, the men received a low dose of caffeine (2 milligrams for every kilogram of their body weight, or about the amount found in one large cup of coffee). Before another, they swallowed twice as much caffeine; and before a third, a placebo.\n\nTheir subsequent time trial results showed that, on aggregate, the men performed better with caffeine, especially after the higher amount.\n\nBut there were substantial differences by gene type.\n\nThe fast metabolizers rode nearly 7 percent faster after they had downed the larger dose of caffeine compared to the placebo. The moderate metabolizers, by contrast, performed almost exactly the same whether they had received caffeine or a placebo.\n\nIt was the slow metabolizers, however, who showed the greatest impact, although in a negative direction. They completed the 10 kilometer ride about 14 percent more slowly after the higher dose of caffeine than after the placebo.\n\nJust how caffeine differentially boosted or blunted the men\u2019s athletic performance remains unclear.\n\nBut Dr. El-Sohemy suspects that, as in the heart-attack study, caffeine lingered in the slow metabolizers, narrowing their blood vessels and reducing the flow of blood and oxygen to tiring muscles.\n\nIn fast metabolizers, the drug likely provided a quick gush of energy and then was cleared from their bodies \u201cbefore it could do the bad stuff,\u201d he says.\n\nThis study involved only healthy young men and bicycling. It cannot tell us whether caffeine likewise gooses or inhibits performance for other people in other sports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd it cannot answer the broader question of whether we need a genetic test before deciding if we should mainline coffee in advance of our next workout.\n\nPhysical performance involves, after all, so many factors, including motivation, sleep, stress, overall nutrition, and the working of a vast number of genes, many still unidentified.\n\nSo if you find that coffee seems to impede your performance, you could use a genetic test to characterize your CYP1A2 gene and confirm that you are a slow metabolizer.

Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201d\n\nYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.\n\nMaybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\n\nSorry, Mr. Cryan tried that.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nInvestors are selling tech again.\n\nThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.\n\nTech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.\n\nChip makers were among the hardest hit on the day.

Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Dudley took the helm in 2009, the financial crisis had left the New York Fed\u2019s reputation as a regulator damaged. The institution had not done enough to address the severe weaknesses at the banks it oversaw, like Citigroup. Early on, Mr. Dudley commissioned a review of the New York Fed\u2019s bank supervision department and then overhauled it. But in 2012, JPMorgan Chase, also overseen by the New York Fed, suffered huge trading losses in what was known as the London Whale scandal. The New York Fed was faulted.\n\nFollowing the embarrassing London Whale imbroglio, Mr. Dudley used his bully pulpit to focus on bankers\u2019 ethics. Banks were stronger financially, but recent scandals showed that the culture of their firms still needed to improve, he observed. And if a cleanup didn\u2019t occur, it may be a sign that they needed to be reduced in size, Mr. Dudley said in a 2014 speech that rattled Wall Street.\n\nThe next big banking scandal \u2014 Wells Fargo\u2019s widespread mistreatment of customers, which came to light in 2016 \u2013 strongly supported Mr. Dudley\u2019s arguments. Wells Fargo was considered one of the most stable \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, with its focus on plain vanilla lending, but in fact, its retail sales culture had degraded. The Fed earlier this year slapped relatively harsh sanctions on the bank, including a limit on its size.\n\nThe example of Wells Fargo is pertinent for John C. Williams, a top candidate to replace Mr. Dudley. Mr. Williams is head of the San Francisco Fed, which oversees Wells Fargo.\n\nAnd there is still work to do to fulfill Mr. Dudley\u2019s initiative. He proposed a \u201cdatabase of banker misconduct,\u201d similar to the one for brokers, that would track a banker\u2019s record on ethics and compliance. Banks could consult it before hiring. But this idea has not taken off. In a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday, Mr. Dudley explained why: \u201cUnderstandably, firms are concerned about legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct, but there may be ways to address these concerns through legislation.\u201d\n\nMr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nHow worrying is the flattening yield curve?\n\nThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.\n\nThat has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.\n\nSince the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\n\n\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201d\n\nThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.\n\nNvidia halts tests on self-driving cars.\n\nA week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\n\nNvidia on Tuesday said it had suspended self-driving tests in New Jersey, Santa Clara, Japan and Germany. A Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, using A.V. as an abbreviation for automated vehicles :\n\n\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence platform is the autonomous industry\u2019s leader. The chip maker has partnered with auto makers such as Volkswagen, Tesla and Audi. Around 320 firms - from software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - use Nvidia\u2019s platform, Reuters reports.\n\nNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.\n\nRoger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\n\n\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being.

Maybe it\u2019s because, as Peter Eavis writes, the president\u2019s threats of a trade war with China might be merely negotiating tactics.\n\nMore from Peter: According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about shifting trade terms. If China doesn\u2019t show real signs that it will do more to open its markets, Mr. Trump could up the ante \u2014 roiling the markets again. But the White House\u2019s more conciliatory tone yesterday after last week\u2019s sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full trade war.\n\nBut remember that Beijing is firmly committed to its industrial policy, while the U.S. is equally adamant about letting American companies operate more freely in China.

Paper, $7.95.\n\nCAN IT HAPPEN HERE?\n\nAuthoritarianism in America\n\nEdited by Cass R. Sunstein\n\n481 pp. Dey St./Morrow. Paper, $17.99.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to impeach a president.\n\nThe founders included the provision, from the very start, as the weakest, \u201cbreak the glass in case of emergency\u201d mechanism for reining in an out-of-control executive. He was already subject to a four-year term, so he would remain answerable to the people, and to two other branches of government, which could box him in constitutionally. But the founders\u2019 fear of creeping monarchism \u2014 the very reason for their revolution \u2014 and their deep realism about human nature led them to a provision, rooted in English constitutional precedent, whereby a rogue president could be removed from office by the legislature during his term as well. At the same time, it\u2019s clear they also wanted a strong executive, not serving at the whim of Congress, or subject, like a prime minister, to a parliamentary vote of \u201cno confidence.\u201d He was an equal branch of government, with his own prerogatives, empowered, in Hamilton\u2019s words, to conduct his office with \u201cdecision, activity, secrecy and dispatch.\u201d He stood very much on his own feet.\n\nAnd so the impeachment power was both strong and weak. Strong as it hovered as the ultimate sanction for any president who might push his luck, but weak insofar as it was deliberately limited to the offense of subverting the Constitution itself or betraying the United States in foreign affairs: the famously grave and yet vague Anglo-American terminology of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which included \u201cgreat and dangerous offenses.\u201d These were essentially serious political crimes, which was why they had to be dealt with in the political arena rather than the courts. They amounted to one core idea: If the president was to start acting like a king, he could be dispatched.\n\nBut if he was to start acting like an idiot, he could not be impeached. If he was psychologically disturbed but not mentally incapacitated, ditto. If he pursued ruinous policies, or faced enormous unpopularity, or said unspeakably reckless things, he could not be impeached. If he committed a whole slew of crimes in his personal capacity, he\u2019d be answerable to public opinion and regular justice, but not subject to losing his job. If his judgment was unstable, his personal behavior appalling or if he were to make the United States a laughingstock in the opinion of mankind, the impeachment provision did not apply.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd even then, the bar for impeachment was very high, as Cass R. Sunstein\u2019s elegant new monograph, \u201cImpeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide,\u201d explains: Both House and Senate would have to be involved and in favor; and conviction would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, ensuring that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. This is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times, and never actually pursued to conviction. The attempted impeachment of John Tyler in 1842 was rightly rejected by the House of Representatives by a margin of 127-83 (he was guilty of innovating the use of the veto on policy grounds alone), and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868(on the preposterous grounds that he had no right to appoint his own secretary of war) was turned back by a single vote in the Senate. The impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton in 1998 because of a civil sexual harassment suit squeaked through the House on partisan lines, 221-212, but failed in the Senate, with conviction on the least ludicrous obstruction of justice charge reaching only 50 votes out of a needed 67.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRichard Nixon resigned before a vote in the full House could be taken. Sunstein assesses his articles of impeachment thus: not impeachable for evading taxes (too personal a crime); probably impeachable for resisting a congressional subpoena (but a president could potentially make a legitimate, if dubious, claim about executive privilege); definitely impeachable for covering up an impeachable offense (abusing the powers of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Department of Justice to conceal evidence of an attempt to subvert an election by burglarizing the Democratic National Committee).", "title": "Can Donald Trump Be Impeached?", "authors": ["Andrew Sullivan"]}
{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is trying to look around the corner and see what\u2019s coming and to anticipate it,\u201d Mr. Aronsson said.\n\nThe idea was inspired by a return visit Mr. Aronsson made to his hometown in 2014 (he was born here in 1953), when he was one of 150 high-profile former Detroiters invited to the inaugural \u201cDetroit Homecoming,\u201d an event organized by Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.\n\nParticipants heard presentations by the city\u2019s entrepreneurs and government leaders about their plans for reviving the city, just then emerging from the largest Chapter 9 bankruptcy in the country\u2019s history.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey also were asked to write their wishes for the city on a chalkboard. Passing by, Mr. Aronsson spotted the words, \u201cBring back Carl\u2019s Chop House\u201d \u2014 the steakhouse founded by his grandfather, Carl Rosenfield, a World War I veteran, in 1932.\n\nLong a haunt for politicians, athletes, executives and locals, Carl\u2019s closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2010. Mr. Aronsson says he was so excited by the shout-out that he called his sister, who lives north of the city.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLikewise, he was impressed by the enthusiasm of the entrepreneurs taking a chance on the long-derelict city.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Boy, if I were 30 years younger, I wouldn\u2019t even need any change in my pocket, I\u2019d be here in a New York second figuring out what to do next,\u2019\u201d Mr. Aronsson said.\n\nBut he went back to New York, and his investment firm, Aronsson Group Capital, which advises apparel and luxury goods companies. Mr. Aronsson says he didn\u2019t give a Detroit project any serious thought until a meeting with the city\u2019s mayor, Michael Duggan, last June.\n\nMr. Duggan, he said, asked him whether Detroit could become home to a garment district like the one that once dominated the West Side of Midtown Manhattan.\n\nAlmost without thinking, Mr. Aronsson presented an alternative. Rather than an old-school fashion district, he foresaw a center that could capitalize on technology and the latest retail trends. He proposed creating a campus to teach and execute every aspect of the fashion process, from fabric production and embroidery to garment and luxury goods design.\n\nThere would be jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers, from engineers to designers to sewers, with a training center to teach employees various tasks, and a manufacturing plant to produce the items, which then could be sold directly to consumers.\n\nMr. Duggan asked Mr. Aronsson to start work on a proposal. The pair announced the project at the 2017 Detroit Homecoming in September, while the city formed a task force to look at its feasibility and location.\n\nMr. Aronsson declined to discuss the financial scope of the project, but said he would invest his own resources and hoped to obtain capital from public and private sources.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nComing Home to Detroit\n\nMr. Aronsson excitedly recalls his memories about the city, especially the jobs he held at Carl\u2019s Chop House, where he was warned by family members that if he couldn\u2019t keep up, \u201cI would not remain,\u201d he recalls.\n\nHe worked 12- to 16-hour days every summer and on weekends while earning his undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan, and again while he was in law school at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nAfter earning his law degree, he headed to New York University for a master\u2019s in tax accounting, and stayed in Manhattan, filling in back home at the restaurant only upon urgent requests from family members.\n\nHis entry into the fashion world came when the designer Oscar de la Renta was looking for legal help. Mr. Aronsson worked for the Dominican-born designer as outside counsel from 1988 to 1993, then as the company\u2019s chief executive from 1994 until 2003.\n\nMr. de La Renta, who died in 2014, was clearly an important influence on his career. Mr. Aronsson, who is stocky with bright brown eyes and an enthusiastic manner, speaks affectionately of the debonair designer, who he says encouraged him to break traditional fashion boundaries.\n\nMr. Aronsson admittedly knew nothing about clothing when he began working at the fashion house. (He said bought his first copy of Women\u2019s Wear Daily, the industry trade publication, after he landed the consulting job.)\n\nBut, he said, he saw it was \u201cincredibly inefficient and dysfunctional to get a design produced and developed and delivered to a customer.\u201d\n\nTasked with regular calls to the label\u2019s key accounts, he visited Dawn Mello, the influential fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, to ask what kind of clothing she would like to see the line produce.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Mello gave him a long wish list, Mr. Aronsson recalled, which he conveyed to Mr. de la Renta. Two weeks later, the designer produced a capsule collection that was exclusive to Bergdorf\u2019s, and the line\u2019s sales there quintupled.\n\nAfter leaving Oscar de la Renta in 2004, Mr. Aronsson spent three years with the fashion giant LVMH, where he oversaw the Marc Jacobs and Donna Karan brands, and then led the troubled fashion house Ungaro for little more than six months in 2011, before returning to his investment firm.\n\nPhoto\n\nGiven his past experience in the fashion ranks, Mr. Aronsson believes Detroit has assets that can make his project successful.\n\nOne is the city\u2019s vast expanse of empty land. Mr. Aronsson has taken a look at the city\u2019s map of available tracts, and is trying to pick a campus location that would be easy for employees to reach, and for goods to be delivered and shipped from.\n\nThe city\u2019s labor pool is another key factor. In September, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 9.7 percent, according to the Labor Department.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThat is nearly 20 percentage points lower than the 28.4 percent rate Detroit experienced in 2009, as the city dealt with the Great Recession, but still more than double the national rate. Mr. Aronsson is also intrigued by the exit of people from Puerto Rico since the devastating hurricane last year, and thinks some could be lured north to work.\n\nDetroit also has a relatively low cost of living, especially compared with other large cities, although prices have been rising for lofts and homes in the city\u2019s most sought-after neighborhoods.\n\nIn recent years, Detroit has attracted a number of high-profile retailers to its urban neighborhoods \u2014 most notably Shinola and John Varvatos (another Detroit native who recently returned home, to open a flagship store on Woodward Avenue) \u2014 but the city has lost most of its major retailers in recent years.\n\nOther cities have taken steps to expand their fashion presence, with mixed success. Chicago has had a fashion director since 2006, but the focus there has mainly been on supporting designers, rather than creating a manufacturing sector. In Miami, the designer Rene Ruiz opened a 10,000-square-foot factory in 2013, where he produces his high-end evening apparel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLos Angeles has a sizable fashion district, focused primarily on designers and fast-fashion wholesalers. But it lost its most notable manufacturer in 2017, when American Apparel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its assets were sold. Some 2,400 workers were laid off.\n\nPossibly the closest thing to what Mr. Aronsson envisions is operated by Zara, the global fast-fashion label, at its operations in Northwest Spain.\n\nThere, Zara designs, manufactures and distributes about 50 percent of the clothing that it sells worldwide. An additional 24 percent is produced in Asia and a similar amount in Europe, according to SMC Globe, a supply chain analysis firm.\n\nMr. Aronsson says fashion production is ripe for disruption. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a matter of chasing cheap labor around the world. We\u2019ve sacrificed core competencies that we\u2019re going to have to re-establish.\u201d\n\nSheng Lu, an assistant professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware, says cheap labor is only part of the equation. \u201cThe apparel business is about building and controlling the supply chain,\u201d Mr. Lu said, adding that many fashion brands outsource their manufacturing to China and other parts of Asia \u201cbecause of the efficiency.\u201d\n\nHowever, Professor Lu does believe there could be room for niche production, like the kind Mr. Aronsson may be able to pull off.\n\n\u201cAs long as the U.S. keeps growing, and consumers keep spending, it\u2019s not surprising to see companies explore investment opportunities,\u201d Professor Lu said.\n\nMr. Aronsson is shying away from retail as part of his project, and little wonder. Thousands of stores have shut and entire shopping malls have closed as the retail industry restructures, while online retailers such as Net-a-Porter have captured customers who used to shop in the upscale boutiques and high-end department stores that Mr. Aronsson regularly visited.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew business models, like clothing-in-a-box brands \u2014 see Stitch Fix \u2014 are canceling out the need for a designer to be a figurehead. Consumers, Mr. Aronsson says, are buying looks, rather than labels. So, he reasons, why couldn\u2019t those looks be created in a city like Detroit?\n\nDespite his enthusiasm and that of the mayor\u2019s office, it can take a long time in Detroit for anything to gain the traction Mr. Aronsson hopes for.\n\nIt took 20 years for ground to finally be broken for a soaring office tower on the site of the J.L. Hudson\u2019s department store, which closed in 1981 and was torn down in 1997. And the abandoned Michigan Central railroad station, which was vacant for nearly 30 years before finally getting a partial refurbishment in 2015, remains a largely empty shell, used only occasionally as a party space. (In 2017, it was the site of the Detroit Homecoming where Mr. Aronsson and Mayor Duggan announced Project Treadwing.)\n\nThe project is still very much in its nascent stage. According to documents the city submitted to the state of Michigan in September, a request was made for a $150,000 grant to the Wilson Foundation and the New Economy Initiative; its status is listed as \u201cawaiting decision.\u201d And while Mr. Aronsson has not yet moved to Detroit full time, the city has helped arrange meetings with potential investors at which Mr. Aronsson has made his PowerPoint sales pitch. (City officials declined several requests for comment on the proposal.)\n\nBut Mary Kramer, the group publisher for Crain Communications, says she is excited that someone with Mr. Aronsson\u2019s roots and experience would want to return from New York to launch the venture.\n\n\u201cThat mix of outside and inside, long-term and new can really make a difference,\u201d Ms. Kramer said, adding of Mr. Aronsson, \u201cHis name and reputation and experience put this above other things that have happened.\u201d", "title": "Can Fashion Help Detroit Make a Comeback?", "authors": ["Micheline Maynard"]}

Yes, you can catch the same cold twice, depending on the strength of your immune response.\n\nMost of what we know about immunity to cold viruses is based on studies performed in the late 1950s and early \u201960s. These were experiments in which volunteers \u2014 the term \u201cvolunteer\u201d may be a bit generous here as the subjects were typically medical students or military recruits whose participation may have been less than fully voluntary \u2014 were intentionally infected with cold viruses.\n\nIn one landmark study from the late \u201950s, over 1,000 stalwarts were inoculated with the infectious nasal secretions from a patient with an active cold.

In a later, particularly rigorous study from 1963, 50 subjects were confined to a dormitory for an entire month to assess their ability to withstand reinfection with the same cold virus.\n\nThe results of these studies showed that for many people, infection with a cold virus can indeed provide effective immunity against subsequent exposure to that particular virus.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Ahmed also documents how Muslim communities end up reinforcing negative stereotypes. Refugees bring with them sectarian and ethnic rivalries that make little sense in Europe. Ahmed\u2019s own team of researchers was chased away from a mosque in Bradford, England, by a group of aggressive teenagers. What happened there \u201ccaptures the current predicament of contemporary European Muslim society: angry and noisy young Muslims, unresolved issues concerning immigration, frequent violence and terrorism, often inspired by ISIS, the rise of the far right and its dangerous rhetoric of religious hatred and rampant Islamophobia.\u201d\n\nAhmed spends little time analyzing the role of economics in promulgating these xenophobic sentiments. Nor does he compare Muslims\u2019 fates with the predicament of other migrants \u2014 Polish workers in England were, after all, a major target of Brexiteers \u2014 or the situation of Christians in the Middle East. His study is more ethnographic than political. We learn from the experiences of living, breathing people. Ahmed also reminds us of the considerable philosophical, scientific and cultural gifts that Muslims gave Europe throughout the ages.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most interesting observations don\u2019t concern Muslims, though, but the white Europeans who are struggling to reconcile the presence of these perceived outsiders with their idea of who they themselves are. Ahmed brilliantly illustrates how deeply rooted European tribal identities take hold during periods of rapid change and uncertainty, and how central these exclusionary concepts can be, particularly for Nordic and Germanic societies.\n\nThe tribal Germanic idea of Heimat, or homeland, for instance, represented a bulwark against the ills of modernity before the Nazis notoriously used it as a pretext for ethnic cleansing. Ahmed talks about Heimat in the same breath as the \u201chygge\u201d fad \u2014 a Nordic idea of warm, fuzzy togetherness that doubles as an advertisement for hot toddies and winter socks. Ahmed notes that the two concepts are rooted in a primordial tribal impulse to wall off familiar locals from (presumably prickly) outsiders. The popularity of these ideas in times of widespread social and political insecurity makes sense: They are a source of pride, and a throwback to simpler times. In Ahmed\u2019s sober, scholarly analysis of primordial European customs, Westerners are so used to reading about unruly Arab tribes that they forget Christian Europeans are descended from societies with similar structures, values and morals.\n\nAhmed frames tribal identity \u2014 whether Norwegian or Bedouin \u2014 as a political conundrum: \u201chow to remain strong in your own identity without transgressing onto that of others.\u201d Too much can lead to predatory chauvinism; too little can bring about a loss of self, a \u201cdangerous vacuum where \u2026 identity should have been.\u201d This point is fundamental to his analysis. Rather than diagnosing tensions between Muslims and white Europeans as an innate clash of cultures, Ahmed blames a loosening of identities \u2014 religious, national, tribal and cultural \u2014 on all sides that\u2019s further exacerbated by globalization.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nHis solution borrows from the past. He hopes Europeans can form new, hybrid identities that broaden the criteria for who belongs. Europe happens to have a homegrown example of this philosophy in medieval Andalusia, when people of multiple faiths in parts of modern-day Portugal and Spain enjoyed convivencia, a state of relative pluralism, peace and prosperity under Muslim rule. \u201cThe answer to the violence and tensions between religions in Europe today and the sense of alienation and confusion in Muslim youth is to revive and strengthen the Andalusian model as an alternative to that of a monolithic tribal society,\u201d Ahmed writes.\n\nAt the same time, Ahmed makes efforts not to succumb to what he calls \u201cAndalusian syndrome,\u201d or \u201ca nostalgia felt too deep for words about a beloved civilization in the past that haunts the imagination\u201d (afflicted parties include everyone from Prince Turki of Saudi Arabia to the Marxist theorist Tariq Ali). This period was hardly utopian, and Ahmed characterizes popular accounts of it \u2014 in the works of Salman Rushdie, notably \u2014 as excessively rosy. Ahmed also concedes that the old version of Andalusia is \u201cdated, impractical and has little legitimacy\u201d today. But his yearning for a better way, and his conviction that a \u201cNew Andalusia\u201d can exist, carries the reader through some 500 pages.\n\nModern manifestations of convivencia are admittedly rare, but there are some bright spots. When accounting for why many Muslims have found a happy home in Scotland, Ahmed borrows a touching idea from the Scottish nationalist politician Alex Salmond: that \u201ctartan tribalism\u201d is a kind of mosaic identity, \u201cflexible enough to accept immigrants with different religious and racial backgrounds.\u201d This flexibility, his research team found, is what brings unity to diverse societies. Regions with a greater understanding of their own mixed-up, multiethnic past \u2014 parts of Sicily, Portugal, even postwar Bosnia \u2014 are more inclined toward pluralism than the parts of Europe where people define themselves through blood or soil.\n\nThe fundamental message of \u201cJourney Into Europe\u201d is that throughout history, Islamic and European civilizations have often been not just compatible, but complementary. It\u2019s crucial to acknowledge their shared past to reject today\u2019s resurgent tribalism. The stakes, as Ahmed puts it, are \u201cAndalusia or dystopia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIntellectually, his conclusion is hard to argue with. But since 9/11, popular perceptions of Islam in the West have been informed by emotion, not facts or reason. That makes it difficult to envision how this book will change anyone\u2019s mind. The mere suggestion that Europe was once better off under Muslim rule would be enough to end a conversation not just with conservatives but with many liberals, too. The collective change of heart needed to achieve convivencia today would require \u2014 in Ahmed\u2019s own assessment \u2014 \u201ca strong moral leadership reflecting both wisdom and compassion while transcending religious, cultural and national boundaries.\u201d That, too, seems further away than ever.", "title": "Can Islamic and European Civilizations Coexist?", "authors": ["Atossa Araxia Abrahamian", "Akbar Ahmed"]}
{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "Mattis\u2019s unusual standing in the administration \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s more than a secretary of defense,\u201d one veteran diplomat told me \u2014 has put him in a paradoxical position. His boss, infatuated with raw military power, packed his administration with retired and active generals. But Mattis himself is visibly uneasy about being thrust into a political role. Relying on the reputation of generals to win over Congress or the public \u201csets up military leaders as the guarantors of public support, something that should be anathema to the longstanding balance of civil-military roles in America,\u201d Mattis and a colleague wrote in an essay published in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of his most frequent talking points, in speeches and off-the-cuff press appearances, is the need to match military strength with more soft power and diplomacy. Mattis seems acutely aware that he has inherited an office whose powers have been steadily expanding for years. The growth of the national security colossus since 9/11 has transformed America\u2019s relations with the rest of the world, overshadowing the State Department and other civilian agencies. As the Pentagon embraced counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan, the State Department withdrew behind bunkers and blast walls, ceding much of its role to men and women in uniform. In 2008, Robert Gates, the secretary of defense, began warning about the \u201ccreeping militarization of some aspects of America\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d with the State Department withering and the Pentagon steadily expanding.\n\nMattis seems to have recognized that promoting diplomacy would be an uphill battle in the Trump administration. To that end, he quickly formed an unusual bond with Tillerson, whom he called \u201cSt. Rex,\u201d calling to mind a heroic martyr stippled with Trumpian arrows. The two men talked daily and made synchronized appearances, forming a united front on almost every major issue. Mattis saw in Tillerson a temperamental and ideological ally, a deliberative man whose experience at Exxon trained him to value international relationships but not the glad-handing that often accompanies diplomacy. Both men can be a little scornful of the press, and Mattis \u2014 whose hero status renders him almost invulnerable \u2014 has received little criticism for the media restrictions he has imposed across the Pentagon. (Although I spent time with him last April, he declined repeated requests for a one-on-one interview afterward.) At times, though, Mattis seemed more committed to diplomacy than Tillerson. In November, when the White House proposed cutting the State Department\u2019s budget by about 31 percent, Mattis urged Tillerson to push back, but Tillerson refused. \u201cMattis can be very effective in supporting a position, but not in creating one,\u201d I was told by Ryan C. Crocker, who served as the United States ambassador to six Muslim countries and has known Mattis for almost 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a measure of Washington\u2019s profoundly anxious condition that Mattis, dismissed as a warmonger during the Obama administration, has been held up in liberal circles as a potential savior. He has mostly tried to keep American policy on autopilot, and that is deeply reassuring to many people who fear Trump\u2019s instincts. In Syria, for instance, Mattis maintained the Obama administration\u2019s military alliance with Kurdish guerrillas in the fight against ISIS and has now expanded it, though without really adjusting for political realities of an emerging Kurdish state. In January, when Tillerson formalized the decision to stay on and expand the mission, he sketched out grandiose goals \u2014 pushing back against Iran and Assad and preserving friendships with the Turks \u2014 without saying how those conflicting aims could be accomplished. The policy\u2019s contradictions became apparent almost immediately. Days after Tillerson\u2019s announcement, the Turkish military launched a bombing campaign against America\u2019s Kurdish allies, and there is no sign yet of how the administration hopes to reconcile its partners. Something very similar could be said about Trump\u2019s Afghanistan policy, introduced last August: more soldiers, more promises, but no plan to manage the regional power struggles that have kept America tied down for 17 years.\n\nStill, these policies have the virtue of familiarity. The next few months offer the prospect of something frighteningly new. President Trump\u2019s impromptu decision in early March to hold face-to-face talks with Kim Jong-un sets up a host of risks and an almost-impossible timeline. If the talks fail, lower-level diplomatic channels \u2014 usually held as a precursor to a leadership summit \u2014 could also collapse, raising the chances of war. The talks are now expected to take place by the end of May, the same month in which Trump has promised to abandon the Iran nuclear agreement if a deal is not reached to strengthen it. All this is happening with the State Department still desperately understaffed and in the midst of a transition. Trump, his aides say, is feeling newly liberated to ignore cautious advice, and his nominee for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is said to be fully in tune with his rowdier impulses. And on March 22, Trump announced that he was replacing McMaster with John Bolton, the hawkish lawyer who published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in February on \u201cthe legal case for striking North Korea first.\u201d If events spin out of control, Mattis could be forced to choose between his loyalty to the chain of command and the moral imperative to avert a catastrophic war.\n\n\u201cThis gets to a fundamental question,\u201d I was told by a retired senior officer who knows him well. \u201cCan Mattis win the president over in the most important debate we\u2019ve had in decades, maybe centuries? I believe there is a moral hazard with this president, he will take everybody to the cliff. ... If Mattis is able to prevail, that is what God put him on earth to do. It\u2019s that serious.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump invited Mattis onstage before a cheering, flag-waving throng in North Carolina in December 2016, he didn\u2019t even give his first name. \u201cYour next secretary of defense, General Mad Dog Mattis,\u201d he bellowed. Later, as Mattis left the stage, voices could be heard chanting \u201cMad Dog\u201d at the retired general. (It would be some time before Mattis, always polite, made clear that he couldn\u2019t stand the nickname.) At the time, Trump had already picked Michael Flynn as national security adviser and was considering David Petraeus for secretary of state; John Kelly and McMaster would come later. The men chosen would go on to staff their bureaucracies with lower-level officers, many of them veterans of the Iraq war, giving the Trump administration a more military cast than any in recent United States history. The president-elect seemed to relish the prospect of packing his White House with warriors who would help return a Pattonesque brashness to America\u2019s government and foreign policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s lifelong reverence for military men is partly about masculine affinity, the love of a self-styled warrior for the real thing. He spent his adolescent years at a military-themed boarding school, where he became infatuated with martial dress and ceremony and idolized his supervisor, a former Army colonel known to the boys as Maje. In black-and-white school photos from the early \u201960s, Trump can be seen in boots, sash and a plumed shako, like some Austro-Hungarian infantryman. In \u201cNever Enough,\u201d his 2015 biography of Trump, Michael d\u2019Antonio describes one of the future president\u2019s proudest moments: cutting past a group of Catholic schoolgirls so that he and his classmates could strut in uniform in the front row of the Columbus Day parade. Although he never learned anything about real combat, Trump somehow emerged from the New York Military Academy in 1964 with the idea that his high school salutes and marches gave him \u201cmore training militarily than a lot of guys that go into the military.\u201d\n\nBut some of Trump\u2019s old friends and associates speculate that he is drawn to Mattis and the other military men partly for the opposite reason: They represent the austere virtues he knows he lacks. \u201cWith the generals, the demeanor, discipline, self-sacrifice, the strict adherence to a code is something he doesn\u2019t see around him\u201d in the business world, I was told by an executive who has known Trump for years. \u201cThe thing he probably has least personal experience of is that.\u201d In other words, men like Mattis are, in many ways, as different from Trump as it is possible to be. Think of the gaudy ubiquity of Trump\u2019s golden logo and consider this: When the Marine Corps was publishing its official history of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Mattis insisted on removing every instance of his own name and replacing it with \u201cCommander, First Marine Division.\u201d\n\nEven the backgrounds of these taciturn men form a stark contrast with Trump\u2019s own story of inherited privilege and tabloid roguery. Mattis grew up in a house full of books and no TV set. His father was a former merchant marine who moved the family to Richland, Wash., a town mostly built by the federal government for workers at the Hanford nuclear site. His mother had worked for Army intelligence as a cipher clerk in South Africa during World War II. Mattis would later say that he was \u201ckind of brought up more to do the job than attract attention to myself.\u201d At school, he was skinny and shy but athletic; classmates remember him sticking up for less popular kids. After graduating from what is now Central Washington University, he joined the Marines in 1972, following an older brother and bucking the culture\u2019s Vietnam-era disaffection from all things military. He was singled out early as a leader and took to the job with a selfless zeal that did not allow for marriage or children (an engagement early in his career was broken off). In an officer corps where marriage is the norm, he soon acquired another nickname: the Warrior Monk. His vast popularity within the military derives largely from his reputation for total, self-punishing commitment to his troops. One incident that has become canonical in the Mattis legend took place in Afghanistan in December 2001. A young Marine captain named Nathaniel Fick had ordered his troops into two-man teams to guard each position, telling the others to rest. It was about 3 a.m. and bitterly cold when Fick walked the line and saw three heads in one of the foxholes instead of two. He was about to chew the third man out for disobeying orders when he realized it was General Mattis, making the rounds. \u201cHe could have been in bed, no one would have blamed him, but he was out there doing the same thing I was doing,\u201d Fick told me.\n\nAfter retiring from the Marines in 2013, Mattis took an academic post in California. Like many retiring generals, he collected large speaking fees, and he also took a lucrative board position with Theranos, a California biotech firm that was recently charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d (The company paid to settle the case.) He also volunteered and served on the board of a local food bank in his hometown in Washington State, where his mother still lived. He spent \u201cenormous amounts of time,\u201d one of his officer friends told me, behind the wheel of a car, driving all over the country to visit the families of men who were killed under his command. When he was nominated by Trump, he still listed as his primary residence a simple wood-frame house built by the federal government for workers at Hanford.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump may also have been drawn to Mattis because of his extremely hawkish reputation. The president is said to have been thrilled when, during Mattis\u2019s first White House briefing in the Situation Room on the campaign against ISIS, he spoke of waging a \u201cwar of annihilation.\u201d Mattis has for years voiced aggressive views about Iran, and this attitude is what led the Obama administration to force his early retirement as commander of U.S. Central Command in 2013, fearing that his pugnacity might undermine its nuclear diplomacy with Iran. Mattis\u2019s reputation is inseparable from a litany of quotes that express his trademark mix of composure and lethal intent: \u201cBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet,\u201d he told troops during the Iraq war in 2003. A few years later, also in Iraq: \u201cI come in peace. I didn\u2019t bring artillery. But I\u2019m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: if you [expletive] with me, I\u2019ll kill you all.\u201d\n\nThese tough-guy mantras express something real in Mattis\u2019s character \u2014 an unflinching directness about war\u2019s essence \u2014 but they are a little misleading. What really separates him from other officers at his level is his extraordinary erudition and his profound interest in diplomacy. He built up a library of some 6,000 books that he took from post to post as he rose through the ranks, and his conversation is larded with casual references not just to the usual military histories but also to novels, memoirs and poetry. Mattis\u2019s call sign in the Marines is Chaos, and many people assume this is another allusion to battlefield mayhem, like Mad Dog. In fact, one of his friends told me, the name comes from his nerdy passion for strategy. He got it as a colonel, when he kept piping up with bright ideas during a staff meeting. The officer in charge, a little exasperated, finally said: \u201cI\u2019ve got the name for you: Colonel Has Another Outstanding Solution.\u201d\n\nIt was almost possible, listening to Mattis at the start of his tenure, to imagine him as the spokesman of an emerging Trump Doctrine not so different from what Hillary Clinton \u2014 herself something of an Iran hawk \u2014 might have staked out in her first term. Like her, Mattis was an advocate of muscular diplomacy backed by credible threats of force. He was uncomfortable with President Obama\u2019s vacillations and his failure to hold Syria and Iran to account, but (unlike Trump) he was a devout believer in working through allies and upholding agreements. There was reason to believe Mattis could guide the president down this path: Trump gushed about his favorite general, and the two men met frequently. According to a schedule made public by a watchdog group in December, Mattis interacted with Trump in small-group settings more than 30 times in his first six months on the job.\n\nOn April 19 last year, I joined Mattis on a weeklong tour of the Middle East and North Africa designed to reassure allies and pave the way for a presidential visit a month later. In Riyadh, I stood with the press pack as he emerged onto the tarmac, looking erect and stoic in a blue suit and tie, and strode down the gangway to meet a group of officers and thobe-clad Saudi officials. The Saudis welcomed Mattis like a long-lost brother, thrilled to meet an American leader who shared their feelings about Iran. Their dislike of Obama and his diplomatic rapprochement with Tehran was no secret, but it was amazing to see how openly and eagerly they were embracing the new administration. Mattis did not disappoint. \u201cEverywhere you look in the region, if you find trouble, you find Iran,\u201d Mattis told me and a clutch of other reporters later that day. The following night, I visited a Saudi I\u2019ve known for years who was briefed on Mattis\u2019s closed-door sessions with King Salman and his advisers. My friend seemed beside himself with pleasure and poured me a glass of white wine as he praised Mattis. \u201cHe said, \u2018As long as the mullahs are ruling Iran, there will be no stability in the Middle East,\u2019 \u201d he said, grinning broadly and seeming to nourish hopes that this was some sort of code for a looming carpet-bombing of Tehran.\n\nOn our second day in Riyadh, Mattis welcomed reporters into a hotel room set aside for briefings next to his own suite. Up close, his face has a weary dignity, with a high forehead and deep vertical furrows that call to mind the marble bust of some venerable Roman senator. He speaks in a slow, deliberate drawl, pronouncing Mosul more like \u201cmuzzle\u201d and Sisi (the Egyptian president) like \u201csissy.\u201d Mattis is 67, and his language is flecked with homespun idioms redolent of the 1950s. Describing the awkward beginnings of a joint Israeli-Egyptian military-training session, he compared it to \u201ca sock hop, with boys and girls sticking to either side.\u201d True to his warrior-scholar reputation, he answered questions about today\u2019s Middle East by invoking Ulysses S. Grant and Herodotus, and he likened the Syrian civil war to earlier conflicts in Lebanon and Algeria.\n\nAll of this might make him sound grandfatherly and almost harmless. But when most of the other reporters left the room and I asked him about the Assad regime\u2019s poison-gas attack on a village called Kahn Sheikhoun earlier that month, Mattis leaned forward in his chair, his hands folded together on his knees, and his tone changed. His eyes became wide and focused. There was something eerily composed in his manner as he described the level of violence the United States military would be willing to bring to bear on its enemies. Our conversation was off the record. But listening to him, I found it easy to believe what I was told by a retired officer who has known Mattis for decades: \u201cThe tougher it gets, the calmer he gets. That\u2019s a pretty rare characteristic.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the time, Mattis already seemed to be leading the new administration in a more aggressive direction, at least in the Middle East. Trump had made clear that he would be devolving far more decision-making power to the Pentagon, after years of strict supervision of drone strikes and other military operations under the Obama administration. Days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mattis recommended a military strike against an Al Qaeda camp in Yemen, and the resulting raid led to the death of a Navy SEAL, at least 14 members of Al Qaeda and as many as 25 civilians. Then in April, in quick succession, came the missile strikes on Syria, in retaliation for a sarin gas attack, and the detonation of the MOAB (Mother of All Bombs) in Afghanistan. The latter strike, targeting an ISIS compound, generated sensational media coverage, especially after it emerged that Mattis had not been given advance warning (the commander who made the decision had been given prior authority to use the bomb if needed). But even as Mattis echoed Trump\u2019s tough talk about Iran, he was quietly moderating the new administration\u2019s more aggressive instincts. Last May, according to a report in The Washington Post, McMaster called Mattis to relay a request from the president for military options to strike Iranian ballistic-missile factories or the Iranian speedboats that regularly harass United States Navy vessels. Mattis refused.\n\nDuring his Mideast tour in April, Mattis emphasized the need for compromise, perhaps sensing that someone had to fill in for the mostly absent State Department. He pressured the Saudis to bring their war in Yemen to an end, calling for United Nations talks to broker a diplomatic resolution. After the trip, a former Pentagon official pointed out something I hadn\u2019t noticed: At every stop, Mattis made sure his first appointment was with the local United States Embassy, where he was careful to coordinate his efforts with the local diplomats. He also reserved a spot for State Department officials at all his meetings with foreign defense ministers \u2014 at a time when those same officials were struggling to get into similar meetings with Tillerson. No other secretary of defense in recent memory has so insistently catered to his diplomatic counterparts, the former official said. Mattis gave a concise summary of his views on diplomacy in 2013, when he told a congressional hearing, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithin a few weeks of Trump\u2019s inauguration, the worsening chaos in the West Wing made the traditional channels of decision-making almost meaningless. Typically, the National Security Council convenes meetings across the bureaucracy in an effort to channel expertise and reach consensus; this process generates recommendations that are sent to the national security adviser and onward, as needed, to the president. But in Trump\u2019s early days, veteran staff members watched in amazement as documents they had contributed to were ignored or overridden by Trump family members and loyalists like Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. \u201cThere were very few opportunities to get information to Trump,\u201d I was told by one former staff member who worked at both the National Security Council and the State Department before leaving late last year. \u201cHe\u2019s not reading five-to-10 page memos on national security. That magnifies the ability of some people to walk into his office and tell him what they think.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He had developed relationships with leading figures in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, and he seemed to be shaping foreign policy via his son-in-law status with Trump. Yet he had no relevant expertise and no formal position; his security clearance remained on hold. Not since Clark Clifford, the Washington lawyer who advised a string of Democratic presidents in the 1940s, \u201960s and \u201970s, has anyone held such influence when he didn\u2019t hold a cabinet position. But Clifford had vast experience and held positions of real authority before acquiring his clout. Kushner had only his father\u2019s real estate empire, and it was becoming clear that his inexperience made him ripe for manipulation by people at the receiving end of United States foreign policy.\n\nThis breakdown burst into view with the Qatar crisis. On June 5, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced an economic embargo and blockade of Qatar, their tiny neighbor. The pretext was that Qatar was funding and hosting terrorists, but the feud was much wider and went back decades. For the Pentagon, this was a rude shock \u2014 and not just because the whole premise of Mattis\u2019s effort to push back against Iran presumed unity among America\u2019s Persian Gulf allies. Qatar is host to al-Udeid Air Base, the United States military\u2019s largest command center in the Middle East and the launch point for the ongoing war against ISIS and other extremist groups in the region. The blockade threatened to complicate those operations. In the early days of the blockade, diplomats sent back reports that the Saudis and Emiratis might even be planning a military takeover of Qatar, a far more destabilizing possibility. (Emirati government officials have denied that there was ever such a plan.)\n\nIn the first week of the crisis, Mattis spoke by phone with the United States ambassador in Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, multiple times, she told me. She did not receive any calls from Tillerson. Mattis soon discovered his efforts to tamp down the crisis were facing opposition from within the White House. At an interagency meeting, a C.I.A. official opened with an assessment that made clear the Saudi-Emirati accusations against the Qataris were exaggerated. Sebastian Gorka, the controversial Trump adviser, responded angrily, I was told by another participant in the meeting. \u201cWhat you need to understand is that the Qataris are evil,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this, you are totally wrong.\u201d On June 9, Tillerson issued an appeal for the conflict to be resolved, but barely an hour later Trump publicly called Qatar \u201ca funder of terrorism at a very high level.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ardent sympathy for the Saudi perspective seemed to have been greatly enhanced by his fawning reception in Riyadh two weeks earlier, where his hosts thrilled him with sword dances, cannon salutes and a huge image of him beamed onto the side of his hotel at night. A photo-op with Trump clutching a weird glowing orb alongside the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt inspired endless internet memes. The gulf leaders used the visit to whisper to Trump about Qatar\u2019s supposed terrorist sympathies, and after they began the embargo, he seemed to take credit for it in one of his tweets.\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t the only object of this charm offensive. For months, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates had been befriending and cajoling Kushner, who had no background in the Arab world, through several meetings and frequent WhatsApp conversations. Kushner was soon bragging about his closeness to Arab leaders to other foreign dignitaries in Washington. He happily adopted the Saudi-Emirati perspective on the Qatar crisis, apparently believing that they would be supportive of his future efforts to broker a peace deal in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they were able to get their hooks into him,\u201d I was told by the official who worked in the National Security Council and State Department until recently. \u201cThey were able to shape his views.\u201d By midsummer, Tillerson was complaining bitterly to aides that Kushner had undermined his efforts to resolve the Qatar embargo. Around the same time, Kushner\u2019s blend of arrogance and ignorance about the Middle East was exposed in a leaked video of his comments to a group of congressional interns. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a history lesson,\u201d Kushner told the interns. \u201cWe\u2019ve read enough books.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn July, Mattis and Tillerson invited Trump and his top staff members for a meeting where they would guide him through the essentials of America\u2019s global power, with an emphasis on the importance of allies, treaties and international order. It would take place in the Tank, the historic Pentagon boardroom where the Joint Chiefs of Staff meet, a hallowed inner sanctum that was bound to appeal to Trump\u2019s taste for hidebound power rituals.\n\nAbout 20 people attended the meeting on July 20, including five cabinet secretaries, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top advisers, including Kushner, I was told by one person who attended. Mattis was clearly in charge, and as the meeting began, he stood in front of two huge screens that showed color representations of NATO, capital markets and various trade deals to which the United States is a signatory. \u201cThe greatest gift the greatest generation left us was the rules-based postwar international order,\u201d Mattis said. He went on to outline the military side of our alliance structures and was followed by Tillerson; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser. Trump listened in silence for a whole hour. When he finally spoke up, the attendee told me, his first words were, \u201cThis is exactly what I don\u2019t want.\u201d He went on to repeat many of the complaints that had become familiar during his campaign: the Europeans are deadbeats, our allies are taking advantage of us, we\u2019re paying for everyone else. A heated discussion broke out, with Bannon facing off against Tillerson and Mnuchin over the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe meeting lasted almost three hours, and by the end, Mattis and Tillerson knew they were facing an uphill battle. There were more meetings over the course of the next month as the internal review of Afghanistan policy heated up. At least one of them turned into a nasty sparring match between Bannon and the generals. Bannon was even more determined than Trump to force an American pullout, and he pelted McMaster with derisive taunts about the futility of throwing more money into Afghanistan\u2019s corrupt army. At one point, McMaster got so angry that Mattis patted his knee as he counseled him to keep his cool, I was told by one of the attendees. At another meeting, Tillerson grew so frustrated with Trump\u2019s complaints about the Iran deal that he seemed unable to look at the president and stared at the wall, his face flushed with emotion, as he repeated the words \u201cit\u2019s your deal,\u201d according to one participant. It was after this meeting broke up that Tillerson described Trump as a \u201cmoron.\u201d He made the comment to Mattis, who was sitting directly across from him. (Tillerson has neither confirmed nor denied his use of the word.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy September, Bannon\u2019s exit from the White House had brought a welcome respite for Mattis and Tillerson and especially for McMaster, who clashed repeatedly with him. The populist-nationalist wing of the administration, with its apocalyptic take on international affairs, appeared to be in retreat. Trump had relinquished his campaign vow to abandon Afghanistan, and signed onto a Pentagon-driven plan to bolster the American presence there. But the progress came at a cost. Tillerson\u2019s battles with the White House had damaged his stature, and the following weeks made that painfully clear.\n\nIn mid-September Tillerson and Mattis briefly thought they had won a breakthrough on the continuing Qatar-Gulf crisis when Trump said he would be willing to host a meeting with the leaders of all the countries involved. Tillerson called the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, to issue the invitation. What happened next was a grim landmark in the State Department\u2019s eroding stature. Thirty years ago, a direct call from the United States secretary of state, offering an invitation to meet the president, would have been treated with the utmost deference. Jubeir did not respond that way. According to an Arab diplomat I spoke with, Jubeir replied, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this because we won\u2019t show up.\u201d Tillerson, shocked and angry, said, \u201cYou would refuse to show up for a meeting with the president of the United States?\u201d and warned of \u201cconsequences.\u201d Jubeir backpedaled a bit, but held firm. Tillerson then called the Emirati foreign minister and got a similar response, the diplomat told me. Apparently, the Saudis and Emiratis felt they had a hold on Trump \u2014 and his son-in-law \u2014 and could safely treat the secretary of state as irrelevant.\n\nIn the hand-held video, Mattis strolls out into the bright sunshine, dressed in a black suit, looking pleased but surprised to be addressing a group of young American recruits on a base in Jordan. He thanks them and then says something more unusual: \u201cYou\u2019re a great example for our country right now, it\u2019s got some problems. You know it and I know it. It\u2019s got problems that we don\u2019t have in the military. You just hold the line, my fine young soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. Just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it.\u201d\n\nAfter the video emerged online, in late August, some liberal columnists were quick to argue that Mattis\u2019s unscripted monologue amounted to a stinging rebuke of Trump\u2019s handling of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., which had descended into riots and death just days earlier. Mattis pushed back emphatically at a news conference, saying that his words were not a critique and that he\u2019d been echoing the president\u2019s own call for unity. But this explanation didn\u2019t quite parse. Mattis\u2019s comments on the Jordan video were not just a bland call for unity. He was clearly suggesting that America had lost its historic \u201cpower of inspiration\u201d as a model of democracy and social tolerance, and the context \u2014 with the country\u2019s four military-service chiefs having just issued unequivocal condemnations of racial bigotry \u2014 gave his words added meaning.\n\nThe Jordan video also yielded a telling phrase \u2014 \u201chold the line\u201d \u2014 that seemed to capture Mattis\u2019s own efforts to balance the chaos of the Trump administration. As always, Mattis preferred to keep his differences with the president private. He had been maintaining a low profile for months, granting no press interviews, where any stray comment could have been used to create a wedge between him and Trump. (Mattis\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment on any conversations between Mattis and the president because of their privileged and confidential nature; a White House spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for comment.) In early October, as a crucial deadline for the Iran deal approached, members of a Senate committee pressed Mattis on whether he believed the Iran deal was in the country\u2019s national security interest. Mattis paused before delivering his verdict. \u201cYes, Senator, I do,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe struggle over the nuclear deal in September and October exposed one of the recurring curiosities of this administration: For all the president\u2019s love of bullying, he seems unable to turn menace into strategic advantage. Trump\u2019s repeated threats to cancel the nuclear deal scared the European leaders who negotiated it with the Obama administration, and some of them expressed a willingness to approve a side agreement addressing Trump\u2019s concerns. \u201cEveryone was looking to placate Trump,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, a former Pentagon official now at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThere was a dialogue that could have been constructive.\u201d In other words, Trump bought himself some useful leverage. But no one in the administration made use of it. No side deal emerged; the deadline came and went. The same pattern has been repeated several times over the course of the past year. Last April, after the administration launched missile strikes on Syrian regime targets in retaliation for the poison-gas attack in Khan Sheikhoun, there was a welcome opportunity to pressure the Syrians and their Russian backers. This was precisely what John Kerry dreamed of during Obama\u2019s final years: a decisive show of force that would create leverage on the diplomatic front. Now Trump had achieved it. A European diplomat told me he spoke to McMaster just after the Syria strike and asked him: \u201cNow you have leverage: What will you do?\u201d McMaster stared back at him blankly, he told me. \u201cFor them, it was not leverage,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt was just a strike.\u201d\n\nThe root of the problem is not a lack of sophistication or experience in Trump\u2019s national security team. It is more basic than that: No one, from Mattis on down, could say what terms the United States would accept in any of these negotiations. And that is because not a single person in the government can confidently say what Trump will say or do tomorrow. This unpredictability came up again and again in my conversations with foreign diplomats. Several of them said it has profoundly rattled governments that have long looked to the United States \u2014 whatever their differences with it \u2014 to abide by its commitments and thereby undergird a wider sense of global order.\n\nUltimately, the Iranian nuclear-deal crisis was averted when Trump reluctantly decided not to void the agreement. He said he would focus (for the moment) on other ways to push back against Iran\u2019s aggressive role in the Middle East, exactly as Mattis, Tillerson and McMaster had been suggesting. But pushing back on Iran is easier said than done, especially when half the government is consumed with reacting to the president\u2019s Twitter feed. The Iranians, meanwhile, had their own plans to extend their control over Iraq. In mid-October, Iranian-backed militia forces helped the Iraqi government recapture the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, driving out America\u2019s most loyal ally in the region, the Iraqi Kurds. The whole thing was stage-managed by Qassim Suleimani, the shadowy commander who runs external operations for Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. The result was a significant coup for Iran, which once again made Iraq\u2019s government look like puppets. The United States, with its foreign service in disarray, was caught off guard. When McMaster heard about the episode, he was so angry that he asked why the United States bothered putting anyone in Iraq at all, a former State Department official told me.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn March 13, hours after learning via Twitter that he\u2019d been fired, Tillerson gave an emotional farewell speech at the State Department. His voice trembling at times, Tillerson spoke of the close working relationship he\u2019d had with Mattis and their shared belief in the importance of diplomacy. \u201cNothing is possible without allies and partners,\u201d he said, with what sounded like a hint of self-vindication and perhaps a warning about the future.\n\nTillerson\u2019s departure will leave Mattis far more isolated, with an incoming secretary of state and a national security adviser who are said to share Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d instincts. The change comes at a time when several global threats are coming to a head. Russia is already attempting to interfere in the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence chiefs, and behaving more aggressively on other fronts as well. Trump has been conspicuously silent on this issue, but Mattis quietly laid out the dangers in his introduction to a new nuclear strategy, leaked in draft form in January and aimed in part at countering Russia. Putin, Mattis wrote, is adopting \u201cmilitary strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success. These developments, coupled with Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow\u2019s unabashed return to Great Power competition.\u201d\n\nA more immediate danger is North Korea. In early August, after Trump and Kim Jong-un began exchanging warlike noises, Mattis and Tillerson responded by writing a joint op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, emphasizing that \u201cdiplomatic and economic pressure\u201d were the administration\u2019s chief tools, not the \u201cfire and fury\u201d Trump had promised. It sounded reassuring. But inside the government, there was widespread alarm. A Senate staff member on the Armed Services Committee told me she called the Pentagon to ask if it was safe for her boss to travel to Seoul. A high-ranking officer told her that \u201cour posture is the same,\u201d she told me. But even Mattis sounded rattled when he gave a news conference on Aug. 14: \u201cWe will defend the country \u2014 hear me now \u2014 we will defend the country from any attack ... at any time, from any quarter. ... But it is not declaring war. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m over here, you know, Dr. Strangelove, you know, doing things like that, O.K.?\u201d\n\nNow Trump is preparing for what promises to be a surreal one-on-one encounter with North Korea\u2019s dictator. He agreed to the meeting \u2014 proposed by a South Korean envoy in the Oval Office \u2014 despite a warning from Mattis and McMaster about the risks. There are many. Kim is unlikely to agree to the kind of \u201cdenuclearization\u201d Trump has in mind without some parallel American concessions. Merely holding the talks is a victory for North Korea, and Trump could come out of them looking like a dupe. Timing is another problem. The next deadline for waiving sanctions against Iran as part of the nuclear deal is also in May, and Mike Pompeo has made clear many times that he sees the deal as a \u201cdisastrous\u201d mistake that should be torn up. If that happens, Iranian officials have said they could start producing enriched uranium within days. The risk of a war between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran, which is already high, might escalate. And the repercussions in Pyongyang would be immediate. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a deal with North Korea, good luck getting it if they see you walking away from a deal you made previously with Iran,\u201d I was told by Andrew Exum, a former Army officer who served in the Pentagon during the Obama administration.\n\nPerhaps the greatest risk of all lies in Trump\u2019s insistence on making everything personal. If he feels slighted by Kim, or senses that his outreach has gone unanswered, anything could happen. Most people, faced with real catastrophe, recoil from the brink. But at least one group of observers is not so sanguine about our prospects. In late January, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved their Doomsday Clock 30 seconds closer to midnight. The scientists believe the planet is closer to nuclear annihilation than at any time since 1953, just after the United States decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.\n\nHow Mattis would reckon with a real impending catastrophe is hard to predict. Over a long career, he has made countless tough decisions but always within a military culture where hierarchy is a given, where obedience is a paramount value. In 2014, Mattis was asked whether there was any order that should cause a four-star general to resign in protest. \u201cHad I ever been asked to do something unethical, immoral,\u201d he said, \u201cof course you would owe it to yourself, you would owe it to your troops. But I think, too, you have to be very careful about doing that. ... Loyalty really counts when there\u2019s a hundred reasons not to be loyal.\u201d The limits of Jim Mattis\u2019s loyalty have yet to be truly tested.", "title": "Can Jim Mattis Hold the Line in Trump\u2019s \u2018War Cabinet\u2019?", "authors": ["Robert F.

Defectors from the North have been known to cite K-pop as one of their inspirations for escaping to the South.\n\nIt seems odd that the autocratic North Korean regime, which has sought to cut off its citizens from what it calls \u201cdecadent capitalism,\u201d is now rolling out the red carpet for these performers.\n\nRed Velvet\u2019s concert in Tokyo, attended mostly by teenage girls, was a nonstop cavalcade of overtly consumerist imagery. The singers enacted a pajama party where they tossed popcorn around a bedroom and sucked on pinwheel lollipops.

Twice during the show, the women boarded carts built to look like circus animal cages and rode through the audience.\n\nPyongyang\u2019s apparent openness to the South Korean performers \u201cis part of this charm offensive to make them seem like a really normal country,\u201d said Jieun Baek, a doctoral candidate in public policy at the University of Oxford and the author of \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s Hidden Revolution.\u201d\n\nWhen K-pop performers went to Pyongyang on several occasions in the early 2000s, the North Korean audiences \u201cpulled faces or were expressionless because they were probably told to react negatively,\u201d said Kang Dong-wan, a professor of North Korean culture and politics at Dong-A University in Busan, South Korea.\n\nBut now that the North has made dramatic advances in its nuclear program, it may even promote the visit as an achievement.\n\n\u201cThe propaganda will say, \u2018The South Korean artists came because we developed our nuclear weapons, and they are here to celebrate our nuclear development,\u2019\u201d said Shim Jin-sup, a retired psychological warfare officer in the South Korean military.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSouth Korea is probably being played by Kim Jong-un, but still, there is nothing to lose,\u201d Mr. Shim added. \u201cSuch cultural exchanges never hurt South Korea in the past.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnalysts say the artists will probably give carefully vetted versions of their usual acts.\n\n\u201cEverything from their costumes to the choreography will be part of the performance negotiations,\u201d said Darcie Draudt, a nonresident Korean studies fellow at the Honolulu-based Pacific Forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nIn an interview on Friday in Seoul at the offices of Mystic Entertainment, a talent agency, Choi Jung-in, 37, an R&B vocalist who is joining the Pyongyang tour, said her agents told her South Korean officials had asked her to sing \u201cUphill Road,\u201d a hit from five years ago, because it \u201cbrought solace to people and touched their hearts.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Choi said she wasn\u2019t thinking much about how the North Korean audience would respond. \u201cThere is no difference between music for propaganda and music for music to enjoy, is there?\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince K-pop performers last went to Pyongyang, North Korean artists themselves have started to emulate their Southern counterparts. North Korea\u2019s Moranbong Band, often said to be Mr. Kim\u2019s favorite girl group, has been known to dance in short skirts and high heels.\n\nStill, some South Korean performers were evidently deemed too risqu\u00e9. Although the South Korean government had hoped to send the global star Psy, the singer of \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d as part of the traveling troupe, the plan did not materialize. A Seoul television channel, MBC, reported that North Korean officials had rejected Psy from the concert lineup.\n\nThe concerts are partly a reciprocal gesture from the South after the North sent cheerleaders and a performance troupe to Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the Winter Olympics in February.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One is his belief, which may give us new steel tariffs, that America is a big loser from the international trade system. Another, which may give us a Trumpian t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Kim Jong-un, is his belief that he alone can solve the problem of nuclear proliferation.\n\nIn 1984, near the peak of Reagan-era nuclear fears, he told The Washington Post that he should lead nuclear deal-making with the Soviets. Six years later, he warned Playboy that \u201cthe greatest of all stupidities is people\u2019s believing [nuclear war] will never happen.\u201d In 1999, flirting with a presidential bid, he promised to \u201cnegotiate like crazy\u201d to prevent North Korea from going nuclear.\n\nNow he gets the chance to actually follow through on these boasts (though the chances of a Kim-Trump summit actually coming off are perhaps still somewhat modest). And as with many problems to which Trump is getting the chance to turn his hand, one can doubt his competence and judgment while also doubting the perfect wisdom of the approaches that preceded him.\n\nThe dilemma facing American policymakers since the Cold War is that you can have a denuclearizing world or you can have a world where liberal values are always on the march \u2014 but you can\u2019t necessarily have both. We have failed to strike a lasting deal with the North Koreans because they are duplicitous and wicked, certainly.

Another former president, Ollanta Humala, is behind bars pending charges of corruption. And Mr. Fujimori\u2019s daughter, Keiko, whose party, Popular Force, holds the majority in Congress and has been instrumental in driving Mr. Kuczynski from office, is under investigation for corruption and money laundering. She also wants to be president and was only narrowly defeated by Mr. Kuczynski in 2016.\n\nShould we despair? I don\u2019t think so, because in the past 25 years the country has actually made great progress. It ended an internal war against the terrorist group Shining Path, settled conflicts with its neighbors, overcame hyperinflation, became a relatively stable democracy and, despite its current predicament, achieved economic growth and reduced poverty.\n\nSo why has eradicating corruption proved so difficult? The recipes for good governance and anticorruption strategies have long been known, but enforcement has dismally failed.\n\nA crucial issue is that the lack of control of illegal and foreign financing of presidential elections combined with extremely weak party structures have turned campaigns into an easy way for adventurous newcomers to become millionaires even before reaching power. Presidential candidates in Peru have been financed by Venezuela and Brazil, and the funding from the latter came linked to allocating huge public infrastructure contracts to previously handpicked Brazilian construction firms. With such a system in place, little wonder Peruvians continue to elect thieves as presidents.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve been here before. Venality was widespread in the 1990s under Mr. Fujimori, when his top adviser, the infamous head of the secret services Vladimiro Montesinos, corrupted the whole spectrum of Peruvian society, bribing politicians, bankers, entrepreneurs, judges, military officers and journalists, videotaping them in the act, building grotesque pyramids of cash as he carried out extortions. When the tapes were shown on prime-time TV, a governmental commission with respected figures was created to design a thorough and vigorous strategy to fight corruption.\n\nIronically, it was Mr. Toledo, a candidate running on a banner of eradicating corruption, who even before becoming president stole campaign money given to him by George Soros. He then asked Odebrecht\u2019s chief executive in Peru for a $35 million bribe \u2014 he got only $20 million \u2014 and set up fresh machinery for graft.\n\nAs finance minister and prime minister a decade ago in Mr. Toledo\u2019s government, Mr. Kuczynski was in charge of overseeing a system that resulted in overpriced public projects. Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s firm had contracts with Odebrecht while he was a public servant.\n\nWhat next? It is not clear whether Mr. Kuczynski will face charges. But he is under investigation and a judge has ordered that he not be allowed to leave Peru and granted a search warrant for his three houses in Lima. His successor, Mr. Vizcarra, who has an untarnished public record, will face public pressure to put an effective anticorruption strategy into effect.", "title": "Opinion | Can Peru\u2019s Democracy Survive Corruption?", "authors": []}

Or maybe it was this month\u2019s Facebook privacy scandal, which reminded you that you\u2019ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit-maximizing surveillance machine.\n\nOur growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls. One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies \u2014 Facebook, Twitter and Google, which shares a parent company with YouTube \u2014 are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago. (And Americans might be the lucky ones. Outside the United States, social media is fueling real-world violence and empowering autocrats, often with much less oversight.)\n\nBut it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way. The original dream of social media \u2014 producing healthy discussions, unlocking new forms of creativity, connecting people to others with similar interests \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders. And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks. The West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike and last weekend\u2019s March for Our Lives, for example, were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe primary problem with today\u2019s social networks is that they\u2019re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can\u2019t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can\u2019t stop selling coffee \u2014 it\u2019s the heart of the enterprise.\n\nMany of the fixes being proposed involve regulation.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "In 2012, still barred from running for office, L\u00f3pez threw his support behind an opposition candidate in the presidential election. Ch\u00e1vez beat that candidate by a 10-point margin but died soon after, opening the door for a repeat campaign against Maduro. When the electoral board announced that Maduro had won by a single percentage point, L\u00f3pez suspected fraud. He pushed for the opposition movement to stage a public demonstration. Most of the other opposition leaders dismissed the idea, but in January 2014, L\u00f3pez called for his supporters to take the streets.\n\nBy February, protests were springing up in every province. On Feb. 12, L\u00f3pez rallied thousands of students at the edge of a park in Caracas. After his speech, they marched to the office of the attorney general a mile away. Some of the protesters began throwing rocks at the building. Security officers emerged, and two protesters were shot. Though L\u00f3pez was gone before the violence began, officials accused him of being the \u201cintellectual author\u201d of the skirmish, and the attorney general issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nL\u00f3pez and Tintori took refuge that night in a friend\u2019s apartment. They recorded a video message for the public. \u201cI want to say to all Venezuelans that I do not repent,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. He spent a few days in hiding, then recorded another video asking his supporters to gather at a downtown plaza on Feb. 18, dressed in white as a sign of peace, to bear witness as he turned himself in.\n\nThat morning, he climbed on a motorcycle and rode into the city. A large crowd was gathering, and the police had set up checkpoints to intercept him. L\u00f3pez tried to find a way around the checkpoints but couldn\u2019t. He finally rode up to a cluster of police officers from the Chacao district and removed his helmet. The officers recognized him, saluted and waved him through. L\u00f3pez saw the crowd extending in every direction. Thousands upon thousands of people had come dressed in white. He waded through them to a statue of the Cuban independence hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and climbed the pedestal to look over the sea of faces. Someone handed him a megaphone, and he raised it. \u201cIf my imprisonment helps to awaken a people,\u201d he called out, \u201cthen it will be worth the infamous imprisonment imposed on me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a short speech, he climbed down from the pedestal, where soldiers were waiting to arrest him. They pulled him inside an armored vehicle, but the crowd pressed in, rocking it. Minutes passed, then half an hour. The truck was trapped by the crowd. Someone gave L\u00f3pez a handset connected to the vehicle\u2019s outside speakers. He called to the crowd that he was safe and that they should clear a way for the truck to get through. Slowly, almost grudgingly, they parted the path for L\u00f3pez to prison.\n\nPhoto\n\nOfficials placed L\u00f3pez in a concrete tower on a military base outside the city, charging him with terrorism, arson and homicide. Amnesty International condemned his prosecution as \u201can affront to justice\u201d and \u201ca politically motivated attempt to silence dissent.\u201d For his initial arraignment, he was taken from his cell in the middle of the night and marched outside to face a judge on a bus. The rest of the proceedings took place at the Palace of Justice in Caracas, a five-story edifice that sprawls across 1.5 million square feet downtown. Over the next 19 months, he traveled there nearly 100 times, in a motorcade of armored S.U.V.s, wearing a bulletproof vest, with his hands shackled together, wedged between two guards armed with machine guns and two more behind him. Each time L\u00f3pez appeared in court, the Palace of Justice shut down.\n\nThe trial hinged on speech. No one accused L\u00f3pez of being violent himself. Prosecutors scaled back the charges, arguing that he inspired violence in others. They brought in a linguistic expert to examine transcripts of his speeches and claimed that his message of peaceful protest disguised a \u201csubliminal\u201d call to violence. They introduced more than 100 witnesses, some of whom testified that they had received the subliminal messages. L\u00f3pez tried to introduce his own witnesses, but the judge wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nA few words about the judge who signed his arrest warrant and a lead prosecutor and attorney general: They all repent. The judge who signed the warrant later admitted that she had been forced to do so. The lead prosecutor, after fleeing the country, denounced the case against L\u00f3pez as \u201ca farce,\u201d saying \u201c100 percent of the investigation was invented.\u201d The attorney general, Luisa Ortega, escaped to Colombia last summer and says that the vice president of Maduro\u2019s party instructed her to pursue L\u00f3pez. I tracked Ortega down a few weeks ago, and we met for coffee in Bogot\u00e1. When I asked her about the criminal charges against L\u00f3pez, she shook her head in dismay. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez is a political prisoner.\u201d\n\nOrtega told me it had been illegal to hold a civilian like L\u00f3pez in a military prison. Over the course of three years, his conditions grew progressively worse. In the early stage, he was allowed to read and write, and a local university devised a program of study. He read Venezuelan poets, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the diary of Ho Chi Minh and a biography of Nguyen Van Thuan. He was consuming several volumes a week, until officials began to restrict what he could read. Eventually, they prohibited everything except the Bible. He read it from Genesis to Revelation. Then they took the Bible, too.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was moved to a new cell, then another. He spent months in solitary confinement in a room that was six feet by 10 feet. He would sit in silence trying to pray or meditate and summon any possible reason for gratitude: that he could feel himself breathing; that his wife and children were safe; that through the window he could hear the commotion of the outside world \u2014 a passing truck, a twisting wind, some emphatic bird.\n\nWithout his books, he reflected on those he had read. He remembered biographies of nonviolent leaders and the Birmingham letter from King, and he began to wonder if what they had in common wasn\u2019t just a commitment to resistance but some deeper observation about the character of history. This came through most clearly in King. His goal was never just to provoke or confront. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between conflict and mediation \u2014 to produce an onslaught of pressure that forced officials to react while preserving an almost irrational faith in their capacity for good will.\n\n\u201cI had an illumination moment,\u201d L\u00f3pez recalled. \u201cOne night, I couldn\u2019t sleep, and I was tossing from one side of the bed to the other, thinking about the son-of-a-bitch director of the prison. I was very, very angry, and I woke up the next morning, and I said: \u2018What am I doing? This guy is taking away my tranquillity, my sleep.\u2019 \u201d He realized that the buildup of anger threatened to distort his thinking. He began trying to separate his outrage from his fury. He continued to defy the arbitrary rules of prison \u2014 composing and smuggling a stream of subversive messages to the outside \u2014 but when the guards would charge into his cell to look for contraband, shouting and tearing through his things, he searched for calm. He would stand back, lifting his hands in a posture of self-defense and say in the most measured tone he could muster that he would protect himself if necessary. In the hours between, the interminable stretches of solitude, he tried to be honest with himself about what anger had cost him. It wasn\u2019t just a threat to his state of mind but to his politics, his movement and the way he conceived the future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn the past, I was in confrontation with different views,\u201d he told me. \u201cNow I understand that everybody is needed in order to reach a way out of this disaster.\u201d He thought of books he had read on postwar Europe and the South African emergence from apartheid, and he realized that Venezuela would never find stability if it were cleaved into disparate sectors. It would be necessary to forge, like Mandela with F.W. de Klerk or King with Lyndon Johnson, some tentative confianza between the opposition and supporters of chavismo. \u201cA lot of people in the opposition have resentment, and I understand that,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I think our responsibility is to move beyond the personal resentment. Four years in prison have given me the possibility of seeing things a different way, of putting rage in its perspective.\u201d\n\nA few nights ago, I was speaking with L\u00f3pez a little before midnight. His family was asleep, and in the quiet hours he was bracing for the possibility that appearing in these pages could trigger his return to prison. This was something we had talked about many times. His eldest daughter was a toddler when he first went to prison and is now a little girl. His son had been less than a year old and was just now getting to know his father. At the end of January, L\u00f3pez and Tintori had a second daughter, and it troubled him to think that years could pass before he saw any of his children again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but I have the responsibility to speak my mind. I\u2019ve been in prison four years now because of speaking my mind, and if I self-censor, I\u2019m beaten by the dictatorship.\u201d L\u00f3pez said he still believed that with the right leadership, Venezuela could rebound. He thought of postwar Japan and South Korea and Europe. He knew that stabilizing the bol\u00edvar could be accomplished by attaching its value to a foreign currency, and that under a new government, the private sector would return. He believed the country\u2019s oil production would recover under good management, and he had been working for nearly a decade on a plan to convert the national oil company into a kind of Social Security trust, with investment shares assigned to the public for retirement, education and emergencies.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe challenge was to reach a point where any of that work could begin. As the crisis in Venezuela deepened, the path to a transition seemed more obscure than ever. Politicians, historians, think-tank pontificators \u2014 everyone had some sort of proposal, but the problem, if you studied each of them, was that none had very much chance of happening, or of working.\n\nStart with the Trump administration, which has lately suggested a military coup. Speaking in February, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mused that in a situation like Venezuela\u2019s, \u201cit\u2019s the military that handles that,\u201d to which Senator Marco Rubio later added on Twitter that the Venezuelan military should \u201crestore democracy by removing a dictator.\u201d Apart from the obvious fact that removing a dictator is no guarantee of democracy, there aren\u2019t many people in Venezuela who consider a coup likely. A few weeks ago, I met up with the leader installed by the last military coup, Pedro Carmona, who told me the military has been purged of dissent, with senior officers monitored for ideological purity by the Cuban intelligence service. \u201cThe G2 has a facility in Caracas, spying on the Venezuelan military,\u201d he said. \u201cSo on the military side, the best I could hope would be for them not to repress the people.\u201d\n\nPressure from outside Venezuela has also been slow to coalesce. Critics accuse the members of the Organization of American States of failing to constrain the Maduro government, which showers oil bounty on several member nations. A smaller coalition of Latin American countries has joined with Canada to create the Lima Group, whose vociferous condemnation of the political repression has not converted to much concrete action. American sanctions have been steadily tightening in recent years. After a protracted debate between the National Security Council and the State Department, the Obama administration imposed limited sanctions in 2015, primarily targeting the financial assets of individual Venezuelan leaders. Mark Feierstein, who assumed responsibility for N.S.C. policy in the Western Hemisphere later that year, told me the administration had missed a critical opportunity to influence a 2016 negotiation between the Maduro government and the opposition. \u201cThe N.S.C., or at least I, was inclined to move more quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think the negotiations largely failed because pressure was taken off.\u201d The Trump administration has expanded the sanctions program, but how far to deepen sanctions, or expand them, or restrict the import of Venezuelan oil, is a brutal calculation about how much of the burden would be carried by the Venezuelan people, and whether adding to their misery is more likely to inspire an uprising or simply worsen the humanitarian disaster.\n\nIn recent months, there has also been rumbling about war. Trump has made oblique suggestions of a \u201cmilitary option\u201d in Caracas, and even relatively moderate voices have begun to fantasize about cavalry. In January, the Harvard scholar Ricardo Hausmann, who served as Venezuela\u2019s minister of planning from 1992 to 1993, published a proposal suggesting that the Legislature invite a multilateral invasion force to help support a new government, making a comparison to the liberation of Europe. I spoke with several opposition leaders who welcome this idea, but this might say more about the country\u2019s desperation than the wisdom of the proposal. It\u2019s difficult to imagine Russia and China, after years of propping up the Venezuelan economy in exchange for oil, allowing a foreign invasion to threaten their investment. An even greater concern is internal: Maduro is polling at about 30 percent approval in a devastated economy, but nothing would rally former chavistas to his side like an occupying army. Venezuela is a heavily armed society and increasingly violent. To invite a military intervention is to welcome civil war.\n\nA few months ago, it was possible to imagine an electoral path to change, but today nearly all the opposition parties have been disqualified from running. On the evening of Feb. 15, Maduro took this a step further, interrupting television and radio broadcasts to announce that the party L\u00f3pez founded in 2009 is not a political organization but a \u201cviolent fascist group\u201d operating \u201coutside the law.\u201d When I spoke with L\u00f3pez the next morning, he said that 87 party leaders were already in prison. Those who remained were preparing to convert the party into a \u201cclandestine organization.\u201d Soon, he said, they could be reduced to secret meetings and tossing pamphlets on street corners from unmarked vans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even as conditions spiraled down, I watched L\u00f3pez try to incorporate what he learned in prison to daily life. Unable to speak publicly, he developed a network of private channels \u2014 reconnecting with leaders of the political parties from which he\u2019d split, making inroads with members of the Maduro government and with foreign ministers and heads of state. During the recent negotiation between opposition leaders and the government, L\u00f3pez was in contact with all sides; even after his party withdrew from the dialogue, he continued to consult with leaders who remained at the table. When disputes spilled over among them, he provided a back channel, an invisible hub to which it seemed as if all spokes connected.\n\nL\u00f3pez was also flexible in his thinking about transition. Through most of our conversations, he strongly opposed the idea of military action, but when we spoke late the other night, he said he was beginning to think differently. An unwelcome mechanism can bring welcome change.\n\n\u201cIn 1958, there was a military coup that began the transition to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in other Latin American countries, there have been coups that called elections. So I don\u2019t want to rule anything out, because the electoral window has been closed. We need to go forward on many different levels. One is street demonstrations; a second is coordination with the international community. But this is how I\u2019m thinking now: We need to increase all forms of pressure. Anything, anything that needs to happen to produce a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nIf it was jarring to hear this from L\u00f3pez, it was matched by another development. For several months, the secret police had been coming to his front door about four times a day to photograph him with a copy of the day\u2019s newspaper. Lately, L\u00f3pez had begun to invite the agents in. He had recently spoken with one for more than two hours, offering him a slice of cake from his daughter\u2019s birthday and talking about the inflation crisis and the recent massacre of a small rebel group. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say a good relationship, but a relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nThinking about these developments together, it seemed to me that L\u00f3pez was trying to strike an increasingly difficult balance. He was willing to entertain proposals that he found abhorrent six months ago, but he was also making a greater effort to open the door for dialogue. The struggle he faced was a heightened version of the tension in all history. It was to locate the elusive fulcrum between his rage and faith.", "title": "Can Venezuela Be Saved?", "authors": ["Wil S. Hylton"]}

With that in mind, I plan to meet Jeff Fillion, among the most polarizing radio talk show hosts in the province, and to see for myself why he both attracts and repels so many people.\n\nSeveral readers also suggested I meet more leading women of the province. As part of my trip, I now plan to meet in Montreal with Phyllis Lambert, who at 91 is still one of the city\u2019s most important civic leaders, an architect and philanthropist. Her father, Samuel Bronfman, built Seagram into the world\u2019s biggest distiller.\n\nMs. Lambert, who is known as Montreal\u2019s \u201cJoan of Architecture,\u201d founded the pioneering Canadian Center for Architecture and played a leading role in commissioning Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to build the towering Seagram headquarters in New York in the 1950s. The building became a memorable emblem of modernism. She also has shaped the architecture of contemporary Montreal like few others.\n\nI also hope to have a laughter-fueled drink with Mariana Mazza, a 27-year-old whose boisterous energy and blunt humor has made her one-woman show, \u201cFemme Ta Guele,\u201d a hit at comedy festivals and beyond. Her subjects include her embrace of celibacy and her relationship to masturbation. Born in Quebec to a Lebanese mother and a Uruguayan father, Ms. Mazza\u2019s multicultural background in many ways embodies contemporary Quebec.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany readers suggested that any road trip through Quebec would be incomplete without examining the state of the contemporary Catholic church. During the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, Quebecers revolted against the domination of the church, and this secular streak has formed an important part of Quebec identity. With that in mind, I plan to visit a slew of cathedrals across the province, including a church in Montreal that has been converted into a sports club (I work out there!).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso high on peoples\u2019 lists was a request for me to go to a sugar shack and sample some maple syrup. It doesn\u2019t get more Quebecois than that. With that in mind, I am planning to make a pilgrimage to Martin Picard\u2019s Cabane A Sucre Au Pied De Cochon, in Mirabel, outside Montreal, where this enfant terrible of Quebecois cuisine conjures artery-hardening dishes inspired by maple syrup \u2014 all washed down, of course, with a good Burgundy wine. Dinners have been known to start with foie gras cake.\n\nA big merci for your suggestions for my road trip playlist. They have been wonderfully diverse, from the plaintive love ballads of Richard Desjardins to the hip-hop tunes of Quebecois band Dead Obies, who rap in Franglais, a mix of English and French that is oh so Quebecois. Other names that came up repeatedly were Coeur de Pirate, Arcade Fire and, of course, Leonard Cohen, whose cultural sway in Montreal I recently explored in a story. I am still making my way through the suggestions and will come up with the finalists.\n\nI will also keep you posted as things take shape.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Some publishing houses have reacted swiftly to sexual misconduct charges. In October, Penguin Press quickly scrapped a forthcoming book on the 2016 election by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, co-authors of the best-selling political tell-alls \u201cGame Change\u201d and \u201cDouble Down,\u201d after it emerged that Mr. Halperin had sexually harassed multiple women at ABC News, where he oversaw political coverage years ago. (Mr. Heilemann has said in a radio interview that he hopes to revive the project on his own.)\n\nOther publishers have issued bland statements \u2014 or taken no action at all. Henry Holt & Company has continued to publish Bill O\u2019Reilly following a New York Times report that Mr. O\u2019Reilly settled claims by multiple women who accused him of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. Mr. O\u2019Reilly was fired by Fox News, and last fall, his literary agent, William Morris Endeavor, said it would \u201cno longer represent Bill O\u2019Reilly for future deals.\u201d But Holt has so far remained steadfast in its support of Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whose best-selling \u201cKilling\u201d series has more than 17 million copies in circulation. Its fall 2018 catalog lists an untitled book by Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201cThe corporate stance is that it\u2019s not our job to judge our authors,\u201d Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher of Holt, told The Times in a recent interview.\n\nThe disparate responses underscore the commercial and ethical challenges publishing houses face. Some, including Hachette Book Group, are expanding the use of morals clauses and \u201cauthor conduct\u201d clauses in book contracts, which allow publishers to cancel book deals if the author is credibly accused of unethical behavior. But some editors and publishers say privately that it\u2019s difficult to impose a code of conduct on writers, who are not their employees.\n\nIn an industry that is overwhelmingly female \u2014 women account for around 80 percent of people who work in publishing \u2014 publishers may also face pressure from within their own ranks to take a firm stance against sexual harassment.\n\nLast month, when the novelist Anne Ursu published an article on Medium about sexual harassment in the children\u2019s book world, it set off a cascade of online accusations against prominent authors, many made anonymously. Ms. Ursu said she has been in touch around 100 women in the industry who have experienced some form of harassment.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI was very saddened to see how many women had left the industry or quit writing or quit illustrating because of something that had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are losing talent because of this, and we need to find a way to privilege the women who have been hurt over the men who make publishing houses a lot of money.\u201d\n\nAfter Ms. Ursu\u2019s article sparked an outpouring of allegations, the fallout was swift for several best-selling authors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBallantine, a Random House imprint, canceled a contract for an adult novel by James Dashner, after multiple women accused Mr. Dashner of harassment. Mr. Dashner is one of the industry\u2019s most successful young adult novelists: His dystopian series \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d has sold more than 14 million copies across all formats. Mr. Dashner, who apologized for his behavior, was also dropped by his agent.\n\nAnother blockbuster author, Jay Asher, whose young adult novel \u201cThirteen Reasons Why\u201d has more than four million copies in print, was let go by his agent following a chorus of online accusations that he had harassed women and behaved in a predatory manner at an annual industry conference.

The American Indian Library Association withdrew an award that it gave to Mr. Alexie in 2008 for his young adult novel \u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\u201d Mr. Alexie also declined to accept the 2018 Andrew Carnegie Medal for nonfiction for his memoir, which was given to him last month by the American Library Association.\n\nOn his website, Mr. Alexie expressed regret for his actions but also sounded defiant, writing that he rejects \u201cthe accusations, insinuations and outright falsehoods\u201d made by a woman he said he had a consensual affair with and who accused him online of being a serial predator.\n\nGrove Atlantic and Hachette Book Group, which both publish Mr. Alexie\u2019s books, issued statements saying that they were surprised and troubled by the accusations, but that they will continue to publish his earlier books.\n\nPublishers face complex calculations as they weigh whether or not to cut ties with an author. Canceling a book can lead to lost profits, but publishing and promoting a book by an author accused of misconduct can have other negative ramifications.\n\nAfter the recent rash of allegations against prominent authors, Jamie Thomas, a manager and children\u2019s book buyer at the bookstore Women & Children First in Chicago, removed books by Mr. Asher, Mr. Dashner and Mr. Alexie from the store\u2019s shelves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have our customers having to come in here and ask why we\u2019re supporting someone accused of sexual misconduct,\u201d she said.\n\nDanielle Foster, the co-owner of Bookworks in Albuquerque, said that she will not reorder books by Mr. Alexie and will instead be featuring works by up-and-coming Native American authors. Still, she is wary of limiting customers\u2019 access to books by popular writers and said the store still has \u201cmany books on our shelves by accused authors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese discussions need to happen among booksellers and publishers, and at the same time, do you censor the art?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the stance that we don\u2019t want to censor or ban anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut at a moment of heightened scrutiny, some publishers are willing to sacrifice worthwhile books \u2014 and lose money \u2014 to signal their support for the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cApparently no industry is exempt from the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and misogyny,\u201d said Yolanda Scott, the associate publisher and editorial director of Charlesbridge, which destroyed finished copies of the picture book \u201cMario and the Hole in the Sky\u201d after harassment allegations against its illustrator surfaced. \u201cWe want the children\u2019s publishing world to be a safe and equitable space.\u201d\n\nThough finished copies had already gone out to book critics and pulling it at such a late stage was costly, Charlesbridge decided publishing the book with Mr. Diaz\u2019s name and illustrations might dampen enthusiasm for the title from readers, reviewers, librarians and booksellers. The company, now searching for a new illustrator, has pushed the publication to 2019.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Diaz acknowledged that he made flirtatious comments and advances at a conference hosted by the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators and that he had gone through harassment training after the society\u2019s board received a complaint about his behavior in 2012. He also went through a probation period where his conduct was regularly reviewed. When a separate allegation arose in the fall of 2017 about a sexual comment that Mr. Diaz made to a woman at a conference five years earlier, before his harassment training, Mr. Diaz voluntarily resigned from the board and apologized to the woman who made the complaint.\n\n\u201cIt stings a little bit, knowing the work that I\u2019ve done, but I support their choice,\u201d Mr. Diaz said about Charlesbridge\u2019s decision to withdraw the book with his illustrations. \u201cIf I were the author, I would want my book to have every chance at success, without anything attached to it that might hinder it.\u201d", "title": "Canceled Deals and Pulped Books, as the Publishing Industry Confronts Sexual Harassment", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"]}

Sports bankers said the Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints and Tennessee Titans could change hands in the next few years.\n\nWhile bidders have emerged for the Panthers, several of them appear unwilling to pay far more than what they believe to be the fair price \u2014 around $2.3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the process.\n\nSo far, there are six bidders, according to a person with knowledge of the process, though only four are publicly known. David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management and a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Michael Rubin, the chairman of Fanatics, the sports merchandise company; and Ben Navarro, who owns Sherman Financial Group, an investment firm, have each made bids to buy the team. The three offers were between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the bids who could not publicly discuss the auction.\n\nAlan Kestenbaum, the chief executive of Bedrock Industries, which owns and operates metal and mining companies, has also bid, though it\u2019s unclear at what price.\n\nThe sale of the team has been a point of focus at the N.F.L. owners meeting here. Representatives from the 32 teams were briefed on the auction on Monday. They were told that a winning bid could be selected by the end of April. Assuming the prospective owner survives due diligence, the owners could vote on that bid at their next meeting in Atlanta in late May. At least 24 owners have to approve a buyer before the transaction can be completed.\n\nRichardson, who has taken a less active role in league proceedings in recent years, has not attended the meetings here. A team spokesman, Steven Drummond, declined to comment on the potential sale of the Panthers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.\n\nCertain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.\n\nWhile both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.\n\nRepresentatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.\n\nAt the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.\n\nNavarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.\n\nAmong other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.\n\nAdditionally, Sherman Financial also owns about half of a joint venture with the Chedraui family in Mexico that provides similar lending services. The company, Consupago, offers loans that are among the most expensive in Mexico to a captive market of government employees.\n\nOn Sunday, Bob McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans, voiced support for Navarro. He cited his philanthropic giving and said he had no issue with his line of work. \u201cHis business is a legitimate business,\u201d McNair told reporters. \u201cFor me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d", "title": "Carolina Panthers Headed Toward Record Sale Price", "authors": ["Ken Belson"]}

(Mr. Ailes died in May.)\n\nMs. Carlson, 51, is the author of the best-selling book \u201cBe Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back.\u201d A former Miss America, she was named chairwoman of the Miss America board of directors in January. The previous chairman and other leaders of the organization resigned in December, after emails surfaced that showed leaders of the organization making derogatory remarks about the physical appearance, intelligence and sex lives of past pageant winners. The day before we met, Ms. Carlson joined Norman Lear and others as an executive producer of \u201cAmerica Divided\u201d on Epix, for which she will produce and appear in a program about sexual harassment.\n\nOver afternoon coffees and a shared fruit plate at the Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan, the pair \u2014 both Minnesotans \u2014 discussed the waves of women who have come forward with their own stories in the past year (and why it took so long for them to do so), whether the workplace has been altered in meaningful and sustained ways, and whether Miss America can be relevant in the #MeToo era.\n\nPhilip Galanes Kitty, you were a law student, just a kid in your 20s, when you developed the claim for sexual harassment. Was there a flash of inspiration?\n\nPhoto\n\nCatharine MacKinnon Sexual harassment was \u201cjust life,\u201d as Gloria Steinem put it. For a couple thousand years, women put up with sexual pressure they were not in a position to refuse. In the mid-\u201970s, I was a graduate student at Yale, and among the things I did to make money was play music with a friend. We went around to schools, and we gave a concert at the Cornell Women\u2019s Center. I signed up for their newsletter, and I received one that told the story of a woman named Carmita Wood. Carmita had been working at Cornell for a man who continually pressured her in a sexual way. He was ogling her; he was looking up her skirt at the file cabinet; he was bumping into her in the elevator and pushing her in sexual ways. And the stress produced physical illness. She had to be hospitalized. But when she went to the unemployment board for compensation, they said she couldn\u2019t because she left her job for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d When I read that, it exploded in my brain! I remember it to this day: \u201cNow this is what sexual discrimination is about.\u201d\n\n\u2018I Blamed Myself. I Felt Guilty.\u2019\n\nPG Gretchen, flash forward 15 years, when you enter the work force. Was sexual inequality a concern of yours?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGretchen Carlson I was brought up in a strong family in Minnesota. My parents told me every day that with hard work, I could do anything I wanted. I was a gifted violinist and a good student, and I worked incredibly hard. So, when I graduated from Stanford, the idea that women were not equal to men was a new concept to me.\n\nPG First job?\n\nGC At an ABC-TV affiliate in Richmond, Va. And one of my first stories was covering Anita Hill [who accused Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment].\n\nCM I did commentary with Tom Brokaw from beginning to end on that. We were out there in parallel on that one.\n\nGC I believed her, and I was blown away that other people didn\u2019t, primarily the members of Congress, all men, who were interrogating her. Then I went out on another story, a month later, with a cameraman from my station. We got into the car in a rural part of the state \u2014 this was before cellphones \u2014 and he started asking me if I\u2019d loved it when he touched my breasts when he put the microphones on me. It went downhill from there. I kept pressing myself against the passenger door, and I actually wondered how much it would hurt if I opened the door and rolled out, like they do in the movies.\n\nPG How did you handle it?\n\nGC I did what many women do: I blamed myself. I felt guilty.\n\nPG Kitty, explain this to me. Women make up half the world. How do we make them feel ashamed of the lousy things men do?\n\nCM It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. No, I would just say it is socially the case in societies of male dominance.\n\nGC And that wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. I had two sexual assault experiences when I was Miss America, by two top television executives who attacked me in cars.\n\nPG Because they thought Miss America would be a bimbo?\n\nGC I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with Miss America. They assaulted me because I was a woman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCM You were there; they could.\n\nGC The first man helped me all day, making calls to help me break into the television business. I was so proud of myself for cold-calling him and asking for help. Then we were riding in the back of his car, and he was all over me \u2014 his tongue down my throat. I didn\u2019t realize that getting into TV meant him getting into my pants. In the second incident, the perpetrator took my neck in his hand and shoved my face into his crotch so hard I couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut you know what\u2019s amazing? I never called them \u201cassaults\u201d until after my experience at Fox News. I was interviewing women for my book, and one of them said: \u201cYou realize that\u2019s assault, right?\u201d I was like: No! This is what women have been socialized to do: think we can overcome it by working just a little harder.\n\nCM And part of it is: Don\u2019t let this get in your way. Push it aside. Get past it.\n\n\u2018It Did Not Kill Me. I\u2019m Right Here.\u2019\n\nPG I watched clips of you on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d Gretchen. I also read your book and heard your TED Talk. That second woman is much smarter than the one I watched on Fox News. Was that part of your job, in bare legs and high heels: to check your I.Q. at the door? To make the guys on the couch with you feel more comfortable?\n\nGC No, my thought process was that I was the only journalist on that couch. I was doing the best job I could every day, and doing the best interviews amid tremendous chaos.\n\nPG Kitty, when you were at Yale, you were unquestionably the most popular professor with students. You invented the legal claim for sexual harassment; your work was hugely influential. And yet you wandered in the desert as a visiting professor for 15 years before you were offered a tenured position. Did that kill you?\n\nCM [Laughing.] It did not kill me. I am right here. I just kept doing what I did. But let\u2019s get realistic: What people do is trim their sails in terms of content. They don\u2019t tell the truth about what\u2019s really happening to women, for example, so they get the job. It never occurred to me to do that. And even though I didn\u2019t get the jobs, there continued to be major fights about appointing me for two decades. The big exception was Michigan, a great school, which offered me a position with tenure. Wandering in the desert, as you put it, was my tenure process. And it turns out, in many of those years, I was the most frequently cited scholar writing in English on law. But nobody knew that because the studies hadn\u2019t been done yet.\n\nPG Let\u2019s turn to #MeToo. Kitty\u2019s been pushing for 40 years. Gretchen topples Roger Ailes in 2016. Why does sexual harassment only go viral with Harvey Weinstein last year?\n\nGC Since I lived it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s because people saw consequences in my story. I didn\u2019t jump off the cliff and disappear. People saw that the perpetrator was brought down in short order. And when I started hearing from other women, thousands of them, they said two things: First, thank you for being a voice for the voiceless. Because the women who had come forward, their lives were in tatters. They were all fired, and never worked in their chosen profession again. That\u2019s outrageous! And second, they felt a sense of victory through me \u2014 even though they personally may not have won. That encouraged other women to say: \u201cWow! They believed her. I\u2019m going to come forward, too.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

A lot of people woke up to the reality of sex inequality because of that election. They also saw someone who admitted being something of a perpetrator get elected to the presidency, as if it didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGC The number-one question I get is: How can the president of the United States have these accusations against him and still be in power?\n\nCM And there be no consequences.\n\nPG Other than possibly fanning #MeToo?\n\nGC I do think it played into women deciding they were going to have a voice on this issue and others.\n\nCM Women have talked to each other about this issue forever. But the media\u2019s reporting it, and staying on it, is an amazing credit to journalists. They discovered that this is a story with legs. It matters, and it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s not just for the latest iteration of the women\u2019s page. It\u2019s in sports, politics, business, tech. Now that they\u2019ve discovered the abuse is everywhere, they can cover it everywhere. It also means that men in power \u2014 generally white men, wealthy men \u2014 can\u2019t afford to ignore it, which they\u2019d always been able to do before. Now it\u2019s going to cost them \u2014 their customers, their advertisers \u2014 in a way that\u2019s going to bring them down. Before, it was easy to get rid of the women.

The members also challenged his decision to forgo testing the question\u2019s wording, saying it reflected different motivations and uses in the American Community Survey \u2014 including a reference to United States territories that would appear \u201cpuzzling\u201d on the 2020 census.\n\nThe last-minute decision to include the citizenship question prevented the bureau from putting it on its only full trial run of the head count, which began this month in Providence County, R.I. The panel urged the bureau to immediately begin testing the language of the query, saying that in the current charged atmosphere surrounding foreign-born residents, the question could lead respondents to misstate or avoid answering other questions about race and ethnicity.\n\nThe committee worried as well that whatever citizenship data the bureau collected might inadvertently compromise the confidentiality of those who provided it. Federal law bars the bureau from releasing any information that specifically identifies respondents, and the bureau\u2019s record of keeping data private is spotless. But the only citizenship data that is currently collected, from the American Community Survey, is aggregated into large parcels called census block groups.\n\nIn contrast, citizenship data collected in 2020 will be reported down to the bureau\u2019s smallest geographic unit, called census blocks, which can be as small as an apartment building.

But the threat of more Japanese investment led Congress to pass the Exon-Florio Amendment in 1988, granting the president the ability to stop a foreign acquisition if there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that a \u201cforeign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.\u201d\n\nCfius was empowered with reviewing mergers for potential threats.\n\nChina is a frequent element in the deals Cfius reviews\n\nCfius reviews deals across a variety of industries and companies from dozens of different countries. It has often set its sites on deals involving Chinese companies, as the country\u2019s economic might has grown in recent years. From 2013 to 2015, the latest years for which the committee has made data public, about 20 percent of the deals that Cfius reviewed involved investors from China.\n\nAmong the notable recent reviews were:\n\nMONEYGRAM \u2014 ANT FINANCIAL Ant Financial, a Chinese electronic payments company, wanted to purchase MoneyGram, a money transfer company based in Dallas, for $1.2 billion. But the deal collapsed in January after both sides said Cfius refused to approve it. The collapse came despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese tycoon who controls Ant Financial, who had visited President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower and pledged to create one million American jobs. But he could not overcome the Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisition of American know-how. CANYON BRIDGE CAPITAL \u2014 LATTICE Canyon Bridge Capital, a private equity firm, wanted to acquire Lattice, a chip maker based in Portland, Ore. Canyon Bridge received investment from a group that included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by Chinese government-backed organizations. Lattice said Cfius objected to the deal, and the company tried to appeal to the president, offering to resolve national security concerns. But Mr. Trump formally blocked the deal in September 2017, prompting China\u2019s commerce ministry to issue a statement saying countries should not push protectionism through security reviews. GO SCALE \u2014 PHILIPS In 2015, the Dutch electronics giant Philips had an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED business for as much as $2.9 billion to GO Scale, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners. Philips canceled the deal after it could not resolve Cfius\u2019s concerns, and in December 2016 announced it would sell the unit to Apollo Global Management for $1.5 billion, almost half the amount of the earlier deal.\n\nThe Broadcom-Qualcomm deal does not involve China-based companies. But there has been concern that the acquisition could undermine the ability of the United States to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. Members of Cfius pointed to Broadcom\u2019s statements that it would take a \u201c\u2018private equity\u2019-style\u201d approach if it acquired Qualcomm, suggesting to the committee that Broadcom could reduce long-term investment on research and development in favor of focusing on short-term profits.\n\nWhile the United States has remained a standard-bearer in mobile technology, the committee noted, \u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers want to expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction\n\nA bipartisan group in Congress has proposed legislation that would greatly expand the number of deals reviewed by Cfius. In November, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced by Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina.

That development was made possible by bringing outside expertise into its fold, similar to the m\u00e9tiers d\u2019art group in its fashion division, with the acquisition of French heritage houses like the plumassier Lemari\u00e9 or the embroidery specialist Lesage.\n\nIn 2011, Chanel took a minority interest in Romain Gauthier, an independent Swiss watchmaker from the Vall\u00e9e de Joux that supplies it with top-quality components.\n\nThat same year, it created a team dedicated to producing movements within the Manufacture G&F Ch\u00e2telain in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, a specialist in the machining, assembly and finishing of high-end timepieces that Chanel acquired in 1993.\n\nEarlier, Chanel primarily had collaborated with Renaud & Papi, the master watchmakers at Audemars Piguet, to produce such models as the 2012 Premi\u00e8re Cam\u00e9lia Flying Tourbillon and its skeletonized version.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe were happy to work with Renaud & Papi so long as we produced the design,\u201d Mr. Beau said. \u201cBut about 10 years ago, we decided to make our own movements so we could be masters of our own destiny.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMaking movements is the most complex part of watchmaking, so acquiring the expertise to make its own, he added, \u201cwas the final brick in the construction of our watchmaking maison.\u201d\n\nLike the Parisian workshops that Chanel owns, both Ch\u00e2telain and Mr. Gauthier are free to supply other watch brands, including Chanel\u2019s competitors. \u201cChanel has a \u2018friendly\u2019 participation in our business,\u201d Mr. Gauthier said in an interview in Geneva. \u201cWe furnish them with high-precision components according to their specifications, but we do so with other brands as well. We have complete freedom when it comes to our business.\u201d\n\n\u201cChanel likes creative talents in different domains,\u201d Mr. Gauthier said. \u201cThey respect our work and do not question our expertise.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They will be marketed to a primarily female audience, although that could include men willing to broaden their horizons.\n\n\u201cSome men may find it difficult to wear a watch made by Chanel,\u201d Mr. Beau said. \u201cIt takes a super-chic man who doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks of him.\u201d", "title": "Chanel\u2019s New Watch?

That shows once again his abysmal and unprecedented unpreparedness for the office.\n\nAfter Stephen Bannon was fired, and then seemingly apolitical John Kelly made chief of staff, it appeared that Mr. Trump wanted to govern more from the center. But now, with the apparent declining influence of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the departures of Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn, and the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state, it seems that while Mr. Bannon left in disgrace, his ideology has taken hold in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind and government.\n\nJAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a former superintendent of schools and executive director of a professional association, I know how difficult it is to fire someone face to face. So I understand why President Trump decided to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter instead of meeting with him.\n\nUnderstanding, however, does not equate to justification.

At first I thought that this answer, another puzzle debut, was a bit anachronistic, or soon to be. The old-fashioned circus is going the way of sideshows, right? Little did I know the history of Clyde Beatty, lion tamer, whose introduction of the use of a chair as a distraction device has inspired 21st-century motivators who hope to improve our focus. Apparently, when a lion sees the four legs of a chair, he (or she, although the boys are usually the ones in these shows, I think) sees four separate pieces of prey, one for each leg, and pauses in a befuddled state. Don\u2019t be a lion!

I had \u201cMing\u201d for a while, which killed my chances at solving one of the theme answers at 77A; the QING dynasty came after Ming, held up for over a century, and really fell apart because of international pressures from Britain more than the United States.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nHAT TIP to the puzzle magazines of my long-gone youth. One of them (Dell?) had a little word puzzle where you had to go from STARTLING to I deleting one letter at a time, always forming a new word without anagramming. (BTW, there are two solutions.) One of my bugaboos is plural names, which I really try to avoid. This one has two! The second one came when I just had to get IN MEM out of the grid and upgraded it with TV MOM. I tried to do something about ALIS. I could replace the corner, but because of the interlock, it would require redoing the whole of the Eastern Seaboard, and I just couldn\u2019t pull it off. Because of a tough crossing, ALIS needed the easiest clue possible, but I like to tell myself the real clue is the first word of Oregon\u2019s state motto.

He demanded excellence and we gave him excellence.\u201d\n\nThey also gave him silence. He allowed no music, no ringing phones and no idle chatter. Scrub nurses were expected to anticipate his requests.\n\n\u201cHe would manage any break of silence with a stern look,\u201d said Dr. Brian Andrews, a neurosurgeon who was one of Dr. Wilson\u2019s residents and also his biographer, with the book \u201cCherokee Surgeon\u201d (2011). (Dr. Wilson was one-eighth Cherokee.)\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Wilson became world renowned for excising pituitary tumors through the sinus in a surgery called transsphenoidal resection. He had embraced the procedure, which had been done for decades, after being displeased with results that U.C.S.F. surgeons had achieved using another technique.\n\nHis zeal to understand the operation had led him one day to call the chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, with an unexpected request: Could the chairman acquire 100 cadaver heads, regardless of the cost, and bring them to the university\u2019s laboratory so that Dr. Wilson might then fly there to study the anatomy he would encounter in the surgery?\n\n\u201cSometime later, when the laboratory was fully stocked, Charles traveled on a Friday to Gainesville and, over a weekend, practiced his technique on each and every one of the cadavers,\u201d Dr. Andrews wrote in the biography.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe writer Malcolm Gladwell, in a profile of Dr. Wilson in The New Yorker in 1999, described one of those pituitary cancer surgeries. Looking at a tumor through a surgical microscope, Dr. Wilson used an instrument called a ring curette to peel the tumor from the gland.\n\n\u201cIt was, he would say later, like running a squeegee across a windshield,\u201d Mr. Gladwell wrote, \u201cexcept that in this case, the windshield was a surgical field one centimeter in diameter, flanked on either side by the carotid arteries, the principal sources of blood to the brain.\u201d\n\nA wrong move could nick an artery or damage a nerve, endangering the patient\u2019s vision or his life.\n\nWhen Dr. Wilson saw bleeding from one side of the gland, he realized that he had not gotten all of the tumor. He found it and removed it. The surgery took only 25 minutes.\n\nDr. Wilson performed the surgery more than 3,300 times.\n\nHe told Mr. Gladwell that he had a special feel for surgery that he could not entirely explain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of an invisible hand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt begins almost to seem mystical. Sometimes a resident asks, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 \u201d His response, he told Mr. Gladwell, was to shrug and say, \u201cWell, it just seemed like the right thing.\u201d\n\nCharles Byron Wilson was born on Aug. 31, 1929, in Neosho, Mo., a farming community in the Ozark Mountains with a population of 5,000. His father, Byron, was a pharmacist who owned a local drugstore; his mother, the former Margaret Polson, also worked there.\n\nCharles, though slightly built, was a three-sport athlete in high school and received academic and football scholarships to Tulane University, where he played running back as a freshman. But he went no further in football because of an ankle injury. He eventually turned to running marathons.\n\nPhoto\n\nA skilled pianist, he also played Dixieland jazz at a French Quarter nightclub during his college years in New Orleans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Wilson graduated from the Tulane School of Medicine and spent a year as a pathology resident at Charity Hospital, also in New Orleans, where he gained expertise in removing brains as well as hearts, lungs and abdominal organs. He considered becoming a pathologist, but he also wanted to help living people.\n\n\u201cI was deeply interested in neuropathology, the art of diagnosis, and the precision of surgery,\u201d he said in \u201cCherokee Surgeon.\u201d \u201cNeurosurgery brought all of my interests together, and it just felt right.\u201d\n\nAfter a residency in neurosurgery that had been jointly offered by Tulane and the Ochsner Clinic (now part of the Ochsner Health System), Dr. Wilson became a neurosurgery resident at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in New Orleans. He later returned to Charity as chief resident, taught neurosurgery at Louisiana State University and, in 1963, joined the University of Kentucky, where he started its division of neurosurgery.\n\nHe joined U.C.S.F. in 1968 as chairman of its neurosurgery division and soon expanded the brain tumor research he had begun in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cHe was a visionary in how he built a multidisciplinary approach to studying brain cancer, linking basic science and clinical research together,\u201d Dr. Susan Chang, director of the division of neuro-oncology at U.C.S.F., said in an interview. \u201cHe was able to set up an infrastructure to test new therapies on tumors and spare patients the side effects of treatments.\u201d\n\nDr. Wilson continued to operate into his early 70s, retiring in 2002 after performing one last pituitary tumor surgery.\n\nHe had already planned for his retirement. He had co-founded the Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance, which develops health care programs in African countries greatly affected by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. And he helped raise money and set policy for Clinic by the Bay, which provides free medical services to uninsured working people in the Bay Area.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Dr. Wilson is survived by his daughter, Rebecca Cohn; his son, Byron; a stepdaughter, Kathryn Petrocelli; and six grandchildren. Another son, Craig, died in 1983. Dr. Wilson\u2019s three previous marriages ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1994, in a speech to a medical conference, he offered his thoughts on how patients can better cope with a brain tumor. They cannot control the diagnosis, he said, and suggested that they face their mortality.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLife can be beautiful,\u201d he said, as he approached his 65th birthday, \u201cbut it is certainly not forever.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Right here. The spot used to be Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. Historians estimate nearly half of all African slaves brought to America arrived in Charleston, most of them at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf. At 840-feet-long, it was, two centuries ago, the largest wharf in America. Thousands of Africans waited in the wharf\u2019s warehouses to be auctioned off.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn what has become a parking lot, just inland, 700 of them froze to death.\n\nFor millions of African-Americans today, the site is \u201cground zero,\u201d as the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has put it, for \u201cblackness, black culture, the African experience, the African-American experience, slavery \u2014 however you want to slice it.\u201d\n\nEvery era erects, removes, amends \u2014 or ignores \u2014 monuments. Monuments and historical museums are always mirrors, advertisements, time bombs. Hardly a street or building in Germany today lacks some sign or plaque, redressing the past. It was the proposed removal of a Jim Crow-era statue of Robert E. Lee that became the excuse for the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, where a white nationalist is to go on trial late this year in the murder of a protester at the event.\n\nUnlike Virginia, South Carolina hasn\u2019t taken down Confederate monuments. Much has changed here but much has not. The state\u2019s most recent proposal for social studies standards in public schools doesn\u2019t mention the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks.\n\nThe Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a young white man massacred nine black congregants in 2015 is virtually in the shadow of what\u2019s still the city\u2019s tallest monument (another Jim Crow relic) of the antebellum vice president and proud white supremacist John C. Calhoun.\n\nIt has been nearly two decades since Joseph P. Riley Jr., Charleston\u2019s mayor at the time, floated the idea of a museum of African-American culture and history, on a different site, nearby. A dozen years passed, then more.\n\nMr. Riley retired in 2016, after 40 years in office, having been elected during the 1970s as a racial bridge builder. White racists called him \u201cL\u2019il Black Joe\u201d when he appointed a black police chief in 1975. Charleston prospered over the intervening decades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut gentrification had its effects. Two-thirds black in the early 1980s, the population has become 70 percent white. I suggested to Mr. Riley the other day that Charleston can come across to a visitor as Disneyland for the Confederacy, still enthralled by its era of slavery, with a monument on seemingly every downtown corner commemorating some Confederate soldier, plantation aristocrat or antebellum judge who opposed Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe worked hard while I was mayor to avoid alienation, to make this a city where everyone feels welcome. When I was in school, they didn\u2019t teach us about slavery. I really only learned the truth about how slaves were treated when I had already been in office for many years. That\u2019s when I began to think seriously about the museum.\u201d\n\nBut without enough money or much public enthusiasm, the plan sputtered. Then excavations turned up traces of Gadsden\u2019s Wharf in the muck beneath the grassy lot. Through the exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum, Mr. Riley reached out to Mr. Cobb.\n\nPretty much the architect\u2019s first question: Why not build on the location of the wharf?\n\nBy that point, the city had sold the property to a local restaurateur, unaware of its history. Mr. Riley spent a tidy sum buying the land back.\n\n\u201cSometimes you quick-cook something, it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d rationalized the former mayor, who has taken to calling the museum his \u201cmost important work,\u201d especially after the church murders. \u201cIt turned out to be good that we had a lengthy germination period.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Working here with the structural engineer Guy Nordenson, he describes this project as an \u201cunrhetorical work of architecture.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite true. On the edge of the cobblestoned tourist area, with its ornate Gothic Revival-style churches and Queen Anne houses, the museum\u2019s plain-spoken modernism comes across as almost whisperingly defiant, a turning of the page, promising a deliverance from history, modernism\u2019s originating goal.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoody Nolan are the architects of record. Slender brick cladding underscores the pavilion\u2019s long horizontal spans and extended cantilevers on either end. Pointed columns are meant to make the structure\u2019s mass appear to float. Perching the museum on piers will take account of rising waters. But it\u2019s also hard not to see an allusion to a wharf.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside, galleries will document the many diverse cultures Africans brought to America, and a family center will let visitors trace their roots to Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Hood has reimagined a constrained and narrow property, about a football-field long. The late, great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer was an inspiration. Mr. Hood creates a shaded public plaza, in the breezy space underneath the raised structure, where people may congregate around the building\u2019s double-sided staircase, so the museum can become a gathering spot, not just a pilgrimage site.\n\nThe memorial garden and tidal pool, at the same time, insure that it\u2019s recognized as hallowed ground, a place for contemplation.\n\nThe budget for building the museum is $75 million. The goal is for bulldozers to start digging later this year and for construction to finish in 2020. But there\u2019s a hitch. No shovel will be lifted until all the money is raised. Charleston has committed its $25 million share, along with the land, and private donations are approaching the $25 million goal.\n\nBut the South Carolina legislature, after an understanding that it would contribute $25 million over five years, allocated $14 million, and now won\u2019t promise the remaining $11 million. The clock is ticking. The current legislature remains in session only until the end of May.\n\nState Representative Brian White, a Republican who heads South Carolina\u2019s House Ways and Means Committee, is one of those holding the money back. The museum \u201cis not a state project and we have a lot of state needs right now that far outweigh a municipality\u2019s request,\u201d he recently told the Greenville News, citing competing priorities like education.\n\nBobby Hitt, South Carolina\u2019s commerce secretary, by contrast, has pointed out that the museum will help attract businesses to the state. It adds a work of architectural dignity. And as for educational value, plainly it fills a gap.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t a black project,\u201d as Bakari Sellers, a former Democrat in the state legislature, put it to the Greenville News. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a Charleston project.

Mr. Moore said his ancestors were among the slaves who arrived in shackles at Gadsden\u2019s Wharf.\n\nHis great-great grandfather was Robert Smalls, who commandeered a Confederate ship, turning it over to Union forces and winning freedom for himself, his family and his crew. Smalls became a crusading state legislator and United States congressman during Reconstruction. He brought free public education to South Carolina.\n\nA plaque honoring Smalls was installed on a squat little pillar downtown not long ago. Mr. Moore showed me a picture of it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThink, the Stonehenge set from \u201cSpinal Tap.\u201d The memorial looks tiny, and is periodically obscured by bushes.\n\nNot far away, a big statue on a huge round pedestal, at the tip of the battery facing Fort Sumter, honors the Confederate Defenders of Charleston.\n\nSymbols matter.

But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.\n\nThe view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

But under Mr. Xi\u2019s guidance, the country has slowed and even reversed some reforms that would reduce the government\u2019s control over the market, tracking by the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group shows.\n\nAmid this retrenchment, business leaders, policymakers and academics who have long defended China against more hawkish views are suddenly changing their tune.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Mr. Brilliant. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201d\n\nAlthough he stands firmly behind Mr. Xi, the Harvard-educated Mr. Liu has a history of advocating economic reform and more open markets.

China\u2019s government views the Tibetan Buddhist leader as a champion of independence for Tibet, and Mercedes-Benz faced withering criticism from Chinese online users who shared those views.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMercedes-Benz erased the post \u2014 even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram. Still, criticism continued. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, branded Mercedes-Benz an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nChina is Mercedes-Benz\u2019s biggest single car market, accounting for about one-quarter of sales.\n\n\u201cChina is getting stronger,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChina is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media. In a prominent conviction last year of a human-rights activist, Lee Ming-che, the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him.\n\n\u201cThe fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig.\n\nThe case of Mr. Zhang, the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp, could indicate a further extension of China\u2019s reach.\n\nThe Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media, but Mr. Zhang\u2019s case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company, it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat, which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities.\n\nMr. Zhang\u2019s lawyer, Sui Muqing, said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr. Zhang.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the information from him, but they have it,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cThat was what we found so weird. None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts said the information was likely gleaned from somebody within Mr. Zhang\u2019s WhatsApp group or by accessing Mr. Zhang\u2019s phone directly, not by hacking WhatsApp. Chinese officials formally blocked WhatsApp in China about the time of Mr. Zhang\u2019s detention.\n\nA spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk about technology and the internet, people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cBut people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology, which makes wider and deeper control possible.\u201d", "title": "China Presses Its Internet Censorship Efforts Across the Globe", "authors": ["Paul Mozur"]}

The products are sold by Anbang and many other Chinese companies, but they disclose little about the underlying investment. Many customers assume the investments are backed by the government even though they are not, putting pressure on officials to make sure investors are paid with government money if the investments go south.\n\nIn the case of Anbang, both the company and government officials have said that the money given to it by small investors is sound. Anbang said in a statement on its website that its business operations were stable and that it has \u201csufficient cash flow to fulfill its policy commitments to all Anbang customers and ensure that the legitimate rights of its policyholders are not lost.\u201d\n\nAfter acquiring the Waldorf Astoria, Anbang tried a number of prominent global deals, including an unsuccessful campaign to buy Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and a bid to buy a stake in a Manhattan office building partly owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family company. The deal with Mr. Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was eventually abandoned after it was covered by the news media.\n\nMr. Wu\u2019s fortunes took a turn for the worse last year when the government, wary about rising levels of debt, began to scrutinize its big deal makers. That led to public criticism of some of those companies and restrictions on capital outflow. On top of that, Anbang was never able to explain fully who its shareholders were to American regulators, who were pressing the company on its ownership structure.\n\nChina is now trying to rein in the growth of its wealth management products industry, fearful that excessive levels of debt could destabilize its economy, the world\u2019s second-largest behind that of the United States. The scrutiny on Anbang roughly coincided with the removal of the commissioner of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission a year ago. On March 12, the Chinese government said it would merge banking and insurance regulators in an effort to close regulatory loopholes.\n\nProsecutors in China say that Mr. Wu concealed his control of companies that he then used to hold shares of Anbang Insurance and Anbang Group. Using one of Anbang Group\u2019s subsidiaries, Anbang Property & Casualty Insurance Company, as a funding platform, he ordered the development of investment-type insurance products.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mr. Wu led the design of the products and instructed the company to make false financial statements and marketing brochures. By doing that, he managed to get approval from the insurance regulatory agency to raise funds from the public.\n\nBy Jan. 5, 2017, the company had sold $116.5 billion of products, far more than the amount the government had approved. Some of that money was then moved to the companies that Mr. Wu controlled. Those funds were used to invest, to repay debts and for personal spending, according to prosecutors. Mr. Wu said the capital increase was from his self-owned funds.", "title": "China Says Anbang\u2019s Founder Defrauded Investors of $10 Billion", "authors": []}

In his speech, Mr. Yi said that China would act resolutely against anyone who engaged in illegal financial activities without a license \u2014 a reference to a continuing campaign against so-called shadow banking.\n\nChina said last November that it would open its financial sector to greater international competition, in an unsuccessful move to tamp down President Trump\u2019s demands for a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with China. Mr. Yi, explaining himself clearly in terms that frequently hinted at his background as an economics professor, said that the opening would continue.\n\n\u201cThe more a sector opens, the more competitive it will become,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a quarter-century of rapid growth, the Chinese economy stalled momentarily at the start of 2009 during the global financial crisis. China\u2019s leaders responded by flooding the economy with credit, in a massive monetary stimulus program that exceeded those of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in terms of the increase in broadly measured money supply.\n\nThat stimulus program allowed the Chinese economy to resume rapid growth almost immediately. But China has been adding debt ever since, building a national grid of high-speed train lines and forests of city skyscrapers as leaders have been reluctant to let growth slow.\n\nTwo credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, downgraded China\u2019s sovereign debt last year on concerns about the buildup of domestic debt.

China\u2019s continued use of economic planning and ongoing support for state-owned companies has prompted pushback by global leaders. President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum are aimed, in part, at China\u2019s own protectionist policies.\n\nDavid Malpass, the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for international affairs, said before the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in Argentina on Sunday that China had reversed its path toward more open markets, in favor of greater subsidies of its industries and more shoring-up of state-owned enterprises.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s gone in a different direction, really, from the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Malpass said.\n\nHe also noted it was \u201cworrisome\u201d that President Xi had done away with term limits, leaving him free to rule indefinitely, and that the United States\u2019 longstanding economic discussions with China had stalled.\n\nAs Mr. Xi has sought to extend it leadership, he has brought more centralized control to the country\u2019s main policy levers.\n\nThe government has just approved a plan to combine China\u2019s banking and insurance regulators, as a way to bolster oversight. The agencies will relinquish some policymaking responsibilities to China\u2019s central bank.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast summer, Mr. Xi created a Financial Stability and Development Committee to coordinate all financial regulation, and Mr. Liu is widely expected to lead it. The new committee, while small, has the power to resolve differences among the People\u2019s Bank of China and the agencies that oversee the regulation of the banking, insurance and securities industries.\n\nIn 2013, the president also made Mr. Liu the director of the Communist Party\u2019s powerful Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A few months later, Mr. Liu named Mr. Yi as one of his deputies at the group, the state-run news media reported at the time.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rapid rise of both men once again show the president\u2019s willingness to dispense with the conventions of China\u2019s bureaucracy when he wants to promote someone he may perceive as especially competent, especially loyal or both. Mr. Liu was promoted several rungs overnight to the Politburo last October despite having been only the deputy director of a ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Yi has not followed the traditional path to a top financial position, like a stint running a big state-owned bank or overseeing one of the lesser regulators. (Mr. Zhou did both before running the central bank.)\n\nMr. Yi worked his way up the ladder at the People\u2019s Bank of China, where he has been since 1997.

He earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then taught economics at Indiana University in Indianapolis for eight years. Mr. Liu studied at Seton Hall University and Harvard.\n\nThe job of running the People\u2019s Bank of China has become much more technical in the past several years as it has shifted away from simply mandating the interest rates that banks can charge for loans and pay for deposits. Instead, the central bank increasingly relies on open-market trading in bonds and other securities to influence interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve does in the United States.\n\nMr. Yi has an extensive academic background in monetary policy and has overseen much of the trading in recent years. But he will face a big challenge in managing the central bank, including shifting political priorities.\n\nThrough the central bank and other institutions, China tightly controls how its currency, the renminbi, is used and valued. That means limiting the amount of money that Chinese citizens and companies, both foreign and domestic, can send across its border.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina has also long used its banking system as an economic throttle, unleashing waves of loans when the government wants growth and ratcheting back when debt looks out of control. The system has kept China stable in times of global economic distress. But as China\u2019s economy has matured, cracks have begun to show.\n\nPrevious efforts to juice the economy led to a startling rise in corporate debt. The system has long supported bloated, inefficient state-owned industries that many economists say are slowing down China\u2019s development.\n\nMr. Zhou, an urbane English speaker who frequently hobnobs with world leaders in places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has worked to gradually change China\u2019s dependence on debt and its control of its currency. Under his administration, the central bank somewhat loosened China\u2019s grip on the value of its currency. And he has championed programs that allow money to cross borders more easily.\n\nHe has also been a vocal, if diplomatic, critic of some Chinese economic policies \u2014 a rarity in a country that values consensus. \u201cIn recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding bank capital and risk resilience,\u201d he said in a statement posted on the central bank\u2019s website on Nov. 4.\n\nBut the direction of China\u2019s economic policy ultimately comes from the top, so Mr. Liu and Mr. Yi will take their cues from the president. It\u2019s an agenda that emphasizes stability and growth, meaning they will most likely focus more on China\u2019s priorities than those of the global markets.\n\nAfter an exodus of capital, China tightened its limits on money flows outside the country over the past two years to bolster the value of its currency. It undermined Mr. Zhou\u2019s efforts to loosen the reins.\n\nNow debt is a paramount focus. The central bank will need to provide just enough credit to keep the economy running but not so much that debt keeps rising and inflation eventually becomes a problem.\n\nMr. Yi\u2019s earliest well-known article for an economics journal, published in 1990 in the China Economic Review while he was still an assistant professor at Indiana University, had a turgid title that might prove especially useful: \u201cInflation and Price Instability: An Empirical Study of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d", "title": "China to Name New Central Bank Chief as It Seeks Continuity Amid Change", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"]}

It also has pledged some of the assets it bought over the past two years to lenders as collateral to raise cash. HNA has even announced plans to sell some of the assets it acquired when it bought a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide Hotels, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe Chinese government has tightened its grip on the economy as the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, consolidates his power and paves the way toward running China longer than any ruler since Mao Zedong. That tightened grip includes increasing pressure on major Chinese companies that piled on heavy debt to make audacious deals abroad.\n\nThat pressure has intensified in recent weeks amid indications that China is trying to tackle its debt and financial problems. Just two weeks ago, the Chinese authorities seized Anbang Insurance Group, a once-quiet insurer that turned to sales of opaque investment products to fuel a global buying binge that included the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. Other companies, like Dalian Wanda Group, have already sold off billions of dollars\u2019 worth of properties at home and abroad as the authorities worried about growing debt and risk.\n\nAs official attitudes turn against flashy but potentially frivolous foreign spending, the pressure is catching up to HNA.\n\nAbout $1.8 billion of its pending deals still await regulatory approval. Among those is a $775 million deal to acquire a majority stake in the storage and logistics business owned by Glencore International with operations around the world. They also include the purchase of a company from Anthony Scaramucci, a former Trump administration aide.\n\nPhoto\n\nHNA\u2019s problems could hit investors both at home and abroad.\n\nHNA has suspended trading in shares of seven of its listed units in China and Hong Kong pending what it says could be a major restructuring announcement. Owners of those stocks could face big losses when they begin trading again.\n\nLenders could be on the hook, too. HNA is using much of the shares it owns in those businesses as collateral for loans. The company has also used the offshore bond market to raise billions of dollars from investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland and elsewhere to help finance its global deal-making, according to its regulatory filings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA lawyer for HNA, Thomas A.

It is moving quickly to sell assets, saying this week that it would sell a stake in a trust that owns Hilton hotel properties worth $1.4 billion. China also has a history of bailing out troubled firms to avoid big financial disruptions or job losses. Last month, one of China\u2019s biggest state-controlled banks, Citic, pledged $3.2 billion in credit. Mr. Chen, the company\u2019s 64-year-old co-chairman, has said the company is hopeful it can move past its problems.\n\nStill, HNA\u2019s bond prices have plummeted, and the cost of raising new capital has skyrocketed over concerns that the company could default on its debts.\n\nSales by HNA this year could total $16 billion, by some estimates \u2014 more than the nearly $14 billion in deals it struck last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But HNA has also blamed outside factors \u2014 including, one executive has said, an anti-China conspiracy in other countries.\n\nIn a speech on Feb. 3, the company\u2019s co-chairman, Wang Jian, cited attacks on the company from \u201creactionary forces from both China and overseas countering China\u2019s rise,\u201d adding that these forces were \u201ca major conspiracy against the Communist Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core,\u201d according to a transcript of the speech sent to employees and seen by The New York Times. Mr. Clare said Mr. Wang was not referring to HNA\u2019s financial situation.\n\nMany corporate management experts are not surprised by HNA\u2019s difficulties. HNA has made 123 acquisitions since 2015, becoming a sprawling enterprise comprising planes, hotels, property developments, computer equipment and even shipping lines.

Over the last six years, HNA has paid more in fees to banks for deal advice than Dalian Wanda, Anbang and Fosun combined, according to Dealogic data. HNA in particular has struck ties over the years with pillars of the global financial system, including big banks in China, on Wall Street and in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose ties have paid off handsomely for Wall Street. HNA paid $140 million in fees over that six-year period to big banks to advise on deals, according to Dealogic. Those banks could score big fees for helping HNA sell what it bought.\n\n\u201cBanks were clearly keen on doing business with these companies when they were on acquisition sprees,\u201d Paul Gillis, who teaches at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, in Beijing, said of HNA and other Chinese companies that bought globally. \u201cThere were lots of fees to be earned backing these transactions.\u201d\n\nHNA\u2019s fate could affect businesses \u2014 and tens of thousands of workers \u2014 around the world thanks to its spending spree. HNA owns Ingram Micro, an American distributor of technology products that it bought two years ago for $6 billion; Swissport, a baggage handler, and Gategroup, an airline caterer, both of Switzerland; and hotels and other properties in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nSome of those properties are now on the block. The company hired JPMorgan Chase in January to help find a buyer for its stake in NH Hotels, a Spanish chain. One week after Mr. Chen, HNA\u2019s founder, received an award at the New York gala from Mr. Schwarzman, it sold a Sydney office building for $160 million to Blackstone, Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s firm.\n\nHNA is also a significant minority shareholder in a number of international companies. It owns 26 percent of Hilton Hotels, the American hospitality chain; a 19.8 percent stake in Virgin Australia, the airline; and a 20.9 percent stake in Dufry, the Swiss airport retailer. It also owns shares representing 3.5 percent voting rights in Deutsche Bank, the German lender.\n\nHNA recently began selling Deutsche Bank shares and had pledged many of them for loans. It has also pledged some of its shares in Dufry and Hilton in exchange for loans.

When reports mention the change, they argue that term limits should be eliminated to ensure leadership continuity at a time when China has ambitions to challenge American dominance and reclaim its rightful place on the global stage. \u201cChina cannot stop and take a break,\u201d the nationalistic Global Times warned. \u201cThe country must seize the day, seize the hour.\u201d\n\nDespite the blanket of censorship, and the fear that many expressed in stating their actual opinions in public, some cracks have appeared in the facade of public unity behind China\u2019s strongman.\n\nRetirees who endured the trauma of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution are warning of a return to dictatorship. University students are posting quotes from George Washington\u2019s farewell address online.

Mr. Xi remains immensely popular among farmers and blue-collar workers, as well as a new generation of young nationalists, who admire what they view as his steely drive and see him as the architect of China\u2019s ascent in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing to remove term limits, so long as the leader has strong abilities,\u201d said one such supporter, Mou Yuxiu, 19, a college freshman in the southwestern province of Sichuan. \u201cPresident Xi is such a person.\u201d\n\nFor another, Mr. Xi already has an iron grip on Chinese society. A sweeping anticorruption campaign has ensnared tens of thousands of officials and imposed discipline on the Communist Party and other powerful institutions like the People\u2019s Liberation Army, China\u2019s military. There have also been conspicuously public arrests of lawyers and dissidents, including Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based publisher who has been in custody for more than two years, apparently for publishing books critical of Mr. Xi and China.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Like Mao, Mr. Xi has also filled China\u2019s society with political slogans and used propaganda to present himself as the leader needed to guide China to its destiny.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics argue that by putting such a personal stamp on power and eliminating the previous collective leadership model, Mr. Xi is setting the stage for a return to the excesses of personal loyalty and fanaticism that nearly tore China apart during Mao\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cMany people inside and outside the system went through the Mao era and their anxiety is intensified,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, whose father, a government official, was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nOthers harbor nostalgia for the politics of the Cultural Revolution, which they see as a time of decisiveness and ideological purity. They dismiss criticism of Mr. Xi\u2019s strongman tendencies, saying centralized power is a sign of prosperity and stability.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping can explore a new mass democracy in his own way, without the chaos, disorder and blood, and without the darkness and negatives,\u201d said Zhang Hongliang, a Maoist commentator. \u201cCentralized power is just a tool. What matters is who holds it.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi has presented himself as a singular figure who has what it takes to eliminate corruption, reduce income inequality and extend China\u2019s influence in the world.\n\nWhile gauging public opinion in an authoritarian country is difficult, surveys suggest Mr. Xi has an approval rating of more than 80 percent. In interviews, many praise him for maintaining robust economic growth at a time when more advanced nations have faltered and for challenging America\u2019s dominance in areas like the South China Sea.\n\nBut even many of Mr. Xi\u2019s admirers have been taken aback by his bid for indefinite rule.

The central bank seeks to maintain the overall stability of the financial system.\n\nThe intellectual justification for the merger of just the banking and insurance regulators, Chinese experts said in interviews over the last two weeks, is to create a single regulator for financial institutions that accept money from the public and invest it with guaranteed rates of return. But the China Securities Regulatory Commission needed to stay separate from the new banking and insurance agency, they suggested, because its role involves overseeing markets, in which customers know that they are taking a risk that they may not recover their investments.\n\nBut some Western experts have tended to recommend a broader combination of regulatory agencies. They have warned that Chinese financial institutions like Anbang Insurance Group, recently taken over by the central government after it embarked on a program of feverish overseas investment, have tended to exploit gaps in regulatory responsibility between the agencies.\n\nMr. Xi did create a lightly staffed financial supervisory commission last summer, which Mr. Liu is expected to take charge of in the coming days, that oversees all the regulatory agencies. Alicia Garcia-Herrero, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Natixis, a French financial institution, said that the limited financial regulatory consolidation set forth on Tuesday would leave that commission with a lot of power.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this more fragmented model for Xi is that he is still the final overseer through the oversight commission he created,\u201d she said.\n\nThe restructuring will also create a new, separate National Market Regulation and Administration Bureau to take over responsibility for registering and supervising companies, food and drug inspection, and price supervision. The new bureau will also grab control over antimonopoly actions from the Ministry of Commerce and another, smaller government agency.\n\nChina\u2019s industrial takeoff and feverish urban growth have created dangerous levels of air, water and soil pollution, and placed deepening strains on land and water resources.

But the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s plan for that is to have the state play the \u201cleading\u201d role in the economy while the market plays the \u201cdecisive\u201d role in allocating resources. Squaring that circle can be tricky.\n\nHow will China\u2019s leaders reform state-owned enterprises, whose profitability keeps declining (especially relative to that of private firms), when they still see those companies as national champions?\n\nMass urbanization is expected to continue, still not out of people\u2019s personal preferences but at the state\u2019s behest, by way of residency restrictions, evictions and forced relocations. Yet China\u2019s planners now seem intent on redirecting migrants from megacities to smaller cities, and this could curb economic growth: As the World Bank points out, labor productivity is much higher in larger cities than in smaller ones.\n\nThen, there is the corruption issue, which will require another delicate balancing act. Corruption has benefited the Chinese economy by, in effect, allowing the transfer of state assets to more efficient private actors. But over time such gains are being outweighed by the social costs of bribes, wasteful expenditures and growing inequities. Allowing corruption to run rampant could undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Yet combating it with draconian measures could hurt growth by discouraging both officials and entrepreneurs from taking economic risks.\n\nHence the importance, and sensitivity, of Mr. Xi\u2019s signature anticorruption campaign. It has been cast as an effort to discipline errant officials, but some see it as a means for Mr. Xi to purge political opponents or exert more control over society. It seems to have been popular so far: The general public perceives local officials as taking advantage of the system, and here is the central government appearing to rectify the situation. But some warn that the National Supervision Commission, a new agency designed to institutionalize anti-graft efforts, could signal overreach.\n\nTo discourage corruption effectively, the Chinese government will eventually have to leaven the rule of the party with more rule of law. In the meantime, some practical reforms would help, including creating a civil code to define acceptable commercial practices, basic property rights and the status of private companies. More sweeping \u2014 and more politically sensitive \u2014 reforms will also be needed to ensure that private actors have more access to major resources, like land and financing, without having to rely on personal connections to local officials.\n\nThe Chinese economy\u2019s glory days may be over, but even a 6 percent growth rate over the next decade would be remarkable. At that pace, the economy would double by 2030 and likely become the world\u2019s largest in nominal dollar terms. (It already is the world\u2019s largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity.)\n\nChina\u2019s remarkable success to date can be credited in part to its leaders\u2019 willingness to set aside communism for pragmatism. Some observers worry that Mr. Xi is now reinjecting ideology into major policies, Mao-style. But he also is concentrating power and promoting action-oriented reformers like Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu \u2014 signaling his intention to address China\u2019s social and economic needs even as he gathers the means to do so.

Despite government-inspired efforts by state-run China Mobile \u2014 the world\u2019s largest cellular provider \u2014 during the development of 4G, few carriers in other countries chose to rely on China Mobile\u2019s preferred standard.\n\nWith 5G, Chinese companies started developing know-how early. Huawei has invested $600 million in 5G research since 2009, according to a company spokesman, and has committed an additional $800 million for this year. The company is testing 5G equipment with European telecom operators including BT, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs of early 2017, 10 percent of the 1,450 patents essential for 5G networks were in Chinese hands, according to analysts with Jefferies, who wrote that they expected the figure to rise. That number includes intellectual property rights held by Huawei; another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE; and others. Qualcomm alone owned 15 percent of 5G patents, Nokia 11 percent and Ericsson 8 percent.\n\nAs of 2011, Huawei and ZTE owned a combined 7 percent of 4G patents, according to Jefferies\u2019s estimates. Qualcomm, at the time, owned 21 percent.\n\nChinese companies have also been increasing their influence at 3GPP, or the Third-Generation Partnership Project, the international body that decides wireless standards and includes representatives from telecom operators, equipment makers and more. The work of deciding technical matters at 3GPP is divided among different groups and subgroups, and Chinese organizations have expanded their presence in the top ranks.\n\nThe number of Chinese representatives serving as chair or vice chair of a group or subgroup was 10 last year, up from eight in 2013, according to Jefferies. There are almost 60 leadership positions in total. Huawei holds five top spots among the different groups; China Mobile has three.

Such gestures led some to think that Mr. Xi be would be a relatively mild leader.\n\nInstead, Mr. Xi has proved to be a strongman who now appears intent on at least partially undoing Deng\u2019s political legacy.\n\n\u201cTerm limits, avoidance of a cult of personality, and the end of routine political purges \u2014 all of these were part of China\u2019s reform-era leaders\u2019 efforts to steer the nation out of the chaos and instability of the Maoist era,\u201d said Carl Minzner, a professor of law at Fordham University in New York and author of a new book on Mr. Xi\u2019s authoritarianism. \u201cAs these start to fall like dominoes, the operative question is: What could go next?\u201d\n\nRemoving the term limit follows a series of political victories for Mr. Xi, including being crowned \u201ccore leader\u201d of the party in 2016.

Last week, the government increased the central bank\u2019s oversight responsibilities, putting it in charge of drafting key banking regulations.\n\nWhat Mr. Yi will do with all this power matters for the whole world.\n\nChina\u2019s mostly state-owned banking system is burdened with bad loans to state-owned enterprises, many of which are unprofitable, and the pet projects of powerful provincial leaders.

China\u2019s banks manage investments and make loans in many other countries, so turbulence in those banks could infect financial markets worldwide.\n\nAnd if China\u2019s banks falter, that could set off a sharp drop in growth because China would no longer be able to rely on debt-fueled spending to keep its economy growing.

Mr. Yi can\u2019t end that policy on his own, but he can tell bankers that they can recognize bad loans on their books without worrying so much about keeping their unprofitable state-sponsored clients afloat. And he can encourage them to focus instead on lending to private firms at the higher interest rates that they are now allowed to charge.\n\nOtherwise, China\u2019s government will not be able to shift its growth model from one driven by (often wasteful) investment in unproductive factories and ghost cities to one driven by consumer spending.

On Sunday, the day after Mr. Xi was reappointed president, the front page of the People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s main newspaper, and other papers were dominated by large pictures of Mr. Xi, underscoring his unrivaled status.\n\n\u201cXi and his supporters within the Chinese Communist Party have broken the post-Mao-era taboo of promoting one individual leader above the whole party,\u201d said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor of political science at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand who studies Chinese propaganda. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a People\u2019s Daily cover like that \u2014 big red headlines and only one leader\u2019s face featured in the photos \u2014 since circa 1966-1976.\u201d\n\nMr. Li\u2019s annual news conference on Tuesday, usually a highlight of the final day of the congress, now seemed an afterthought.

It has clear parallels with the \u201cgreat helmsman,\u201d a phrase used in the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s to venerate Mao Zedong, China\u2019s founding revolutionary leader. The Chinese word used for Mao the \u201chelmsman\u201d (duoshou) was slightly different from the one used for Mr. Xi (zhangduozhe).\n\nBut still, for many Chinese, the term inevitably evoked Mao and the Cultural Revolution, said Zhang Lifan, a historian and former businessman in Beijing. \u201cThe helmsman is the one who steers the direction of the craft,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was also a song about how a ship at sea depends on its helmsman.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Xi does not approach Mao in raw, untethered power, the glorification of Mr. Xi has approached levels not seen in Chinese politics since that time. During the congress, some delegates swooned and wept about Mr. Xi.\n\nParty media outlets have suggested that Mr. Xi will not remain leader for life, despite facing no term limits. But some lawmakers would hear none of that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI felt this wave of heat from people around me,\u201d one delegate, Du Meishuang from Hunan Province in southern China, told reporters after Mr. Xi won his second term as president on Saturday. \u201cIt should be lifelong, a whole life. That\u2019s what the hearts of the ordinary people are saying, really.\u201d\n\nSuch fervor in the Great Hall of the People was unthinkable under Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, a poker-faced functionary. Even Deng Xiaoping, for all his personal power, discouraged personal adulation as a dangerous remnant of Mao\u2019s time.\n\nMore measured advocates of Mr. Xi have said his power must be extended and consolidated so that China can push through hard economic changes essential to ensuring the country\u2019s continued prosperity. They also point to the rot of corruption that set in during the collective leadership of Mr. Xi\u2019s predecessors.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the things that need to be done \u2014 and the big three right now are controlling financial risk, eliminating extreme poverty and pollution \u2014 he is now more able to affect more changes than ever before,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a biographer of Chinese leaders who appears on China\u2019s main state television network. \u201cBecause any resistance will realize that it\u2019s futile and they can\u2019t wait him out.\u201d\n\nBut the acclaim for Mr. Xi has unnerved Chinese people and foreign observers who fear hubris by a leader unrestrained by checks and balances. In private chats over recent weeks, retired officials and academics in Beijing have also said Mr. Xi\u2019s inflated power may encourage him to press harder for the return of Taiwan, the democratically governed island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. Mr. Xi\u2019s latest comments appeared likely to encourage that view.\n\n\u201cNow you have almost all the power in your hands, and you have all the trusted people on your team, you need to deliver miracles,\u201d Ding Xueliang, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who studies Chinese politics, said before Mr. Xi\u2019s speech. \u201cXi Jinping needs to deliver something big, and Taiwan is something very, very big.\u201d", "title": "China\u2019s New \u2018Helmsman\u2019 Offers a Strident Nationalist Message", "authors": ["Chris Buckley"]}

LoVett played in seven games as the Red Storm began the nonconference schedule by winning 10 of 12, but then he got hurt and subsequently left school, reportedly to turn pro.\n\nA 2016 recruiting coup went bad when Zach Brown, a 7-foot center from Florida, was arrested on a robbery charge, then dropped.

He also served as the chief financial officer of International Paper, and more recently, took on that role at the Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor.\n\nMr. Liddell would also bring extensive management experience from his time in politics.\n\nIn 2012, he served as the executive director of Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential transition team, where his job centered on process, not policy.

The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna.\n\nThe deal would ensure that all of the major pharmacy benefit managers would have ties to big insurers. CVS Health, which also owns pharmacies, recently announced a merger agreement with the health insurer Aetna. OptumRx is owned by the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. Anthem, which operates for-profit Blue Cross plans in several states, said it had plans to create its own pharmacy business.\n\nWith no other large independent pharmacy managers left for smaller insurers, federal and state officials could be reluctant to approve the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department who is a fierce critic of mergers of insurers and pharmacy managers. The CVS-Aetna deal could face the same problem, he said.\n\n\u201cHistory has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert,\u201d Mr. Balto said.\n\nOther antitrust experts said it was unclear how the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts would reshape the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as obvious an antitrust risk as other deals,\u201d said Leemore S. Dafny, a business professor at Harvard. The deal could make the insurance industry more competitive by giving Cigna, which is not a major player in some markets, a way to challenge the dominant companies, she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHealth insurers, thwarted by federal regulators in their attempts to combine with one another, have been hunting for possible acquisitions. Thursday\u2019s deal came little over a year after a judge blocked a proposed $48 billion merger of Cigna and Anthem. A judge also blocked a $37 billion deal between Aetna and another health insurer, Humana, last year.\n\nThe insurance companies now say they need to integrate the delivery of care and pharmacy benefits into their own operations in order to tackle high medical costs. UnitedHealth, for example, has been acquiring doctors\u2019 practices and surgery centers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of vertical integration,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers.

Berkshire\u2019s founder, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, described those costs as a \u201cgrowing tapeworm on the American economy.\u201d\n\nAdam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, which studies the drug industry, said the recent mergers may lead to better coordination because the companies will be looking at health care from multiple angles.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything you are thinking about is pharmacy costs, everything looks like a drug pricing problem.\u201d\n\nSome experts, though, see the combinations as potentially harmful. George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, which also raised concerns about the Aetna-CVS merger, said in a statement that these deals \u201ccould result in restricted choices throughout the marketplace, ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers.\u201d\n\nCraig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said that whether consumers ultimately benefit \u201cwill hinge entirely on the amount of competition in the health insurance market.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the model of a pharmacy benefit manager has also come under scrutiny. The pharmaceutical industry, among others, argues that benefit managers are profiting from higher drug prices by keeping a percentage for themselves. The Trump administration made a similar argument in February, noting that the top three benefits managers controlled 85 percent of the market.\n\nOn Wednesday, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a speech that the situation had created \u201cmisaligned incentives,\u201d as the discounts that manufacturers negotiate \u201cmay not always be passed along to employers or consumers.\u201d\n\nMr. Wentworth, the Express Scripts executive, said the company was \u201cfully transparent about how the money flows and the contracts we do.\u201d", "title": "Cigna to Buy Express Scripts in $52 Billion Health Care Deal", "authors": ["Katie Thomas", "Reed Abelson", "Chad Bray"]}

Bazin Paris with bronze statues. The elephant head, a centaur, the stork and the Nobosudru head were presented: numbered editions of eight in large formats and 100 in smaller sizes.\n\nThe pieces were cast by the art foundry Fusions, a heritage business recognized by the French state, based in the Auvergne region. Prices begin at 950 euros ($1,170) for a small centaur; large sizes are available by order.\n\nThis spring, that lineup has expanded into jewelry, beginning with the Croisi\u00e8re Noire collection: four variations of Nobosudru, said to have been the favorite of a Mangbetu chief in the Belgian Congo (now, the Democratic Republic of Congo). The most striking is a 3-D statement piece that reprises her elongated profile on a ring. The Favorite earrings sway with chain fringe; the Mangbetu bracelet portrays her in full-face relief. Coiffe, the most discreet and gender-neutral theme, reinterprets the concentric circles of her headdress on pendant and bracelet discs.\n\nPhoto\n\nPrices for jewelry range from \u20ac150 for a silver and leather bracelet to \u20ac460 for the fringed earrings. Like the sculptures, the pieces are made using the lost wax technique and finished by hand. Ms. Bazin said she deliberately chose to work in silver without rhodium plating so that, with wear, the jewelry would take on the same kind of patina as a sculpture.\n\nMs. Bazin said that, of the 70 or more possible ornaments to choose among, she decided to start with Croisi\u00e8re Noire for its femininity: \u201cWith jewelry, you can talk about the woman, the sculpture, adventure and an extraordinary era all at once.\u201d", "title": "Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Croisi\u00e8re Noire Sculpture Becomes Jewelry", "authors": ["Tina Isaac-Goiz\u00e9"]}

The new hires were slated to work for the various committees that have already been a priority for Mr. Johnson, including 20 for a newly constituted investigations division, 20 to work on recommendations for changes to the City Charter \u2014 a rival effort to one proposed by the mayor \u2014 and a large increase in the size of the Council\u2019s finance division, to 66 from 38.

Mr. Johnson said those positions would include an extra \u201cbody man\u201d \u2014 a person who helps with his personal needs \u2014 to cover what Mr. Johnson said was a seven-day-a-week schedule, and two positions he promised during the speaker\u2019s race, one apiece for the Council\u2019s women\u2019s caucus and its progressive caucus.\n\nBudget analysts questioned the necessity, size and timing of the increases, which come amid concern over cuts from Washington and a possible economic downturn on the horizon. Mr. de Blasio, for his part, has highlighted the reserves his budget has amassed and the spending reductions at city agencies he has requested \u2014 even as his administration grew the budget substantially to $87 billion over his first term.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to beef up the Council\u2019s analytic capacity, but 130 new people is quite an increase,\u201d said Carol Kellermann, president of the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission, a city budget watchdog, adding that the Council should have to show the necessity of that steep an increase in staffing. \u201cIf a city agency came in and asked for a 27 percent increase, the Council would rightfully be quite skeptical.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson said there was \u201cnothing in this budget that I\u2019m uncomfortable with,\u201d and added that some of the money was aimed at seeking better pay for Council staffers whose salaries are often far lower than those across City Hall in the mayor\u2019s office and at city agencies.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues we have here at the Council is that we lose staff,\u201d he said.", "title": "City Council\u2019s Latest Power Play: Giving Itself More Money", "authors": ["J.

Scheidemann, a local real estate and insurance agent and lifelong resident. The spirit of acceptance was famously demonstrated three years ago when the Clifton High School senior class selected a Muslim student who wore a hijab as its best-dressed female student.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor residents, the ethnic diversity is a selling point, even if some were initially unaware of it. Jason Chuon, who bought a $380,000 expanded Cape Cod after being uprooted from Staten Island by Hurricane Sandy, said he was worried that his Asian-American family might stand out. That was not the case in a town with vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian and Eastern European communities.\n\n\u201cWe have friends here who are Muslim, Hispanic, you name it,\u201d said Mr. Chuon, a 38-year-old online marketer. \u201cThere\u2019s a Colombian guy on one side of me, a Polish lady on the other.

The city, which takes up five ZIP codes, is defined by its distinct neighborhoods, most with their own commercial districts, public elementary schools and parks. (Old-timers tend to say they\u2019re from Athenia or Allwood or Botany Village rather than Clifton.)\n\nWhat is called downtown Clifton is Main Avenue. Along this low-rise thoroughfare stretching between the Paterson and Passaic borders are Peruvian restaurants, hookah stores, Turkish markets \u2014 even a pierogi maker.\n\nAmong the neighborhoods, Allwood is known for its district of Tudor-style homes; Albion, in the shadow of the Garret Mountain Reservation, has street after street of tidy Cape Cods; Clifton Center, which includes Main Avenue, abounds with older, multifamily colonials on narrow lots. The most expensive properties are in Montclair Heights and Rosemawr.\n\nCondominiums and rentals are in ample supply. Cambridge Crossings, a 15-year-old gated townhouse community on a former industrial tract, has several hundred homes, some for ages 55 and older. Country Club Towers, next to the Upper Montclair Country Club, has 476 rental apartments in a pair of 1960s-era high-rises.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClifton\u2019s largest development project in years is in the early stages. A medical school affiliated with Seton Hall University and Hackensack Meridian Health is expected to begin operating later this year at the former headquarters of pharmaceutical giant Roche, once Clifton\u2019s largest taxpayer. The 116-acre site on Route 3, partly in Nutley, is being reimagined as a life sciences campus consisting of the medical school and ancillary businesses, including a hotel. New construction is planned for the Clifton portion. \u201cFive years from now, we hope to be talking about hundreds of new jobs,\u201d Mayor James Anzaldi said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\n\n\u201cAt the low-end, you can pick up a small one-family house in the $250,000 to $300,000 range in areas bordering Paterson and Passaic, and at the high end, you might find a million-dollar home in Montclair Heights,\u201d said Nicholas Tselepis, broker-owner of the Nicholas Real Estate Agency in Clifton. Mr. Tselepis noted that Clifton\u2019s accessibility and relative affordability appeal to buyers from New York City.\n\nOn Mar. 8, the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service website showed 137 properties for sale, the majority of them single-family houses, with about 60 in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. A dozen listings were for $599,000 and up, with the most expensive a $1.19 million custom-built Cape with four bedrooms and four and a half baths, in Rosemawr.\n\nFrom May 1, 2017, to Feb. 28, 2018, the median sale price for a single-family house was $336,000; for a condo or townhouse, $285,000; and for a two- to four-family house, $384,250, versus $308,000, $318,000 and $322,500 in the same period a year earlier, according to the Multiple Listing Service.\n\nAfter the new federal tax law capped the property tax deduction at $10,000, a survey by the city found that about three-quarters of homeowners were already at or under the $10,000 threshold, Mr. Anzaldi said.\n\nThe Vibe\n\nResidents of this suburban melting pot rally around their lone high school and its high-stepping Mustang Marching Band.

From the Delawanna station, it is five minutes shorter and costs $5.50 one way, or $170 monthly.\n\nThe Schools\n\nThe Clifton district has 14 numbered grade schools, most enrolling 200 to 500 students. Christopher Columbus and Woodrow Wilson middle schools, each enrolling about 1,200, serve grades 6 to 8.\n\nClifton High School, on Colfax Avenue, is one of New Jersey\u2019s largest public high schools, with 2,924 students. Mean SAT schools for 2016-17 were 516 in reading and writing and 519 in math, versus 551 and 552 statewide. Sixty-one percent of the class of 2017 went on to college, versus 71 percent statewide.\n\nThe History\n\nVoters of Acquackanonk township greenlighted incorporation as a city in 1917 and ditched the tongue-twisting Lenni Lenape name in favor of Clifton, a reference to a prominent local cliff.\n\nThough a ways from Yankee Stadium, Clifton has Bronx Bomber connections.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "There are six types of concussions: vestibular, ocular, fatigue, anxiety/mood, migraine headaches and cervical. Each of those concussions\u2019 symptoms has different triggers. For example, symptoms of an ocular concussion, which affects visual tasks and the ability to track moving objects, can be prompted by being in the bright light of a cellphone or being in a long passageway, Collins said. The Yankees, citing privacy laws, have not said what type of concussion Frazier has.\n\nEach type of concussion has distinctive therapies.\n\n\u201cIf you can have 30 different types of knee injuries, why do we think there\u2019s one type of concussion?\u201d said Collins, who added that each type of concussion has about 20 subsets. \u201cThere\u2019s different treatment to those different problems. Science is progressing rapidly now that we know it\u2019s not a homogeneous thing.\u201d\n\nAs diverse as the treatments might be for a concussion, they are almost all active, involving some sort of exercise or exposure to conditions that might exacerbate symptoms, Collins said. What is important is not pushing too far or easing off too much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brain injury; it takes awhile to recover,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a treatable problem. The best way to prevent concussions is to manage it effectively when you have one.\u201d\n\nThough concussions are typically associated with high-impact sports like football or hockey, or in a sport that requires heading a ball, like soccer, they do occur with some frequency in baseball. The Yankees, for example, have had a player get a concussion in six of the last seven seasons.\n\nAn ocular concussion can be significant for a baseball player, given how it impacts vision. \u201cTry to hit a 95-mile-per-hour fastball with really good eyes,\u201d said Collins, who treated the former Yankees infielder Stephen Drew when his 2015 season ended with a concussion he received after being hit in the face with a ground ball.\n\nResearch is indicating that even when players return from a concussion, their performance lags in the weeks upon their return. Erin Wasserman led a study of the performance of players who spent time on the disabled list with a concussion between 2007 and 2013, and used as a control group players who went on paternity or bereavement leave.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWasserman found that batting average dropped 31 points, slugging percentage declined 62 points and on-base-plus-slugging percentage fell by 99 points in the first two weeks upon players\u2019 returns from concussions. Performance was still lower four to six weeks after returning, but not significantly so, Wasserman said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe symptoms and neurocognitive computerized testing is all we have to measure whether an athlete is recovered, but the neurocognitive areas that are required for hitting may not be fully recovered,\u201d said Wasserman, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Datalys Center for sports injury research in Indianapolis. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find any evidence that it was dangerous for these players to return, but there may still be some sort of deficit.\u201d\n\nThat may help explain why Yankees center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who missed a month with a concussion last season, experienced a sharp decline in his performance when he returned, leading to his eventual benching.\n\nEllsbury was having a solid season, batting .281 with a .771 O.P.S., when he crashed into the center-field wall at Yankee Stadium making a catch. In a little over three weeks between his return and his benching, Ellsbury batted .177 with a .497 O.P.S.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nEllsbury declined to be interviewed for this article, but General Manager Brian Cashman said that Ellsbury\u2019s decline after the concussion was not a surprise and that it was explained by a neurologist last season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a period of time they\u2019ve got to work through on their own, regardless,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cYou have to grind it out and be patient.\u201d\n\nEventually, Ellsbury found his peak form, hitting .337 with a .912 O.P.S. in September.\n\nA tipping point in how baseball began to view concussions came 10 years ago with Ryan Church, a Mets outfielder whose career was derailed after he was allowed to continue to play for about a week despite experiencing symptoms from his second concussion in a two-month period. After a steep decline in performance, Church retired after the 2010 season at age 31.\n\nHis case spurred Major League Baseball to develop a concussion protocol, which was updated in the most recent collective bargaining agreement in 2016. It requires baseline testing of players when they enter professional baseball and dictates what tests must be administered before a player can return. It also allows for a seven-day concussion disabled list, removing an incentive for teams to keep players off what was then a 15-day disabled list. (It has since been shortened to 10 days.)\n\nIt also calls for a game to be stopped and a player to be evaluated on the field by a trainer if there is an incident that carries a high risk of concussion. If the trainer detects signs of a concussion, the player must be removed and examined further. But because a concussion\u2019s cause can be so nebulous, it is hard to know just what constitutes a high-risk collision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor example, Ellsbury was allowed to remain in a game last May after running into the wall at Yankee Stadium to make a catch. But when he was re-examined at the end of the inning, he was removed from the game. He missed a little more than a month.\n\nIt is not clear how Frazier became injured. He fell backward making a catch on Feb. 24 in Bradenton, Fla., and his head hit the wall. A trainer did not examine him until he came off the field at the end of the inning. Later in the game, Frazier caught a ball on the warning track and his shoulder hit the wall, jarring him. He did not begin experiencing symptoms \u2014 a headache and nausea \u2014 until after the team returned from Bradenton.\n\nFrazier has undergone a CT scan and an M.R.I. and has visited regularly with a league neurologist, as well as one in the Tampa area.\n\nAfter Frazier spoke with reporters last Saturday, expressing his frustration that the symptoms had improved but had not cleared up, he was barred by Cashman from speaking to the news media.\n\nCashman pointed to the N.F.L. and the N.B.A., which make their players off limits to the news media while they are recovering from concussions.\n\nAsked when Frazier, who had come to spring training motivated to make the opening day roster, might get back on the field, Cashman shrugged.\n\n\u201cNo one can predict that,\u201d he said.", "title": "Clint Frazier Is Part of Baseball\u2019s Evolution on Concussions", "authors": ["Billy Witz"]}

In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday morning, he said he was confident the tariffs would not hurt economic growth, as many economists have warned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re going to manage through this so that it is not detrimental to our growth projections,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nMr. Cohn\u2019s departure comes amid the ascendence of advisers who have urged the president to take tougher action on trade. Peter Navarro, a trade skeptic who had been sidelined by Mr. Cohn, has been promised a promotion and made the rounds on Sunday talk shows to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversaw an investigation that led to the tariffs, succeeded in moving up the announcement even as Mr. Cohn sought to delay it. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has become a trusted adviser to the president.\n\nThose advisers have a much more binary view of trade, seeing it as a zero-sum game in which the United States is losing. They have pushed the president to withdraw from deals like Nafta unless trading partners agree to sharp concessions and to implement the type of stiff tariffs that he seems prepared to impose on steel and aluminum imports. Mr. Cohn has argued against some of the tougher positions that economists and businesses say could disrupt global supply chains, drive up costs for American businesses and hurt consumers.\n\nThe rise of the populist faction is already fanning fears on Wall Street and among foreign officials that Mr. Trump could start and escalate a global trade war or take a more combative stance toward trading partners and international groups like the World Trade Organization. Foreign officials viewed Mr. Cohn as a reliable ally on global economic issues and someone who could express their views to the president.", "title": "Cohn\u2019s Departure Widens Policy Rift Between Party and President", "authors": []}

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nAs a manager raised in the 1970s, I am sensitive to differences between myself and my younger staff members, most of whom were raised in the 1990s. That said, I was surprised to stumble upon an apparent point of differentiation during the course of a conversation about childhood. I mentioned drinking out of a garden hose as a child, and younger staffers reacted with disgust and revulsion: \u201cYou drank all of those germs? Ugh!\u201d I thought of this recently after I was out sick for two days with a cold. Fully recovered, I returned to work \u2014 and one member of my staff, who was a good five yards away, backed into a wall. This usually warm employee muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get sick,\u201d and darted into her office. Another staff member, in my office for a meeting, wouldn\u2019t touch anything, and closed the door with his elbow, presumably avoiding contagion. Throughout the day, he and his colleagues followed me silently with wet wipes, erasing my path of \u201cgerms.\u201d I\u2019m not an untidy or unclean person. In fact, I am rather fastidious. And I was perfectly healthy during this episode. I find this behavior rude and unprofessional, and can\u2019t imagine the reaction if they had treated a visitor to our office in the same way. How do I discuss this issue with workers who \u2014 given these dubious \u201cprevention\u201d tactics \u2014 evidently believe their own health comes before social propriety and respect to others? C.P., NEW YORK\n\nAnecdotal evidence aside, I think the generational angle is probably a distraction. A survey last year conducted on behalf of CityMD, a chain of urgent-care clinics, found that people ages 18 to 35 who had experienced \u201cflulike symptoms\u201d were much more likely than those above that age to venture into the world despite feeling sick.\n\nBefore we go any further, let\u2019s acknowledge that people who are sick and potentially contagious should not go to the office. And yet anyone who has ever worked in an office has experienced the sniffling, sneezing, hacking co-worker who insists on coming in. People do this for all sorts of reasons \u2014 from economic necessity to the misguided sense that the enterprise can\u2019t get by without them. The possibly contagious colleague is among the most familiar villains of office life.\n\nWe\u2019ve all encountered this menace, and especially during a rough flu season, it is understandable that your co-workers are worried. Address the situation directly, but keep it light: Treat the whole episode as a simple (and, like your note, amusing) misunderstanding, rather than a generational showdown. Assure your colleagues that you are well, and no threat to their health. Then pivot into your management role and make precisely the points you are making here. Affirm that you value your colleagues too much to put their health at risk \u2014 and that they need to show you the same respect.", "title": "Colleagues Think You\u2019re Contagious.

Or rather, because he has loved some women and one cat, and learned a few things along the way. In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E. B. White and David Sedaris, an affable hero gamely bumbles through adventures rich with moments of fleeting profundity and moral reckoning. He follows a manic circus tutor on a train to Mexico, falls for a fellow cartoonist amid the early aughts\u2019 war on terror and trysts with a politically enlightened prostitute. These stories entertain, though I prefer him being wittily deprecated by his female companions to his drawing binaries between \u201c\u2018Type A\u2019: smart, pretty, sane, moral girls with glasses who tended to work for nonprofits or write\u201d and \u201cbawdy dominatrices\u201d (to be fair, this reviewer is a Type A, former bawdy dominatrix who writes). But his depictions of the arc from ignorance to wisdom are reliably deft. With every blunder he gleans insights like \u201cHowever salacious it may seem to civilians, that\u2019s what prostitution is: another goddamn job.\u201d\n\nKreider is a curious and compassionate observer and a fantastic wit \u2014 I laughed to tears more than once. Though he excels at romantic comedy, the essays that stray from that convention resound longer, like \u201cThe Strange Situation,\u201d which ambitiously explores his relationship patterns vis-\u00e0-vis his childhood participation in the psychologist Mary Ainsworth\u2019s famous study on attachment theory.\n\nThese are pleasurable, well-wrought essays, though they sometimes feel like a throwback to a time when we were more easily charmed by the affable straight white man. In an essay about teaching at a former women\u2019s college, he is thrilled by not wanting to sleep with his students. His self-examination manages to be both endearing and irksomely self-congratulatory. That is, the character of Kreider is a good guy \u2014 self-aware, if not always scrutinizing. But how does the joke go? Why did the male feminist walk into the bar? Because it was set so low.\n\nTHIS WILL BE MY UNDOING\n\nLiving at the Intersection of Black, Female, and Feminist in (White) America\n\nBy Morgan Jerkins\n\n258 pp. Harper Perennial.

But the tale that begins \u201cWhen I was 10, I realized that I was black\u201d is not the cozy cultural appropriation fable of \u201cBring It On.\u201d Not because of its unhappy ending, but because it centers the black female experience. Much of the book\u2019s language is this deceptively simple: \u201cI couldn\u2019t make the team because I was not human.\u201d Without turning linguistic or lyrical cartwheels, Jerkins lucidly articulates social dynamics that have dictated the realities of American black women for centuries, like how white feminism erases black women. \u201cThis book is not about all women,\u201d Jerkins explains at the end of the opening essay, \u201cbut it is meant for all women, and men, and those who do not adhere to the gender binary. It is for you.\u201d Indeed, it is a book I wish everyone in this country would read.", "title": "Collections of Essays by Writers Old and Young", "authors": []}

This is the first season of an expanded coach\u2019s box, which is the area the head coach may patrol during play. Vigorous sideline generals received an extra 10 feet this season; they may now roam from the baseline all the way to a mark 38 feet away. That\u2019s a midrange jump shot from midcourt, which is 47 feet from the baseline.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI have had officials tell me that it was expanded for me,\u201d Weber said.\n\nCollege basketball coaches are easy subjects for ridicule. N.B.A. fans scoff at their hyperactivity and point to professional coaches\u2019 comparatively calm mien, even though N.B.A. coaches may stray as much as 43 feet from the baseline. Casual observers wonder why these blustering, nattily dressed bombasts can\u2019t stay cool.\n\nThe college coaches say they deserve sympathy. Their charges are younger than most players in the N.B.A. Their teams can feel especially far away while on defense, seeking crucial late-game stops out of vocal range for even the loudest coach. Most coaches are former players with decades of experience who now watch mostly helplessly as post-adolescents try to implement months of training in a few essential seconds. Their antics also make for great TV.\n\nYet they have to stay inside an invisible box during games or risk a penalty that could tangibly hurt their team. The correct call for a coach\u2019s box violation after a warning is a Class B technical foul, giving the other team one free throw and the ball, inbounded where it was when the foul was called.\n\n\u201cI have a young team, and sometimes they don\u2019t talk,\u201d Alabama Coach Avery Johnson said last week between first- and second-round games. \u201cYou can hear it in my voice. I\u2019ve got to talk for them. I got warned yesterday, and, probably, going to get warned tomorrow.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite plenty of yelling and straying, Johnson and Alabama lost to Duke on Sunday night.\n\nIn a world where referees \u201cT-up\u201d coaches for far more subjectively determined violations, there is an argument that the coach\u2019s box is extraneous, even condescending. Anecdotally, there appear to be few T\u2019s actually called (the N.C.A.A. said it did not keep the statistic). Kansas Coach Bill Self complained that he had been whistled once this year \u201cfor sticking my toe two inches outside the box.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe represent universities,\u201d South Carolina Coach Frank Martin said in a phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re grown men. We\u2019re employed. We get treated like we\u2019re immature. We\u2019ve got to be in this small little confined area. We\u2019re not going to go to the other bench and instigate something.\u201d\n\nThis understanding was partly why the box was expanded, according to Art Hyland, secretary-rules editor of the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball rules committee. It is also why referees are instructed to first give the bench a warning.\n\n\u201cPeople felt empathy that the coaches really needed a little more room in order to do their job correctly,\u201d Hyland said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn extra 10 feet turns out to be a lot, Self said Thursday in Omaha before the Jayhawks\u2019 round of 16 game. He thought it was a \u201cpretty insignificant change\u201d when it was announced last June, but now that it has been in place for a season, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a great rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou feel like you can actually have a little bit more communication on the other end of the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, before Thursday night\u2019s violation, Calipari blamed the tight strictures of the old box for one of the most infamous coach\u2019s box technical fouls in the college game.\n\nIn 1992, Calipari\u2019s Massachusetts team was playing Kentucky in the round of 16 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The Minutemen had made up most of a double-digit deficit late in the second half when a referee called a technical foul on Calipari for a coach\u2019s box violation. The referee \u201cwas 50 feet away from the UMass bench when he called it,\u201d The Baltimore Sun reported. The call swung the momentum back the Wildcats\u2019 way, and they won. (They lost the next game to Duke on Christian Laettner\u2019s famous buzzer-beater.)\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAt the Spectrum where they had all those lines,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cI\u2019m standing there and the guy calls a T from 90 feet away. \u2018You\u2019re out of the box.\u2019 And I really wasn\u2019t out of the box, but it looked like it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCalipari had no such defense or excuse Thursday night.\n\nIn practice, there is frequently a live-and-let-live dynamic between referees and hyperactive coaches. Warnings are issued; actual fouls, less so.\n\nEd Hightower, a retired referee, said officials often find that assistant coaches are better interlocutors for conveying the warnings. Speraw, Weber\u2019s assistant, said that the referees had spoken to the staff at halftime of the U.M.B.C. game.\n\nWhen warning coaches that they were in danger of violating this rule, Hightower said he would often say, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make me do something I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the time, I would say, the coaches are just so caught up in the moment, coaching their kids,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional sport.\u201d", "title": "College Coaches Cannot Be Contained", "authors": ["Marc Tracy"]}

The tax would increase over time. That money would then be returned to taxpayers in a per-person monthly payment, with half-payments going to children under the age of 18 and a limit of two children per family. The Climate Leadership Council created by Mr. Baker and Mr. Shultz estimates a dividend would amount to about $2,000 a year for a family of four.\n\nAs part of the deal, there would also be limitations on regulatory actions like the Clean Power Plan, which former President Barack Obama impose d to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Members of the coalition said they considered a promise to scale back future regulation key to encouraging Republican support.\n\nAlexander Posner, 22, a Yale University senior who founded the group, said he has been interested in climate change and energy for years.

This coalition on the climate front is sort of a reflecting of the inaction of adults.\u201d\n\nLast week the nonprofit Alliance for Market Solutions issued a survey on millennial attitudes toward climate change showing that nearly 60 percent of young Republicans acknowledge that human-induced climate change is real, and 88 percent of young Democrats .

According to Human Rights Watch, more than seven million Colombians were displaced, disappeared or murdered during the 52 years of fighting. The Museum of Modern Art was founded by artists in 1978 and opened its doors to the public in 1980.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t go out then,\u201d said the museum\u2019s director Mar\u00eda Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez. \u201cLife took place indoors.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "The three bottles I recommended were: Ch\u00e2teau Aney Haut-M\u00e9doc 2013, Ch\u00e2teau Moulin de Tricot Haut-M\u00e9doc 2013 and Ch\u00e2teau le Puy Emilien Francs C\u00f4te de Bordeaux 2013.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe two Haut-M\u00e9docs are from the so-called Left Bank, the region to the west of the Garonne River encompassing the M\u00e9doc north of the city of Bordeaux and Graves to the south. The Emilien is from Francs C\u00f4te de Bordeaux on the Right Bank, the area north and east of the Dordogne River.\n\nThe Aney and Moulin de Tricot are both dominated by cabernet sauvignon, grown on gravel soils, supplemented by merlot. The le Puy, by contrast, is mostly merlot grown on clay and limestone, with some cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon.\n\nOne reader, NK of Washington, D.C., was perplexed by the choices.\n\n\u201cWhy did you pick two Left Banks and one Right Bank?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeems like we would be comparing apples to oranges.\u201d\n\nWell, sort of. Except in this case we were talking about the larger entity of Bordeaux rather than the specific terroir of one appellation within that region. In addition, I\u2019m thrilled that so many readers take the challenge of buying three bottles and comparing them. That adds another dimension to Wine School. But I don\u2019t expect all readers to do that, and it is not necessary. All you need is one of the bottles to participate.\n\nNow, many readers drank wines from other vintages, and found enjoyable wines, bearing out the original intent of the selections. But even those who drank the 2013s found some pleasure in the wines.\n\nFor me, the 2013s recalled Bordeaux I drank in the 1980s, resolutely dry, with flavors more herbal than fruity. Consumer tastes have evolved over the last 30 years, and many people would describe these wines as lean and weedy. Napa Valley, known for the opulent fruitiness of its wines, would fall to its knees and beg forgiveness if it produced bottles like these. But honestly, these wines are a lot easier to drink with food today than many highly praised Napa bottles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe key element here is \u201cwith food.\u201d I believe that wine is at its best as part of the synergy of food, wine and conversation, even if the conversation is simply an internal dialogue. And that, to me, is how these 2013s need to be enjoyed.\n\nWithout food, they were tart and somewhat cedary. More modern styles of Bordeaux, which you would see in vintages like 2012 or 2015, are rounder, fruitier and easier-going. You can enjoy a glass on its own, even though it would still improve with food. For me, the 2013s came alive with braised pork shoulder, fulfilling the bottom-line requirement of a wine, as is generally the case with classic Bordeaux, of simply being a good, fresh drink.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Moulin de Tricot was herbal, straightforward and refreshing. The Aney seemed a bit riper and smoother, though also compact and refreshing. The le Puy had almost a menthol edge to its aroma. It seemed a trifle richer than the Haut-M\u00e9docs, and a little more tannic. It was pure and also refreshing.\n\nreader perspectives Eric Asimov, The New York Times\n\nwine critic, is talking about\n\nvalue Bordeaux.\n\nIf you would like to join the conversation,\n\ntry one of the bottles listed here and as you try them, ask yourself these questions.

Freshness Are the wines alive and vibrant? Drinkability Do they refresh? Food Taste them before you eat. Are they different with food? respond\n\nNone of these bottles really have the potential to age. They lack structure, and the tart flavors will not evolve in particularly attractive ways. Yet these wines have their uses. They are ready to drink now, and if they are on a restaurant wine list, a 2013 might be preferable to a wine from a better vintage that is not yet ready to drink. But I would not want to pay a lot of money for them.\n\nRegardless of the particulars of these \u201913s, the question comes up: What priority should consumers place on vintages?\n\nFor many simple wines, like the vins de soifs we drank last summer, vintage will not be particularly important. But for wines that will evolve and develop nuance and complexity over time, vintage can be crucial to their personality \u2014 though not as important as the skill, intent and conscientiousness of the producer.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These years often require many years of aging before they can be pleasurable.\n\nMeanwhile, years that may not conform to certain definitions of great may still offer great pleasures, while being cheaper and ready to drink far sooner.\n\nI have seen this in Burgundy, where people flocked to the \u201999, \u201902, \u201905 and \u201909 vintages. Many of these wines are still developing, while the \u201900 and \u201907 vintages, far less esteemed, have given plenty of pleasure in the interim. Even the 2004s, which have been roundly assailed as peculiarly green, can offer pleasure. I recently drank a gorgeous \u201904 Chambolle-Musigny from Jacques-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mugnier.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe same phenomenon occurs in Bordeaux. With all the millennial hype paid to the 2000 vintage, 2001, a very good year, was largely ignored. The 2011 vintage was completely overshadowed by the critically acclaimed 2009s and \u201910s. And in Napa Valley, you can find some awfully good 2011s, a vintage that was essentially dismissed as an ugly duckling.\n\nI could go on and on with that sort of thing. But that does not mean the critics were wrong about the 2013 Bordeaux. Those wines are certainly drinkable, but if you have an opportunity, compare them with the 2014s, which, to my mind, is an absolutely delicious vintage. The \u201914s will offer far more pleasure, more nuance and complexity, and will evolve beautifully. Nonetheless, the critics prefer the 2015s, which are richer and rounder.\n\nSome readers agreed with me that these wines required food. Dan Barron of New York described the \u201913 Moulin de Tricot as a \u201creserved, elegant wallflower.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore food, it was no one\u2019s favorite,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt only shone \u2014 or let\u2019s say \u2018glowed\u2019 \u2014 with the lamb, where its weight lent balance and dignity.\u201d\n\nAnd Joseph of Ile de France found a lot to like in the le Puy. With c\u00f4te de boeuf and potatoes, he wrote, it showed \u201cvibrancy and depth.\u201d\n\nNaturally, not everybody saw it as I did. Without food, George Erdle of Charlotte, N.C., found the Aney to be \u201ca harmonious, light, friendly wine that showed a lot of vibrancy.\u201d With beef tacos, he said, it was overwhelmed.\n\nNot everybody will agree with my assessments of vintages, either. Compared with the \u201913s, Tom Lipton of Munich said, \u201cThe \u201912s were far better, and the \u201914s appear to be very tight, ungenerous.\u201d Personally, I far prefer 2014s to 2012s.\n\nSuch differences of opinion are exactly why educated wine consumers need to go beyond critics to drink for themselves. Only by calibrating a sense of their own tastes can people develop a sense of whom to pay attention to and whom to ignore.

She was 38 weeks pregnant at the interview. \u201cBoy, are you fat,\u201d Whedon said. (His producer followed up with, \u201cShould I put down a tarp?\u201d) She didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nIf the sprinkling of sociological terms like \u201cstereotype threat\u201d sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Scovell collaborated with Sheryl Sandberg on her study-laden blockbuster, \u201cLean In.\u201d Sandberg, the Facebook executive, provides the TED Talk-ready foreword to \u201cJust the Funny Parts,\u201d writing that \u201cwhoever said feminists weren\u2019t funny never met Nell.\u201d (At her own mother\u2019s funeral, Scovell, one of five siblings, held up an envelope and announced that it contained \u201cthe name of mom\u2019s favorite child.\u201d) A career in the entertainment industry \u2014 scaled like a jungle gym, not a ladder \u2014 meant Scovell lived \u201cLean In\u201d long before she wrote it, Sandberg says. \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is a record of her scramble, retrofitted with post-\u201cLean In\u201d indignation. (She took Shandling\u2019s words as a compliment at first.)\n\nThe bar for contemporary women-in-comedy books was set in 2011 with Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cBossypants,\u201d which managed advice that was both hilarious and accurate \u2014 no pigtails or tube tops at the office, no diet foods in meetings and cry at work if you must because \u201cit terrifies everyone.\u201d Scovell\u2019s lessons are less jokey and more emotionally bare; she even confesses a few things that our feminist foremothers have taught us to keep buttoned up \u2014 like the lines that she crossed, too \u2014 which feels freeing. Over all, though, \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d functions best not when Scovell is recounting some backstage encounter on \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d or \u201cNewhart\u201d but when she\u2019s rankled. My first laugh came on Page 58, when Scovell, her contributions on a show once again ignored, asks a female co-worker: \u201cAm I corporeal? You can see and hear me, right?\u201d\n\nGender aside, her comedy bona fides are solid: Scovell is from a large, neurotic, bookish, mercilessly honest \u2014 though loving \u2014 Jewish family in Massachusetts. She went to Harvard and wrote for Spy magazine. With a few biographical tweaks, she could be Conan O\u2019Brien. (The two intersected as writers on a short-lived \u201980s talk show.) In typical overachiever fashion, even her failures \u2014 Scovell writes that she was too full of self-doubt to apply for The Harvard Lampoon \u2014 led her somewhere: She became a sportswriter for The Boston Globe, then moved to New York and got a staff job at Vanity Fair. But Scovell soon realized that her high-concept style was better suited for TV. \u201cWriting for TV made way more sense than writing for magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by sense, I mean money.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nFor aspiring writers, the book has just enough practical advice on story pitches and script editing to qualify as a how-to. \u201cWhen I write, I feel like an optometrist, constantly flipping between lenses and asking: \u2018Is this better? Is this?\u2019 Slowly, the work comes into focus,\u201d she explains. An appendix lists all of her jobs, from Lifetime movies to \u201cNCIS,\u201d and, more bracingly for those starting out, the dozens of scripts unproduced over her 30-year career. Along the way, she married an architect and had two sons, and she is brisk about the fact that her husband\u2019s staying at home with the boys \u2014 carting them around to sets as she wrote, produced and directed \u2014 is what made her employable.", "title": "Come-Ons, Takedowns and Insults: What It\u2019s Like to Write Comedy as a Woman", "authors": []}

Weprin, a Queens Democrat who helped lead the opposition.\n\nStill, Mr. Cuomo and some congestion pricing advocates have sought to cast the new surcharge on for-hire vehicles as a first step toward congestion pricing, which would reduce car congestion and establish a long-term revenue source for public transportation. The task force had also recommended a per-ride surcharge of $2 to $5 on for-hire vehicles in a phased-in approach to congestion pricing.\n\nPeter Ajemian, a spokesman for the governor, said the new surcharge fees would \u201cprovide hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue to the M.T.A. every year,\u201d and called the budget \u201ca huge win for the millions of people who rely on mass transit every day.\u201d Fix NYC Transit, another coalition, said, \u201cthe governor and legislative leaders deserve credit for enabling New York to begin tackling our traffic and transit woes.\u201d\n\nThe budget agreement also expands an existing traffic camera program that targets drivers who block bus lanes, and provides funding for half of an $836 million emergency subway repair program, but would force the city to pay the remainder.\n\nSupporters of congestion pricing said they would continue to fight for a congestion zone and other measures.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that traffic challenges, aside from more bus enforcement cameras, are not addressed,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, a member of the task force and president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a group of the city\u2019s top business leaders. \u201cThe legislature is in session until the end of June, and congestion pricing can be taken up outside the budget, so we will continue to urge moving forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile congestion pricing has been shown to work in London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has stalled in New York since at least the 1970s. The last major effort in 2008 by then-Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought to charge drivers $8 to enter a similar congestion zone in Manhattan, but died in Albany after legislative leaders refused to bring it to a vote.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Supporters saw the city\u2019s subway meltdown and daily traffic problems as giving new urgency and momentum to the issue.\n\nBut despite the backing of dozens of influential business, labor, transportation and community groups, congestion pricing\u2019s prospects again waned in Albany. In a sign of things to come, the congestion zone was not in budget amendments submitted by the governor, or in budget proposals by the Republican-led Senate and the Democrat-dominated Assembly.\n\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat who faces re-election in November, came under increasing criticism from advocates who said he did not do enough to move congestion pricing forward. They pointed out that he did not aggressively line up legislative support as he had with other divisive issues such as same-sex marriage and the minimum wage \u2014 a suggestion the governor\u2019s aides rejected.\n\nIn recent weeks, the governor and his aides had sought to work around legislative opposition to the congestion zone by negotiating for authorization of about $200 million for infrastructure and technology investments for a congestion zone. The more controversial details of how it would actually work \u2014 the boundaries, prices, hours and any exemptions \u2014 would be shelved until next year or later.\n\nBut in the end, what they got was the surcharge on for-hire vehicles, whose skyrocketing numbers have added to congestion woes. It was Assembly leaders who initially proposed the $2.75 per-ride surcharge for Uber, Lyft and the other ride-hailing apps, though they have said the surcharge was not about congestion pricing but about raising money for the M.T.A.\n\nOther cities and states \u2014 including Chicago, Philadelphia and Portland, Ore. \u2014 have increasingly imposed fees or taxes on ride-hailing services to raise money. Last year, New York State also approved a 4 percent assessment on trips by the ride-hailing services that begin outside New York City (rides in the city are already subject to state and local taxes), which is expected to raise $24 million a year for the state\u2019s general fund.\n\nToday, more than 103,000 for-hire vehicles operate in New York City, or more than double the roughly 47,000 in 2013, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In contrast, yellow taxis are capped by city law at 13,587.\n\nAlix Anfang, a spokeswoman for Uber, which backed the Fix NYC plan, said that the company supported the new surcharge because it was limited to Manhattan, where there is more congestion and also more transportation options than in the other boroughs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will continue to advocate for the adoption of a comprehensive congestion pricing plan that is applied to all vehicles because it is the best way to fully fund mass transit and reduce traffic in the central business district,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the surcharge on taxis is lower, it is still a blow to an industry that has been decimated by the advent of ride-hailing apps.\n\nTaxi owners and drivers have argued that they should be exempt from any new fees because it is their rapidly expanding rivals who are creating much of the congestion, and because they pay far more for medallions that should already give them access to Manhattan streets.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply concerning and disappointing that the state is piling on costs on the yellow taxi industry when it is well known that the yellow taxi industry and its mainly immigrant medallion owners and drivers are struggling,\u201d said Ron Sherman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents medallion owners.", "title": "Congestion Pricing Falters in New York, Again", "authors": ["Winnie Hu"]}

{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "To this day, gun rights advocates dispute the study\u2019s findings. The N.R.A. pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the C.D.C. from spending taxpayer money on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996, and cut funding that effectively ended the C.D.C.\u2019s study of gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nThe result is that 22 years and more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence.\n\nAfter the Parkland school massacre in Florida last month, lawmakers and gun control experts have demanded that the agency take up the issue of studying gun violence again, arguing that the federal law doesn\u2019t ban such research altogether but prohibits advocacy of gun control.\n\nAlex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said at a congressional hearing that he believed the C.D.C. should resume the work. \u201cWe\u2019re in the science business and the evidence-generating business,\u201d Mr. Azar said, \u201dand so I will have our agency certainly working in this field, as they do across the broad spectrum of disease control and prevention.\u2019\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a meeting with reporters last week, Mr. Azar said that other priorities, like fighting the flu and Ebola, also competed for funds. He did not specify which subjects would be a priority, how much money he might ask Congress to allocate to gun violence research, or whether he will transfer money from other health agency programs.\n\nThere is no shortage of ideas \u2014 or criticism of the time lost in studying gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly and consciously turned our back on the problem,\u201d said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine who in July started the Firearm Violence Research Center at the University of California, Davis, with funding from the state. \u201cHow many thousands of people are dead today who might have been alive if that research effort had been put in place and we had answered critical questions and set prevention measures in motion?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question that haunts researchers. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, President Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider gun violence research. The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine outlining priorities, but never followed up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most pressing questions cited by the institute, now known as the National Academy of Medicine, still have no answers. Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?\n\nThen there is a separate set of questions about what kind of policy changes or prevention efforts actually reduce gun-related deaths and injuries.\n\nAndrew R. Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, directed a recent study that found moderate evidence that background checks do reduce both firearm suicides and homicides. The report also said there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws, which allow people to use guns to defend themselves without first trying to retreat, may increase the murder rate.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, we\u2019ve been having arguments about factual matters for decades,\u201d Mr. Morral said. As an example, he cited laws that seek to prevent children from killing themselves or others with guns.\n\n\u201cThe N.R.A. has argued that such laws make it tough for people to defend themselves in a crisis,\u201d Mr. Morral said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no research on that. We\u2019ve argued and argued and argued, and we have not invested in the research needed to answer the question: What is the trade-off between childhood deaths and self-defense?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe new set of proposals by President Trump calls for a commission to examine whether to raise the age to 21 from 18 for young people to buy certain firearms. Just after the Parkland killings, Mr. Trump repeatedly supported raising the age, but the latest proposals do not include such a measure \u2014 one that the N.R.A. opposes.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, who was director of the C.D.C. from 2009 to 2017, said in an email that he believed the study of firearms-related violence was important even though little was conducted during his tenure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why year after year I asked Congress to fund C.D.C. to do research in this area,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201dWe need to know which interventions are most effective and how they can best be implemented to save the most lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Congress refused to include funding for those proposals, he said. The National Institutes of Health has continued to fund some gun violence research, including violent crimes related to drug and alcohol consumption, and parental roles in preventing injury from firearms.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More than 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides.\n\nThe Justice Department also studies gun violence, but the budget for that research is a small fraction of what the federal government spends on looking at other high-mortality hazards, like car accidents or smoking \u2014 money that has led to actions that greatly reduced deaths in both categories.\n\nPrivate foundations have stepped up to fill the gap. But there is another congressional roadblock that private money cannot circumvent \u2014 the Tiahrt Amendments, which prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement.\n\nThose records, Mr. Morral and other experts say, are crucial to analyze the flow of guns used in crimes over state borders, from places where guns are easy to buy to places where it is tougher.\n\nThe Dickey Amendment technically did not ban gun research, only advocacy. Its real goal \u2014 one it easily achieved, according to public health officials in place at the time \u2014 was to scare federal agencies into thinking twice about even collecting data that might reflect badly on gun ownership.\n\nSince the Parkland murders, there have been signs of change. Several Republican lawmakers said they would support the C.D.C. taking on the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous misunderstanding here and maybe an overabundance of caution on the part of C.D.C. and N.I.H.,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, of Oklahoma, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the health and human services department.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Cole also said he expected there would be money available for such work at both N.I.H. and C.D.C., but not until next year\u2019s appropriations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome Democrats are pressing to take advantage of the new mood on Capitol Hill. Senator Patty Murray, of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, and Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, have both pressed Mr. Azar for details, but as of Friday neither had received a response.\n\n\u201cFrom fighting cancer to decreasing road traffic fatalities, public health research has played a critical role in saving lives,\u201d Ms. Murray wrote to Mr. Azar. \u2018\u2018It is immoral and unacceptable to treat gun violence any differently.\u201d\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Democratic members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce have called for a hearing on the adequacy of federal research into gun violence.\n\nJennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the group continues to support the Dickey Amendment. \u201cWe oppose taxpayer dollars being spent to advocate for gun control,\u201d Ms. Baker said.\n\nAsked if there is any type of research the group would support, she said the N.R.A. would like to see a study of how often firearms are used in self-defense.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine report, published with the National Research Council, is still considered a road map by the C.D.C. The report proposed research on issues like motivations for gun ownership and use; the relationship between poverty and gun use; risk factors that lead youths to carry guns; and dozens of other questions.\n\nThe C.D.C. did ask for and receive money to expand its National Violent Death Reporting System, which tracks homicides and suicides in 40 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The project aims to help state health departments develop strategies to reduce violent deaths, but some critics say the database lacks sufficient detail to be very useful.\n\nResearch proponents want to make sure that new studies don\u2019t serve as an excuse for a lack of action on gun control.\n\n\u201cAlthough more gun research is needed,\u201d Dr. Frieden said, \u201cthere are proven means to reduce gun violence, including better background checks, getting guns away from domestic abusers and people convicted of violent crimes, and safe storage. More research can help. But this is no excuse for inaction.\u201d", "title": "Congress Quashed Research Into Gun Violence. Since Then, 600,000 People Have Been Shot.", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan"]}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "In this time of political division, the broad story line of the omnibus spending bill approved late last week is largely a heartening one. With the Democratic leadership in full resistance mode and the Republicans facing a treacherous political climate in the fall elections, Congress repudiated President Trump\u2019s extreme budget cuts in rare bipartisan fashion. In doing so, it protected a range of domestic programs the president had targeted for huge reductions, if not outright elimination, and sent an infuriated Mr. Trump scuttling off to Mar-a-Lago with yet another problem to worry about: a mediocre Congress making a lazy president look even worse by actually accomplishing something.\n\nA cynic observing this unusual Capitol Hill lovefest could plausibly argue that it\u2019s easy enough for Republicans and Democrats to link arms when there\u2019s serious money to be spent. And it is: There is plenty of old-fashioned pork in this bill. Even so, it is hard to argue with an outcome that preserved and in some cases increased funding for vital health, education, foreign aid, infrastructure and environmental programs while providing a fraction of what Mr. Trump wanted for his border wall \u2014 the presumed reason for his choleric withdrawal to his Florida fortress.\n\nThere is another story line within the broader one, and it too is heartening: the willingness of the Democratic leadership to stand up to mischief-makers in Congress itself. A bill of this magnitude \u2014$1.3 trillion altogether, including hundreds of billions for the military \u2014 is fertile ground for legislators who wish to sneak in provisions that are unlikely to survive on their own and thus need the protective cover of a big must-pass bill. As a rule, these so-called riders have nothing to do with spending and are aimed primarily at changing policy or undermining basic laws.\n\nMost of the most damaging riders in the bill were devised by Republicans and involved environmental policy. Among other things, they would have delayed enforcement of clean-air regulations, killed two Obama-era rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gases from oil and gas wells, weakened protections for endangered species and insulated the Trump administration from legal challenges to its efforts to repeal clean-water rules.", "title": "Opinion | Congress Resists the President, for a Change", "authors": []}

Despite his New York roots, Mr. Trump zeroed in on Gateway and urged Republican leaders not to provide federal funds for it \u2014 an apparent rebuke to Mr. Schumer, whose caucus the president has repeatedly accused of obstructionism.\n\nThe spending bill does not include $900 million in funding for Gateway that had been included last year in House legislation. But according to a senior Senate Democratic aide, it includes hundreds of millions of dollars that could go toward the Gateway program, including funds that do not require the approval of Mr. Trump\u2019s Transportation Department.\n\nAs November\u2019s midterm elections loom, the legislation also includes $380 million for grants to states to improve their election infrastructure and bolster election security.\n\nAnd although Congress has shown little appetite for passing significant gun control legislation in response to the mass shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., the spending bill includes a modest measure to improve reporting to the national background check system for gun purchases. It also includes a measure to provide grants to improve school safety.\n\nCongress approved a broad two-year budget deal last month that paved the way for this week\u2019s legislation. That deal set overall spending levels, raising strict limits on military and domestic spending by a total of about $140 billion this year. The spending bill this week allocates the allowed spending among a vast array of federal programs.\n\nThe bill is long overdue, coming almost halfway through the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. Since then, Congress has needed five stopgap spending measures to keep the government open. By snapping that streak of short-term patches, lawmakers would provide a dose of stability to federal agencies that have been left in limbo as Congress lurched from one stopgap measure to the next.\n\nEven with the spending bill unveiled, there is still some risk of a brief shutdown this weekend, as any one senator can stop the Senate from speeding up consideration of the bill to meet Friday\u2019s deadline.

It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity.\n\nRepublican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, said the party was \u201cnot conceding anything.\u201d", "title": "Conor Lamb Wins Pennsylvania House Seat, Giving Democrats a Map for Trump Country", "authors": []}

You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.\n\nI\u2019m intrigued by one of the ways that Conor Lamb appealed to cultural conservatives in his Pennsylvania congressional campaign. He said that, as a Catholic, he is personally opposed to abortion but that he does not favor new anti-abortion laws.\n\nThis position still makes him pro-choice, of course, even if he rejects the label. It won\u2019t win over committed abortion opponents (like National Review\u2019s Alexandra DeSanctis, who criticized Lamb as a hypocrite).\n\nYet I still find Lamb\u2019s framing to be important. Personal opposition to abortion isn\u2019t just a catchphrase. It has real implications. People who are opposed to abortion \u2014 as well as those who have deep qualms about it \u2014 are unlikely to have fetuses tested for conditions like Down syndrome, to take one example. They\u2019re more likely to believe that babies with the syndrome have as much right to life as those without it.", "title": "Opinion | Conor Lamb and Abortion", "authors": []}

It\u2019s a lesson that bears repeating to Democratic Party leaders, who in recent years effectively surrendered many seats to Republicans under the mistaken belief that Democrats had no chance. For example, the party did not bother fielding candidates during the 2016 and 2014 elections for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District seat, which recent polls show Mr. Lamb could narrowly win on Tuesday. While Donald Trump won the district by 20 percentage points, it has a large population of union members and more registered Democrats than Republicans.\n\nMr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, has campaigned energetically and made striking gains without much help from his party. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put up a small fraction of the money that Republican groups are spending. Even if Mr. Lamb loses on Tuesday, analysts say he could easily win in November, when Pennsylvanians will vote under a new congressional map ordered by the State Supreme Court in an important gerrymandering lawsuit.\n\nThere is no doubt that Mr. Lamb has benefited from running against a lackluster opponent, Rick Saccone, who even many Republicans have privately grumbled is a \u201cweak\u201d candidate. But Mr. Saccone\u2019s weakness, which now seems obvious, would not have been much of a factor in the race had Mr. Lamb not decided to run in the first place. Without a serious Democratic challenger, Mr. Saccone might have coasted to victory like the last person to hold the seat, Tim Murphy, a Republican who resigned after it was revealed that he had encouraged a woman he was having an affair with to have an abortion even though he publicly opposed the procedure. The same argument applies in the case of the special Senate election in Alabama last year, in which the Democrat Doug Jones triumphed against Roy Moore, a Republican who several women said harassed and abused them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.", "title": "Opinion | Conor Lamb\u2019s Lesson for Democrats", "authors": []}

The transaction is encrypted, timestamped and stored. (A blockchain is a collection of digital transactions that are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data.)\n\nWill these apps revolutionize sex? Not likely. As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving.\n\nWhen yes becomes no.\n\nDr. Michelle Drouin, a leading expert on technology and relationships, said the apps are good at documenting consent, but don\u2019t account much for fluctuating human emotions. They don\u2019t necessarily allow for any immediacy of one\u2019s feelings, she said.\n\nUse of the app \u201chas to be planned,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now.\u201d\n\nMr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that\u2019s not always possible.\n\nIf encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website.\n\nThe creators of LegalFling, part of the blockchain company LegalThings, which digitized regulation for the Dutch government, said they decided to apply their technology to sexual consent when, in December, Sweden proposed a law that would require people to get explicit verbal consent before sexual contact.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Gender Letter A weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Dr. Drouin is not sold on apps as a solution to a very human problem. The requirement to interact with an app during a sexual encounter is \u201ccompletely unrealistic,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, \u2018Wait a second, I\u2019m changing my mind on the app and also with you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMore important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous.\n\nLegitimate, but there are caveats.\n\nThese digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual\u2019s intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. \u201cWe already see it all the time in social media or text messages,\u201d he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well.\n\nBut these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It\u2019s very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a \u201cgreat deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things,\u201d he said.\n\nEven implying that someone doesn\u2019t have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if \u201cthe box wasn\u2019t checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said.\n\nDr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer \u2018he said, she said.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn app with a different lens.\n\nWhile LegalFling is the newest app hoping to address the rising tide of consent awareness, it\u2019s not the first. We-Consent, introduced in 2015 by the nonprofit Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence, was created for students on college campuses to help them adhere to the implementation of affirmative consent rules.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state to require colleges to use affirmative consent as the standard in disciplinary decisions, which inspired the creation of We-Consent, said Michael Lissack, director of the institute.\n\nWe-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition.\n\nThere are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances \u2014 before We-Consent turned in the videos \u2014 the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said.\n\n\u201cFrom Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they\u2019re going to do with one another,\u201d he said.\n\nConsent can happen only from discussion, he said, \u201cnot from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement.\u201d", "title": "Consent in the Digital Age: Can Apps Solve a Very Human Problem?", "authors": ["Maya Salam"]}

Now, one of those works, Xu Bing\u2019s \u201cA Case Study of Transference,\u201d is coming back to the museum, this time as a valued part of its permanent collection, purchased with funds provided by an anonymous donor. The website ARTnews first reported the gift.\n\nThe controversial work is a video documentation of a 1994 performance in which two pigs, one imprinted with nonsensical English words and one stamped with fanciful Chinese characters, copulate before a live audience. It is a satirical take on the collision of East and West.\n\nInstead of showing the video, the museum displayed a blank monitor with a wall label explaining, \u201cFor Xu, who, like many intellectuals of his generation, had spent time on a farm during the Cultural Revolution and was familiar with animal husbandry, the performance was a literal and visceral critique of Chinese artists\u2019 desire for enlightenment through Western cultural \u2018transference.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cXu Bing\u2019s \u2018A Case Study of Transference\u2019 is recognized as an iconic work of conceptual and performance art from China during this period and is now part of the exhibition history,\u201d said Sarah Eaton, a spokeswoman for the Guggenheim, who told The New York Times that the museum might show the work there in the future.\n\nIt could also be shown elsewhere sometime soon. \u201cArt and China After 1989\u201d will travel to the Guggenheim Bilbao from May 11 to Sept. 23, 2018, and to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from Nov. 10, 2018, to Feb. 24, 2019, although neither institution has finalized its checklist yet.\n\nThe Guggenheim Abu Dhabi already owns another work that was altered for the exhibition, Huang Yong Ping\u2019s \u201cTheater of the World\u201d (1993), an empty cage that was intended to be filled with live insects, lizards and snakes that would ostensibly feed off each other during the course of the three-month show.

At the last trial, prosecutors relied on an exception that permits such evidence when it shows conduct so similar it can be argued that it demonstrates a common scheme or plan, a kind of unique signature of the defendant.\n\nFor the retrial, prosecutors are also relying on a new argument, the \u201cdoctrine of chances,\u201d which essentially argues that the more times an event takes place, the less plausible it becomes that it happened by mistake.\n\nProsecutors and Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers tussled over what parts of a civil case that Ms. Constand brought against him in 2005 could be referred to at trial. That suit ended with a financial settlement and a confidentiality agreement, and the lawyers bickered over what details from those matters and the accompanying negotiations should be admitted.\n\nAnd the two sides argued over whether Mr. Cosby\u2019s team would be able to call as a witness Marguerite Jackson, a student adviser at Temple University, where Ms. Constand was employed when the episode with Mr. Cosby occurred. Ms. Jackson has said that years ago Ms. Constand told her that she had been drugged and assaulted by a famous person, then later said it had not happened, but that making such a complaint could result in a valuable lawsuit settlement.\n\nMr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers said they intended to include Ms. Jackson in their opening statement at trial.

Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer.\n\nMr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney\u2019s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford.\n\nAnd David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times\u2019s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein.\n\nIn Ms. Battilana\u2019s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced.\n\nProsecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance\u2019s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department\u2019s special victims unit and the district attorney.\n\nFor detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime \u2014 known in law as \u201cprobable cause\u201d \u2014 is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar.\n\n\u201cThe police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. \u201cOur job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court.

A Quinnipiac University poll last month showed that 75 percent of Democrats in the state said they were inclined to re-elect him, and he has more than $30 million in campaign money. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign asked donors to bolster that war chest last week, inviting them to a half-dozen events in the coming months with price tags as high as $50,000.\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Cuomo has burnished his progressive credentials.\n\nOn Sunday, he headlined a rally for a Democrat in a competitive special election in Westchester. On Monday, he appeared at a public housing site in the Bronx and decried the conditions as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d On Tuesday, he delivered a firebrand speech to Planned Parenthood in Albany where he said Democrats were fighting a \u201cbiased, bigoted, misogynistic backward mentality.\u201d On Wednesday, he joined a student walkout protesting gun violence, including the \u201cdie-in\u201d in Manhattan\u2019s Zuccotti Park, the original home of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPointedly, Mr. Cuomo lay on the ground alongside Ms. Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, and rallied with Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers.

To argue that actual politicians are useless, so let\u2019s try something else, is not completely insane.\u201d\n\nIndeed it\u2019s not. On top of which, many experiences other than lower-level government work can be useful, as Michael Bloomberg\u2019s New York mayoralty and Ronald Reagan\u2019s California governorship show. I\u2019d argue that Winfrey now has a sturdier claim on office than Reagan did when he ran for governor. But she would be aiming straight for the presidency. That\u2019s a bit much, as Trump has amply demonstrated.\n\nPlenty of Democrats accused Nixon of similar overreach. Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council, was among them. In a bizarrely worded comment to The New York Post, she called Nixon an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u201d who had failed to support her, a \u201cqualified lesbian,\u201d when she ran for mayor in 2013. Quinn later apologized for bringing sexual orientation into the discussion, but she isn\u2019t backing down from her assessment that Nixon\u2019s accomplishments as an actress and dedication as an activist aren\u2019t adequate credentials. Nor should she.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if I decided I wanted to be an actor,\u201d Quinn told me. \u201cI speak in public. I get my picture taken. I need to lose a little weight, but aside from that, why can\u2019t I do this? Because I can\u2019t. The years I might have spent developing skills in that area, I spent developing other skills.\u201d\n\nNichols, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, said that the downgrading of experience and devaluing of expertise can be explained partly by the internet, which allows people to assemble their own preferred information and affords them the delusion of omniscience.\n\nThe narcissism of our era also comes into play, he said. Feelings have been accorded as much currency as facts. No one can claim more or better feelings than anybody else. And so Nixon\u2019s empathy as a mother and frustration as a subway rider, to name two themes in her video, carry as much weight as a political veteran\u2019s legislative wrangling and budget balancing.\n\n\u201cAmericans have a tendency to look around and think, \u2018We are all peers now,\u2019\u201d Nichols told me. \u201cIt sounds lovely. Except that when you\u2019re up to your hips in water in the basement and you\u2019ve got a plumber standing there, you hand the wrench to him and say, \u2018O.K., maybe we\u2019re not peers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe mess of the Trump administration suggests where an insufficient respect for germane experience can lead. The president put Carson in charge of federal housing, Rex Tillerson in charge of diplomacy and Jared Kushner in charge of civilization itself.

But from mid-2005 through early 2007, he could be found performing shirtless and hooded as a member of the New York doom-metal band Bloody Panda. \u201cI had a lot of fun playing those live shows,\u201d he said. But they took a physical toll. \u201cI remember fainting after one of them, and I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not doing this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe left the group but continued to follow metal closely, as he had since Metallica\u2019s 1988 LP \u201c \u2026 And Justice for All\u201d blew his young mind. He obsessed over bizarre, challenging bands, and his 2006 album, \u201cNow Yes When,\u201d included a piano-trio composition called \u201cOde to Meshuggah,\u201d which hints at that Swedish group\u2019s mind-bending rhythmic cycles.\n\nHe had already begun bonding with fellow jazz progressives like Mr. Taborn and Ben Monder over their mutual interest in heavy music. Mr. Monder, Starebaby\u2019s guitarist, recalled being on tour with Mr. Weiss soon after the release of Meshuggah\u2019s \u201cI,\u201d a dauntingly intense 2004 EP. \u201cI remember him coming into my hotel room and just slapping the headphones on my head, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to check this out,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview at his Brooklyn apartment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

As a child, she was a fixture at the local courts in St. Petersburg, whacking balls off the backboard and hanging around looking for a game. Eventually some \u201cold people,\u201d as she described them, asked her to join their league and they taught her how to play doubles.\n\nBetween ages 8 and 12, she designed her own high-performance development program \u2014 she would approach grown-ups, middle-aged men and women, at the courts and ask them to hit with her, and they usually did, she said.

He said 37 witnesses would be called, a handful by the defense.\n\nHe also warned the court that graphic and disturbing photographs would be presented and said that, according to a psychiatric evaluation, Mr. Madsen was \u201cseverely aberrant,\u201d but not insane. He added that Mr. Madsen was manipulative and lacked empathy and feelings of guilt.\n\nOn March 24, 2017, Ms. Wall contacted Mr. Madsen, requesting an interview. They then met on Aug. 10, the day they departed on the submarine. The prosecutor showed pictures of Mr. Madsen and Ms. Wall sailing off into the Oresund Strait around 7 p.m. At 8:16 p.m., she sent the last text messages to her boyfriend.

The straps and pipes, they say, were tied to Ms. Wall\u2019s torso and limbs to weight them down after he threw them overboard.\n\nWhile an exact cause of death has not been established because the body parts were in the water for so long, investigators say that she was either strangled, or her throat cut.\n\nMs. Wall had apparently intended to write about Mr. Madsen as part of an article about a Danish amateur space race. Though she had been in touch with him months earlier, it was not until the afternoon of her disappearance that he extended an impromptu invitation to interview him that evening on his submarine, the UC3 Nautilus.\n\nMs. Wall and her boyfriend, Ole Stobbe, had been scheduled to move to Beijing less than a week after she went missing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProsecutors have asked for a life sentence or, failing that, a sentence of \u201csafe custody,\u201d a special psychiatric measure for those considered particularly dangerous.\n\nWhile both sentences can be indefinite, Mr. Madsen could apply for parole after 12 years if given a life sentence. A sentence of \u201csafe custody\u201d in a secure medical institution is reviewed on a regular basis by the courts. The Danish Medico-Legal Council, an independent medical body that advises the courts, has recommended that Mr. Madsen be placed in safe custody.\n\nIn Denmark, serious crimes that carry more than a four-year prison sentence are normally tried before three judges and a six-member jury. But the accused has the right to a smaller panel, which is what Mr. Madsen has chosen. His trial is being conducted before Judge Anette Burko and two lay jurors. The opinions of the judge and each of the jurors carry equal weight.\n\nIn memory of Ms. Wall, her family and friends have set up a fund to support young female journalists.

Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what \u2014 or which client \u2014 prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity to Russian expansionism.\n\nOn two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "It seems that these successes within the department have intensified the ambitions of people who want to put V.A. health care in the hands of the private sector. I believe differences in philosophy deserve robust debate, and solutions should be determined based on the merits of the arguments. The advocates within the administration for privatizing V.A. health services, however, reject this approach. They saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed. That is because I am convinced that privatization is a political issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if it undermines care for veterans.\n\nUntil the past few months, veteran issues were dealt with in a largely bipartisan way. (My 100-0 Senate confirmation was perhaps the best evidence that the V.A. has been the exception to Washington\u2019s political polarization.) Unfortunately, the department has become entangled in a brutal power struggle, with some political appointees choosing to promote their agendas instead of what\u2019s best for veterans. These individuals, who seek to privatize veteran health care as an alternative to government-run V.A. care, unfortunately fail to engage in realistic plans regarding who will care for the more than 9 million veterans who rely on the department for life-sustaining care.\n\nThe private sector, already struggling to provide adequate access to care in many communities, is ill-prepared to handle the number and complexity of patients that would come from closing or downsizing V.A. hospitals and clinics, particularly when it involves the mental health needs of people scarred by the horrors of war. Working with community providers to adequately ensure that veterans\u2019 needs are met is a good practice. But privatization leading to the dismantling of the department\u2019s extensive health care system is a terrible idea. The department\u2019s understanding of service-related health problems, its groundbreaking research and its special ability to work with military veterans cannot be easily replicated in the private sector.\n\nI have fought to stand up for this great department and all that it embodies. In recent months, though, the environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve. I can assure you that I will continue to speak out against those who seek to harm the V.A. by putting their personal agendas in front of the well-being of our veterans.\n\nAs many of you know, I am a physician, not a politician. I came to government with an understanding that Washington can be ugly, but I assumed that I could avoid all of the ugliness by staying true to my values. I have been falsely accused of things by people who wanted me out of the way. But despite these politically based attacks on me and my family\u2019s character, I am proud of my record and know that I acted with the utmost integrity. Unfortunately, none of that mattered.\n\nAs I prepare to leave government, I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your country.", "title": "Opinion | David J.

His father, Hollis, was a mechanical engineer, and his mother, the former Ruth Sword, was a teacher and librarian.\n\nHis family attended the Centenary Methodist Church in Auburndale, Mass., where young David was involved with the youth group. He was a grandson of two Protestant ministers, and his later research took on a personal dimension when he documented the failure of American Christians to speak or act on behalf of European Jews during the war.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t cry easily, but all my life I had been taught to believe in the good Samaritan, yet here were Christians killing Jews in Europe,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1984, describing an emotional reaction to his own research. \u201cAnd here was The Christian Century, a religious magazine that had always been at the cutting edge of care and concern, failing to raise its voice against the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nHe graduated from Boston University in 1951 with a degree in history. He received a master\u2019s degree in education at Plymouth State College in New Hampshire in 1961 and a doctorate in history at Harvard in 1966, taking a job that same year teaching history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He retired there in 1991.\n\nDr. Wyman first began to examine the response to Naziism in \u201cPaper Walls: America and the Refugee Crisis 1938-1941,\u201d published in 1968. \u201cThe Abandonment of the Jews\u201d was not the first book to suggest a systemic failure to act on the part of the United States and England, but it was perhaps the most thoroughly researched. Dr. Wyman put 15 years into the project, scouring numerous archives. His book was 444 pages long and included 71 pages of footnotes.\n\nIn his research he found not only a president and Christian leaders who seemed uninterested in the problem, but also a federal bureaucracy that could be openly hostile to helping Jews, a news media that underplayed the shocking revelations about the exterminations, and a Congress and country where anti-Semitism and anti-immigration sentiment encouraged inaction. Gas chambers and the rail lines leading to them could easily have been bombed, he found, and rescue efforts could have saved at least some of the millions who died.\n\nDespite the complaints by some historians, John Gross, reviewing the book in The New York Times, found Dr. Wyman\u2019s conclusions well grounded.\n\n\u201cWhere there are allowances to be made, he makes them,\u201d he wrote; \u201cwhere there are honorable exceptions, he honors them; but in the end he is compelled to hand down a damning indictment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2003 scholars and others inspired by Dr. Wyman\u2019s book founded the Wyman Institute to promote education and research on the response to the Holocaust.

They had been stranded in Sudan when an effort to airlift them to Israel to escape famine and discrimination was halted. A copy of Dr. Wyman\u2019s book, then on the best-seller lists, was given to George H. W.

He also said Ms. Ortega also showed signs of melancholy. \u201cShe did not seem to see a bright future, proximately or remotely, for herself,\u201d he said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Mr. Caffrey acknowledged he had not asked Ms. Ortega about hallucinations or hearing voices.

A deal for the company had been expected to be formalized on Feb. 12, but the lawsuit brought sale talks to a halt.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, the press secretary for Mr. Schneiderman, said on Feb. 11 that his office had recently reached out to representatives of Ms. Contreras-Sweet to emphasize the importance of adequately compensating victims, protecting employees and not rewarding those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein\u2019s misconduct.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised to learn they were not serious about discussing any of those issues or even sharing the most basic information about how they planned to address them,\u201d Ms. Spitalnick said. Mr. Schneiderman said again in a Feb. 12 news conference \u201cthere was no victim compensation fund.\u201d\n\nMs. Contreras-Sweet was stunned by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s public remarks, according to one person briefed on the matter, believing that he was overlooking money for victims that had been built into her proposal.", "title": "Deal for Weinstein Co., Seemingly Dead, Is Reached", "authors": []}

More recently I have read the wonderful noir-themed anthologies published by Akashic Books, collecting stories set in regions from Moscow to Boston to Barcelona. I especially like to read books with international locations. Lawrence Osborne\u2019s \u201cThe Forgiven\u201d and \u201cHunters in the Dark\u201d are two of my most recent favorites.

Glasgow is wet and dark but still warm, the bitterness of winter has yet to bite.\u201d Denise Mina\u2019s moody, mesmerizing book from last year, \u201cThe Long Drop,\u201d opens in mild weather, but the historical novel, based on a real-life set of murders in 1950s Scotland, soon shows its teeth. Suspected of killing his wife, daughter and sister-in-law, William Watt seeks to clear his name and pinpoint the real perpetrator with the help of Peter Manuel, a career criminal with \u201can eye for a weakness or a half-opened window or a chance.\u201d In clipped prose, Mina reimagines the events surrounding the crimes, including the (weirdly true) story of the night the two men spent drinking together prior to Manuel\u2019s dramatic trial for the homicide.\n\nImperfect Unions\n\nThere\u2019s no hard-boiled detective brooding in Seicho Matsumoto\u2019s tightly controlled thriller \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d translated by Louise Heal Kawai.

As the details behind Eiko\u2019s suspicious death surface, the story darkens and a devastating portrait of Japanese customs and manners emerges.\n\nAnother marriage marked by secrets cracks open early in \u201cCrimes of Winter,\u201d the third book in Philippe Georget\u2019s series about Inspector Gilles Sebag, translated by Steven Rendall. A more typical noir antihero, the whiskey-gulping, chain-smoking lieutenant is gifted with uncommon insight and empathy that enable him to first suspect and then confirm his wife\u2019s affair by the end of the first chapter. The trouble extends out of the inspector\u2019s front door into the streets of Perpignan, a Catalonian city in Southern France where a string of violent crimes \u2014 beginning with a murder in a seedy hotel \u2014 underscore the book\u2019s theme of betrayal and test the heartsick cop\u2019s investigative skills.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the years leading up to high school, readers walk a tightrope: They are ready to begin exploring more mature ideas and writing structures, but they aren\u2019t always ready for full-on realistic drama. What titles can you recommend for these avid readers?\n\nJENNIFER FALVEY\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C.\n\nDear Jennifer,\n\nAt school my older children learned the five-finger rule for finding a \u201cjust-right book\u201d: If it has more than five unfamiliar words on one page, the book is deemed too challenging for a student to read. I sympathize with the practicality of the guideline, and understand that it is aimed mostly at developing readers, but in practice I find the rubric a little deflating for young bookworms. Part of the joy of unbridled childhood reading lies in the haze of misunderstanding; the mystifying behavior of adult characters and even scads of obscure vocabulary can spur curiosity and spark richly imaginative embellishments to fill in the gaps. Your more expansive approach \u2014 to look for books that will challenge your students \u2014 allows for who they are and who they will become.\n\nOld Standbys\n\nYour library is probably stocked with classics that your tightrope-walking middle schoolers will enjoy. Fluent, attentive readers of that age will fall for the warm, slyly playful first-person narration and meaty characters in Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201d And they might relate to the story of childhood friendship in Willa Cather\u2019s more leisurely paced prairie novel \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia.\u201d\n\nEverything Old Is New Again\n\nI\u2019m sure your shelves also hold some of my recent favorites: \u201cThe Thing About Jellyfish,\u201d by Ali Benjamin (for more science-minded kids); \u201cWhen You Reach Me,\u201d by Rebecca Stead (a great companion to \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d by Madeleine L\u2019Engle); and \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming,\u201d by Jacqueline Woodson (a memoir in verse for your budding poets). But I also want to make a pitch for some mid-to-late-20th-century (mostly) realistic books for younger readers that may have fallen off your radar. Robert Cormier\u2019s deeply unsettling, desperately suspenseful and structurally complicated novel from 1977, \u201cI Am the Cheese,\u201d tracks the thoughts of Adam Farmer, a troubled boy on a bicycle who is caught up in sinister events beyond his understanding.", "title": "Dear Match Book: Reading for Precocious Preteens", "authors": ["Nicole Lamy", "Match Book"]}

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Without fresh oxygen coming in, the population dynamics of our internal bacterial communities change and our resident decomposers increase, and without a live immune system at work, they spread throughout the body. They consume the proteins in our cells and produce byproducts like methane and hydrogen sulfide gas that bloat and rupture the body. The nasty smells of the dead attract insects that disassemble the bulk of the body mass, and the altered acidity of our remains attracts fungal decomposers. If there are any pathogens on the corpse, microbes in the soil kill them, or they die of exposure or lack of food, which is why graveyards aren\u2019t hotbeds of disease.\n\nAll this can take months. And it\u2019s not just happening from the inside out. Top predators are broken down by top detritivores. In a Tibetan sky burial, a naked human corpse is transported to the top of a mountain on the back of a relative\u2019s moped, the flesh flayed and left exposed to be eaten by large carrion birds. The remaining bits are consumed by smaller detritivores like rats and beetles. Fungi and bacteria break down the molecular leftovers into life\u2019s raw ingredients, and still other types of bacteria help recycle the building blocks of life back into the pool of opportunity. Sad as death is, it\u2019s also about opportunity.\n\nSo it takes a village of detritivores and decomposers to recycle a corpse. That\u2019s why the designer Jae Rhim Lee\u2019s Infinity Burial Suit \u2014 basically pajamas threaded with fungal spores bred to decompose bodies \u2014 can\u2019t really fulfill its promise to ensure you a speedier decomposition. The suit costs $1,500, as does the Infinity Burial Shroud (there\u2019s an \u201cadd to cart\u201d button on Ms. Lee\u2019s website, which I think is a much more sensitive choice than \u201ccheck out\u201d). But fungi are actually pretty bad at decomposing corpses on their own. We bury our dead deep, and fungi are aerobic. They need air. The truth is, not much will happen quickly to a corpse or anything organic if it\u2019s buried six feet under the soil\u2019s surface, because the diversity of decomposers drops off the deeper you go.\n\nIf it\u2019s efficient land-based breakdown you are after, it\u2019s probably best to be buried under a pile of wood chips, which have lots of little air pockets to keep aerobic decomposers alive.\n\nThere is life after death, and it is mainly microbial. Microbes like bacteria bridge the living and nonliving spheres of the Earth. Life starts with microbes that use energy and secure food from inorganic sources like atmospheric gases and minerals (this includes plants: The parts of the plant that do the work of photosynthesis, chloroplasts, evolved from ancient bacteria). Once those nutrients are in the bacterium, they become terrestrialized, and available to other earthbound critters, all the way up the food chain to us. And then, when we die, there are bacteria waiting to release those elements back into the nonliving sphere.", "title": "Opinion | Decomposition: An Easter Story", "authors": []}

Chris Christie of New Jersey, who worked closely on the opioid crisis with Ms. Conway and credited her with urging the president to personalize the issue through his brother\u2019s experience with addiction. \u201cShe\u2019s gotten a bad rap at times, but I think that\u2019s because of some of the really awful people inside the White House who have been trying to hurt her, as opposed to anything the press came up with on its own.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Ms. Conway has watched, somewhat from the sidelines, as John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s current chief of staff, came in and pledged to bring order to the West Wing, dispatching a number of aides who had once envied the access Ms. Conway cultivated with the president.\n\n\u201cHe came around and wanted to know what everyone had been working on for the first six months,\u201d Ms. Conway said, \u201cand some of us were just better equipped to handle that question than others.\u201d\n\nFor the president, Ms. Conway, an outspoken opponent of abortion, is one of his most prominent ties to the conservative movement.\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Ms. Conway had been wise to engage in public appearances only \u201cat times when the president has asked her to engage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Kellyanne,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the president of the United States and this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Meadows added: \u201cThe limelight is not the primary concern for getting her agenda done, and I think that has served her well.\u201d\n\nShe has told allies in and outside the West Wing that her respect is not just for the president, but the presidency as an institution. Still, one of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A friend of Ms. Conway\u2019s, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because of the social opprobrium she would face as a Democrat, said Ms. Conway had particularly struggled with Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, during the first chaotic months of the administration. She also survived efforts to curtail her influence by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who for months privately bristled over Ms. Conway\u2019s getting credit for the campaign victory.\n\nBut, that friend said, she learned that if her colleagues did not take her seriously, she could use it to her advantage. She kept her head down while other aides burned out, and kept her access to the president.\n\nIn fact, her portfolio has grown, with the addition of the opioid crisis and coordination with cabinet secretaries, which originally fell under Mr. Kushner\u2019s purview. On Thursday, she put together an opioid summit meeting with cabinet members at the White House, which the president briefly joined.\n\nOther Republicans say her loyalty to Mr. Trump \u2014 and thus her ability to survive in his chaotic White House \u2014 is no virtue.\n\n\u201cShe has no shame,\u201d Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, said in a text message, \u201cand that is a quality the president values.\u201d\n\nMs. Conway, of course, would see it differently. She refers to those who have lasted from the campaign until now as \u201cunbroken threads.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was not originally part of the campaign, but her friends say she has known the president for more than a decade, and has come to understand him and how to speak with him in ways few aides do outside of Ms. Hicks and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime bodyguard, who left the White House last year. For a president hit by crosscurrents on policy, Ms. Conway has frequently been a voice reminding him of his campaign promises.\n\nShe has called supporters from the final days of the Trump campaign members of the \u201cOctober 8th coalition,\u201d for defending Mr. Trump after audio of him bragging about sexual assault had leaked.\n\nA mother of four who moved her family to Washington last year, Ms. Conway has faced near-constant attack for defending Mr. Trump\u2019s track record with women. But she has also willingly stepped into battle, including when she criticized women for joining the Women\u2019s March the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration last year.\n\n\u201cI frankly didn\u2019t see the point,\u201d Ms. Conway said at the time.\n\nBut she and her allies say the attacks against her often have a sexist undertone. And she has bristled at a line of thought in liberal spheres and on social media that she and other women have advanced in the White House by keeping their heads down in a misogynistic workplace.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is more kind, open, gracious and respectful to the women in the White House than the so-called pro-women movement that criticizes everything from what we wear to what we say to what we believe,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t work there if he weren\u2019t open to my opinion.

An enthusiastic fan of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front and Donald Trump, Mr. Salvini fanned sadly familiar flames of nationalism, ethnocentrism and xenophobia, promising, among other things, \u201ccleansing\u201d Italy of immigrants, threatening force.\n\nThe League ran with Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party. If there was a sliver of good news it was that the party of Mr. Berlusconi, forerunner of today\u2019s populists who was forced out as prime minister in 2011 in a swirl of sex scandals and legal troubles, took only 14 percent of the vote.\n\nThe biggest blow was to the governing Democratic Party, led by Matteo Renzi until his resignation on Monday. It sagged to a mere 19 percent of the vote. The party, which has led Italy in a technocratic direction for the past five years, pulled Italy out of recession and had been trying to modernize its economy.

That promise of instability and uncertainty is no doubt being celebrated in the Kremlin. (Both the Five Star Movement and the League have argued against union sanctions on Russia.)

Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day.\n\nThe agency\u2019s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook\u2019s stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered.

On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.\n\nIn an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer.\n\nThe employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.\n\nThe company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201coperational\u201d roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.\n\nCommon Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate \u201cknowing and willful\u201d violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.\n\n\u201cIt defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.\n\nIn the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company\u2019s privacy and user data policies.

The manuscript was typewritten, handbound, homespun. Its author, a late great-uncle of mine, had been a high school chemistry teacher. From him, I learned that some of my forebears came to the American Midwest in the 19th century not only for the reasons I\u2019d assumed \u2014 the arable soil offered to European immigrants by the Homestead Act, the freedoms of speech and religion. They also came for the schools, education having been in their corner of the Old Country a scarce resource, available to the few, withheld from the many.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much to trust my great-uncle\u2019s account. He may have been seeking in the past the seeds of his own biography, as authors of such volumes are prone to do \u2014 as all of us, I suspect, are prone to do. And yet it\u2019s true that the American Midwest, in the century after Jefferson purchased it from Napoleon, provided unusually fertile soil for schools as well as corn. Just how fertile, Americans seem to have forgotten of late, and in this, her fifth collection of essays, Marilynne Robinson is here to remind us \u2014 of the Midwest\u2019s intellectual and political heritage, of the public university\u2019s democratic and humanistic origins, and of much else.\n\nAs novelist and essayist both, Robinson has always been something of an underwater archaeologist, diving into the twilight zones of memory to drag lost histories into the light. \u201cI am especially fascinated by erasures and omissions, which seem to me to be strongly present in their apparent absence, like black holes, pulling the fabric of collective narrative out of shape,\u201d she writes here. It\u2019s worth pausing a moment over that metaphor to note how indebted it is to Melville and Dickinson and the other Transcendentalists, whose influence Robinson has long welcomed and acknowledged. Like them, she is an ardent armchair naturalist, not to mention an ardent armchair theologian, cosmologist, ethicist, historian. Like them, she sees, or creates through metaphor, correspondences across disparate fields, frames of reference, states of being \u2014 between cosmos and mind, or astronomy and history, black holes and the absences in stories. Her way with metaphor implies a metaphysics, in her case a metaphysics informed by her Calvinism: History is a fabric. So is the cosmos. So are the moments lived quietly beside a mountain lake in Idaho, or in a prairie town in Iowa. Or on a whaling ship. Or wherever you are now. \u201cWhat are all these fragments for,\u201d asks Ruth, the narrator of \u201cHousekeeping,\u201d Robinson\u2019s first novel, \u201cif not to be knit up, finally?\u201d\n\nIn her fiction Robinson knits narratively; in her essays rhetorically, inquisitively, at times polemically, but rarely autobiographically. Some writers moving between fiction and nonfiction are like musicians switching instruments. You can hear the difference when they put down one and pick up another, but the music, or the voice, is recognizably the same. Not so with Robinson. Readers who come to her essays having fallen under the spell of her fiction are likely to feel disoriented. There is a dreamlike intimacy to the voices that narrate her novels, as if we were not so much listening to a story being told as eavesdropping on a consciousness.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "In Mr. Gerson\u2019s retelling of American religious history, liberal Christians \u201cfound better things to do with their Sundays than attend progressive services\u201d and abandoned key Christian tenets: \u201cMany combined their faith with the Social Gospel \u2014 a postmillennialism drained of the miraculous, with social reform taking the place of the Second Coming.\u201d\n\nThese critiques have grown more frequent over the past few years as the religious left became savvier and figures like the Rev. William Barber attracted national attention for his Moral Mondays campaign in North Carolina (a weekly social justice protest at the state capitol in Raleigh).\n\nGenerations of white evangelicals have been conditioned to see evangelicalism as so synonymous with Republican politics that the idea of a non-Republican political option for religious voters simply does not exist. Rather than contemplate this possibility and grapple with it, Mr. Erickson, Mr. Gerson and others simply disparage and deny it \u2014 while also condemning political tribalism.\n\nMany conservative evangelicals would say the problem with progressives isn\u2019t just a matter of doubting their religiosity \u2014 it\u2019s that Democrats are wrong on policy, and those progressives who claim to be religious are blinkered if they support Democrats. Mr. Falwell, a stalwart Trump supporter, took to Twitter last fall to counter the idea that Christians should factor concern for the poor into their political decisions.\n\n\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me how leftist Christians twist the words of Jesus,\u201d Mr. Falwell wrote. Jesus never told \u201cCaesar how to run Rome and never said to care for the least of these by voting to tax your neighbor to help the poor.\u201d\n\nEven widely respected evangelical leaders have spent the past few decades insisting that a correct reading of the Bible requires Christians to reject homosexuality, and especially gay marriage. In August 2017, a group of 150 prominent evangelicals released the \u201cNashville Statement,\u201d a document that condemned (among other things) Christians who support L.B.G.T.Q. issues. \u201cSuch approval,\u201d they asserted, \u201cconstitutes an essential departure from Christian faithfulness and witness.\u201d Their calculation is very simple: If you support gay rights and affirm the idea of gay Christians, then you aren\u2019t really Christian.\n\nThe biggest stumbling block for conservative evangelicals is the scarlet abortion \u201cA\u201d that Democrats wear for their support of abortion rights. Conservative evangelical preachers inveigh against \u201cpro-abortion\u201d forces throughout the country, and the columns of Mr. Gerson and his conservative peers are littered with the rhetorical labeling of Democrats and progressives as \u201cpro-abortion.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Democrats Are Christians, Too", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "The geopolitical implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade decisions should also alarm Democrats. His decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which President Barack Obama negotiated) weakened America\u2019s economic standing in the world and was a gift to China. If the United States is not involved in setting the rules for international trade, China and Russia will now drive these decisions. Our strong allies will be pushed into trade deals dictated by China. The alternative to TPP\u2019s negotiated labor and environmental standards will be China\u2019s lack of standards on labor and the environment. The same applies to technology, where either the United States will set rules with a focus on innovation or China will set rules with a focus on government control of information.\n\nWhen Democrats focus on building a modern economy that competes globally, as we did particularly in 1992 and 2012, we appeal to the majority of voters who believe that trade benefits America. When we do not lean in on a positive case for competitive jobs of the future or are perceived as indecisive on America\u2019s role in the global economy, as we were in 2004 and 2016, it can come across as hypocritical to the recent history of our party and limits our ability to win over swing voters.\n\nElectorally, Democrats can win over small-business owners and moderate Republicans with a platform of investing in education and research to build an American economy that competes with the rest of the world. We proved this in Virginia, where the state has gone from being solidly Republican just 10 years ago to having a Democratic winning streak in statewide contests. That shift occurred both because Republicans focused on an extreme anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-immigrant agenda and because Democrats made the case directly to moderate Republicans and business owners that we were the only party focused on building a modern, vibrant Virginia economy.\n\nIn my 2013 campaign for governor, I won endorsements from many moderate Republicans because I campaigned on a welcoming Virginia economy, while my opponent was known for crusading on social issues that scared global companies away from Virginia.\n\nAs governor, I worked across party lines to help build a new Virginia economy that traded with the world. That work included 35 trade missions to five continents, which brought substantial foreign investment to Virginia and helped create over 200,000 jobs. The state\u2019s economy was driven in part by exports, and agriculture and forestry increased 31 percent, to $91 billion. That growth in trade meant more jobs, with Virginia\u2019s unemployment rate falling to 3.7 percent from 5.4 percent during my term.", "title": "Opinion | Democrats Should Embrace an Open Economy", "authors": []}

The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning.

What\u2019s your feeling?\n\nO\u2019Malley Dillon: There is no doubt in my mind that the attacks on Leader Pelosi are driven in large part by her gender, and I think that is also why it often resonates more with certain segments of the population. Of course, there are other elements at play here, but anyone that suggests that gender isn\u2019t part of this isn\u2019t paying attention.\n\nBruni: As hugely encouraging as Lamb\u2019s performance was, I have to wonder: Would he even have been the Democratic candidate in that district if he\u2019d had to go through the kind of primary that other Democratic aspirants around the country will go through? It\u2019s interesting to note that both he and Doug Jones, victorious in Alabama, had no primary challenge to navigate. Most other House candidates do. How does the party make sure that in swingable districts, it has the most strategically optimal general-election candidates and not the riskier ideologues that highly partisan primary voters sometimes reward?\n\nMoulton: In 2014, I challenged an 18-year incumbent in my own party who was a frontline candidate every cycle \u2014 meaning he was a top Republican target \u2014 even though he had never had a significant primary challenge. The last general election poll before the primary had the Republican candidate, a respected state senator, beating the Democratic incumbent by six points, and it had me beating the Republican by six points. Folks in Washington on both sides of the aisle have told me since that we probably would have lost the seat if I hadn\u2019t won my primary challenge.

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nSubtitled TV shows often struggle to reach a wide audience in the United States, but since landing on Netflix in January, the German-language series \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d has become a sleeper hit. Set in Berlin during the Weimar Republic, the series mixes the police procedural, the gangland noir, the spy caper and the political thriller with unusual dexterity. Add romance, outlandish visuals, intricate plotting and breakneck pacing, and it\u2019s little surprise the series broke through.\n\n\u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe characters are just as rich as the production, including a morphine-addicted detective (played by Volker Bruch); a corrupt chief inspector (Peter Kurth); and an amateur sleuth, who\u2019s a police typist by day, hard-partying flapper by night (Liv Lisa Fries). Once you\u2019ve burned through the 16 episodes on Netflix, you may be craving similar fare. Few series possess the riches of \u201cBabylon,\u201d but here are seven shows that should hit some of the same pleasure points.\n\nIf You Want to See More of Berlin During Dramatic Times\n\nA scene from \u201cThe Same Sky.\u201d Beta Film\n\n\u2018The Same Sky\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cThe Same Sky\u201d jumps ahead a few decades in Berlin\u2019s tumultuous history to 1974, when the German metropolis was split in two by the Berlin Wall. A collaboration between the British writer Paula Milne and the German director Oliver Hirschbiegel, the show is a canny evocation of the Cold War tensions that led the citizens of East and West Berlin to constantly spy on one another. The harsh toll that the espionage takes on the spies themselves unspools amid picture-perfect art direction, while a story line about the human toll of an East German doping program targeting teenage athletes is more chilling still. If you like \u201cThe Americans\u201d or \u201cDeutschland 83,\u201d you\u2019ll want to savor these six hourlong episodes.\n\nIf You\u2019re Wondering What It All Added Up To\n\nA scene from \u201cA French Village.\u201d Etienne Chognard/CCSP\n\n\u2018A French Village\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nRemember the generals who were working hard to weaponize Germany again in \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d? Well, \u201cA French Village\u201d is effectively about the results. Set in a hamlet during World War II, this French-language series doesn\u2019t have the production values of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d but it is just as addictive. Each season takes place in a different year, and the show, which brilliantly mixes melodrama and realism, follows a set of locals as they try to survive the German occupation by choosing collaboration or resistance \u2014 or, among the canniest of them, by choosing one and then the other. \u201cA French Village\u201d excels at setting up the kind of moral quandaries that make you wonder what you would do in similar circumstances. The answer is not always as obvious as one might hope.\n\n0\n\nIf You Can\u2019t Get Enough of Volker Bruch\n\nVolker Bruch in \u201cGeneration War.\u201d Music Box Films\n\n\u2018Generation War\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe quietly charismatic Bruch here portrays Vilhelm, one of five twentysomething friends at the center of this 2013 German mini-series, which tracks the diverse experiences of these Berlin buddies from 1941 to the end of World War II. Vilhelm and his brother, Friedhelm (Tom Schilling), are both in the army and are sent to the Eastern Front. Charlotte (Miriam Stein) finds herself there as well, but serving as a nurse. Back at home, Greta (Katharina Sch\u00fcttler) sleeps with a Gestapo officer in hopes of saving her secret lover, Viktor (Ludwig Trepte), who is Jewish. The show packs a lot into three 90-minute episodes. Some viewers have objected to its portrayal of some of the average Germans as innocent victims, but the horrors of war and their psychological aftermath are rendered well and with complexity, and the overall message is clear: A fanatical, delusional Germany set the world on fire, then succumbed to the flames.\n\nIf You Want More Stylish International Double-Crossing\n\nFrom left, Elizabeth Debicki, Hugh Laurie, Tom Hiddleston and David Avery in \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Des Willie/The Ink Factory, via AMC\n\n\u2018The Night Manager\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAmong the many mysteries in \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are what, exactly, is on that Soviet train and who is the cargo\u2019s intended recipient. Trafficking and double-crossing are reliably suspenseful plot devices, especially when a sultry blonde is involved, and you will find all of this in \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d Based on the novel by John le Carr\u00e9, this elegantly cinematic British mini-series boasts superb turns by Tom Hiddleston in the title role; Hugh Laurie as a diabolical, supremely composed villain; and Elizabeth Debicki as the object of their desire. The story jumps around the sunny climes of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, but make no mistake: Its heart is as cold as ice.\n\nIf You\u2019re Looking for More Period Gangsters\n\nCillian Murphy in \u201cPeaky Blinders.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Peaky Blinders\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA fan favorite in \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d is the mysterious Armenian cabaret owner and underworld kingpin, Edgar. The equivalent in \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d is Cillian Murphy\u2019s Tommy Shelby, a criminal mastermind and gang leader, and the center of this British series. Set in Birmingham between the two world wars, this flashy, violent British show follows the titular local gang (so named for the razor blades kept in their caps, which they traditionally used to blind their enemies), which spreads its tentacles well beyond its home base and ruthlessly wipes out those who stand in its way. Another similarity with \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d is its elaborate soundtrack \u2014 most of them in \u201cPeaky\u201d are modern rock songs (including many interesting covers of the theme song, which is by Nick Cave), which is jarring at first, then quickly feels integral.\n\nIf You Loved the Lavish Period Reconstruction\n\nA scene from \u201cRome.\u201d Franco Biciocchi/HBO\n\n\u2018Rome\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, HBO\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nTwo hallmarks of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are the awe-inspiring crowd scenes and the mammoth sets. Among the few series to match that cinematic grandeur is HBO\u2019s \u201cRome,\u201d which was created in part by John Milius, who directed and helped write \u201cConan the Barbarian.\u201d (The first season reportedly cost $100 million.) Despite being eclipsed in recent years by \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d this sprawling production set in ancient Rome is well worth revisiting \u2014 or discovering, if you missed its original airing, from 2005 to 2007. The main characters are two humble former soldiers, but \u201cRome,\u201d like \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d offers a vivid cross-section of an entire society, from its ruling elite to its poor laborers. Need more convincing? The Romans\u2019 sex life was likely just as thrilling as that of the Berliners centuries later.\n\nIf You Want More Women Solving Crimes\n\nEssie Davis in \u201cMiss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Acorn, Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the best subplots in \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d involves Charlotte\u2019s dream to become a police officer at a time when women were not allowed on the force. Another woman with a talent for ferreting out illegal activities is Phryne Fisher (played by the excellent Essie Davis) in the Australian series \u201cMiss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries.\u201d Set in 1920s Melbourne, the show tracks the glamorous, wealthy Phryne as she gets embroiled in one caper after another. The tone is decidedly more lighthearted than that of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d \u2014 think \u201cThe Thin Man\u201d \u2014 but it is still rewarding to see a smart, resourceful heroine take criminal matters into her own hands.", "title": "Did You Love \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019?

Steve Cavanagh\u2019s hero, Eddie Flynn, has taken to the profession with the same relish he showed for his previous work as a con man. A New York defense attorney with the dregs of the earth as clients, Flynn is living out of his office when a C.I.A. operative arrives with an offer he can\u2019t refuse: Lean on a client to plead guilty and cut a deal, a move for which Flynn will collect a fee of $100,000. The problem is, Flynn doesn\u2019t believe his client, David Child, is guilty of murdering his girlfriend. Could someone be framing him in order to steal his design for a security system that can be misused for laundering dirty money? The impressive legal maneuvering pays off in a centerpiece courtroom drama that Flynn describes as \u201cVegas time.\u201d But a lot of his showmanship is pure flimflam, meant to dazzle his audience.

Dr. Mary Stipp, who ministers to prostitutes, makes it her mission to find the missing girls. But evil men get to them first, and it takes another violent act of nature \u2014 a raging flood \u2014 to flush them out of their basement prison. Rescuing Emma from rapists is even more of a challenge because the age of consent in this not-so-enlightened era is 10.

The future of the rule was already called into question last year when the new leadership at the Labor Department said it would review the regulation and delayed its full implementation by 18 months to July 2019. After this month\u2019s court ruling, the agency said that pending further review, it would not enforce the rule.\n\nBut there is another complication. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly working on its own proposal for financial professionals, which would likely apply to all investment accounts and not just tax-advantaged retirement money.\n\nIn October, Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, said that he was \u201cfocused on the standards of conduct that investment professionals must follow in providing advice to Main Street investors.\u201d Last June, he invited the public to submit comments on the issue. (The S.E.C. declined to comment on the details of any future proposal.)\n\nRegardless of whether any form of the fiduciary rule survives, however, consumers need to proceed with caution.\n\n\u201cGiven the uncertainty, there is more reason now than ever for an investor to simply ask a financial adviser whether he or she is acting as a fiduciary, at all times,\u201d said Arthur Laby, a professor at Rutgers Law School. Fiduciary is the legal term that means an adviser must put its customers\u2019 financial well-being before their own.\n\nOne ally for consumers in lieu of the federal government could be the states. Champions of the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule, include William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth, who recently called on the federal government to appeal the court decision striking down the rule.\n\nIn the meantime, he said his office would continue to aggressively pursue investigations to ensure retirees were protected. Just last month, he brought charges against Scottrade, now part of TD Ameritrade. \u201cIf the Department of Labor will not enforce its own laws and rules, then the states must do what they can to protect retirees,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn anticipation of the fiduciary rule, Scottrade banned a list of activities that could tempt its representatives to put their own financial interests ahead of customers, including sales quotas and contests, bonuses and special awards. But Scottrade held two sales contests anyway, according to the Massachusetts regulator\u2019s complaint.\n\nBoth contests \u201cperversely incentivized Scottrade agents to bring in new assets from customers, including through the rollover of retirement assets,\u201d the complaint said. It also noted that \u201cScottrade\u2019s own internal-use materials instructed agents to target a client\u2019s \u2018pain point\u2019 and emotional vulnerability.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Secretary Galvin\u2019s office charged the firm with engaging in unethical and dishonest conduct. TD Ameritrade declined to comment on the matter.\n\nAmeriprise Financial recently settled allegations that the firm\u2019s representatives recommended and sold higher-priced mutual fund shares to retirement account holders, which made the brokers more money, when cheaper shares were available. About 1,791 customers\u2019 accounts paid nearly $1.8 million in unnecessary upfront sales charges, as well as higher ongoing fees and expenses, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAmeriprise did not admit or deny the findings, but as part of a settlement with regulators it paid back customers (with interest) as well as a $230,000 penalty.\n\nRegardless of how the fiduciary saga ends, there are several things consumers can do to minimize that they will be on the receiving end of any of these shenanigans.\n\n\u2022 Work with a fiduciary, or someone who pledges to put your financial interests ahead of their own \u2014 all of the time, with all of your money. Get them to pledge to their fiduciary duty in writing. Working with a fiduciary is not fail-safe, but it is a consumer\u2019s best defense. So-called investment advisers, who generally must register with the S.E.C. or a state securities regulator, must put their customers\u2019 interests first, regardless of what accounts they are working with.\n\n\u2022 Choose a financial planner with strong credentials. Anyone can call themselves a financial adviser, at least for now, so don\u2019t accept titles at face value. Certified financial planners hold a professional designation with rigorous curriculum and experience requirements. They can manage your entire financial life, but can also provide guidance locating reputable specialists, like an estate planner, or, say, a life insurer who will sell you only what you need.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Consider paying the adviser outright. No financial adviser is entirely free of conflicts. But it\u2019s often easier to eliminate those conflicts when they are paid for their time or advice and their paychecks are not dependent on selling you a financial product.\n\n\u2022 You can find a list of fee-only financial planners through the Garrett Planning Network, the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the XY Planning Network.\n\nApply the same sort of rigor in your search for a financial adviser as you would when seeking a doctor or a lawyer, advised Tamar Frankel, a fiduciary expert and professor at Boston University School of Law. \u201cThe rules do not do it now,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you have to do it now.\u201d", "title": "Do Financial Advisers Have to Act in Your Interest?

The study, conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, ETH Zurich and the University of Illinois, was published on Tuesday in the journal N.P.J. Biofilms and Microbiomes. The researchers tested a range of bath toys, 19 different ones, and found 75 million cells of bacteria per square centimeter in the ducks \u2014 a strikingly high level that scientists say was a result of their polymer material releasing carbon, which acts as a nutrient for bacteria. \u201cIn addition to the nutrient supply, dirty bath water also serves as a further source of microbial seeding for the bath toys,\u201d the researchers noted.

The 17-minute protests unfolding at hundreds of schools are intended to pressure Congress to approve gun control legislation after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and come 10 days before major protests in Washington and elsewhere. \u2026 The demonstrations unfolded in different ways from city to city and school to school. In some places, demonstrators chanted and held signs. At other schools, students stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee.

The study, published in January in the journal Child Development, found that late adolescents and young adults who voted, volunteered or engaged in activism ultimately went further in school and had higher incomes than those who did not mobilize for political or social change. By tracking nearly 10,000 young people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds, researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine, Fordham University and the University of Massachusetts measured the long-term implications of youth political and social engagement. Remarkably, they found that civic activity linked to better academic and financial outcomes regardless of early school performance and parental education levels, two factors that usually drive later success. Of course, correlation does not prove causation, but the study makes a case for the benefits of civic engagement. In light of the findings, Parissa Ballard, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor in the department of family and community medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine, said that \u201chaving meaningful opportunities to volunteer or be involved in activism may change how young people think about themselves or their possibilities for the future.\u201d\n\nStudents: Read both articles, then tell us \u2026\n\n\u2014 What is your reaction to the national school walkouts to protest gun violence?

CreditJason Henry for The New York Times Shared bathrooms at the end of the hall and having no individual kitchen or living room is becoming less weird for some of the city\u2019s workers thanks to Starcity, a new development company that is expressly creating dorms for many of the non-tech population. Starcity has already opened three properties with 36 units. It has nine more in development and a wait list of 8,000 people. The company is buying a dozen more buildings (including one-star hotels, parking garages, office buildings and old retail stores), has raised $18.9 million in venture capital and hired a team of 26 people. Starcity said it was on track to have hundreds of units open around the San Francisco Bay Area this year, and thousands by 2019. These are not micro-units, nor are they like WeWork\u2019s WeLive housing developments, where residents have their own small kitchens, living rooms and bathrooms but share common event space and industrial appliances for parties. These are not single-family homes that are being used as group houses. Instead, Starcity residents get a bedroom of 130 square feet to 220 square feet. Many of the buildings will feature some units with a private bath for a higher rent. But Jon Dishotsky, Starcity\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said a ratio of one bathroom for every two to three bedrooms makes the most sense for large-scale affordability. The average one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rents for $3,300 a month, but Starcity rooms go for $1,400 to $2,400 a month fully furnished, with utilities and Wi-Fi included. \u201cIf you think about the most private things that you do, a lot of them are related to the bathroom,\u201d said Mr. Dishotsky, 34. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably the hardest part.\u201d\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 What do you think of the Starcity living arrangements, and why?

At the news conference, Monsignor Vigano said he had asked Francis\u2019 predecessor, Benedict, to \u201cwrite a page or a page and a half of dense theology in his clear and punctual style\u201d and that the 90-year-old retired pope responded instead with a \u201cbeautiful, personal letter.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Benedict condemned the \u201cfoolish prejudice\u201d of critics who depicted Francis as a pragmatic pastor without theology and Benedict as an academic with his head in the clouds. Benedict added that the books helped clarify \u201cthe interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.\u201d\n\nMonsignor Vigano and the Vatican disseminated a photo of the letter and spun it as Benedict\u2019s seal of good papal housekeeping for Francis. The suggestion was that Benedict had read and approved of the books. But there were some key omissions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt turned out that the Vatican had purposely blurred the final two lines on the letter\u2019s first page in which Benedict acknowledged that he had not actually read the books and that he was physically unable and too busy to contribute his own theological assessment of Pope Francis. Distorted though it was, at least the first page saw the light of day. In the photo, the letter\u2019s second page sits buried under the books about Francis. Only Benedict\u2019s signature was visible.\n\nMonsignor Vigano, in a sort of Keystone Clergy moment, himself drew attention to the omissions in the photo when he read the missing text at Monday\u2019s news conference. Mr. Magister, who was at the news conference, transcribed and published the remarks.\n\nThe Associated Press first drew attention to what appeared to be blurred lines in the photo of the letter. Its discovery prompted an outcry, especially among Catholic conservatives who complained that their hero, Pope Benedict, was being exploited to paper over Francis\u2019 doctrinal deficiencies. The Twitter hashtag #releasetheletter went viral.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Back then, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group, blends accounted for 98 percent of the Scotch market in the United States, about 13.1 million cases against just 240,000 cases of single malts. By 2017, that proportion had dropped to 77 percent of the Scotch market, which had dwindled in total to about 9.3 million cases.\n\nDuring that time, sales of blends dropped to about 7.2 million cases in 2017 while sales of single malts rose to about 2.1 million, an increase of almost ninefold. Nonetheless, a lot of blended Scotch is sold in the United States, nearly twice as much as Irish whiskey, which over the last few years has been the fastest-growing spirit in the country.\n\nLargely out of curiosity, the spirits panel recently tasted through 20 bottles of blended Scotch in an effort to see what they offered. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two drinks writers, David Wondrich and Robert Simonson.\n\nFirst, some definitions. All Scotch whisky must be made in Scotland. Single malts come from a single distillery and are distilled entirely from malted barley. Malting simply means soaking the barley until it germinates, which releases enzymes that convert starches to fermentable sugars. The germination is stopped by heating the barley, sometimes over peat fires, which impart a smoky aroma.\n\nBlended Scotch combines malt whisky, either a single malt or many, with grain whisky. The whiskies must be aged at least three years in oak barrels, and if a bottle carries an age statement, like \u201c8 Years Old,\u201d it means that the youngest whisky in the blend is that old.\n\nWhile the malt components are the crucial elements, the grain whisky is not just neutral spirit, like vodka. It, too, takes on character as it ages.\n\nOne other important Scotch category exists, blended malt whisky, a combination of two or more single malts. These whiskies, which used to be called vatted malts, can be wonderful and complex. But they differ from blended Scotch as they do not contain any grain whisky.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think of blended Scotch as diluted malt whisky. There may be some truth to that, but it\u2019s not the whole story. In his excellent guide, \u201cThe World Atlas of Whisky,\u201d Dave Broom asserts that in good blended Scotches, grain whisky coaxes out the complexities of a malt by emphasizing secondary characteristics that might otherwise be hidden.\n\n\u201cMalts are about intensity of character,\u201d he writes. \u201cSingle-malt bottlings are about maximizing this singularity. Blends are about creating a totality.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Broom\u2019s book devotes just three pages to blended Scotch and more than 150 to single malts. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a lot of celebration,\u201d Robert said.\n\nDavid noted that efforts are made periodically to talk up blended Scotch, but they never really take hold, particularly among younger consumers. \u201cBlended Scotch doesn\u2019t have the craft imprimatur,\u201d he said, \u201ceven though some are really good, like Pinch, if you can even find it.\u201d\n\nSadly, we did not have Pinch among our 20 bottles.\n\nWe all found a lot to like among these blended Scotches. I was drawn to their mildness and restraint. It was easy to see how they would satisfy people who prefer whisky that is not as aggressive as many single malts.\n\nNonetheless, we preferred the whiskies that had assertive malt characters, with creamy textures and lingering flavors.\n\nThe differences among many of them were small and incremental. David said he was expecting more variation among them, and recalled that years ago blended Scotches were maltier and peatier. Robert felt that, as producers are able to blend any whiskies they want, they might have missed an opportunity to stand out from the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut they are making these whiskies for an audience,\u201d he said, \u201cso they are obliged to satisfy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur No. 1 bottle was Buchanan\u2019s Master, which seemed to epitomize the category: smoky but not too smoky, rich and creamy but not too much so, more complete package than singular distinctiveness.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At $24 for a liter, it was also our best value.\n\nTeacher\u2019s was on the cusp of what the trade refers to as value and premium brands, the lower end of the price spectrum and the categories of Scotch that are declining the fastest. Any growth in blended Scotch, the Distilled Spirits Council said, is coming among high-end premium and especially super premium, the most expensive categories. Super premium includes brands like Johnnie Walker Blue Label, which, at $150 or so a bottle, exceeded our $100 cap.\n\nThe ever-popular Johnnie Walker Black Label, however, a high-end premium brand at $55 a liter, was our No. 3 bottle. It was creamy, complex and among the smoothest of the whiskies, which may be because it was one of only three bottles in our tasting to carry an age statement, 12 years. The other 12-year-old in our top 10 was Chivas Regal at No. 6, rounded and mild with subtle aromas of malt and flowers.\n\nNo. 4 was the spicy, easygoing Compass Box Asyla, which had a natural sort of sweetness that differed markedly from the sweetness that comes from the legal use of caramel as a coloring agent. We found several bottles that tasted overly of caramel. They did not make the cut.\n\nOther notable bottles included the fresh, chewy Ballantine\u2019s Finest, the smooth and spicy White Horse, the creamy J & B Rare, the gently peaty Dewar\u2019s White Label and the concentrated John Begg Blue Cap.\n\nI\u2019m not sure any of us were convinced enough by the tasting to trade in distinctive single malts for mild blends. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting group,\u201d David said. \u201cThey\u2019re for drinkers who do not want to be challenged.\u201d\n\nYet they have a clear place as a component for mixed drinks, whether Scotch and sodas or the few classic Scotch cocktails like Rob Roys and Rusty Nails.\n\nAside from those, I\u2019ll always have my fragrant memories.\n\nTasting Blended Scotches\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Buchanan\u2019s Master Blended Scotch Whisky 40 percent $48, 750 milliliters\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmoky, rich and creamy, with discernible malt flavors that linger.

But that bottle of workmanlike Scotch can also contribute its alcohol and flavor to the cooking process. I have soaked dried currants in whisky to add to a simple chocolate cake. Here, taking my cue from the Blood and Sand cocktail, made with orange juice and Scotch, I used the spirit to bolster a warm bread pudding laced with orange, both grated zest and candied peel, and finished with a marmalade and whiskey glaze.

I\u2019d hold my head high sporting bright red lipstick and a full beard; dance on the bar, unshaven legs exposed by a miniskirt; strut unashamed across cobblestones in four-inch heels. I wasn\u2019t just gay \u2014 I was a total queen. And for half of the gay men on campus, I was something of a goddess, an inspiration, a friend.\n\nBut for the other half, I was embarrassing. I was that flamboyant gay kid who made everyone else look bad by association. Many gay men on campus were so unsettled by me, so vicariously ashamed of my gender expression, that they\u2019d avoid eye contact, wouldn\u2019t even talk to me. The irony is that these very gay men were allowed to be \u201cnormal\u201d because I was the campus freak. My unabashed femininity was what paved the way for gay men in, say, fraternities to come out without jeopardizing their masculinity. I was the shameful femme foil to their butch pride.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "THE ACT OF producing art can be anything but romantic. To escape the blank page, the only thing on earth as passive as yourself, you cast about for distractions, half-convinced that avoiding your project will shower some sort of mystical growth hormone on your ideas. Yet for some artists, such as William Carlos Williams, life and art were more than each other\u2019s palate cleansers. The poet doctor saw his dual vocations as mysteriously fused. \u201cThey are two parts of a whole,\u201d he contended in his 1967 autobiography. \u201cIt is not two jobs at all \u2026 one rests the man when the other fatigues him.\u201d As a physician, Williams developed an antenna for the \u201cinarticulate poems\u201d emanating from his patients, even as he resolved to \u201cuse the material I knew\u201d from practicing medicine in his writing.\n\nWhat, then, is the real relationship between art and trade? Agonistic? Complementary? The question, suggesting something like a creative sanctum shimmering a few meters above the room in which you punch a clock or schedule a meeting, supposes that aesthetic experience is categorically different from everyday experience, and that muse-fueled invention floats apart from earthier forms of productivity.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut those borders have a tricky way of dispersing. Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s 1964 \u201cLunch Poems,\u201d a set of imagistic, peripatetic musings on a city in motion, are beloved in part because they manage to articulate the balance of work and life. Written on his breaks, their title an invitation to us to read them on ours, the seemingly dashed-off lines celebrate the pleasure a mind can take in wandering through its own busyness: Creative practice can be meditative flow, but it can also be worthy of a Ricky Gervais punch line. The author Sujatha Gidla, whose recent memoir, \u201cAnts Among Elephants,\u201d examined India\u2019s caste system, has been a conductor for the New York City subway since 2009. \u201cI\u2019m very disorganized,\u201d she told me immediately, before I could frame my first question. \u201cYou must factor that in to how difficult it is to manage work and writing.\u201d But for all the stress of brainstorming ideas during her commute and transcribing interviews in the M.T.A. break room, Gidla would never quit her day job. \u201cIt\u2019s masculine; I fancy it,\u201d she said. What\u2019s more, Gidla fervently believes that the individual \u201cshould be participating in social production, something useful for society.\u201d She has met people from all over the world (\u201ceven Liberia\u201d) at the M.T.A., drinking in their \u201ccosmopolitanism and openness.\u201d She enjoys their company. \u201cWriting is kind of lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel like, this is my environment. At work I have no choice but to talk to people.\u201d\n\nSome cultivate their art because it sustains their work, or because it fulfills a sense of civic responsibility. Writing children\u2019s literature \u201chas helped me grow in confidence as a person, which in turn has helped me develop \u2026 as an officer, too,\u201d said Gavin Puckett, a U.K.-based policeman (it remains his primary income source) and author of the prizewinning 2013 \u201cFables From the Stables\u201d series. Puckett, who joined the service in 1998, sketched the rhyming adventure \u201cMurray the Horse\u201d after passing a horse in a field while listening to a radio announcer report on \u201csports and activities you can only complete backwards\u201d \u2014 he imagined a story about a horse that runs in reverse. He admits that telling stories still makes him feel as though he\u2019s \u201cstepping out of character.\u201d \u201cMy role as a police officer came first,\u201d he told me.\n\nOthers are pulled, almost involuntarily, the other way. Edi Rama, the Prime Minister of Albania, sometimes feels his hand doodling as he contemplates a political decision. The art pours out to center and steady him. In 1998, Rama left a promising career as an artist in Paris to become Albania\u2019s minister of culture. Now the country\u2019s leader, he shows his loose, improvisatory drawings and sculptures in galleries around the world. \u201cI found myself drawing almost all my working time whilst interacting with people in my office or on the phone,\u201d he said in a 2016 interview. \u201cI began to understand that my subconscious was being helped \u2026 by my hand to stay calm while my conscious had to focus on demanding topics.\u201d\n\nArt, so often the wild or ephemeral factor in this equation, stabilizes the politician. Do politics abet the artist? Unlike Williams, Rama does not borrow directly from his waking life for subject matter; he aims to explore automated and preconscious processes. But perhaps the day\u2019s noise makes the quiet of drawing more numinous and clarifying. A year ago, Rama papered the walls of the Kryeministria, Albania\u2019s main government building, with his own compositions. He wanted to remind himself of spaces in which \u201cpolitics, with its characters and struggles, has evaporated\u201d \u2014 to appreciate a freedom he might otherwise forget he had.\n\nPhoto\n\nBACK TO THE artist in her turret. Though ethereal, she possesses monomaniacal focus. She can barely cook for herself, let alone pursue other hobbies. Her cultural ascent coincides with the waning of another figure: the renaissance person, who is allowed to excel at multiple things. At the risk of overliteralizing, one of the West\u2019s foundational creatives, Leonardo da Vinci, held down at least a dozen occupations, from cartographer to engineer to painter to architect. But today, we ridicule Tom Hanks for composing short stories, Steve Martin for trying his hand at a novella, James Franco for making a run at poetry. Why do we rain down suspicion on those who seem ruled by competing creative impulses? In this moment when our pieties about identity are unraveling to admit more nuance, what\u2019s wrong with letting people do two things at once?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome artists may try to simultaneously grow both of their undertakings \u2014 and yet the balance shifts from year to year.

She inscribed lines of poetry on the candles\u2019 packaging and enmeshed herself in every aspect of design and production. Hi Wildflower also became a form of introspection, \u201ca space to rethink my values,\u201d Islam said. The business was separate from the work of book-composing, but not conceptually distant from it: Islam envisioned her aromatherapy and skin-care artifacts moving through the public sphere in the same tender way her sentences did.\n\nYet as Hi Wildflower developed into the author\u2019s main source of income, morphing from an alternate expression of the energies that drove her fiction into \u201ca way of keeping afloat in a society that doesn\u2019t pay artists to do their work,\u201d its meaning mutated. The company now has three employees, 70 products and distribution ties to boutique retailers. Business is where Islam works; writing is where she dreams and roams. She no longer notates individual candle wrappers with poems, and she\u2019s delegated some of the more menial production tasks. When I spoke to her, Islam was at work on a collection of poems and a second novel. Meanwhile, Hi Wildflower, an erstwhile extension of her aesthetic self, has clumped off into its own entity, an enterprise that props her up materially and gives her space to write.\n\nFinancial security (for now, at least) is not the only thing the business has bequeathed Islam. \u201cWhen I create, I want this sense of quietness and wisdom to seep in,\u201d she told me, echoing Rama. \u201cBut leading a company has made me tough on myself as an artist. You experience so much discomfort [in writing]: pitching articles, revising, building your brand. Having a business primes you for that kind of grind, that hustle.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own\u201d (1929), her famous, passionate argument about the material conditions necessary for writing, Virginia Woolf compared fiction to a \u201cspider\u2019s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.\u201d It is a lovely vision of art hanging from the beams of reality, only people are not spiders \u2014 they don\u2019t generate just one thing. The trope of the secluded creator has echoes of imprisonment and stasis. (After all, who wants to spend all their time in one room, even if it belongs to them?) Sometimes the artist needs to turn off, to get out in the fray, to stop worrying over when her imagination\u2019s pot will boil \u2014 because, of course, it won\u2019t if she\u2019s watching. And regardless of whether the reboot results in brilliance down the line, that lunchtime stroll isn\u2019t going to take itself, those stray thoughts won\u2019t think themselves, the characters on the corner certainly won\u2019t gawk at themselves.

He added that efforts to convert people to Christianity amounted to \u201csolemn nonsense.\u201d\n\nAt first, the Vatican\u2019s spokesman at the time, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, confirmed the interview as \u201cfaithful to the thought.\u201d He subsequently published the article in its entirety on L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the Vatican\u2019s official outlet, and in a space on the website of the Holy See usually reserved for papal speeches.\n\nThen the Vatican, which recently digitally blurred out embarrassing lines of a letter sent by Pope Benedict XVI, removed the text from its website. \u201cThere were some misunderstandings and disagreements about its value,\u201d Father Lombardi said back then.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe two men spoke again in July 2014, and Mr. Scalfari published an article in which he said the pope had estimated that 8,000 members of the clergy, including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles and that perhaps priestly celibacy should be reconsidered.\n\nThe Vatican responded by asking whether a lack of quotation marks suggested \u201can attempt to manipulate some na\u00efve readers.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Scalfari quoted Francis as having said that \u201call the divorced and remarried who ask will be admitted\u201d to Communion. Father Lombardi responded that observers \u201cknow the way Scalfari writes.\u201d\n\nBut throughout, the Vatican has seemed reluctant to bring down the hammer on an erudite man toward whom the pope apparently had grown affectionate.\n\nFrancis stayed in touch with Mr. Scalfari, calling him on the phone and inviting him in for another long chat in November 2016. Mr. Scalfari described their warm greetings and reported that the pope said, \u201cIt is the communists who think like Christians.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s controversy is not the first time Mr. Scalfari and the pope have visited the subject of hell. In October 2017, Mr. Scalfari wrote, \u201cPope Francis has abolished the places where souls were supposed to go after death: hell, purgatory, heaven.\u201d\n\nBut the pope, who is surrounded by a court full of politically attuned cardinals, yes men and conservatives trying to undercut his mission, keeps coming back to Mr. Scalfari.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become friends,\u201d Mr. Scalfari said, recalling that the pope helped him into his car during the last visit, and that this time he walked him to the door. \u201cHe blessed me, but knowing that I\u2019m not faithful, he blew me a kiss.

Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader, never became the target that Pelosi did, nor has Chuck Schumer, Reid\u2019s successor.\n\nIn an Atlantic piece, Peter Beinart lays out some strong evidence that sexism is a major reason.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "If I had to say where my drinking began \u2014 which first time began it \u2014 I might say it started with my first blackout, or maybe the first time I sought blackout: the first time I wanted nothing more than to be absent from my own life. Maybe it started the first time I threw up from drinking; the first time I dreamed about drinking; the first time I lied about drinking; the first time I dreamed about lying about drinking, when the craving had become so deep that there wasn\u2019t much of me that wasn\u2019t committed to either serving or fighting it.\n\nI started drinking every day when I was in graduate school in Iowa City, where getting drunk daily didn\u2019t seem dramatic and pronounced so much as encompassing and inevitable. There were so many ways and places to get drunk: the fiction-writers\u2019 bar in a smoky double-wide trailer, with a stuffed fox head and a bunch of broken clocks; the poets\u2019 bar down the street, with its anemic cheeseburgers and glowing Schlitz ad, a scrolling electric landscape with a gurgling stream and neon grassy banks, a flickering waterfall. I mashed the lime in my vodka tonic and glimpsed \u2014 in the sweet spot between two drinks and three, then three and four, then four and five \u2014 my life as something illuminated from the inside. There were parties at a place called the Farm House, out in the cornfields, where poets wrestled in a kiddie pool full of Jell-O, and everyone\u2019s profile looked beautiful in the crackling light of a mattress bonfire. Winter took us below zero. There were endless potlucks where older writers brought braised meats and younger writers brought plastic tubs of hummus, and everyone brought whiskey, and everyone brought wine. Winter kept going; we kept drinking. Then it was spring. We kept drinking then too.\n\nThe first time I told the story of my drinking, I sat among other drinkers who no longer drank. Ours was a familiar scene: circled folding chairs, foam cups of coffee gone lukewarm, phone numbers exchanged. Before the meeting, I imagined what might happen after it was done: People would compliment my story or the way I\u2019d told it, and I\u2019d demur, Well, I\u2019m a writer, shrugging, trying not to make too big a deal out of it. I practiced with notecards beforehand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was after I\u2019d gone through the part about my abortion, and how much I\u2019d been drinking pregnant; after the part about the night I don\u2019t call date rape, and the etiquette of reconstructing blackouts \u2014 it was somewhere in the muddled territory of sobriety, getting to the repetitions of apology or the physical mechanics of prayer, that an old man in a wheelchair, sitting in the front row, started shouting: \u201cThis is boring!\u201d\n\nWe all knew him, this old man. He was instrumental in setting up a gay recovery community in our town, back in the \u201970s, and now he was in the care of his much-younger, soft-spoken partner, who changed the man\u2019s diapers and wheeled him faithfully to meetings where he shouted obscenities. He was ill, losing the parts of his mind that filtered and restrained his speech; \u201cKiss me, wench!\u201d he once said, as he held my hand for our closing prayer. But he often sounded like our collective id, saying all the things that were never said aloud in meetings: I don\u2019t care. This is tedious. I\u2019ve heard this before. He was nasty and sour, and he had also saved a lot of people\u2019s lives. Now he was bored.\n\nOther people at the meeting shifted uncomfortably in their seats. The woman sitting beside me touched my arm, a way of saying, Don\u2019t stop. So I didn\u2019t. I kept going \u2014 stuttering, eyes hot, throat swollen \u2014 but this man had managed to tap veins of primal insecurity: that my story wasn\u2019t good enough, or that I\u2019d failed to tell it right, that I\u2019d somehow failed at my dysfunction, failed to make it bad or bold or interesting enough; that recovery had flatlined my story past narrative repair.\n\nDuring the early days of my drinking, I was drawn to the legendary writer-drunks. I understood their drinking as proof of extreme interior weather. If you needed to drink that much, you had to hurt, and drinking and writing were two different responses to that same molten pain: You could numb it, or you could grant it a voice.\n\nWhile I was studying at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, I spent my nights at the writers\u2019 bars on Market Street, and I spent my days reading the other writers who had gotten drunk in that town before I\u2019d gotten drunk there: John Berryman, Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson. The myths of their drinking ran like subterranean rivers underneath all the drinking I was doing. Their drinking seemed like proof of their proximity to the terror and profundity of psychic darkness. As Patricia Highsmith argued, drinking allowed the artist to \u201csee the truth, the simplicity and the primitive emotions once more.\u201d Jack London wrote about the \u201cimaginative\u201d drunk for whom the \u201cwhite light of alcohol\u201d granted access to bleak truths about the human conditions \u2014 what he called \u201cthe pitiless, spectral syllogisms of the white logic.\u201d Booze was illumination and consolation. It helped you see, and then it helped you survive the sight.\n\nDenis Johnson\u2019s short-story collection \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d was our bible of beauty and damage, a hallucinated vision of how and where we lived. Half the book took place in Iowa City bars; its stories were full of farmhouse parties and hungover mornings. There was a dilapidated old house where people smoked pharmaceutical opium and said things like: \u201cMcInnes isn\u2019t feeling too good today. I just shot him.\u201d Johnson\u2019s protagonist looked at the giant screen of a drive-in theater in the cornfields and saw a sacred vision: \u201cThe sky was torn away and the angels were descending out of a brilliant blue summer, their huge faces streaked with light and full of pity.\u201d He had mistaken the ordinary Iowa around us for something sacred, and drugs and booze had helped him do it. One of Johnson\u2019s poems described being \u201cjust a poor mortal human having stumbled onto/the glen where the failed gods are drinking.\u201d That\u2019s what it felt like to drink in Iowa. This sense of affinity had been passed down like a half-glorious, half-absurd inheritance.\n\nBut if mythic intoxication was an inheritance, who had the right to claim it? It seemed like a family tree composed almost entirely of men. Women rarely got to strike the same roguish silhouettes. \u201cWhen a woman drinks it\u2019s as if an animal were drinking, or a child,\u201d Marguerite Duras wrote. A woman\u2019s drinking is often understood less as the necessary antidote to her own staggering wisdom and more as self-indulgence or melodrama, hysteria, an unpardonable affliction.\n\nThis is only one of many double standards, of course. Some addicts are pitied, others are blamed. Race and class have everything to do with this abiding cognitive dissonance. But in Iowa, I didn\u2019t see this context. I just wanted entry to the boys\u2019 club. I wanted to understand my drinking as part of a story about the kind of creativity that had to happen past the boundaries of comfort. As Berryman himself put it in his poem \u201cDream Song 57\u201d: \u201cSomething can (has) been said for sobriety/but very little.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSitting on a folding chair in a church basement, you always face the question of how to begin \u2014 how to assemble your private ledger of traumas into what people in meetings call a drunkalog. The early days of my drinking are the easiest ones to dress in costumes of nostalgia: drinking in smoky bars with other 22-year-olds who dreamed of becoming writers; running drunk through the peeling paint of the French Quarter, riding piggyback on my boyfriend, both of us fueled by shots of well bourbon; drinking lukewarm rum by candlelight during power outages in Nicaragua.\n\nBut the truer story of my drinking is really a story about tedium, about claustrophobia and repetition. At a certain point, it started to expose itself as something that wasn\u2019t revelry, that wasn\u2019t about connection but isolation, that wasn\u2019t about dark wisdom or metaphysical angst \u2014 that wasn\u2019t about anything, really, besides the urge to get drunk, by myself, with no one watching.\n\nThe night of my first meeting, when I was 26 and desperate, I drove across the river to an address near the hospital, crying all the way across the Burlington Street Bridge, my tears streaking the streetlamps into bright white rain. It was almost Halloween: cobwebs on porches, hanging ghosts made from stuffed sheets, jack-o\u2019-lanterns with their crooked grins. Being drunk was like having a candle lit inside you. I already missed it.\n\nThe first two times I had stopped drinking, I didn\u2019t go to meetings. It seemed like crossing an irrevocable threshold. Those times, some part of me suspected I would probably end up drinking again, and I didn\u2019t want voices from meetings chiding me when I did. But this time I wanted to cross a line \u2014 to make it harder to go back. It was like taking out an insurance policy against the version of myself who \u2014 days from now, weeks from now, months from now \u2014 would miss the drinking so much she\u2019d say: I want to try again.\n\nI wasn\u2019t quitting because I wanted to quit. I had woken up that morning, just like every other morning, wanting to drink more than I wanted to do anything else. Quitting seemed like the only way I would ever arrive at a life where drinking wasn\u2019t the thing I wanted to do most when I woke up. When I imagined a meeting, I pictured grizzled men in a church basement talking about their D.T.s and their time in detox wards, gripping their foam cups with trembling hands. I pictured what I\u2019d seen on television: slow claps and nodding heads, earnest mmm-hmms. But I didn\u2019t know what else to try.\n\nWhen I reached the gravel parking lot of the address I\u2019d copied down, it was just a clapboard house, not a church. But the lights were on. For 10 minutes I sat in my car without killing the engine, heat blasting, wiping my snotty nose with the back of my wrist, jamming my fists into my eyes to make them stop crying. I was searching for a story I could tell myself that would take me back home: Maybe I\u2019ll come back tomorrow, maybe I don\u2019t have to be here, maybe I can do this on my own, maybe I don\u2019t have to do it at all.\n\nThe meeting itself \u2014 once I willed myself out of the car, into the cold and through the lit doorway \u2014 was just a bunch of strangers gathered around a huge wooden table, past a kitchen tracked with footprints, old linoleum curling upward at the edges of the room. People smiled as if they were glad to see me, almost as if they\u2019d been expecting me. A sheet cake on the table was frosted in muted sunset tones.\n\nA man called Bug was celebrating an unthinkable amount of time without booze. He described staying in his apartment for 40 days straight \u2014 without leaving, without going anywhere, like Christ in the desert of a low-rent Iowa condo \u2014 and getting handles of vodka delivered to his door. I thought: I never got that bad. And then: Vodka delivery actually sounds pretty great. When Bug described how he\u2019d gotten there \u2014 starting with the ritual of a vodka tonic with the 6 o\u2019clock news, his whole day built around it \u2014 I thought, Yep. Imagining the rest of my life without that relief made me sick to my stomach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in that room, I felt a different relief, just an inkling: the eerie immediacy of hearing myself spoken out loud. These people didn\u2019t know anything about me, but they knew one part of me \u2014 the part that thought about drinking all day, every day \u2014 better than anyone else. I tucked myself quietly in a corner. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say aside from my name \u2014 which, as it turned out, was enough.\n\nOnce I got sober, I became more interested in the question of what little, as Berryman put it, could be said for sobriety. If addiction stories ran on the fuel of darkness \u2014 the hypnotic spiral of an ongoing, deepening crisis \u2014 then recovery often seemed like the narrative slack, the dull terrain of wellness, a tedious addendum to the riveting blaze. I wasn\u2019t immune; I\u2019d always been enthralled by stories of wreckage. But when I got sober, I wanted to know if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart. I needed to believe they could.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019d come to realize that many of my drunk icons had actually gotten sober eventually, or tried to, and I went looking for proof that recovery had not blunted or destroyed their creativity. It was like the desire the poet Eavan Boland confessed when she asked for poems with women who weren\u2019t beautiful or young: \u201cI want a poem/I can grow old in. I want a poem I can die in.\u201d I wanted a story I could get sober in.\n\nMany of the writers I\u2019d come to idolize were famous for work that evoked the pulsing dysfunction of their addictions: the slurred voices and wild visions of Berryman\u2019s \u201cDream Songs,\u201d or the weary distances of Carver\u2019s short stories, their tense conversations strewn with silences. The work that evoked sobriety \u2014 much less recovery \u2014 had often faded into obscurity, out of print or unpublished, lodged deep in file boxes in hushed university libraries.\n\nAt Berryman\u2019s archives in Minneapolis, I found A.A. step-work covered with coffee stains and cigarette burns. The inventory he completed when he arrived at rehab in 1970, in a Minneapolis hospital called St. Mary\u2019s, spelled out the wasteland his drinking had made of his life:\n\nWife left me after 11 yrs of marriage bec. of drinking. Despair, heavy drinking alone, jobless, penniless in N.Y. ... Seduced students drunk. ... My chairman told me I had called up a student drunk at midnight & threatened to kill her. ... Drunk in Calcutta, wandered streets lost all night, unable to remember my address. ... Wet bed drunk in London hotel, manager furious, had to pay for new mattress, $100. ... Defecated uncontrollably in a University corridor, got home unnoticed. ... My wife said St. Mary\u2019s or else. Came here.\n\nAfter his first few stints at rehab, Berryman began to think about writing a novel called \u201cRecovery\u201d: \u201cmake a book of these notes \u2014 useful 12th step work \u2014 probably hardly worked up at all, only expanded and glossed, with some background ... on Hazelden and St Mary\u2019s last spring. ...\u201d When Berryman described the novel as \u201cuseful 12th step work,\u201d he was imagining the potential impact it might have on other alcoholics \u2014 that it might help them understand their addictions more fully, or come to believe in the possibilities of recovery. But I suspect he was also hoping the novel could do something for him, that it might prove that his sober energies could be translated into a new kind of creative project \u2014 less stylistically adorned, perhaps (\u201chardly worked up at all\u201d) but just as deeply felt, and more explicitly geared toward emotional generosity \u2014 the project of reaching others in their desperation.\n\nPhoto\n\nBerryman had long cherished his reputation as a drunken sage \u2014 had loved, for instance, the seven-page profile Life magazine published in 1967, with a photograph of him in a Dublin bar surrounded by foam-lipped pints. \u201cWhisky and ink, whisky and ink, these are the fluids John Berryman needs,\u201d the article began. \u201cHe needs them to survive and describe the thing that sets him apart from other men and even from other poets: his uncommonly, almost maddeningly penetrating awareness of the fact of human mortality.\u201d But by the time Berryman started working on \u201cRecovery,\u201d he had come to see the notion that he needed to drink in order to write as a delusion. \u201cSo long as I considered myself as merely the medium of (arena for) my powers, sobriety was out of the question,\u201d he wrote in his journals in 1971. \u201cThe even deeper delusion that my art depended on my drinking, or at least was connected with it, could not be attakt directly. Too far down. The cover had to be exploded off.\u201d\n\nThe protagonist of \u201cRecovery\u201d is a renowned professor of immunology named Alan Severance \u2014 almost amusingly revered, as if celebrity immunologists are nothing out of the ordinary \u2014 who struggles, as Berryman did, to reconcile his acclaimed professional life with his identity as a debilitated alcoholic. From his room at rehab, Alan sees the spires of the college campus where he teaches: \u201cTowers above the trees across the river reminded him he was University Professor Severance not the craven drunk Alan S who had been told by an orderly that his room smelled like a farmyard.\u201d At rehab, Severance is constantly reaching for the part of himself capable of something besides self-concern: \u201cHis own hope was to forget about himself and think about the others.\u201d The novel is all about the world of rehab \u2014 its linoleum floors, cafeteria food and daily mundanity \u2014 but it\u2019s ultimately about these others, and what it might mean to think about them. A woman named Arabella tells the group that she hasn\u2019t wanted to do anything but scream for years. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember a time when you didn\u2019t have it?\u201d her counselor asks, and she replies, \u201cDrinking sends it away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe core question of \u201cRecovery\u201d is whether something else might send it away instead. Perhaps other people might. This had been Berryman\u2019s hope in life as well. \u201cIn hospitals he found his society,\u201d his friend Saul Bellow wrote about Berryman\u2019s stints in rehab. \u201cAbout these passioning countrymen he did not need to be ironical.\u201d In the spring of 1971, during his last sustained bout of sobriety, Berryman taught a course at the University of Minnesota called \u201cThe Post-Novel: Fiction as Wisdom-work.\u201d This was what he was trying in \u201cRecovery,\u201d as well: something like wisdom-work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He left only yellow notecards suggesting the possible endings he\u2019d imagined. \u201cEND OF NOVEL,\u201d he wrote on one. \u201cTURN THIS CARD OVER.\u201d On the back, he wrote: \u201cHe might, certainly, at any time drink again. But it didn\u2019t seem likely. He felt \u2014 calm.\u201d On an alternate card labeled \u201cLAST PAGE OF BOOK,\u201d he wrote: \u201cOn Pikes Peak, coming down. He was perfectly ready. No regrets. He was happier than he had ever been in his life before. Lucky, and he didn\u2019t deserve it. He was very, very lucky. Bless everybody. He felt \u2014 fine.\u201d\n\nBut I suspected that part of why he couldn\u2019t finish the book is that he didn\u2019t feel fine. Those phrases \u2014 He felt \u2014 fine, He felt \u2014 calm \u2014 are haunted by similar phrases that appear earlier in the book, statements of feeling punctuated by the long, uncertain pause of a dash: He felt \u2014 depressed. He felt \u2014 nowhere.\n\nBerryman kept writing in the composition notebook dedicated to \u201cRecovery\u201d even after he gave up on the novel itself. But his final entries, from December 1971, are full of despair: \u201cterrible continual thoughts of suicide \u2014 cowardly, cruel, wicked \u2014 beating them off. Don\u2019t believe gun or knife; won\u2019t.\u201d On Jan. 7, 1972, Berryman jumped off the Washington Avenue Bridge near the University of Minnesota, where he taught for almost 20 years, and landed on the riverbank below, dead on impact. He relapsed just days before jumping, after 11 months of sobriety, his longest stretch.\n\nWhen I started visiting the archives of drunk authors who had gotten sober, I thought I was looking for proof of the possibilities of sober creativity. But in truth I was also looking for something much simpler: company in the struggle \u2014 not just the struggle to live without alcohol but the struggle to find a voice that didn\u2019t depend on its thrall. In those early days of sobriety, when I first read Charles Jackson\u2019s 1944 best seller \u201cThe Lost Weekend,\u201d a tragicomic account of a single extended bender, I found myself torn between rooting for its antihero, an aspiring writer named Don Birnam, to get sober and wanting him to find a way to keep drinking. Reading the novel illuminated my own deep ambivalence about booze: how much relief I felt at stopping, how thirsty I still felt.\n\nJackson\u2019s reputation was largely based on that novel, which the director Billy Wilder turned into an Oscar-winning film the following year. The book was revolutionary for its time, in its willingness to portray alcoholism as a state of merciless dependence rather than a metaphysical state illuminated by the sepia-tones of tragic myth, as Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Faulkner, the holy trinity of modernist drunks, had done half a generation earlier. \u201cThe Lost Weekend\u201d was a critical and commercial hit, selling almost a million copies over the course of Jackson\u2019s lifetime. But it frustrated Jackson that its success meant his reputation became so inextricably entwined with alcoholism.\n\nFor decades, Jackson wanted to write the story of his drunk hero once he\u2019d left his lost weekends behind him. But he was perpetually stymied by that hypothetical book, tentatively titled \u201cWhat Happened\u201d; his biographer, Blake Bailey, has observed that Jackson was a master of \u201cworking on every conceivable thing but his novel.\u201d In the months after Jackson began attending A.A. in 1953, however, he was finally able to generate about 150 pages, presenting a more stable vision of his drunk antihero. He wrote to a friend: \u201cIt\u2019s far & away the best thing I\u2019ve done, simpler, more honest, and, for the first time, out of myself \u2014 that is, not self-tortured or -absorbed or -eviscerated.\u201d\n\nThe novel was anchored in the ordinary texture of a sober alcoholic\u2019s daily experience. \u201cI can put it best,\u201d Jackson told his editor, Roger Straus, \u201cby saying that the story happens, is happening \u2014 taking place, like daily living \u2014 on every page.\u201d Jackson wanted to believe his novel could be wondrous in its attention to ordinary human life. But he was also worried. In letters to friends, he openly confessed his anxiety that this approach could seem marked by a \u201ctotal lack of originality\u201d \u2014 the very lack of originality that A.A. was teaching him to embrace. How could he write a novel that would succeed according to the very different standards set by the spheres of literature and recovery?\n\nJackson never finished \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d When I finally read the unpublished manuscript at his archives in New Hampshire, I brought so much desire with me \u2014 to see the fruits of his sober creativity, to see proof that sober creativity was possible \u2014 but found only pages of turgid, convoluted narrative. \u201cI can only write the human, meanderingly,\u201d Jackson had written to a friend, confessing his fears about his long-awaited epic, and reading his pages I started to understand what he meant. I\u2019d been glued to \u201cThe Lost Weekend,\u201d unable to put it down, and I wanted \u201cWhat Happened\u201d to be like that, but it wasn\u2019t. Mostly, it was hopelessly abstract:\n\nWhat life means, it came to him (or he seemed to overhear it), it means all the time, not just at isolated dramatic moments that never happened. If life means anything at all, it means whatever it means every hour, every minute, through any episode big or small, if only one has the awareness to sense it ... each step, the dramatic and the humdrum alike \u2014 every fleeting second of the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe thing was, I actually agreed with what Jackson was saying. I\u2019d come to believe that life happened every hour, every minute; that it wasn\u2019t made of dramatic climaxes so much as quiet effort and continuous presence. But I could also see how Jackson\u2019s desperate desire to deploy his recovery wisdom had crippled his story. His own words about the book now played back to me like an omen: \u201cwith scarcely any \u2018plot\u2019 but much character. ... I\u2019m proud to be so objective & detached, finally.\u201d\n\nThe manuscript bore out some of my worst fears about sobriety: that it was destined to force you into a state of plotless tedium, a string of empty evenings, a life lit by the sallow fluorescence of church-basement bromides rather than the glow of dive-bar-neon escapades. I was afraid that loving the drunk story best meant some part of me still wanted to keep living it. And of course, some part of me did.\n\nNine months into my second sobriety \u2014 the sobriety I\u2019m still inside of, seven years and counting \u2014 I stopped going to meetings and found myself wanting deeply to drink. I\u2019d just moved back to the New England college town where I\u2019d spent several years drinking heavily, and all the old bars made me nostalgic. I remembered their crushed peanut shells and vodka specials, the sweet blur of that nightly surrender. The shimmering alternate world in which I decided to drink again grew close once more. It lay just beyond the drudgework of recanting: I know I said I was an alcoholic and then took it back and said I wasn\u2019t really and then took that back and said I actually was but the thing is I\u2019m really not, I promise. Then I\u2019d be back in the sweet autumnal swirl of red wine and hard cider, the chilled salt slide of dirty martinis. It would be like finally crawling back under the covers on a cold morning.\n\nThat\u2019s when I found \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d David Foster Wallace\u2019s novel didn\u2019t exactly lead me back to meetings, though I did return to them, but it helped me understand why I needed them. More specific, it helped me understand that certain things about meetings could drive me crazy and that I could still need them. The novel had metabolized recovery with so much rigor that it had already asked all my questions and weathered all my intellectual discomforts. It documented what Wallace called the \u201cgrudging move toward maybe acknowledging that this unromantic, unhip, clich\u00e9d A.A. thing \u2014 so unlikely and unpromising ... this goofy slapdash anarchic system of low-rent gatherings and corny slogans and saccharine grins and hideous coffee\u201d might actually offer hope, in its simplicity and its slogans, in its church-basement coffee and its effusion of anonymous and unqualified love.\n\nWhile Berryman and Jackson understood the project of writing sobriety in terms of deprivation \u2014 denying themselves the luxuries of plot and stylistic adornment, eschewing the momentous for the plain-spoken \u2014 Wallace wrote recovery with an exuberant excess. \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is full of humor and wild imagination \u2014 giant feral hamsters roaming the land, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois-separatist assassins in wheelchairs \u2014 and its vision of recovery is similarly full of earnest absurdity: grown men crawling across cheap carpeting with teddy bears tucked into the crooks of their arms, sober folk struggling with \u201cpastry dependence\u201d or a man in rehab killing alley cats to get a sense of \u201cresolution.\u201d \u201cSerious AAs look like these weird combinations of Gandhi and Mr. Rogers,\u201d the novel observes, \u201cwith tattoos and enlarged livers and no teeth.\u201d\n\nIf I\u2019d read \u201cThe Lost Weekend\u201d rooting for Don Birnam to get drunk again, I read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d rooting for Don Gately \u2014 one of Wallace\u2019s protagonists, a beleaguered halfway-house counselor \u2014 to stay sober. Gately describes the newly sober as \u201cso desperate to escape their own interior\u201d that they want \u201cto lay responsibility for themselves at the feet of something as seductive and consuming as their former friend the Substance.\u201d I wanted to lay myself at the feet of the book that told me that.\n\nWallace himself went to a Boston rehab called Granada House in late 1989, seven years before \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d was published and nearly 20 years before his suicide in 2008. In his 2012 biography of Wallace, \u201cEvery Love Story Is a Ghost Story,\u201d D.T. Max argues that Wallace quickly understood the ways that recovery was also a \u201cliterary opportunity.\u201d He credits recovery as part of Wallace\u2019s growing commitment to \u201csingle-entendre writing, writing that meant what it said.\u201d Recovery shifted Wallace\u2019s whole notion of what writing could do, what purpose it might serve \u2014 made him want to dramatize the saving alchemy of community, the transformative force of outward-facing attention, the possibilities of simplicity as an alternative to the clever alibis of complexity. (The rehab staff, he wrote in an anonymous online testimonial often attributed to him, recognized his \u201cmeaningless intellectualization as a way of evading terrible truths.\u201d) I\u2019d been so afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Jackson had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline, as Berryman and Johnson and maybe the older waitress sitting at the Tuesday-morning meeting had been afraid of sobriety as a flatline. I\u2019d been afraid that meetings were basically lobotomies served alongside coffee-flavored water and Chips Ahoy!; afraid that even if sobriety could offer stability and sincerity and maybe even salvation, it could never be a story. But \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d knew better. It wasn\u2019t that the novel\u2019s brilliance survived the deadening force of sobriety. Its brilliance depended on what sobriety had wrought.\n\nThree years after I got sober, I found myself teaching Denis Johnson\u2019s stories to a classroom of college students in Connecticut: another circle of chairs full of people listening to tales of drugged-out misadventure. My students seemed unspeakably cool \u2014 they spent their weekends finding their spirit animals and doing drugs I\u2019d never heard of \u2014 and I was desperate to earn their affection. On the first day of class, I brought two dozen doughnuts and a cardboard box of coffee, and then I kept bringing them each week, afraid that if I stopped, the students would be disappointed. When we read Johnson\u2019s stories about barflies and hallucinated visions, I could see myself a decade earlier, convinced that these fever dreams had a monopoly on creative brilliance, these farmhouses full of pharmaceutical opium and outdoor movie screens lit by the gigantic faces of angels. I asked the class if they had a favorite story from the collection. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s no right answer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut I was lying. There was a right answer. Their favorite story was supposed to be my favorite story, which was now \u201cBeverly Home\u201d \u2014 the only one about recovery. Johnson\u2019s protagonist is finally sober and working at a rehabilitation center for the elderly and disabled, where he spends his days walking the O-shaped circuit of its lobby with the patients: \u201cAll these weirdos, and me getting a little better every day right in the midst of them,\u201d he says. \u201cI had never known, never even imagined for a heartbeat, that there might be a place for people like us.\u201d\n\nI read that line, the closing line of the story, aloud to my students. I read it \u2014 once, twice, three times \u2014 while they quietly swept up their doughnut crumbs. There might be a place for people like us. Every voice I\u2019d ever heard in meetings echoed in that closing line. Maybe some of my students found it sappy or maudlin, that sense of belonging, but my heart swelled righteously against their imagined accusations. The story believed in something besides the self-immolating antics of dysfunction \u2014 their flickering, intoxicating glow. It was gazing somewhere beyond the horizon, past the blaze.\n\nJohnson, who died last year, first tried to dry out in 1978, in his parents\u2019 home in Tucson, where he was living with his eccentric grandmother Mimi, but he didn\u2019t get sober for good until the early 1980s. \u201cI was addicted to everything,\u201d he said decades later. \u201cNow I just drink a lot of coffee.\u201d At first Johnson was \u201cconcerned about getting sober,\u201d and knew this was \u201ctypical of people who feel artistic.\u201d But he wrote only two stories and a few dozen poems in 10 years while he was actively using, so he figured he didn\u2019t have much to lose. In the first decade after he got sober, he produced four novels, two collections of poetry, a collection of stories and a screenplay.\n\nHis was the arc I\u2019d been looking for: the possibility of sobriety as jet fuel. In his archives, I found a letter a younger writer sent him in 1996: \u201cI want to thank you for your unfailing support and friendship in helping me get acquainted with my alcoholism. It seems there are two kinds of American writers. Those who drink, and those who used to. You introduced me to the latter. Thanks, brother.\u201d\n\nIn an early draft of \u201cBeverly Home,\u201d Johnson wrote: \u201cApproval was something I craved more than drugs or alcohol, and I hadn\u2019t been able to get it in the bars, but it seemed attainable in the rooms.\u201d He meant the rooms of recovery. That early draft shows his ragged, stuttering attempt to articulate that transformation:\n\nI had sobered up just in time to have a nervous breakdown. I had no ide\n\nI had\n\nI was a wi a whimpering dog inside. nothing more than that.\n\nIn a 1965 book review for The New York Times, Charles Jackson wondered about the myth of the tormented artist: \u201cAre we really all that tormented? Or is it something we hang onto, foster, even cherish?\u201d During days spent in the archives and during the midnight hours of my own attempts to write, it was liberating to start questioning the ways I\u2019d understood torment as a prerequisite to beauty. It was liberating to start imagining that there could be meaningful stories told about wreckage, sure, but also meaningful stories told about what it might mean to pull yourself out from under it: stories about showing up for work, for intimacy, for other people; stories about getting through ordinary days without drinking enough vodka to forget yourself entirely. The lie wasn\u2019t that addiction could yield truth. The lie was that addiction had a monopoly on it.", "title": "Does Recovery Kill Great Writing?", "authors": ["Leslie Jamison"]}
{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Term limits were introduced in the 1982 Constitution, partly in response to the destabilizing effects of what the C.C.P. had come to see as the excesses of Mao\u2019s rule, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. Since then, two presidents have stepped down after their second five-year stints. This shift from the rule of a man to the rule of the party has been credited with bringing political stability and economic development to China.\n\nFew authoritarian regimes have established means of tidily transferring power from one leader to the next (except for monarchies, which often rely on heredity). This is one reason that when autocrats, especially long-serving ones, exit the stage, they often do so under duress or by force: Think of Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya in 2011 or, more recently, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.\n\nUntil that moment comes, as much political science research has shown, authoritarian leaders often have to fend off two major threats to their longevity: competition from would-be successors and popular discontent. Removing formal limits on office terms tends to exacerbate both of these problems.\n\nChina, of course, is no garden-variety dictatorship. It is a single-party regime, with the C.C.P. entrenched at every level of government, in most social organizations and increasingly even in private firms, including foreign ones. At its apex sits a group of leaders who rule collectively and consensually under a president long regarded as the first among equals.\n\nBut since becoming head of the C.C.P. in 2012, Mr. Xi has dismantled practices that spread out power and has amassed power for himself.\n\nHe has adeptly leveraged the party\u2019s record of achievements in recent decades, exploiting it to build a cult around his personality. He has justified this as a necessary step in realizing the Chinese Dream, a nationalistic project to build a Strong China, a Civilized China, a Harmonious China and a Beautiful China. The country is no longer biding its time on the world stage; it is asking for its due. And as the architect of this vision, it is Mr. Xi, not the C.C.P., who exemplifies the country\u2019s rejuvenation.\n\nBut now, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to entrench himself as president, perhaps for life, risks undermining the norms and mechanisms developed by the C.C.P. that have brought China \u2014 and Mr. Xi himself \u2014 this far.\n\nLifting term limits removes incentives for would-be leaders to bide their time and wait out Mr. Xi\u2019s tenure, particularly if they are associated with a political faction other than his. The rules of the game have also become more unpredictable. Will Mr. Xi retire after three terms? Four? Or never? With no clear successor in line, any sudden need to transfer power also becomes more fraught.

He pursued a second term in 1792 only at the urging of his cabinet, and in 1796, when he insisted it was time to step down, he famously warned that not to do so risked a return to the very tyranny Americans had fought to overthrow.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form of government, a real despotism,\u201d Washington wrote in what\u2019s become known as his Farewell Address. \u201cA just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, millions of Americans have put their lives on the line to protect against the despotism that Washington warned about. In World War II, Americans sacrificed their lives and lost their loved ones to defeat dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan. For nearly the rest of the 20th century, the United States led the free world to preserve democratic ideals against the Soviet Union\u2019s push for Communism.\n\nThat\u2019s a proud history, and it hasn\u2019t been much of a challenge until recently for American presidents to extol it \u2014 the wisest of them mindful of how far short of its ideals the United States has at times fallen, even as it has tried to guide other nations toward democracy as the surest safeguard of human rights, peace and opportunity.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump Sure Has a Problem With Democracy", "authors": []}

Of course, that didn\u2019t last. Later, a White House official told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cThe invitation has been extended and accepted, and that stands.\u201d\n\nThe planned session builds on an agreement, announced this week, for the United States and North Korea to hold their first sustained direct talks in many years. After a period of aggressively testing nuclear devices and missiles, Mr. Kim opened the door to talks by promising to discuss ending his nuclear program if America guarantees the North\u2019s security. He agreed to suspend nuclear and missile tests during the talks and not to object when the United States and South Korea hold military exercises this spring.\n\nMany assumed the next step would be preparatory talks in which experts from each side would test the other\u2019s intentions and then enter into lengthy formal negotiations. What happens now is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nA White House official provided Trumpian bluster on Thursday, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re not even talking about negotiations\u201d but rather a meeting between Mr. Trump, who \u201cmade his reputation on making deals,\u201d and an authoritarian North Korean leader who has the power to make decisions and therefore avoid the \u201clong slog of the past\u201d negotiations. But the long slog of negotiations has a purpose, allowing the two sides to stake out positions, sometimes in public, then horse-trade privately as they search for a mutually acceptable bottom line. There is reason summit meetings are usually saved for the end, when leaders can give the last push to make a deal happen.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that responsible American officials are not approaching the talks with a serious belief in the skills of a businessman whose impetuousness helped lead to several bankruptcies and who revealed sensitive intelligence secrets to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump seemed optimistic that North Korea\u2019s promise to discuss denuclearization means the North actually would abandon the nuclear program, which includes more than 20 nuclear warheads, an arsenal of missiles and facilities for producing nuclear fuel with both enriched uranium and plutonium. Many experts doubt Mr. Kim will ever give up his nuclear weapons, and one question is whether Mr. Trump could ever accept a compromise, as Mr. Obama did with the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump is threatening to renege on.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump and North Korea: What a Fine Mess", "authors": []}

Insiders report that when Mr. Trump first assembled his cabinet, he rejected Mr. Bolton for secretary of state because of his eccentric brush mustache.\n\nBut central casting, in the guise of Fox News, has encouraged the president to reconsider this prejudice, and having done so, he\u2019s unlikely to regret it.

They come in all varieties \u2014 and context is everything. In the realms of modern business and politics, however, facial hair has particular resonance. Beards and mustaches were effectively banished from these worlds more than a century ago. And so a man who persists in wearing a large mustache is deliberately standing out as a nonconformist. What does he reject? He rejects the longstanding shaving standard, and to some extent, its associated virtues: propriety, discipline and sociability.\n\nThe reasons that mustaches were abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century are complicated, but have to do with hygiene and corporate business culture. Germs were discovered at the end of the nineteenth century, and facial hair was subsequently condemned as unsanitary and uncivilized.

I have resisted predictions about what could come of the investigation because it would be little more than conjecture. Only Mueller knows what Mueller knows.

The most tantalizing and threatening of the three is the case with porn star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Daniels and her attorney, as well as language in the nondisclosure agreement that she signed, suggests that she has some compromising written and photographic evidence about her encounters with Trump.\n\nFurthermore, in Daniels, Trump seems to have met his match as an internet troll.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "More important, the Trump administration has repeatedly dropped the ball on efforts that might have succeeded in prompting China to curb production, something that would have benefited not just the United States but also allies that are now threatening to retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods and services.\n\nMost experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country\u2019s leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together.\n\nCharacteristically, the Trump administration has displayed none of the diplomatic and economic savvy required to get China to change its policies. On Jan. 12, 2017, the Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization that accused China of unfairly subsidizing aluminum producers and thus driving down global prices for the metal. But Mr. Trump\u2019s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has failed to ask the W.T.O. to convene a panel of judges to hear the case, effectively suspending it. Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s office declined to answer questions about the case.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Lighthizer, a trade lawyer who has represented the steel industry, did not believe the case would have been successful because he shares Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt for the W.T.O., an organization the United States was instrumental in creating to help prevent trade wars. Last month, Mr. Trump said the organization \u201cmakes it almost impossible for us to do good business,\u201d arguing that American officials get to pick too few judges on its dispute resolution panels. But these assertions are belied by the fact that the United States has won nearly 86 percent of the cases it has brought before the W.T.O. since 1995.\n\nAnother opportunity for addressing excess steel production came in talks last summer between Chinese officials and Mr. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The Chinese told the Americans they would be willing to reduce China\u2019s steel production capacity by 150 million tons by 2022. But Mr. Trump rejected the offer. An unnamed administration official told The Financial Times that Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t interested in striking a deal because he had already decided that he wanted to impose tariffs.\n\nBy now it should surprise no one that Mr. Trump prefers empty statements to doing the work needed to achieve lasting change. The former is easy to deliver in tweets and public pronouncements, while the latter takes patience and persistence. The president would rather impose tariffs and claim he is protecting the country and bringing back lost jobs than take the time to properly address the problem of excess Chinese steel and aluminum capacity. And he does not seem to care that, in doing so, he might penalize and anger an ally like South Korea, with which the United States needs to work closely on potential negotiations with North Korea, an unpredictable adversary.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump\u2019s Empty Words on Trade", "authors": []}

President Trump hit the trifecta last week when he encouraged the House speaker, Paul Ryan, to scrap start-up money for an additional rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, a project essential to the economic health not only of those two states but of the entire country.\n\nWorse yet, the president\u2019s action bore no relation to objective analysis of the region\u2019s infrastructure needs. Accounts in The Times and The Washington Post said he did it to spite the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, whose sin is failure to fall in lock step with Mr. Trump on a variety of issues.\n\nThis is foolishness. Republicans and Democrats alike broadly agree on the essentiality of the so-called Gateway tunnel, described by many officials as the most urgently needed infrastructure project anywhere in the United States. It will not come cheap, with $11 billion required for the first phase and an estimated $19 billion more needed to finish the job. \u201cPeople get frightened by the cost,\u201d said John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. \u201cBut the alternative is worse.\u201d\n\nExisting tunnels under the Hudson River are more than a century old and stressed by damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

There were more athletes playing soccer and football in the state as well.\n\nRichard Lapchick, chairman of the sports business management program at Central Florida and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, said a lack of opportunity and top-flight competition in the state was mostly to blame.

Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.\n\nPeople in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it\u2019s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it\u2019s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.\n\nMoreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.\n\nFacebook\u2019s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that\u2019s true, don\u2019t expect Facebook to fix itself.\n\nHope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.", "title": "Opinion | Don\u2019t Delete Facebook.

No question, Mr. Bell\u2019s crime was a despicable assault on society itself. In 1971, with fellow Black Liberation Army radicals, he ambushed two police officers in Harlem, repeatedly and fatally shooting them as part of a war they had declared on the United States.\n\nRather than being condemned to prison forever, Mr. Bell got 25 years to life. Now, at 70, and after more than 44 years behind bars, he has been granted parole by a New York State board, which found he had expressed \u201cregret and remorse.\u201d Long in coming though the statement was, he is said to have told board members this month: \u201cThere was nothing political about the act, as much as I thought at the time. It was murder and horribly wrong.\u201d In mid-April, he could be freed from his maximum-security prison in the Hudson Valley.\n\nDespite angry reactions from law enforcement groups and others, the process worked as it should if parole is to amount to more than an empty word. Our prisons call themselves \u201ccorrectional facilities.\u201d The New York board found that Mr. Bell had indeed been corrected, based on a solid disciplinary record, a \u201csturdy network of supporters\u201d and a likelihood of his now leading a \u201claw-abiding life.\u201d To lock him up forever even though deemed a changed man is to make a mockery of his sentence: \u201c25 years to life\u201d is not supposed to be cynical code for \u201clife.\u201d\n\nParole is understandably fraught in cases of slain police officers.

Despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the White House, the economy is improving.

So sell it.\n\nI would go further and argue that it is the Trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder, more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other Republican who might have been elected.\n\nWould a President Jeb Bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty, or would a President Marco Rubio have started construction of a wall? Would President John Kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency, dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy?

They have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform, job creation and regulatory relief.\n\nThe Republican Party will either rally around its Republican president \u2014 and defend our shared accomplishments \u2014 or it will enter the fall with a depressed base and a turnout disadvantage that will lead to major losses in Congress, governorships and state legislatures.

According to a report issued by Front Line Defenders, 67 activists were killed in Brazil last year. Of all the cases tracked by Front Line Defenders, only 12 percent resulted in the arrest of suspects. This seems to prove the sinister efficacy of the killings.\n\nEven when the murders of Brazilian human rights defenders do receive coverage in the news media, people here frequently create other narratives to explain the murders: The person was killed by a lover, or by drug traffickers or by the mob, or committed suicide. And worse: the person might have deserved it.\n\nIt\u2019s happening now with Ms. Franco. Soon after her killing, fake news began to circulate on social media. Some items said she was married to a drug trafficker, others that she was a member of a criminal organization. Some articles said she had smoked pot. Some articles claimed that she had a baby at 16. What a crime! (The truth: She had a baby at 19, a girl named Luyara.

According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\n\nFrom a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d\n\nMr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.\n\nInvestors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.\n\nMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\n\n\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d\n\n(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)\n\nStill, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nShares of Facebook continue to slide.\n\nThe stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\n\nFacebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.\n\nTo put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012.

The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nApple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nElsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.\n\nAndrew\u2019s take\n\nMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others.

The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.\n\nFrom Reuters:\n\nThe option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.\n\nShares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.\n\nPhoto\n\nEddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears\n\nWith Sears Holdings increasingly desperate in its efforts to stay afloat, the company\u2019s C.E.O. gave his first in-depth interview in roughly 15 years to William D.

The plan has met surprisingly strong resistance, despite the need for jobs in a region where manufacturing used to employ one in five workers.

But whether investors think the technology darling is more valuable as a publicly traded company or as a privately held start-up is debatable.\n\nThe San Francisco company said Monday that it planned to raise as much as $648 million in its initial public offering, pricing its shares between $16 and $18 each. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at roughly $7.5 billion, including restricted stock units and options \u2014 well below the $10 billion it commanded during its last private fund-raising round.\n\nThe lower potential valuation suggests that public market investors don\u2019t share nearly the same enthusiasm for technology companies that venture capitalists once did, raising questions for a horde of other high-priced start-ups that are edging their way toward the public markets.\n\nDropbox attained its $10 billion valuation as a privately held company more than four years ago, in a different age for Silicon Valley, when many start-ups raced to collect as high a valuation as they could.

The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.\n\nStill, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.\n\nHis measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.\n\nWhat is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year.

The S.&P. 500 index was down 5.95 percent this week, falling every day but one. And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout, with the S.&P. 500 skidding 2.52 percent on Thursday and 2.1 percent on Friday.\n\nWe know that Mr. Trump watches the stock market\u2019s response to his policies. He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Will this week\u2019s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China? Mr. Trump sounded unfazed on Friday. \u201cI think the stock market is going to be great,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump signs spending bill.\n\nThe president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.\n\nFrom this morning:\n\nJulie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:\n\nBut the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.\n\n(The backstory to the bill: Here\u2019s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers\u2019 objections.)\n\nMark Zuckerberg and the congressional hearing ahead\n\nAs Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing. Finally, on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews. We asked Paul Pendergrass, a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook\u2019s \u201cJack Flack\u201d columnist, to offer his insights into the situation:\n\nIn most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.\n\nThe goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.\n\nHe elaborated:\n\nThe question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.\n\nSo it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.\n\nIf Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask John Stumpf, the former C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and the bank\u2019s current chief executive, Tim Sloan, how much information they were asked to provide. He could ask the same of the C.E.O. of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes. For that matter, Mr. Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch. Just last fall Mr. Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuckerberg is brought in to testify, the committee\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can\u2019t be trusted to regulate themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.\n\nAfter this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse.

He was quickly swallowed by Syracuse\u2019s zone, but somehow managed to kick it out to Duke\u2019s lone senior, Grayson Allen. Allen nailed a 3-pointer and pointed at Bagley in acknowledgment.\n\nAside from brief moments like that one, Duke never really solved Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim\u2019s celebrated 2-3 zone. And maybe it should have, given that Duke now runs the same defense.\n\nStill, in a game that was sloppy and came down to the final seconds, Duke held on for a 69-65 win in the round of 16.\n\nEven though upsets have spiced up much of this year\u2019s bracket, the Midwest regional final on Sunday will feature Duke against the quadrant\u2019s top seed, Kansas, which outlasted Clemson, 80-76, on Friday night.", "title": "Duke Survives a Battle With the Syracuse Zone", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Even Duke managers with no basketball aspirations see the program as a springboard, as opposed to most college basketball managers, for whom the job is a way to get the best ticket in the arena. \u201cWith Coach K, I felt like I had the opportunity to learn about excellence and how to build excellence from the ground up,\u201d Spiera said.\n\nAsk the managers about their jobs, and they will articulate the ideology of Duke exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cI think the culture we have is really special,\u201d Zach Marcus, another senior manager, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Coach K, the program he\u2019s established.\u201d\n\nEverything they do is deliberate, specific, thought through. They wear matching uniforms, typically polo shirts, slacks, belts and Nike sneakers. During the opening segment of practices, eight of them line the court \u2014 three to a side, one under each basket \u2014 with a ball under an arm. During one drill, rebounding is a three-manager job: one under the basket, another in the corner, a third at the top of the arc next to a coach. At halftime, they sprint to the locker rooms to get them ready before players and staff arrive. After games, their duties done, they meet and critique their performance.\n\n\u201cI used to come back in there, and I see it now,\u201d said Nolan Smith, a former Duke player who is now a special assistant on the staff. \u201cThey meet as a team and talk about areas of improvement.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn-game timeouts are their shining moment. These are like Nascar pit stops. During Thursday\u2019s 89-67 first-round win over Iona, Spiera raced from his seat at the far end of the bench to the first one, pulled it out \u2014 creating a passage between the bench\u2019s front and back sides \u2014 and placed it facing the bench, so Krzyzewski could sit and face the five players in the game. Then he assumed his clipboard position. It all took about five seconds. After timeouts, the managers rushed to towel off the coaches\u2019 seats, which had just been occupied by sweaty players.\n\nIf Duke is Rome and the players are the gladiators, or perhaps the generals, then the managers are the Praetorian Guard, the emperor\u2019s personal division. There is no need to clarify who the emperor is in this analogy.\n\nKevin Pauga, Michigan State\u2019s director of basketball operations, was a Spartans manager. He now administers a postseason basketball tournament for team managers. (Duke\u2019s managers did not play the five regular-season games requisite for qualifying, he said.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They will rebound for any player who wants it, at all hours. They text players to remind them about practices; they fetch them if they are in danger of being late.\n\nThen there are odder assignments. When the freshman Trevon Duval forgot his sneakers at a hotel before a road game, a manager was dispatched to fetch them. When the former center Marshall Plumlee\u2019s leg cramped up during a home game last season and a muscle roller stick was not to be found, Krzyzewski had Michael Karamardian, now a senior manager, massage Plumlee\u2019s upper leg with his own hands. Coincidentally or not, Karamardian hopes to attend medical school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be easier to tell you what they don\u2019t do,\u201d the sophomore Marques Bolden said.\n\nManagers begin as freshmen by signing up at the annual activities fair on Duke\u2019s East Campus. There has not been a female manager for several years, and a few months ago, Duke\u2019s student newspaper reported that one applicant had complained, citing another female applicant\u2019s belief that women were held to a higher standard. David Bradley, Duke\u2019s director of basketball operations, disputed this, saying, \u201cWe\u2019d love to have anyone.\u201d\n\nApplications include r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. The first interview requires semiformal attire. The second involves basketball shorts and physical activities: managers, after all, are frequently rebounding and throwing hard chest passes to some of the country\u2019s best players. Duke prefers applicants who were involved in basketball, as a player or a manager, in high school. The program brings on three or four managers per class.\n\nThey typically spend four years on the job. (There is little attrition.) They travel with the team beginning their junior year. The seniors are in charge, and they share one full scholarship after three years of working without pay (though they may get paid for working summer camps).\n\nThey know they are mocked on the internet: for making an impromptu privacy tent out of towels as Marvin Bagley III recovered from a poked eye earlier this season; for just constantly running (\u201cWere they slow on filling the Gatorade cooler?\u201d a Kentucky fan wondered).\n\nTheir response, in standard Duke fashion, is to point to the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, you realize you get to be part of the best program, you go to a really good school, some people are going to try to attack you for those things,\u201d Karamardian said. \u201cIf you just understand they\u2019re only attacking you because you\u2019re really good at these things, then who really cares?\u201d", "title": "Duke\u2019s Basketball Managers Strive to Be (What Else?)

Put forth in 2012, they would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nIf fully implemented, the rules would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations, according to E.P.A. projections.\n\nThe rules also would have put the United States, historically a laggard in fuel economy regulations, at the forefront worldwide in the manufacture of electric and highly fuel efficient vehicles. The United States and Canada are the only major nations that have adopted mandatory emissions standards through 2025. The European Union has only recently proposed standards for 2025 and 2030, while China has only started to work on standards for those years.\n\nLess restrictive regulations in the United States could provide an opening for automakers to push for more lenient standards elsewhere as well, leading to the emission of more pollution by cars around the world.

The United States is the world\u2019s largest importer of steel, and while many of Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments have focused on cheap steel from countries like China, the European Union as a whole is the single biggest exporter of steel to the United States. At the same time, the region is concerned that cheap steel that had been destined for the United States could now flood the Continent, putting significant pressure on European producers.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s push for tariffs is driven by his fixation on trade deficits.

Long before 2016, the fault line was there, rumbling with every papal pronouncement affirming the male-only priesthood or claiming to speak with moral authority on issues of human sexuality. What kind of faith community denies a sacrament to parishioners who don\u2019t happen to have been born heterosexual?\n\nDuring college and graduate school, I tried to talk myself out of believing in God. The reasons not to believe were multifarious and convincing. The reasons to believe came down to only one: I couldn\u2019t not believe. I seem to have been born with a constant ache for the sacred, a deep-rooted need to offer thanks, to ask for help, to sing out in fathomless praise to something. In time I found my way back to God, the most familiar and fundamental something I knew, even if by then my conception of the divine had enlarged beyond any church\u2019s ability to define or contain it.\n\nA church isn\u2019t a necessary thing to a believer for whom the whole world is holy. But when our first baby was on the way, my husband and I signed on. We could have chosen another branch of Christianity, one whose secular framework more closely matched our own understanding of a church\u2019s role in the world.

During his one year in the White House, Trump has so thoroughly warped the space-time continuum of our news cycle that it seems preposterous that any words about his presidency, slapped between covers, won\u2019t have been overtaken by events by the time they appear in print.\n\nYet there are routes to staying power. One comes from Michael Wolff, whose jaw-dropping (and thinly sourced) tales of White House dysfunction in \u201cFire and Fury\u201d cost Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s onetime Svengali, both his media platform and his billionaire patron. Another successful approach is provided by David Frum, whose elegantly written jeremiad \u201cTrumpocracy\u201d will give future historians ample evidence that not all Republicans fell in line behind their party\u2019s president.\n\nWith \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think,\u201d David Cay Johnston has chosen a third, more difficult path. A former New York Times reporter who in 2001 won a Pulitzer Prize for his expos\u00e9s on tax loopholes, Johnston practices a brand of journalism that\u2019s an amalgam of advocacy and forensic accounting. \u201cIt is not enough just to cover politics and controversies,\u201d he writes. \u201cOften the most important news goes unannounced, lying right out in the open in the government documents most journalists are loath to uncover and read.\u201d It\u2019s Johnston\u2019s contention that much of the media\u2019s coverage of Trump \u2014 fixated as it is on the president\u2019s tweets and feuds \u2014 misses the real damage he\u2019s doing to the country. \u201cThe Trump administration deposited political termites throughout the structure of our government,\u201d Johnston argues. \u201cThe endgame is not just a smaller government, which Republicans always say they want, but a weak government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJohnston sets out to shine a bright light on these termites. He finds an obvious one in Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s man at the Environmental Protection Agency, whose \u201cone-sided approach to E.P.A.\u2019s mandate,\u201d Johnston writes, favors the concerns of the industries it regulates at the expense of the public\u2019s health. Of course, Pruitt has already received considerable media attention. But Johnston uncovers some less well-known termites as well.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis chapter on the goings-on at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a textbook example of the sort of green-eyeshade reportage on which he built his formidable reputation. First, Johnston explains how Trump\u2019s decision to force out the chairman left the commission with only two members, short of the three required for a quorum, which meant it was unable to approve \u201c$50 billion worth of energy projects\u201d that would have benefited American workers and consumers. Next, Johnston reports that when Trump finally got around to filling out the agency, he didn\u2019t pick anyone with a consumer-protection background, like the chairman he\u2019d just sacked, instead nominating three new commissioners who all favored the utilities. \u201cCongress created FERC \u2026 to protect families, small-business owners and industry from monopolists and pricing schemes that jack up prices while at the same time ensuring an abundant supply of electricity,\u201d Johnston writes.

It followed the committee\u2019s release on Tuesday of a set of recommendations for state and federal officials to shore up the ballot box.\n\nThat effort appeared likely to get substantial resources on Wednesday, as congressional leaders completed a more than $1 trillion government funding bill that included hundreds of millions of dollars for election security. The bill, which is expected to pass later this week, includes $380 million for state grants to improve election infrastructure, as well as $307 million above what the Trump administration had requested for the F.B.I. that can be used to combat cyberattacks, election fraud and other crimes.\n\nTop federal officials have concluded that Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and breached that of at least one, Illinois, during the last election cycle. No votes were changed, but the effort \u2014 alongside a concerted Russian disinformation and hacking campaign \u2014 exposed dangerous vulnerabilities in the voting systems and the government\u2019s ability to respond.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials have warned that Russia considered its campaign to sow social and political divisions in 2016 a success, and is already meddling in the midterm elections. A central tool of the campaign \u2014 fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and disinformation \u2014 continues to be used unabated, the officials said.\n\nMs. Nielsen echoed those concerns on Wednesday, making clear that with voting already underway in primary elections around the country, the threat was not over.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Johnson was asked several times why his department and other Obama administration officials had not done more to warn state election officials and the public about the threats in the run-up to the election.\n\nHe repeatedly defended his decision-making, saying that some states had rebuffed federal outreach and that the department had been able to directly assist more than 30 others. Mr. Johnson also lamented that greater heed was not taken of an October 2016 statement he signed with the director of national intelligence alerting the public to the Russian intrusion into election systems.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it did not get the attention that I thought it should have received,\u201d he said, noting that the statement was issued the same day that the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced.\n\nSome senators went further.\n\nSenator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, warned bluntly that the threat was \u201cnot being treated with the urgency that it deserves\u201d and that a patchwork of defenses would mean little without a comprehensive cyberdeterrence strategy. Of the Russians\u2019 targeting of state systems in 2016, he said, \u201cWhat it looks like is a test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country has to wake up,\u201d he said, later telling Ms. Nielsen, \u201cI encourage you to go back with your hair on fire.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations released by the committee on Tuesday \u2014 the first such disclosure in its investigation \u2014 covered much of what experts and intelligence officials have been urging election authorities to do for months.\n\nThe panel also pressed the Trump administration to make it clear that any attack on an American election would be viewed as a hostile act.\n\nThose recommendations come from a fuller classified report on election security that the committee has prepared. The fuller document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for declassification before it can be released publicly, a process that could take weeks or months. The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said on Wednesday that it would release an overview of its findings in the interim.\n\nThe committee is expected to prepare similar reports in the coming months on other areas of investigation, including the Russians\u2019 use of social media and whether the Trump campaign aided the meddling campaign.", "title": "Efforts to Secure Elections Moving Too Slowly, Senators Tell Homeland Security Chief", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Matthew Rosenberg"]}
