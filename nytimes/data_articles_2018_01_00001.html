If descriptions of its contents are true, the memo details a shocking collapse of standards in one of the government\u2019s most important jobs: collecting foreign intelligence to stop terrorist attacks and enemy spies.\n\nThe president has the constitutional authority to classify and declassify secrets.

An agreement could also provide the starting point for review and restructuring of the department\u2019s national security division and its management of electronic surveillance.\n\nBut again, the president seems unable to allow good government to proceed freely. Instead, he has claimed for months that the Obama administration hatched a conspiracy to illegally eavesdrop on him and, according to reports, has decided to approve release of the Nunes memo even before reviewing it. Again, Mr. Trump risks the prospects for departmental reform to score political points against Mr. Obama.\n\nThese episodes reveal a shortcoming in Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the presidency. He has the constitutional power to push out Mr. McCabe and to release the Nunes memo.

Throughout his political career, Governor Scott has veered between supporting and opposing offshore drilling.\n\nLegal experts said they were perplexed by Mr. Zinke\u2019s move. \u201cNo one knows what the legal implications are, because this has never been done before,\u201d Ms. Weaver said.\n\nShe said Mr. Zinke\u2019s move may put the administration in conflict with the provisions of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, a law that lays out the standards and procedures for determining which areas will be opened to offshore drilling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a 60-day public comment period, an environmental-impact statement,\u201d Ms. Weaver said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what they did here, and it\u2019s not clear that they understand that there is a legal process that they need to follow.\u201d", "title": "Florida Is Exempted From Coastal Drilling.

With a lower corporate tax rate, businesses are expected to bring more foreign earnings home, increasing the cash available to pay for dividends and share repurchases. That could mean the supply of new corporate bonds will shrink a bit, as companies lose some appetite for issuing debt to bolster shareholder returns.\n\nBasic math suggests that there is less reason to invest in lower quality corporate bonds. Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, points out that high-yield bonds pay about 3.4 percentage points more than similar maturity Treasury issues, in contrast to the 5.4-percentage-point spread investors have typically been paid for taking on the risk of junk bonds. That\u2019s not much compensation, given that junk bonds tend to behave a lot like stock in bad markets.\n\nInvestors who enjoyed the strong 6 percent return for multisector bond funds in 2017 should take note that on average, more than one-third of the assets of these go-anywhere bond funds is invested in junk bonds, according to Morningstar.\n\nMr. Scholnick says Western Asset Management has reduced its high-yield holdings and increased its investment in bank loans. These securities are a form of low-quality corporate bonds with two compelling value propositions over standard junk bonds. In the event of a default, bank loan investors are paid before regular bond investors. In addition, the interest rate on bank loans fluctuates along with a benchmark index, such as the London Interbank Offer Rate, or Libor, and prospects for an increase are viewed as good.\n\nEmerging market bonds may be the best relative value for bond investors these days, considering that in many countries, economies are growing, inflation is low and central bank policy is reasonably strong.\n\n\u201cIn the past, it was emerging markets that held all the debt, but now all the debt is in Japan, Europe and the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock. In 2018, the best opportunities for positive returns after accounting for inflation could be in emerging markets.\n\nEmerging markets also are often more volatile.

It concerns part of the proposed site, a 2.8-acre lot owned by the county and used as a storage depot. In a lawsuit filed last summer, Bruce C. Matheson, a wealthy Miami landowner, challenged the county\u2019s approval of the $9 million sale since it had not allowed for competitive bids. County officials argued that Florida law permits such no-bid transactions involving public land if they result in wider economic benefits. In October, a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge dismissed the lawsuit, but Matheson has appealed.\n\nIn addition, some residents of Overtown, traditionally one of the city\u2019s poorest and most underdeveloped neighborhoods, have objected to the proposed stadium on the grounds that there is no official provision for job creation in the immediate area.\n\nBut most businesses seem to welcome the prospect of a stadium in their midst. \u201cTalk about stimulating the neighborhood,\u201d said Luis Garc\u00eda, whose family has run a seafood restaurant on the Miami River, three blocks south of the proposed soccer venue, since 1966. \u201cI\u2019ve got to believe that local restaurants and bar owners are going to benefit.

Nothing is more reassuring to patients than seeing a silver-haired doctor walk up to their bedside. To this day, medicine is largely an apprenticeship, with young physicians huddling around older physicians, straining to catch every word, so as to not lose a nugget of wisdom. Experience is even written into our dress codes: Students in many medical schools cannot wear long white coats, unlike their seniors; in some, even medical residents can\u2019t have coats that extend much below the waist.\n\nYet, as the field evolves into one where data and evidence are beginning to outweigh anecdotes and opinions, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: In medicine, a lack of experience may not actually be a bad thing.\n\nA paper published last year by researchers at Harvard showed something very striking \u2014 patients being taken care of by younger doctors were less likely to die. Younger, less experienced physicians are also less likely to order unnecessary tests in both men and women, to face disciplinary action from state medical boards or be cited for improper prescription of opioid painkillers and other controlled substances.

As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.\n\n\u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.\n\nWhen Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite.

The system is intended to avoid any hint of instability or intrigue, but it practically guarantees that the president will be elderly \u2014 even very elderly.\n\nPresident Monson was 90, and had served as prophet and head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for nearly 10 years. Following a tradition that dates from the church\u2019s early years, he is to be succeeded by the longest-serving member of a church governing body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nRight now, that man is President Russell M. Nelson, a former heart surgeon, who is 93. Next in line after him is Dallin H. Oaks, a former president of Brigham Young University and state Supreme Court justice. He is 85.

The outcome of the lawsuit could influence this year\u2019s congressional election, helping to secure or flip the seat of Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat with wide Native American support.\n\nIn the battleground state of Nevada, the Pyramid Lake and Walker River Paiutes won a lawsuit in late 2016 that charged that tribal citizens had to travel as many as 100 miles to vote. The suit forced officials to open new polling stations in tribal areas and spurred nine other tribes to request their own election sites.\n\nAnd in Alaska, where native people make up a fifth of the population, officials recently rolled out election materials in the Yup\u2019ik, Inupiaq and Gwich\u2019in languages, following federal rulings that found the state had failed to provide materials equivalent to those used by English speakers.\n\nAfter those changes, turnout in villages rose by as much as 20 percent, increasing the political power of the state\u2019s native residents.\n\nOther native voting cases are proceeding or have been recently settled in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. And a second case is open in San Juan County, this one challenging the county\u2019s decision to move to an all-mail ballot.

But many live in America\u2019s most remote places \u2014 amid mountain passes or miles of near-empty plains \u2014 and the native path to the ballot box has often been less visible than that of other groups.\n\nIt was not until 1924 that Congress granted native people the right to vote, and for generations afterward, local and state governments have blocked them from doing so, often saying that Native Americans living on reservations were not state residents.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a critical moment, prohibiting election practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But relatively few lawsuits were filed on behalf of native voters until the 1990s.\n\nThe pace of legal challenges has picked up recently, something observers attribute to a realization that American Indians can influence local and national policy. The fate of Bears Ears, a conservation area that originally occupied a quarter of this 8,000-square-mile county, is one such issue.\n\nWhen President Trump slashed the size of the monument last month, one argument was that he was considering the desires of local officials. A Navajo-controlled commission, however, could oppose the decision, a move that could influence coming legal battles over the monument\u2019s fate.\n\nPhoto\n\nSan Juan County is a hardscrabble expanse in the state\u2019s southeast corner, and home to some 16,000 people. The county population is about half Native American and half white, and battles over resources have often fallen along racial lines.\n\nThe lower portion of the county overlaps the Navajo reservation, and native people bring millions of dollars to the county each year in the form of oil and gas revenue and other taxes. But those living on the reservation do not pay property taxes, frustrating many others who feel they pay more than their fair share.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the south, where most native families live, the library is in the corner of a trailer, there is no hospital or bank, and residents have spent more than a generation suing the county for services.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Twitter has made clear that Mr. Trump veers wildly from subject to subject, fight to fight. Fact checkers have made clear that he has a strained relationship with the truth.\n\nMr. Bannon is quoted in the book saying things that other advisers have said confidentially for months \u2014 that the president is stunningly undisciplined with no patience or interest in learning and driven by intemperate, sometimes absurd motivations. At one point, Mr. Bannon describes Mr. Trump acting \u201clike a 9-year-old,\u201d an observation that has power not because it was unique to those who worked for the president but because it is now on the record in Mr. Bannon\u2019s name.\n\nThe phenomenon is so universal that it is a wonder any White House is surprised anymore when someone who sat in the next chair during staff meetings in the Roosevelt Room one day becomes the next day\u2019s featured character in the window of Washington bookstores like Kramerbooks or Politics and Prose.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump, of all presidents, should know what to expect given his predilection for making employees sign nondisclosure agreements, a practice he brought from the private sector to his 2016 campaign and the subsequent presidential transition.\n\nVideo\n\nBut other than security reviews that sometimes limit what a former administration official can write in a book, no one has yet figured out a way to muzzle White House aides from telling their stories after departing the West Wing, either in first person or through authors such as Mr. Wolff.\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s chief speechwriter, James Fallows, wrote a trenchant piece in The Atlantic Monthly called \u201cThe Passionless Presidency,\u201d portraying his former boss as a good man but an ineffective chief executive. Ronald Reagan\u2019s budget director, David Stockman, wrote a book describing an amiable but inattentive and unsophisticated president whose funny math disguised rising deficits.\n\nPerhaps more vexing for Mr. Reagan was the score-settling memoir of Donald T. Regan, his second chief of staff at the White House who was pushed out during the Iran-contra scandal. Mr. Regan\u2019s revelation that Nancy Reagan had influenced the president\u2019s schedule based on advice from her astrologer infuriated the president. \u201cThe media are behaving like kids with a new toy \u2014 never mind that there is no truth to it,\u201d Mr. Reagan wrote in his diary.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Just as there was truth to the sometimes unsettling depiction of Bill Clinton\u2019s White House by his former senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, whose memoir described his disillusionment with a president who recklessly risked his policy agenda for extramarital sex. When that book was released, Mr. Stephanopoulos\u2019s former White House colleagues stayed away from the launch party lest they risk Mr. Clinton\u2019s ire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLeon E. Panetta may hold a record of some sort by writing two tell-all memoirs of his time in two presidential administrations 43 years apart. The first was a scathing description of his service as a civil rights official under Richard M. Nixon that ended when Mr. Panetta was pushed out. The second was a more respectful but at times unflattering portrayal of his experiences as C.I.A. director and defense secretary for Barack Obama, whom he deemed smart but vacillating and overly cautious.\n\nOther advisers have told their stories to authors, as Mr. Bannon did. Paul O\u2019Neill, who served an unhappy tenure as Mr. Bush\u2019s first Treasury secretary, gave interviews and documents to the author Ron Suskind for a searing account of a White House where tax-cutting, neoconservative ideology pushed aside evidence and contrary views. Mr. Bush, Mr. O\u2019Neill concluded, was \u201ca blind man in a roomful of deaf people.\u201d\n\nBob Woodward\u2019s many books have benefited enormously from tales of former aides freed from the shackles of service, usually not attributed directly to them but often clear enough to the presidents who read with seething anger.\n\nAs aggravated as Mr. Trump may be with Mr. Bannon\u2019s apostasy and Mr. Wolff\u2019s book, he may need to get used to it. Just one year in, Mr. Trump faces many years of books to come.\n\nHe may not have to worry much about Sean Spicer, his first White House press secretary who has remained loyal and is now working on a memoir \u2014 although to be sure, no one in the Bush White House initially thought they had to worry about the ever-loyal Mr. McClellan either.\n\nMr. Trump may have more to wonder about with Omarosa Manigault Newman, the veteran of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who left her White House post noisily last month saying that as the only African-American woman of prominence on Mr. Trump\u2019s team, she had seen things \u201cthat have upset me.\u201d She added ominously, \u201cIt is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump last year and trashed on Twitter ever since. Mr. Comey has a different understanding of the meaning of loyalty than the president does.

And asking a family to donate a loved one\u2019s face is not like asking for a heart or a lung. Transplant procurement groups say that for many families, removing the loved one\u2019s face would amount to a second loss.\n\nN.Y.U.\u2019s hope is simple: that a better replacement face will encourage more families of potential donors to say yes, reducing the wait time for the tiny but desperate pool of candidates for face transplants.\n\nHelen Irving, the president of LiveOnNY, a network that matches organ donors with recipients, said that the 3-D mask would \u201cmake the donation journey more comfortable, and perhaps a bit easier, for the loved ones of donors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew York University\u2019s 3-D printing center, LaGuardia Studio, housed in a strip-mall-like building south of Washington Square Park, more typically prints projects for arts and engineering departments.

Ryan and I were members of the Princeton University Glee Club and the Princeton Nassoons, the university\u2019s oldest a cappella group, before beginning our crossword collaboration.\n\nI started writing down crossword theme ideas in the \u201cNotes\u201d app of my phone during my commutes to work in 2015. Many of the early concepts I came up with revolved around phrases that lent themselves to literal interpretations involving a letter addition or removal (\u201cDROP THE F\u201d BOMB luckily never came to fruition \u2026). But then NO WAY came to me and I realized dropping an entire word might result in some fresher \u201cwacky\u201d phrases. RUN A TRAIN was the first potential theme answer that I thought of, and with Ryan\u2019s expert grid construction skills and some more theme answer brainstorming, I knew we were on the right track, so to speak.\n\nSide note: As a runner, I was excited to use \u201cMarathon leader?\u201d as the clue for ULTRA, but I wasn\u2019t sure if the Ultramarathon reference was too obscure for the general public. After a quick Google search eased my initial worries, I noticed the following blurb in the Wikipedia article for Ultramarathon:\n\n\u201cSince 1997, runners have been competing in the Self-Transcendence 3,100 Mile Race, which is billed as the longest official footrace in the world. They run 100 laps a day for up to 50 days around a single block in Queens, N.Y., for a total distance of 3,100 miles (5,000 km).\u201d\n\nThis absurd race has been the topic of many conversations since finding out about it during my crossword research. Just thinking about the fact that Suprabha Beckjord ran the race 14 times (i.e. she spent over two years of her life running around a high school in Queens) makes my legs hurt \u2026\n\nRyan McCarty: Excited for my second New York Times puzzle today, co-written with one of my (soon-to-be) groomsmen! For my day job, I work as a tech consultant at the SEC, and I have kept up my singing in three choirs and occasionally in some smaller ensembles in the D.C. area. Alan is the person who actually introduced me to The New York Times Crossword in college \u2014 we would often attempt puzzles together during breakfast, with varying degrees of success. Soon after I got interested in constructing puzzles and made a few for friends before submitting some to publications. Alan and I decided it would be fun to collaborate on a New York Times puzzle and, after a couple of attempts, we got an acceptance with this NO WAY puzzle. We hope you enjoy!", "title": "Forget It", "authors": ["Deb Amlen"]}

He was forced out of his Eighth Street premises in 1929 and opened the Strand on Fourth Avenue with $300 in savings and another $300 in borrowed money. The cash register was a cigar box. In the early days, to keep expenses down, he slept on a cot in the back of the shop.\n\nIt was not a successful concern, and the onset of the Depression made it even less so. Destitute, he placed Fred and his daughter, Dorothy, in foster care with a couple in the East Village.\n\nImage Fred Bass and his father, Benjamin, outside the family store in an undated photograph. Credit The Strand Bookstore\n\nAfter graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Fred enrolled in Brooklyn College, earning a degree in English in 1949. He attended classes by day and worked for his father in the afternoons, as he had since the age of 13. He swept the floor, organized the shelves and visited private homes to scout out books, which he carried on the subway to the Strand, by then at 81 Fourth Avenue, between 10th and 11th Streets.\n\n\u201cI got the dust in my blood and I never got it out,\u201d he told McCandlish Phillips, a New York Times reporter and the author of \u201cCity Notebook: A Reporter\u2019s Portrait of a Vanishing New York\u201d (1974).\n\nMr. Bass was drafted into the Army in 1950 and posted to West Germany. In 1952, while serving stateside in New Jersey, he married Patricia Miller. She survives him, as do their daughter, Nancy Bass Wyden, who now owns the business; his sister, Dorothy Bass; a half sister, Eleanor Allen; and three grandchildren.\n\nMs. Wyden, whose husband is Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, took over the store on her father\u2019s retirement.", "title": "Fred Bass, Who Made the Strand Bookstore a Mecca, Dies at 89", "authors": []}

Often inefficient Canadian factories protected by tariffs offered Canadian consumers a limited selection of products at comparatively high prices. Protectionist policies that kept factories running in Ontario and Quebec sometimes limited the ability of western Canada to export agricultural and natural resource-based products because of retaliatory tariffs.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut I was struck in Peterborough about the widespread disappointment over Nafta.

Lawmakers won\u2019t vote on the measures until the spring, and any improvements are expected to take months, if not years, to bear fruit.\n\nThat layoffs are being announced before this crucial part is done has fueled suspicion among organized labor. And while new jobs will eventually be created, many unions worry the changes are a ploy to strip away worker protections \u2014 and their own power. In the last several weeks, the country\u2019s most ardent trade organizations have vigorously opposed such plans, with differing results.\n\nThe new rules tip the balance of power from workers to employers. Businesses have been reluctant to hire because it was difficult to shed workers. Employers have turned en masse to precarious short-term contracts to fill the gaps.\n\nNow, companies will be able to negotiate job cuts and restructurings through voluntary departures directly with labor representatives inside the business, rather than under strict industrywide collective bargaining agreements. Multinationals can downsize loss-making French operations more easily, even if the overall business is profitable. Companies will face less risk of legal action over dismissals, and can hire new staff immediately, rather than waiting.\n\nThe government has portrayed the changes as continuing to protect workers. When Pimkie, a struggling fast-fashion chain whose parent company is profitable, sought hundreds of voluntary buyouts, unions and workers rejected the proposal as insufficient. Managers must now go back to the negotiating table until payout terms satisfactory to the unions are reached. And unions will negotiate with management over the terms of at least 2,500 voluntary departures being pushed by the retail giant Carrefour.\n\nYet the measures clearly give companies more flexibility. PSA Group, which makes Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars, will offer 1,300 voluntary buyouts to older workers. It will fill most of those vacancies with younger, less expensive employees on full-time contracts after most unions approved the plan, originally unveiled last year. PSA will also offer 2,000 low-paid apprenticeships to young people.\n\nPierre-Olivier Salmon, the head of corporate information at PSA Group, said the carmaker is looking to bring in a new generation of workers with the digital and programming skills needed to develop projects like electric cars and future technology for the automotive industry.", "title": "French Companies Have Newfound Freedom \u2026 to Fire", "authors": []}

She served for 20 years before retiring last June, and decided only a few months later to run for Congress.\n\nMs. Luria said that she felt the pull to run for office after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and that her husband quit his job to help take over household duties so she could focus on campaigning.\n\nShe grew up in Birmingham, Ala., where her family owned a scrap metal business. She was drawn to two seemingly contradictory passions \u2014 art and engineering \u2014 which she thought she could pursue at the Naval Academy.\n\n\u201cI went to Annapolis and was really just brainwashed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe midshipmen seemed like they knew everything in the world.

Her older brother, Matt, pushed her to compete with boys in every sport, including football.\n\nAs an 11-year-old, she became enthralled with fighter pilots after watching a documentary on the History Channel and asked her mother how she could become one. Her mother told her the law prohibited it. The young girl asked how laws could be changed.\n\nShe persisted, writing Jim Bunning, her representative in Congress at the time, to ask why women were not allowed to be fighter pilots. Mr. Bunning, who died last May, replied that women were not prohibited because they were considered \u201cinferior,\u201d but rather \u201cwere perceived as a precious commodity of the country that deserved protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I was beating all the boys, and I just did not understand because my name was Amy and not Andy that I couldn\u2019t be a jet pilot,\u201d Ms. McGrath said.\n\nSo she wrote to the members of the congressional armed services committees, and only Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, supported her position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen came the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, and Democrats eventually pushed through the kind of change that Ms. McGrath had been seeking.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThat was my first understanding of the difference between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew all the Democrats were willing to give me an opportunity to compete, and the Republicans said no.\u201d\n\nShe applied to the Naval Academy because she thought that was where the best pilots trained. Ms. McGrath said she loved the atmosphere from the first day \u2014 the tougher the better. Soon after graduation, she was flying an F-18.\n\n\u201cThe F-18 is the most intense job in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine playing a soccer game and doing math problems and doing a talk radio show at the same time. It completely physically and mentally absorbs everything that you have.\u201d\n\nShe flew missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and then did a tour at the Pentagon and as a fellow in Congress. She turned down a possible promotion to have the second of her three children, and earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins. After that, she taught at the Naval Academy, and a guest speaker one day was Ben Chandler, a former Congressman from her home state of Kentucky. He gave her his card and asked her to call if she ever needed anything.\n\nForty-eight hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ms. McGrath was rummaging through a drawer to find Mr. Chandler\u2019s card. She quickly wrote him an emotional email.\n\n\u201cI never really thought I\u2019d ever write you to ask you for some guidance but this week has left me numb,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so taken back by who our nation elected president and what he stands for that I feel as if I must do something. I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life in the service of this country, three combat tours, and literally years of my life living in tents overseas. I love this country, but I\u2019ve never been more ashamed and embarrassed to be an American as I was waking up on Weds morning.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to run for Congress.

With the strong backing of her party, she is favored to win her primary and her chances for winning the seat increase with Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s retirement announcement.

As if this premise is not sufficiently hackneyed, Allende adds literary insult to injury by spelling it out in breathy prose: \u201cOver the next three days, as the storm wearied of punishing the land and dissolved far out to sea, the lives of Lucia Maraz, Richard Bowmaster and Evelyn Ortega would become inextricably linked.\u201d The novel is riddled with such formulations. Seemingly intended to stab at the surreal, fablelike quality for which Allende is known, they come off as merely soppy and uninspired.\n\nIn fact, the story owes less to magical realism than to histrionic crime dramas. Richard, a lonely, aging professor, sets out in a car from his Brooklyn apartment and collides with a vehicle being driven by Evelyn, an undocumented immigrant who happens to be driving her employer\u2019s car. She turns up at his apartment later that night, distraught and unintelligible, her Spanglish broken by a stammer she developed after suffering a brutal gang assault in her native Guatemala. Richard calls his tenant Lucia, a middle-aged visiting Chilean professor under his direction at N.Y.U., to help. The three split a pot brownie, as one does during blizzards with strangers, and swap life stories.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt comes out that there is a corpse in Evelyn\u2019s trunk, which won\u2019t close thanks to the crash. She is terrified of returning the damaged car to her employer, the abusive Frank Leroy, who is sure to come after her if he knows she\u2019s seen the body. Naturally, Evelyn can\u2019t go to the police either. Moved by her plight, Richard and Lucia decide to help her dump car and corpse. This fantastic bit of plot \u2014 why on earth should they undertake such a risk for a stranger who, for all they know, committed the murder herself? \u2014 is supposed to be justified by their own immigrant histories: Lucia fled Chile\u2019s military junta in the 1970s; Richard, whose father escaped the Nazis, hears \u201chis father\u2019s voice deep inside him reminding him of his duty to help the persecuted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the trio journeys upstate, the novel flashes back through each character\u2019s past \u2014 Lucia\u2019s memories of a family fractured by war in Chile, Richard\u2019s doomed marriage in Brazil and Evelyn\u2019s tragic childhood in Guatemala. Some images are memorable: Lucia\u2019s murdered brother is \u201ca feeling, a fleeting shadow, a kiss brushing her forehead\u201d; a Guatemalan gangster has \u201ctattoos spreading like a plague across his skin.\u201d Though inventive, these back stories are marred by simplistic exposition (\u201cthe deep crisis dividing Chile became unsustainable\u201d) and clunky dialogue (\u201cthis violence is the result of an endless war against the poor\u201d). They plead with the reader to have sympathy for Latino immigrants, which is a fine humanitarian agenda. But heaps of suffering and misfortune cannot give depth to thin characters.\n\nNor can love. Lucia and Richard fall into a late-age romance and, as in Allende\u2019s other love stories, their passion inspires some of the novel\u2019s most cringeworthy lines: She accuses him of having spent \u201cmany years with your soul in winter and your heart locked away.\u201d It also leads to a rosy, fairy-tale ending, which figures awkwardly in a novel that wants to tell the truth about immigration.", "title": "From Isabel Allende, a Novel of Three Immigrants and a Brooklyn Misadventure", "authors": ["Elizabeth Winkler", "Isabel Allende"]}

{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Wolff turns to the same device, only from the voice of the opposing camp, in recounting Trump\u2019s fateful decision to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey. \u201cIt was Jared, in the version told by those outside the Jarvanka circle, that pushed for action,\u201d he writes. (\u201cJarvanka\u201d is Wolff\u2019s shorthand, borrowed from Bannon, for Jared and Ivanka.) Wolff\u2019s caution may be explained in his acknowledgments, where he gives a glowing tribute to his trusted libel lawyer. It is that sort of book.\n\nWolff is unsparing in his portrayal of Trump as an aberrant chief executive, not only detached from governance but barely literate. He summons withering on-the-record assessments from ostensible allies of a seemingly infantile president. \u201cIf they tell him the whales need to be saved, he\u2019s basically for it,\u201d says Katie Walsh, a former White House deputy chief of staff, recalling how easily the Kushners could sway Trump. Yet much of Wolff\u2019s sourcing is opaque. \u201cI\u2019ve made stuff up forever, and they always print it,\u201d Trump boasts about his long-running media con. But Wolff, with seemingly unintended irony, does not make clear where he harvested such an explosive line.\n\nWolff is also slippery about whether he was present for some of the conversations he relays or is merely offering a version of events from those who were. He opens the book, for example, with an engrossing dinner conversation that included Bannon and Roger Ailes, the former Fox News president, shortly before the inauguration, offering sentence after sentence of verbatim quotations. Wolff writes that the dinner was held \u201cin a Greenwich Village townhouse,\u201d but leaves out that it was his home and he was the evening\u2019s host.\n\nPhoto\n\nWolff is a media writer by trade and, like his protagonist, he repeatedly scorns the mainline press for what he suggests is its liberal bias. He singles out this paper for treating the Trump presidency as anomalous. Yet putting aside the irony that his own depiction sketches out a shockingly aberrant White House, Wolff shows that his media-bashing is not on the level when he switches from the Ailes hymnal to a more conventional liberal perspective. In a jab at the media, he calls Richard Spencer, the racist alt-right activist, \u201ccatnip for the liberal press,\u201d but then effectively makes the liberals\u2019 case by giving Spencer an open mic to proclaim \u201cwe are the Trump vanguard.\u201d And Wolff casually refers to a \u201cvirulent, if not anti-Semitic (at least toward liberal Jews), right-wing West Wing.\u201d\n\nWolff is strongest when he\u2019s writing on what he knows best: the insecurities and ambitions of Trump and other media fixtures. Yet while much of this presidency does revolve around news coverage, it is still a presidency. And Wolff is far weaker when it comes to politics.\n\nThe collapse of the Affordable Care Act repeal in the Senate is dealt with in less than a single sentence, with no mention of Senator John McCain\u2019s opposition or Trump\u2019s 11th-hour telephone call to him that preceded it. Vice President Mike Pence is largely airbrushed out of the book, which is puzzling given how influential he was in tapping cabinet officials and staff. Similarly, few would see Andrew Card or Erskine Bowles as \u201clarger-than-life\u201d presidential chiefs of staff; the conservative United Nations ambassador Nikki R. Haley is hardly a \u201cJarvanka Republican\u201d; and at a September campaign rally in Alabama for Senator Luther Strange, Trump did not abandon Strange \u201cfor the rest of the speech\u201d after criticizing N.F.L. players for kneeling at the national anthem.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mondale\u2019s former counsel, who breakfasts at the Four Seasons, not the Washington Post reporter Mark Berman.\n\nThe writing is often vivid but Wolff, who tries to hold to a chronological narrative, can be as repetitive as Trump, returning again and again to preferred words or phrases (joie de guerre is a favorite). What ultimately salvages the book are those moments when he all but makes Bannon his co-author, letting Bannon describe West Wing showdowns with his moderate nemesis, Jarvanka, in ways that render this the de facto first insider account of the Trump White House. Of course, the recollections are just those of a single aide, and may include what Trump himself once called examples of \u201ctruthful hyperbole.\u201d\n\nIn the newspaper business, such stories would be deemed \u201ctoo good to check.\u201d But given the popularity of \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d Wolff might call them something else: liberal catnip.", "title": "From \u2018Fire and Fury\u2019 to Political Firestorm", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin", "Michael Wolff"]}

Despite fundamental differences, the efforts to resolve them have been inching forward. But the decision by Speaker Paul D. Ryan to back the release of the report on the F.B.I. and the quiet acceptance by Republicans of administration assurances that added sanctions are not needed have Democrats newly alarmed. They profess deep concern about threats to government institutions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to me the lengths that some of the Republicans, particularly in the House, will go to protect the president when they are doing real harm to our democracy, our rule of law,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, in an interview. \u201cThis is not just a political battle. It goes to the wellspring of our democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Schumer faulted House and Senate Republican leaders for not intervening.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, sought to distance Senate Republicans from the F.B.I. report prepared by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, noting that the Senate intelligence inquiry was on a different track.

The health care business saw sales grow by 6 percent to $5.4 billion.\n\nMr. Flannery, who took over in August, told investors last November that aviation, health care and power were G.E.\u2019s three core businesses. That equates to two thriving divisions and one in need of fixing, although with a strong franchise in the power-generation business. G.E.\u2019s lighting and railway locomotive divisions are already up for sale.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet last week, after the surprising setback because of insurance claims at GE Capital, Mr. Flannery suggested that even one of the three core businesses could be a candidate for a spinoff to generate returns for shareholders.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price has dropped by 44 percent over the past year, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has climbed 25 percent. G.E. shares slipped 1 percent during trading on Wednesday morning, after the earnings report and the conference call.\n\nGiven the earlier surprises, G.E.\u2019s new leadership needs to show that it can stabilize the company and begin a turnaround, analysts say. The S.E.C. investigation only adds more uncertainty. After the setbacks in the past few months, class action shareholder suits have been filed.\n\n\u201cThese things are further risks that make G.E. difficult to value,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cThey have to right the ship.\u201d", "title": "G.E.

But it\u2019s also unlikely that Mr. Flannery will be the one to break up the 125-year-old conglomerate.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that Mr. Flannery and his team will consider unique ways of separating G.E.\u2019s core business units without actually splitting them completely apart. But it\u2019s all somewhat speculative at the moment.\n\nCritic\u2019s corner, from Brook Sutherland of Gadfly:\n\nIt is now abundantly apparent that the previous management team led by Jeff Immelt had little handle on the comings and goings of all the pieces of this sprawling conglomerate. The reasons for keeping GE together \u2014 shared resources and technology \u2014 look increasingly tenuous.

Several others are expected, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and Free Press, which argue that the F.C.C.\u2019s order was harmful to consumers and was done hastily and without proper public input.\n\nNestl\u00e9 gets its U.S. candy deal done\n\nThe business that makes Butterfingers and Gobstoppers will find a new home \u2014 at Ferrero, the producer of Rocher chocolate \u2014 for $2.8 billion in cash.\n\nThe numbers\n\n\u2022 The U.S. candy business, which doesn\u2019t include KitKats, generated $900 million in sales in 2016.

The move had been lauded by Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point, which has put pressure on the food titan to sell off nonessential businesses.\n\nThe pullquote, from Mark Schneider, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s C.E.O.:\n\n\u201cWith Ferrero we have found an exceptional home for our U.S. confectionery business where it will thrive. At the same time, this move allows Nestl\u00e9 to invest and innovate across a range of categories where we see strong future growth and hold leadership positions, such as pet care, bottled water, coffee, frozen meals and infant nutrition.\u201d\n\nThe advisers\n\nFor Ferrero: Credit Suisse, Lazard and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nBehind Elliott\u2019s campaign at Bezeq\n\nOne of Elliott\u2019s first campaigns of 2018 sees the activist hedge fund going even further abroad: Its latest target is Bezeq, the once-government-owned Israeli telecom company. The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott\u2019s investment and public letter to the telecom\u2019s interim chairman, David Granot.\n\nThe context\n\nBezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts:\n\n\u2022 The company has been under pressure from regulators amid an investigation into potential securities violations, including an inquiry into the mogul Shaul Elovitch, who owns 26 percent of the company.\n\n\u2022 The company\u2019s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff.\n\nWhat Elliott wants\n\n\u2022 Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders\n\n\u2022 Simplifying the ownership structure of the company\n\nFrom the hedge fund\u2019s letter to Mr. Granot:\n\nAs you well know, Bezeq faces compelling business opportunities and significant challenges. The time that passes without stable, impartial ownership and governance is to the detriment of all stakeholders.\n\nWhat could lie ahead\n\nBeyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. )\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nThe most interesting number from Silver Lake\u2019s deal for Blackhawk Network\n\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the $3.5 billion purchase price that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners agreed to pay for the operator of gift card stores.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk\u2019s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents.\n\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release. (More on that below.)\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s the $1.7 billion equity check that Silver Lake is writing to support the deal. That\u2019s one of the biggest-ever equity commitments that the $39 billion investment firm has ever made.\n\nThe backstory\n\nDan Primack has more on the five-year saga over at Axios.\n\nThe advisers\n\nFor Blackhawk: Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners, Citigroup and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz\n\nFor Silver Lake: Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett\n\nFor P2 Capital: The law firm Debevoise & Plimpton\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nQualcomm\u2019s day of fighting M.&A. battles on two fronts\n\nThe first\n\nQualcomm unveiled its first official \u201cfight letter\u201d in its campaign to beat back Broadcom\u2019s $105 billion bid for the chip maker.\n\nAmong the highlights of the letter:\n\n\u2022 Qualcomm says that it will deliver between $6.75 and $7.50 in pro forma earnings per share for its 2019 fiscal year.\n\n\u2022 A pledge to continue the company\u2019s its cost-savings program.\n\n\u2022 A reiteration that Broadcom\u2019s offer ignores the upswing that the emerging 5G wireless standard will bring for Qualcomm\u2019s stock.\n\nFrom the letter:\n\nBroadcom is asking Qualcomm stockholders to voluntarily transfer to a hostile acquirer the considerable near- and long-term value creation Qualcomm has in front of it. It is attempting to acquire Qualcomm at an opportunistic, inferior price by installing a slate of conflicted Broadcom/Silver Lake nominees with minimal relevant experience.\n\nThe second\n\nRamius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm\u2019s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done \u2014 but at a higher price.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat follows the declaration of Elliott that NXP was worth $135 a share on a standalone basis.\n\nFrom Ramius\u2019s news release:\n\nShould Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nCiti takes a big tax charge\n\nCitigroup said that it earned $3.7 billion in its fourth quarter \u2014 if one excludes a $22 billion charge related to the tax overhaul.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at its results by the numbers:\n\n\u2022 $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share. Citi\u2019s loss in the fourth quarter, including the tax charge. It is the bank\u2019s largest quarterly loss.

That triggered an informal review of the unit and several high-profile departures, including global commodities head Gregory Agran. The bank\u2019s commodities earnings in the final three months of 2017 were better than the previous two quarters as losing natural gas trades were closed. Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.\n\nGoldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nAnother millennial marker bites the dust\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time.\n\nIt took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next.\n\nThe previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000.\n\nOf course, 1,000 point moves aren\u2019t what they used to be. Going from 25,000 to 26,000 is a move of just 4 percent. By comparison, when the index went from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 days in 1999, it was a rise of 10 percent, points out the WSJ\u2019s Erik Holm.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year.\n\nIn fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nGreenlight Capital\u2019s David Einhorn is betting on Twitter\n\nIn a letter to investors, the hedge fund manager wrote that his firm had bought shares of Twitter in the fourth-quarter at an average price of $21.59.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVia ValueWalk:\n\nDespite a massive user base and broad reach, TWTR has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform. New management improved the TWTR user experience, which led to rapid growth in number of users and time spent on TWTR in 2017. As a result, we believe TWTR will have a pitch to advertisers in 2018, which should lead to revenue growth. Restructuring actions taken over the past year will allow much of the revenue to fall to the bottom line, and we expect TWTR to begin to close some of the 25% margin gap vs. its social media peers. TWTR shares ended the year at $24.01.\n\nShares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nBlackRock wants C.E.O.s to show they do good\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Larry Fink of BlackRock is sending a letter to C.E.O.s of public companies today saying that they must show how they contribute to society, or risk losing the money-management firm\u2019s support.\n\nMore from the letter:\n\nThe public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.\n\nThe leverage: BlackRock has $6 trillion under management, making it the biggest investor in public companies in the world.\n\nThe context, from Andrew\u2019s latest DealBook column: Mr. Fink\u2019s letter pits the investment mogul \u201cagainst many of the companies that he\u2019s invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.\u201d\n\nThe assessment: Jeff Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management told Andrew, \u201cIt is huge for an institutional investor to take this position across its portfolio.\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld added that he\u2019s seen \u201cnothing like it.\u201d\n\nMore in corporate social activism\n\n\u2022 Citi said it would measure, publish and address gaps in the pay between male and female employees in the U.S., Britain and Germany, after pressure from an investor.

Mr. Ammann said it was not clear how the department\u2019s main auto-safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would evaluate G.M.\u2019s petition, and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself.\n\nThe safety agency said Friday that it would give G.M.\u2019s petition \u201ccareful consideration.\u201d\n\nLocal approval will depend on each state\u2019s regulations, Mr. Ammann said. Michigan, for example, already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads. Other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars.\n\nIndustry analysts say automakers and technology companies could generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit by selling or leasing self-driving cars to ride services, taxi fleets and delivery companies. Ford said this week that it would work with Domino\u2019s Pizza and a start-up delivery company, Postmates, to use its autonomous prototypes in limited commercial tests this year.\n\nWaymo, the autonomous-vehicle company spun out of Google, is testing its own fully autonomous cars in Arizona and California. Lyft and a technology start-up called Nutonomy recently began testing self-driving cars in Boston. Uber is running a pilot program in Pittsburgh.\n\nTesla, G.M., Audi and other automakers are also developing driver-assistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions, such as cruising along a divided highway. Those technologies, however, require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems.\n\nG.M. is convinced that self-driving cars can play a significant role in reducing deaths and injuries from auto crashes. Traffic accidents kill more than 35,000 people a year, and 95 percent result from driver errors. Ride services with self-driving cars could also make it easier to get around without owning or renting a car \u2014 and producing those cars would help G.M. weather a shift away from individual ownership.\n\n\u201cUltimately we see a very big business opportunity around this,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.", "title": "G.M.

At one point, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, had young undocumented immigrants protected by the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, stand in the hearing room as he recited their impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nIn the meantime, Dreamers and those who support them protested at Republican lawmakers\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep the government open,\u201d Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to be held hostage to do things that we think are contrary to the best interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nIf Republican leaders can push the bill through the House this week, the Senate \u2014 where at least nine Democratic votes will be needed \u2014 is no sure bet. Some Democrats in that chamber \u2014 especially those considering a White House run \u2014 are expected to oppose any spending measure that does not protect the young undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut Democrats up for re-election this year may be reluctant to oppose the bill and risk being blamed for a shutdown.\n\nMr. Trump moved in September to end DACA but gave Congress until early March to come up with a legislative replacement. Last week, a federal judge ruled that, for now, the administration could not end the program, and the government has now resumed accepting renewal requests for it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a result, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, argued on Tuesday that there was \u201cno urgency right now to try to ram through a major change in immigration law by Friday.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell said lawmakers have \u201cat least until March, at a minimum, and possibly even longer\u201d to reach a DACA agreement.\n\nIn the bill to be passed this week to avoid a shutdown, Republicans would also suspend a tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act on medical devices, as well as a tax on providers of health insurance. In addition, it would delay the law\u2019s tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, known as the Cadillac tax.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The bill would extend the program\u2019s funding for six years.\n\n\u201cI cannot see the Democrats voting against the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program,\u201d said Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, \u201cbut they\u2019ll be given that option in this funding bill.\u201d\n\nLawmakers were able to break a partisan deadlock on the program, started under President Bill Clinton, after they received a new estimate from the Congressional Budget Office showing that the cost would shrink over time and that extending the program for eight to 10 years could actually save money.\n\nMembers of Congress responsible for the program said the new estimate should clear the way for a swift renewal of the program.\n\nThe solution results almost entirely from a curious quirk in the way costs are estimated by the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 and from the unforeseen consequences of Congress\u2019s decision to eliminate a pillar of the Affordable Care Act, the penalties for people who go without health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThanks to the repeal of the individual mandate tax, C.B.O. updated its score and gave us the momentum to push a long-term CHIP extension across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWe must stop holding CHIP hostage.\u201d\n\nFunds for the program lapsed at the end of September. Congress provided a short-term infusion of money last month, and the Trump administration has shuffled money among states to help those with the most urgent needs. Nevertheless, some states have informed families that their children could lose coverage because of delays and inaction by Congress.\n\nExtending CHIP for six years \u201cmay have no cost\u201d to the federal government, said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said that extending the program for 10 years would save $6 billion, according to the budget office. \u201cWith this news,\u201d he said, \u201csecuring kids\u2019 health care for the long-term should be a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nThe Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, created in 1997 with bipartisan support, is given credit for a big increase in the proportion of children who have coverage. But Republicans and Democrats have squabbled for months over how to pay for it.\n\nIn the tax bill signed last month by Mr. Trump, Congress eliminated the penalties for people who go without health insurance, starting in 2019. The Congressional Budget Office, like many health policy experts, believes that healthier people will be less likely to obtain insurance, so that people who remain in the health law\u2019s marketplace \u2014 including children \u2014 will face higher premiums than they otherwise would.\n\nExtending CHIP saves money, the budget office said, because it would be less expensive for the government than the alternatives \u2014 if many of those children enroll in Medicaid or in government-subsidized marketplace coverage.\n\nThe taxes on medical devices, health insurance providers and high-cost employer-sponsored health plans were all imposed by the Affordable Care Act, to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the law. All three would have been repealed under the bill passed last year by the House to dismantle that law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Democrats have joined Republicans in opposing the device tax, which they describe as a threat to innovative medical technology. The bill would suspend it during two years, 2018 and 2019.\n\nHealth insurance companies have strenuously opposed the tax on insurance providers, saying the additional costs are generally passed on to consumers, businesses, state governments and taxpayers. The bill would suspend it for 2019.\n\nThe \u201cCadillac tax\u201d is meant to help rein in the cost of employee health benefits.

I\u2019ve been doing it for two decades, but there were a lot more microphones this time around than there\u2019s ever been. We\u2019re now seeing how many people have dealt with sexual violence and the toll it can take. All of these disclosures \u2014 from Hollywood to farmworkers to the restaurant industry to television to music to academia \u2014 show that this is so widespread and so many people\u2019s lives have been derailed. All you can think is, I wonder who you could have been and who you can be now? And a lot of those people are waiting for that conversation or for somebody to tell them that they can be anything, that it does not define you.\n\nIt seems as if the book was spawned by a responsibility to use your platform to educate others. What has the feedback been like? Over the last few years, I\u2019ve started feeling worthy of my life, and the more I did, the more I realized that, yeah, maybe I can share this. I definitely got the sense that there are a lot of people who are in tremendous pain, who\u2019ve gone through unspeakable horrors and have been suffering in silence, and the bit of time that they spent with my book made them feel seen and understood.\n\nUnion is the star of \u201cBeing Mary Jane\u201d on BET. \u201cWe're Going to Need More Wine\u201d is her first book.

DuBois about the double consciousness that comes with being black in America, then describe having to constantly code-switch as a smart, self-conscious black girl growing up in the very white, conformist California suburb of Pleasanton. How did you balance those two experiences? A lot of people who experience a dual consciousness have to pretend and stifle and suppress their real feelings. You start to condition yourself, trying to figure out what the right voice is, the right tone, the right word. There are millions of actors: They\u2019re just not in Hollywood. It\u2019s exhausting, and it can fill you with rage.\n\nThe book is largely about self-identity and survival. You write a lot about that basic human desire to be seen and recognized. Is that why you got into acting? I wish I had that cute story where I said something like, \u201cAnd then I saw \u2018Miracle on 34th Street,\u2019 and I knew this was the only thing I could do!\u201d I got into acting because I wanted to be chosen. When you\u2019re insecure, being chosen, whether that be by a man or by a company or by a production, by the right group of friends or the right community, is like being embraced. I was working at the bookstore at U.C.L.A., making $6.15 an hour after three raises, and when an agent asked if I would ever consider modeling, the idea that someone might choose me based on what I look like, for an insecure person, was unbelievable. That vote of confidence was everything.\n\nYou write about how that\u2019s one of the weird secrets of life: Self-confidence is the thing that makes people attractive. And it\u2019s the confidence that comes from being your most authentic self.

The group has been operating a home-sharing service since 1981, matching people who have space in their homes with those in need of affordable housing. It is one of a number of similar programs that have emerged across the country as the population of older Americans grows, as a way to help people stay in their homes.\n\nThe concept of pairing older people with younger ones, particularly those who are not family members, is not a new one: It was popularized by Maggie Kuhn, an elder-rights activist who opened up her Philadelphia home to others for more than 20 years before she died in 1995. Today\u2019s home sharing, however, is as likely to be between those of the same age as it is to be intergenerational. The crucial thing is that it involves two or more people sharing an apartment or a house to their mutual benefit. And finances often play a big role.\n\nFor those who are still working age, it\u2019s getting harder to pay the rent: According to a StreetEasy survey, rents in the city rose twice as fast as wages between 2010 and 2017. The lowest rents (those up to $2,300) rose 4.9 percent annually since 2010, which means someone who paid $1,500 a month in 2010 likely paid nearly $600 more for the same place in 2017.\n\nFor baby boomers entering retirement, financial security is also increasingly hard to come by. Many Americans may think they have plenty of savings, but about half have not saved enough to maintain their pre-retirement living standards, according to a recent estimate by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The rising cost of health care, increased life expectancy and lower interest rates only exacerbate the situation. In addition, a Fannie Mae survey found that baby boomers are more likely to be carrying mortgage debt into their retirement years than previous generations were.\n\nTo Ms. Felstein, who was confronting these realities, there didn\u2019t seem to be any other option than taking in a roommate. The New York Foundation for Senior Citizens connected her with a licensed social worker who asked a host of questions, including details about her sleeping habits, personality, interests and daily schedule. She also had to provide three personal recommendations and her rental agreement, to prove she was on the lease.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd she was asked to describe what she considered the ideal roommate. Her response: someone who wasn\u2019t home much.\n\n\u201cI knew it would be a long shot,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I thought I should be honest.\u201d\n\nShe found her match in Yukari Honda, a 27-year-old graduate student in interior design at the New School. Ms. Honda, who is from Tokyo, is often at school from morning until past midnight.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA year ago, Ms. Felstein moved out of her old bedroom to make room for Ms. Honda. She replaced the living room sofa with a bed, turning the living room into a bedroom for herself. Fortunately, there is a separate kitchen and common room where Ms. Honda studies and Ms. Felstein keeps reams of fabric for her quilting.\n\nThe two split the utilities and the $1,145 rent equally. They rarely share meals or do things together, but have found that they seek each other out in other ways. \u201cShazzi is so patient, she has helped me for hours with my schoolwork,\u201d Ms. Honda said.\n\nMs. Felstein, an avid quilter, said she has been thrilled to talk about design and assist Ms. Honda with her assignments. In return, Ms. Honda has been helping out more with the housework.\n\n\u201cGetting a roommate at my age certainly required some mental adjustment,\u201d Ms. Felstein said. \u201cBut it has been wonderful in so many ways.\u201d\n\nSusan Bendes, the shared housing coordinator at the Women\u2019s Rights Information Center, in Englewood, N.J., said the nonprofit, which has found affordable housing for Bergen County residents since the 1970s, believes there is an urgent need for public policymakers to promote home sharing to seniors to prevent homelessness.\n\n\u201cI have seniors who call and ask me all kinds of questions because they\u2019re in dire need of financial assistance to stay in their homes, but they tend to be gun-shy when it\u2019s time to actually bring in a tenant,\u201d Ms. Bendes said. \u201cThere needs to be more dialogue on how and why home sharing should be a normal thing in our society.\u201d\n\nStatistics show that the number of older Americans who are homeless is growing. In 2007, homeless people 62 and older who sought shelter accounted for 2.9 percent of the country\u2019s homeless population. By 2016, the percentage had risen to 4.7, according to estimates from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group.\n\n\u201cPeople were doing O.K. until the recession,\u201d said Nan Roman, president of the alliance. \u201cBut as people lost their jobs and struggled to get rehired, some lost their assets over time.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWendi Burkhardt, chief executive of Silvernest, an online home-sharing and roommate-matching service geared toward older adults, thinks that society\u2019s penchant for independent living has clouded the conversation about how we age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI really think the \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 were early trendsetters,\u201d she said, referring to the popular TV sitcom from the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, in which four older women lived under the same roof in Miami. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to share your home with others, whether it\u2019s for financial reasons or for companionship?\u201d\n\nAlthough placing an ad and setting up a profile is free, Silvernest charges those who have rooms to rent about $30 to use the messaging service to communicate with potential roommates. Those seeking rooms pay the same amount, which covers a background check and gives them access to the listings.\n\nMore than 70 percent of those who have placed an ad since the company was started in 2015 were motivated by financial reasons, Ms. Burkhardt said, noting that while most of the company\u2019s clients are in the West, the service is available nationally.\n\nThe real estate listings site Trulia estimates that there are 3.6 million unoccupied rooms that can be rented out in the country\u2019s largest housing markets \u2014 and there may be more than 17,700 spare rooms that can be rented out for about $868 a month in the New York area alone.\n\nSarah Oswald, a relationship coach who lives in Boulder, Colo., said she messaged numerous people through Silvernest to find her father, John Oswald, a roommate.\n\nMr. Oswald, 69, lives in a one-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment in the West Village and has no pension to rely on, he said, because he worked in the nonprofit world for years. Health issues stemming from his service in the Vietnam War also took a toll on his finances, because numerous surgeries on his legs prevented him from working at times.\n\nMs. Oswald said she tried using Craigslist and university housing boards, but they were difficult to navigate from afar.

Another tenant, a struggling alcoholic in her fifties, stole a nine-foot satellite dish, jewelry and appliances, Ms. Rosania said.\n\nBut last year, she found John Costanzo, 61, with help from social workers at HomeSharing Inc., a nonprofit in Bridgewater, N.J., and the two became fast friends. They now watch TV, run errands and eat most meals together.\n\nFor Mr. Costanzo, a former Marine who owned a crane-rigging business and is on disability after several back surgeries, affordable housing was essential. He pays $600 for his room, a monthly fee that includes utilities and cable. He is not allowed overnight guests, alcohol and drugs are prohibited in the house, and he must keep the bathroom clean at all times.\n\n\u201cI think my blood pressure is lower and I\u2019ve lost 43 pounds since I moved in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know where,\u201d Ms. Rosania shot back with a smile.\n\nHome sharing, of course, is not just for those who need the money. Taking in a tenant for little or no rent in exchange for household work suits many who have extra space, like Thelma Chesney, a Brooklyn Heights resident.\n\nMs. Chesney, 91, started living with a new roommate last month. In exchange for light household work \u2014 taking out the garbage, cleaning the house, shopping \u2014 Grace Linderholm, 23, an artist who recently graduated from New York University, gets to live on the top floor of Ms. Chesney\u2019s house for free.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA former associate professor at the New York University Silver School of Social Work, Ms. Chesney said the four-story brownstone became \u201ca lot of room for one person\u201d after her three children moved out and her husband passed away in 2008. She finds all her lodgers through word of mouth, and also rents out the ground floor at a reduced rate, in exchange for handyman work done on the brownstone.\n\nBut more important than the work her tenants do, she said, is having her home lived in, especially when she is on vacation or visiting her children. She recalled previous boarders, including one who practiced the cello for hours on end and another who helped her sew buttons on her clothing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to coexist with everyone quite well,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving someone fetch you milk in bad weather is quite convenient.\u201d\n\nMelissa McHam Green, a licensed social worker and eldercare manager in Brooklyn, has helped some of her clients find roommates and agree on mutually beneficial guidelines. She advises those interested in home sharing not to go about it on their own: Go through a nonprofit service, she said, or ask a trusted eldercare professional, friends or family to help properly vet the prospective roommates. And before you sign a lease with a boarder, make sure to do a background check.\n\n\u201cYou need a huge amount of trust and to be very clear with your expectations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut if you have the help you need to stay in your home \u2014 and the tenant gains affordable housing in exchange \u2014 I think there\u2019s much to gain socially and spiritually when young and old live together.\u201d", "title": "Getting a Roommate in Your Golden Years", "authors": ["Kaya Laterman"]}

The Giants cannot offer Shurmur the job or finalize the terms of a contract with him until the Vikings, who play in Sunday\u2019s N.F.C. championship game, are no longer in the playoffs.\n\nThe NFL Network first reported on Monday that Shurmur had risen to the top of the Giants\u2019 short list of candidates for head coach. Two of the most prominent names on that list \u2014 Matt Patricia, the defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots, and Josh McDaniels, the Patriots\u2019 offensive coordinator \u2014 are expected to take head coaching jobs elsewhere. According to news reports, Patricia will become the Detroit Lions\u2019 coach while McDaniels is headed to the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nShurmur, 52, met with Giants officials on Jan. 6 in Minnesota. In his 19 years coaching in various positions in the N.F.L., Shurmur is known best for his development of quarterbacks. The Giants have an aging quarterback in Eli Manning, who had a subpar season in 2017, and they are expected to use the second overall pick of the upcoming N.F.L. draft to select one of the top available quarterbacks.\n\nShurmur\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has been buttressed by his work this season with Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, who has gone from an N.F.L. journeyman to a surprising star for Minnesota. Keenum threw 22 touchdown passes and seven interceptions during the regular season, while the Vikings won 11 of the 14 games he started.

Gettleman recently held the same position with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nShurmur, who comes to the Giants from the Minnesota Vikings, where he thrived as an offensive coordinator, will be charged with resurrecting a roster short on depth.

In \u201cOff the Charts,\u201d Hulbert attempts to capture the complicated lives of child prodigies without descending into voyeurism or caricature. She has tried to \u201clisten hard for the prodigies\u2019 side of the story,\u201d to her great credit.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis is an arduous task, and it sometimes shows in the writing, which can be stilted in its reliance on quotes and documentation. But Hulbert\u2019s diligence results in a surprising payoff: The best advice for managing a child prodigy may be a wise strategy for parenting any child, including the many, many nonbrilliant ones.\n\nHulbert, The Atlantic\u2019s literary editor, wrote her last book, \u201cRaising America,\u201d about the tortured history of parenting advice. So she is appropriately wary of preachy morality tales. \u201cMy goal isn\u2019t to pile on the stark cautionary fare. Nor am I aiming to crack some \u2018talent code,\u2019\u201d she writes in the prologue for \u201cOff the Charts,\u201d to our great relief.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, she tries to place each of the boys and girls featured in the book in a specific time and place; their celebrity reveals much about their particular moment in American history. For example, Bobby Fischer\u2019s chess prowess might not have been impressive enough for adults to overlook his breathtaking egotism \u2014 but for the launching of Sputnik and America\u2019s anxiety about creeping Soviet domination in education and science. One era\u2019s prodigy is another\u2019s anonymous misfit.\n\nThe book begins with the story of two gifted boys who attended Harvard at the same time, in the early 1900s. Norbert Wiener, a budding philosopher and mathematician, was 14, and William Sidis, a star in linguistics and mathematics, was only 11. They were not friends, which was a shame. Both suffered under the weight of their elders\u2019 intellectual expectations, combined with the impossibility of fitting in as boys among men. They were told they were superior, but then punished if they acted like it. Their identities depended on superhuman smarts, which made any academic failure feel like a knife to the heart.\n\nWiener would struggle with depression for the rest of his life, but he did manage to eventually find professional fulfillment at M.I.T., where he helped invent the field of cybernetics. Sidis was not so successful; after fleeing a criminal charge related to a political protest, he did low-level accounting work in New York. He continued to alienate others with his stubborn arrogance before dying at 46 of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhat would have helped these boys and the other struggling prodigies in this book? Maybe nothing. But after poring over their words and stories, Hulbert has concluded that they might all offer parents similar advice: Accept who they are.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean protecting them from failure or stress; quite the opposite. \u201cWhat they want, and need, is the chance to obsess on their own idiosyncratic terms \u2014 to sweat and swerve, lose their balance, get their bearings, battle loneliness, discover resilience,\u201d Hulbert writes. Interestingly, this is the same advice contemporary psychologists tend to give to all parents, not just the parents of prodigies. Parents must hold children accountable and help them thrive, which is easier said than done; but if they try to re-engineer the fundamentals of their offspring, they will fail spectacularly, sooner or later. And this lesson is particularly obvious in the extremes.\n\n\u201cExtraordinary achievement, though adults have rarely cared to admit it, takes a toll,\u201d Hulbert writes. \u201cIt demands an intensity that rarely makes kids conventionally popular or socially comfortable. But if they get to claim that struggle for mastery as theirs, in all its unwieldiness, they just might sustain the energy and curiosity that ideally fuels such a quest.\u201d\n\nThe special challenge for prodigies is that they are exceptional in more ways than one. \u201cGenius is an abnormality, and abnormalities do not come one at a time,\u201d explains Veda Kaplinsky, a longtime teacher of gifted students, in Andrew Solomon\u2019s \u201cFar From the Tree,\u201d a book that is cited by Hulbert. \u201cMany gifted kids have A.D.D. or O.C.D. or Asperger\u2019s. When the parents are confronted with two sides of a kid, they\u2019re so quick to acknowledge the positive, the talented, the exceptional; they are often in denial over everything else.\u201d\n\nThe very traits that make prodigies so successful in one arena \u2014 their obsessiveness, a stubborn refusal to conform, a blistering drive to win \u2014 can make them pariahs in the rest of life. Whatever else they may say, most teachers do not in fact appreciate creativity and critical thinking in their own students. \u201cOff the Charts\u201d is jammed with stories of small geniuses being kicked out of places of learning. Matt Savage spent two days in a Boston-area Montessori preschool before being expelled. Thanks to parents who had the financial and emotional resources to help him find his way, he is now, at age 25, a renowned jazz musician.\n\nInterestingly, some prodigies may actually do better when their eccentricities are seen by loving adults as disabilities first \u2014 and talents second. Hulbert tells the story of Jacob Barnett, born in 1998, who withdrew into autism as a toddler in Indiana. His parents tried every form of therapy they could find, before finally discovering that he could be drawn out through his captivation with astronomy. His mother, Kristine, took him to astronomy classes at the local university \u2014 not to jump-start his genius but to help coax him back to life. \u201cIf I had stopped and let myself bask in the awe of Jake\u2019s amazing abilities \u2014 if I had stopped to ponder how unusual he really is \u2014 I don\u2019t think I could have been a good mother to him,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe most vivid section of the book comes at the end, when Hulbert reunites with the musical prodigy Marc Yu, a decade after first interviewing him at age 6. With his mother\u2019s support, Yu had tried to ease up on his musical career and live a more normal life, an approach that had worked for other prodigies, including the child actress Shirley Temple. But Yu found that the strategies that worked at the keyboard were useless in high school, where no amount of discipline and focus could make him cool. The adorable, joke-cracking boy she\u2019d remembered had grown into a lonely teenager. \u201cI always expected things to go my way,\u201d Yu told Hulbert. \u201cIf I wanted it, I worked hard enough, I got it, and people loved me. That\u2019s no longer true, and I feel I exist in the shadow of popular kids.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYu\u2019s story reinforces one of Hulbert\u2019s central, if unsatisfying, findings: Children\u2019s needs change. If you think you\u2019ve got a child figured out, you will be proved wrong momentarily.

She said that the treatment produced some dramatic individual improvements \u2014 one man, shackled for 10 years, became strikingly lucid for the first time in memory \u2014 and that more careful, and longer, follow-up likely would have found that chaining was reduced, at least somewhat.\n\nVideo\n\nExperts acknowledged the multiple cultural hazards involved \u2014 including obtaining informed consent, perhaps the slipperiest issue \u2014 but were impressed the trial happened at all.\n\n\u201cThe implications are clear: symptom control through the solitary use of medications is not a means to reduce chaining,\u201d wrote Dr. Vikram Patel of Harvard University and Dr. Kamaldeep Bhui of the London School of Medicine, in an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cThis study reaffirms the need for a comprehensive and humane approach for the management of psychosis.\u201d\n\nPeople are chained at prayer camps throughout West Africa that are mostly Christian retreats. Some are tiny and hidden, while others are sprawling places, with open-air churches and cafeterias that teem with people on holy days.\n\nThe pastors who run the camps and their followers believe that prayer and fasting are the best treatment for mental problems. Camp staffers remove the chains when they decide a person is no longer mentally troubled but consistently lucid, calm, reasonable. That can take days, months or even years, depending on the person and the camp.\n\nThe leader of the Mt. Horeb camp, about an hour\u2019s drive from Accra, the country\u2019s capital, allowed Dr. Ofori-Atta and a team of psychiatric residents to recruit chained attendees for the study. The team obtained consent in the usual way, explaining the trial and its risks to the people and their families in the Twi language native to the region.\n\nObtaining informed consent is an imperfect process even when engaging patients in the United States who live independently, let alone chained, impoverished West Africans, said Dr. Rosenheck. People held in chains are deeply vulnerable, often poor and uninformed about Western medicine; many are apt to agree to almost anything if the staff and religiousleader approve.\n\n\u201cYou explain everything in detail, and you ask people. Still, it is as ambiguous a process there as it is here,\u201d Dr. Rosenheck said. Yale\u2019s Global Health Leadership Initiative worked with Dr. Ofori-Atta to develop the study. Funding came from the University of Ghana and Ghana\u2019s health ministry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the study, the researchers monitored the mental well-being of 110 chained people. The vast majority had a psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia. Half got a diagnosis, using Western labels like schizophrenia and depression, and predominantly drug treatment. The other half continued as before, with no changes to treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks, those on drugs showed clear improvements on a standard rating scale that tracks feelings of hostility, emotional withdrawal and hallucinations. The camp residents doing the ratings did not know which people were on medication and which were not.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Yet the number of days each person spent in chains was identical in both groups: about 12 days on average, after the initial phase of the trial.\n\nThe reasons that treatment didn\u2019t reduce chaining are not obvious, said Dr. Ofori-Atta, but may include the length of the trial itself. The decision to remove chains was the camp\u2019s to make, and typically staff want to see steady improvement over time.\n\nDr. Ofori-Atta said that another factor was the abuse of recreational drugs. Some people in chains were addicts likely to return to using drugs if freed, so staffers were slow to turn them loose.\n\nIn that sense, the study is yet another demonstration that people have little chance of becoming fully well until they are reintegrated into a community with the supports they need, regardless of diagnosis or treatments.", "title": "Given Medicine, the Patients Got Better.

In addition to giving coral reefs their bright colors, zooxanthella also provide corals with oxygen, waste filtration, and up to 90 percent of their energy. Absent zooxanthella, corals not only take on a ghostly pallor, hence the term bleaching, but they are also more susceptible to death.\n\nIn theory, coral reefs can recover from even a severe bleaching event. Some of the coral will die off from increased disease susceptibility, but once ocean temperatures drop again, many of the corals will start growing back.\n\nBut that\u2019s only if they\u2019re given enough time.\n\nTypically, it takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing corals to recover after a severe bleaching event.

The strong ensemble cast, which includes Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and the pop star Harry Styles, doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of talking; Nolan lets the sights and sounds of war speak for themselves.

Whether you see it as a horror comedy, a biting and serious social critique or both, there\u2019s no question that this story of a young black man\u2019s harrowing visit to his white girlfriend\u2019s suburban family home delivers far more than laughs and jump scares.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on HBO Go.\n\n\u2014\n\n[Interested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

But, as dark as its story lines can be, it\u2019s still a pleasure to watch the show\u2019s Globe-winning lead, Elisabeth Moss, battle the patriarchy as the smart, sardonic narrator, Offred, a young woman who has lost her job, home, family and bodily autonomy to a theocratic revolution.

The first season of that lavish Netflix historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II took top TV honors at the 2017 Globes, and its star, Claire Foy, won the award for best actress. Season 2, which covers the tumultuous period between the late 1950s and the early \u201960s, is the final outing for the show\u2019s original cast. (An older cohort of actors will replace Foy and her co-stars in Season 3.) The new episodes are less cohesive than their predecessors, although the unconventional courtship of Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her first husband, Lord Snowdon (Matthew Goode), makes for a few of the show\u2019s most thrilling hours to date.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\n\u2014\n\nSterling K.

While that high-concept family drama courted its enormous audience through an early sequence of heavy-handed twists, its devastating portrait of the loving but troubled Pearson clan has matured considerably since those somewhat contrived episodes. Much of the credit for the show\u2019s evolution belongs to its cast \u2014 particularly the Globe winner Sterling K. Brown \u2014 for humane performances that rarely devolve into sappiness.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Hulu.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Marsai Martin, Miles Brown, Anthony Anderson, Yara Shahidi, Tracee Ellis Ross and Laurence Fishburne in \u201cblack-ish.\u201d Ron Tom/ABC\n\n\u2018black-ish\u2019\n\nNominated for: best musical or comedy series; best actor, musical or comedy\n\nbest musical or comedy series; best actor, musical or comedy Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nKenya Barris is quickly becoming one of the biggest behind-the-scenes forces in Hollywood. The creator of \u201cblack-ish,\u201d a charming ABC sitcom about an upper-middle-class black family, Barris also helped write one of 2017\u2019s funniest big-screen comedies, \u201cGirls Trip.\u201d He kicked off 2018 with the premiere of Freeform\u2019s \u201cgrown-ish,\u201d a \u201cblack-ish\u201d spinoff that follows the Johnson family\u2019s oldest daughter (Yara Shahidi) to college. But Barris hasn\u2019t neglected her parents and siblings in favor of these new projects. \u201cBlack-ish\u201d has never shied away from topical story lines, and with the standout episode \u201cLemons,\u201d which aired last January, the show became one of the first TV series to address the repercussions of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Hulu.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cMaster of None.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Master of None\u2019\n\nWon for: best actor, musical or comedy\n\nbest actor, musical or comedy Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe first season of this finely crafted Netflix comedy from Aziz Ansari was subtly unorthodox, periodically interrupting its Tinder-era love story for episode-length explorations of weighty topics like immigration, sexism and Hollywood\u2019s racism. Season 2, which appeared last spring, doubled down on those experimental flourishes to profound and delightful effect. Although the season does embroil Ansari\u2019s Dev Shah in another wrenching romance, its best episodes focus on entirely different characters: \u201cNew York, I Love You\u201d traces the intersecting lives of a doorman, a bodega clerk and a cabby, while the Emmy-winning \u201cThanksgiving\u201d goes back in time to recount how Dev\u2019s friend Denise (Lena Waithe) came out as a lesbian to her family.\n\n0\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\n\u2014\n\nPamela Adlon, left, and Mikey Madison in \u201cBetter Things.\u201d Jessica Brooks/FX\n\n\u2018Better Things\u2019\n\nNominated for: best actress, musical or comedy\n\nbest actress, musical or comedy Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nLike \u201cMaster of None,\u201d this semi-biographical family dramedy from Pamela Adlon followed up a very good debut season with a truly excellent Season 2. When we first met Adlon\u2019s alter ego, Sam Fox, she was a sort of gruff supermom, slaying single parenthood with wry humor and infinite patience. She deflected her three daughters\u2019 thoughtless insults while alleviating their growing pains with perfect gems of insight about the messiness of life. The show\u2019s second season went all-in on that messiness, in an evolution that made \u201cBetter Things\u201d cathartic as well as inspirational, acknowledging that even a supermom can get mired in anger and vulnerability and sheer exhaustion.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on FX Now.\n\n\u2014\n\nRachel Brosnahan in \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d Nicole Rivelli/Amazon Studios\n\n\u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019\n\nWon for: best musical or comedy series; best actress, musical or comedy\n\nbest musical or comedy series; best actress, musical or comedy Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt was exciting to watch this dark-horse nominee from Amy Sherman-Palladino (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) win big in the comedy series category, just six weeks after its first season appeared on Amazon. The show repurposes the cult-favorite TV creator\u2019s chatty, referential style for a story set in the 1950s. Rachel Brosnahan more than earns her best actress nomination as the lovable Midge Maisel, an ultra-capable Manhattan housewife whose perfect life suddenly falls apart when her amateur-comedian husband leaves her. It doesn\u2019t take long for Midge to show up, drunk and bitter, at his open-mic venue of choice and entertain the downtown crowd with her disgruntled Jewish mom routine. From there, \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d becomes a mostly lighthearted tale of a remarkable woman who\u2019s embracing her independence \u2014 and cracking up audiences with foul-mouthed jokes that are as funny now as they would have been 60 years ago.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Amazon Prime.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrankie Shaw (here with her television son) in \u201cSMILF.\u201d Mark Schafer/Showtime\n\n\u2018SMILF\u2019\n\nNominated for: best musical or comedy series; best actress, musical or comedy\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis dark Showtime comedy from the actress and filmmaker Frankie Shaw is another surprising nominee. \u201cSMILF\u201d debuted at the end of an extraordinarily crowded year for TV and got somewhat lost amid a crush of other raw, female-fronted comedies. And it is most definitely not a show that will appeal to everyone. Shaw stars as Bridgette Bird, a broke single mom with an eating disorder, a history of sexual abuse and an obsessive fear that childbirth has made her body unfit for sex. Although it didn\u2019t quite reach the brilliantly neurotic heights of \u201cFleabag\u201d and \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d in its first season, \u201cSMILF\u201d (which has already been renewed for Season 2) has limitless potential and will probably appeal to anyone who loves those two series.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Showtime Anytime.\n\n\u2014\n\nKyle MacLachlan in \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return.\u201d Suzanne Tenner/Showtime\n\n\u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019\n\nNominated for: best actor in a limited series or made-for-TV movie\n\nbest actor in a limited series or made-for-TV movie Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMaybe David Lynch and Mark Frost\u2019s wildly ambitious revival of their classic \u201890s crime drama, \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d was just too weird to merit a nomination for best limited series. That\u2019s a shame, but at least the press association acknowledged Kyle MacLachlan for his stunning performance as the heroic F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper, as well as two new characters: Cooper\u2019s evil doppelg\u00e4nger and a strangely endearing human-shaped blank slate named Dougie Jones. You really have to get on board with the creators\u2019 experimental vision to appreciate this small-town soap that doubles as an abstract rendering of the cosmic battle between good and evil. Luckily, the alternately affable and inscrutable MacLachlan makes a perfect conduit between Lynch\u2019s world and our own.\n\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Showtime Anytime.\n\n\u2014", "title": "Golden Globes 2018: Where to Stream the Nominated and Winning Movies and TV Shows", "authors": ["Judy Berman"]}

On Monday the Cleveland Indians owner, Paul Dolan, and the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, said the chief\u2019s times is up. The racist logo will be off the uniform by the 2019 baseball season.\n\nChief Wahoo \u2014 the version from the stadium \u2014 wound up at the Western Reserve Historical Society, a center of Cleveland memorabilia and regional history. When you walk into the historical society, you see the chief, and then to your left, the classic Cleveland-manufactured cars from the early 20th century. Cleveland likes its history. And we have no beef with nostalgia either. For instance, I have a 1958 baseball card on my desk of Roger Maris in an Indians uniform. Maris played for the Indians for a minute. What if he had hit 61 homers for the Indians instead of the Yankees? The world would be a better place, that\u2019s what. Chief Wahoo is plastered all over the Maris card. Mr. Dolan, the Indians owner, said Wahoo paraphernalia will still be available in Northeast Ohio, exclusively, after next year. Keep the locals happy.\n\nI\u2019m a landlord, and I once rented to a graphic-design shop that did good cash flow with \u201cKeep the Chief in Cleveland\u201d T-shirts and other Cleveland-themed gear. Many locals love Wahoo. My wife\u2019s cousin George Becker is against getting rid of the chief. He said: \u201cChief Wahoo is a representation of Cleveland. It\u2019s highly identifiable with this town. Why have somebody from another city tell us who we are? They don\u2019t know what makes this city tick.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut at least we\u2019ll still be able to buy the Chief Wahoo tchotchkes here.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve played gigs beneath the Wahoo logo at the historical society. (When I\u2019m not a landlord, I\u2019m a musician.) I did a duo gig with the guitarist Irwin Weinberger, whose parents were Holocaust survivors from Poland. The Wahoo sign irked Irwin. On Monday he said to me: \u201cYahoo! Wahoo! It\u2019s fantastic that Wahoo is gone. That caricature reminded me of the Jews in Germany. It was a very degrading symbol.

In a lengthy phone conversation, both men agreed to seek a permanent spending deal rather than the stopgap measure being negotiated by lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\nLess than an hour later, Mr. Schumer was meeting with Mr. Trump over cheeseburgers in the president\u2019s study next to the Oval Office. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was there, as was Mr. Schumer\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Lynch.\n\nRead more from Michael D. Shear and Maggie Haberman \u00bb\n\nEven as the shutdown dominates headlines, it could be forgotten by November.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, Republican hard-liners engineered a 16-day shutdown of the federal government, implausibly insisting that President Barack Obama acquiesce to their demand that the Affordable Care Act be stripped of all funding.\n\nThe gambit failed miserably. The Republican Party\u2019s already low standing in public opinion polls plunged further. Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers were widely seen as victorious.\n\nThen the following November, something happened that plainly informed the moves of Democrats today as they drove the government toward another shutdown: Voters handed Republicans overwhelming victories and a Senate majority \u2014 in large part because of dissatisfaction with the man in the White House. The shutdown was a distant memory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody paid a big price for it,\u201d Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who is facing a competitive re-election race this fall, said of the 2014 election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Democrats on the ballot in many of the states that President Trump carried, the fresh government shutdown is unmistakably perilous, especially if it is seen as a strong-armed move to protect undocumented immigrants brought to this country illegally as children. And Mr. Manchin vote to keep the government open, as did four other Trump-state Democrats.\n\nRead more from Jonathan Martin \u00bb\n\nLindsey Graham proposed a three-week extension.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, released a statement proposing a three-week funding extension, a week shorter than the bill the House had passed.\n\nIn the statement, he said that he thought that lawmakers were \u201cinside the ten yard line\u201d on finding solutions to immigration and other issues involved in the debate over the spending bill.\n\nSoon after Mr. Graham\u2019s statement, Mr. Trump interjected on Twitter casting doubt on whether lawmakers can reach a deal.\n\nWhite House officials outlined what may be involved in a shutdown.\n\nVideo\n\nOfficials at the White House Office of Management and Budget spent the past week consulting with federal agencies on contingency plans in the event of a shutdown, the fourth time in the past year that they have had to make such preparations.\n\nMore than 1 million active duty military personnel will serve with no lapse, they said, but could not be paid until the shutdown ends. Agencies such as the Department of Energy that have funding that is not subject to annual appropriations can use that money to stay open, the officials said, and the administration is encouraging them to do so. Most mandatory programs \u2014 entitlements such as Social Security that are automatically funded rather than subject to congressional appropriations \u2014 can continue without disruption.\n\nOfficials said Mr. Trump may travel on Air Force One to carry out his constitutional responsibilities, such as a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, next week \u2014 although it was not clear if trips to Mar-a-Lago, his exclusive Palm Beach club, for golf and socializing, such as the one he had planned for this weekend, would fall into that category.\n\nVideo\n\nOverall, the senior officials said, the administration was working to minimize the effect of the shutdown on Americans. But some things will have to wait. One official said there could be no work, at least in the short term, on the president\u2019s forthcoming budget request for 2019 as long as a shutdown remained in effect.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld Davis\n\nPhoto\n\nMulvaney went from shutdown instigator to government defender.\n\nMr. Mulvaney was once a ringleader of the so-called Shutdown Caucus when he helped orchestrate the shuttering of the government in 2013 as a hard-right member of the House.\n\nNow, as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, he is doing his best to avert one. At a White House briefing on Friday, Mr. Mulvaney insisted that a shutdown was not a desirable outcome, and that unlike the last such scenario under President Barack Obama in 2013, the Trump administration was doing everything possible to avoid a funding lapse. He said that Democrats \u201cweaponized\u201d the shutdown back then for political purposes.\n\nThe tune on Friday was much different from five years ago when it was Mr. Mulvaney who dared Democrats over funding for the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Mulvaney also helped spearhead the debt ceiling brinkmanship in 2011 over Republican demands to cut Planned Parenthood funding.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In southeastern Utah, county commissioners decided to reopen Natural Bridges National Monument in act of self-declared civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect the government to remain open; however, in the event of a shutdown, national parks will remain as accessible as possible while still following all applicable laws and procedures,\u201d Heather Swift, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe noted that some services that require staffing and maintenance, like campgrounds and full-service restrooms, will not operate.\n\n\u201cThe American public and especially our veterans who come to our nation\u2019s capital will find war memorials and open-air parks open to the public,\u201d she said.\n\nJacque Simon, the public policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, said federal workers have not yet been given any instructions about how agencies plan to operate or whom will be sent home if a shutdown occurs. Keeping the parks open, she said, is a smart political move.\n\n\u201cThe White House is very conscious of what\u2019s popular and what\u2019s not, and I think one of the memorable images from the last shutdown was World War II veterans who had come to D.C. to visit the then-relatively new World War II Memorial being turned away. It was not a good visual,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Simon said a shutdown would be an \u201ceconomic disaster\u201d for federal employees, and said she is concerned that national parks my remain open by the government paying contractors while sending federal workers on furlough. That, she said, would amount to an illegal privatization of the work force.\n\n\u201cWe will be watching that very closely,\u201d she said.\n\nEnvironmental activists criticized the plan to keep open the national parks, calling it dangerous to visitors as well as illegal under the Anti-Deficiency Act of 1998 that mandates the government can\u2019t spend funds that haven\u2019t been appropriated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than a baldfaced attempt to divert Americans\u2019 attention away from the G.O.P.\u2019s extreme agenda,\u201d Scott Slesinger, the legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Lisa Friedman\n\nShutdown comes at a terrible time for the I.R.S.\n\nMr. Trump has warned that a government shutdown could blunt the effect of his tax cuts, and he could have a point.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTax filing season starts in less than two weeks, and the Internal Revenue Service, which has been swamped with work trying to carry out the new tax law, may take a big hit. That could take a toll on the tax collection agency\u2019s ability to ensure a smooth transition and deal with the tsunami of questions coming from confused taxpayers.\n\nAbout 56 percent of I.R.S. employees are set to be sent home in the shutdown.\n\nAnd it comes at a time when the agency is already understaffed, having lost 21,000 full-time employees since 2010 as its budget has dwindled.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport", "title": "Government Shuts Down as Bill to Extend Funding Is Blocked; Senate Adjourns for the Night", "authors": ["The New York Times"]}
{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "One such incident is intolerable, and it opened our eyes to the urgent need for real reform because we simply cannot risk another. A criminal justice system that ignores its cornerstone principle to the detriment of anyone \u2014 whether they are white, black, Latino, rich or poor \u2014 delegitimizes it. And we cannot allow this to persist.\n\nThis year, I am sending a bill to the State Legislature that will close the gap between what our criminal justice system says and what it does.\n\nThe bill will reform our bail system so that anyone facing misdemeanor or nonviolent felony charges should be released without bail. Those who pose a current danger to a person or persons or pose a risk of flight can still be held in detention, with due process, but no longer will people go to jail for the crime of being poor.\n\nIn addition to bail reform, we also need discovery reform. New York is one of only 10 states where prosecutors are not required to share with a defendant\u2019s lawyers basic evidence, including police reports and witness statements, until just before the trial. Expanding discovery will ensure that attorneys have the tools necessary to adequately represent their clients.\n\nWe will also propose changing procedures and scheduling to move cases faster so that we no longer have people sitting in jail for years waiting to be heard. Backlogs often cause attorneys to request postponements and delays, frequently without the approval of their clients. We propose that any waiver to a speedy trial be put in writing and signed by the defendant.\n\nThese changes will build on the reforms enacted during my tenure as governor. Last year, we raised the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18, affecting thousands of young people who will have a brighter future. We passed video interrogation and photo array reforms, important changes that protect the integrity of the investigative process. We ended the Rockefeller-era drug sentencing rules that took discretion away from our judges and filled our prisons with nonviolent offenders, and we closed 24 prisons and juvenile detention centers, eliminating prison beds and reducing by more than 5,000 the number of men and women behind bars.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, New York became the first and only state to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate, and if necessary prosecute, police-involved killings of unarmed civilians.\n\nBut some improvement is not enough. Our tolerance for any continuing injustice is repugnant to our position as a progressive government and flies in the face of the great leaders who took on the fight in the days before us.", "title": "Opinion | Governor Cuomo: The Way to a More Just New York State", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "text": "REALITY: Many White House policies will hurt New Jersey. The new federal tax plan will raise taxes for many residents who previously were able to deduct all of their property taxes. Commuters were dismayed when the Trump administration indicated that it would not \u2014 at least for now \u2014 provide financing for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. To counter Washington, Mr. Murphy has shown a willingness to be creative with the state tax code, though finding sufficient money for the rail tunnel without help from the federal government will likely be impossible. The new governor can also take steps to protect undocumented immigrants, such as providing state identification cards and driver\u2019s licenses and making them eligible for college financial aid. But immigration policy is ultimately set by the federal government.\n\nOn the Economy\n\nPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey is rooted in an economy that creates better jobs and provides higher wages that creates places where industries can grow and communities can rise, where innovative companies are born and where millennials want to live and where seniors want to retire.\u201d He added: \u201cfor small businesses, and women, veteran and minority-owned businesses to thrive instead of delivering massive tax breaks to a handful of select and connected big corporations that don\u2019t need them in the first place.\u201d\n\nREALITY: Mr. Murphy inherits a stalled economy \u2014 the unemployment rate is higher than the national average. The state has struggled to retain younger workers and the new tax plan could make things worse. The state\u2019s staggering pension debt has led to 11 credit downgrades in the past eight years. Still, a report by McKinsey last year found that New Jersey had the potential to grow its economy by more than $150 billion and create more than 250,000 jobs over the next decade if it shifted from its practice of providing tax credits to retain old businesses to providing incentives for start-ups. Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has embraced the idea of new incentives and on Tuesday talked about \u201ctechnology incubators.\u201d\n\nOn Education\n\nPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey funds its public schools and delivers on the promise of property tax relief. It makes a four-year college more affordable and provides free access to community college. And it creates new training programs to prepare our residents for jobs in an innovation-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nREALITY: New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, driven largely by the way it pays for public schools. The state also has some of the country\u2019s highest paid teachers. Mr. Murphy said the state would fulfill its financing obligation to fully fund public schools as a way to lower property taxes, but it remains unclear how he would generate the additional revenue. Mr. Murphy\u2019s financial blueprint should become clearer when he delivers his first budget address on Feb. 27.\n\nOn Marijuana\n\nPROMISE: \u201cA stronger and fairer New Jersey embraces comprehensive criminal justice reform comprehensively, and that includes a process to legalize marijuana.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some of his other promises will require legislative approval and though some bills, such as providing funding to Planned Parenthood, are pending, other issues, like increasing the minimum wage, will require intense negotiations.\n\nNotably absent\n\nMr. Murphy made no direct mention of two of the state\u2019s most pressing issues: its large public pension liability and its decrepit transportation system, especially the chronic complaints about the reliability of New Jersey Transit\u2019s commuter trains.", "title": "Governor Murphy Pledges a Progressive Course for New Jersey", "authors": ["Nick Corasaniti"]}

Given lengthening life spans, a family may already have a presiding great-grandparent, an Opa or an Abuela, which pushes the new grandparent to find some alternative. My friend Dale might have gone with Bubbe, but her children already call their 91-year-old grandmother Bubbe. So Dale will be DiDi to her new granddaughter.\n\nBesides, contemporary family life has grown so complex that the new arrivals may face a whole host of elders \u2014 grandparents, step-grandparents, former spouses of remarried grandparents. They all need to be called something.\n\nWhich may explain why Georgia Witkin\u2019s \u201cThe Modern Grandparent\u2019s Handbook\u201d actually lists 251 grandparental names (I counted), divided by gender into three categories: Traditional, Trendy and Playful. I wouldn\u2019t volunteer to be known as Sweetums, G-dawg, Faux Pa or Grandude, however playfully, but apparently some folks have.\n\nAnd who can criticize them? Nothing is more personal than a name, especially a name only a handful of beloved people will ever use. (My granddaughter\u2019s other grandparents also took a fairly traditional route, selecting Nana and Saba, the latter being Hebrew for grandfather.)\n\nBut my theory is that beyond the logical explanations for the name game, we can discern a couple of underlying motives.\n\nPartly, it\u2019s a boomer thing. Tradition didn\u2019t always seem a good enough reason for this cohort to go along with certain practices back when, so it might not seem like a good enough reason to be called Grandpa now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA generation of women who entered the labor force, and men who entered the delivery room, isn\u2019t so keen on the old standbys, perhaps.

We too often won\u2019t use hearing aids, even if we need them. We may not claim the senior discount at the movie theater.\n\nWe don\u2019t want these wondrous new creatures calling us names that signify old age, either.\n\nA few high-wattage Hollywood types have been quite open about their distaste for grandmotherly names. Maybe that\u2019s reasonable for folks like Goldie Hawn (\u201cGlam-ma\u201d), who have to contend with the shortage of roles for older actresses.\n\nMost of us aren\u2019t worried about casting directors, though, but about something else. My friend Ellen Edwards Villa sent her mother a \u201cgrandma\u201d charm for her charm bracelet when her first grandchild was born.\n\nThe gift came back by return mail. Her mother, a mere 69 at the time, objected that she wasn\u2019t old enough to be a grandma. She insisted her grandchildren call her Sweetie Pie, instead, and they did.\n\n\u201cGigi\u201d seems a particularly popular grandma alternative of late. It makes sense for Frieda Kasden in Rockville, Md., a friend who actually is a great-grandmother. In other cases, I think women just prefer to picture Leslie Caron, circa 1958.\n\nTrying to stave off aging with inventive names doesn\u2019t make sense, of course; you can be a grandparent even before you reach middle age. But ageism, like other prejudices, isn\u2019t rational. In fact, it\u2019s particularly irrational, the elderly being the only marginalized group that all of us, if we\u2019re lucky, will eventually join. But there it is.\n\nThe kids could have the last laugh, though.

Then her first granddaughter came up with a monosyllabic moniker that was easy to say and suited her, somehow. To her three granddaughters and their parents, she was Fa ever after. She died 17 years ago and I still think of her as Fa.\n\nThis raises a terrifying prospect, of course. My own granddaughter, who is now 17 months old and can sound out quite a few words, is beginning to turn Bubbe \u2014 which is supposed to rhyme with \u201chubby\u201d \u2014 into something very different.\n\nShe\u2019s coming up with a name better suited to a running back at Ole Miss \u2014 and there\u2019s a possibility I\u2019ll be \u201cBubba\u201d for the rest of my life.\n\nOh no.

Will Kevin Spacey work again? Should he? This question came up with Roman Polanski, it comes up with Woody Allen. Should we care about, reward or punish what artists do beyond the parameters of their art? Should it affect their opportunities? Their reception?\n\nGERWIG: I would like to speak specifically to the Woody Allen question, which I have been asked about a couple of times recently, as I worked for him on a film that came out in 2012. It is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say. I can only speak for myself and what I\u2019ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film. I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again. Dylan Farrow\u2019s two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman\u2019s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization. I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.\n\nSORKIN: I don\u2019t like seeing anyone get disappeared. Personally, I don\u2019t think Kevin\u2019s going to be able to find his way back, but I\u2019m still rooting for a miraculous transformation.\n\nBRUNI: Thank you both for your candor. In reward: a happier topic! We\u2019re in the midst right now of people casting votes for the Oscar nominations, which will be announced on Jan. 23 and may well include both of your names. From a cultural standpoint, how much does who and what gets nominated \u2014 and who and what wins \u2014 really matter? Can you think of a nominee or victor that really changed America by dint of that recognition?\n\nSORKIN: It\u2019s sort of a two-part question, so I\u2019ll answer in two parts. Most of the films in the awards conversation this year are lower-budget films (\u201cDunkirk\u201d and a few others notwithstanding). High-profile award nominations give films like \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d a reach they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. As for a nomination or a win that changed the culture? I\u2019ll go with Hattie McDaniel.\n\nGERWIG: I do think it matters \u2014 when Kathryn Bigelow won the Oscar for best director it meant a great deal to me, personally. I imagine that it impacted other young women as well who had dreams of being a director. Suddenly, there she was, and more seemed possible to me. Also, I love the Mark Harris book \u201cPictures at a Revolution,\u201d which I think does an amazing job of looking at a moment of culture through the best-picture nominees of 1968 and what it meant for a changing Hollywood and a changing country.\n\nBRUNI: Aaron, I have to ask about the White House.

She had, in fact, lived in Brooklyn briefly as a child, but that was not what made her a New Yorker. She had and has the spirit of a quintessential New York City gal. She\u2019s brash and smart and tough and funny, and was always the mother my school dreaded a call from because she would push and push and push until she got what she wanted. I was the only kid who was allowed to take both band and Spanish because of her insistence.

I didn\u2019t understand drugs or mugging, but I did remember an anxiety that was indistinguishable from excitement. It felt a universe away from the kids-on-bikes town that was Sacramento. It seemed impossible that it was the same country. And yet somehow, it also felt like home.\n\nSacramento is a place where you can always see the horizon. It is flat and beautiful and open. But I loved the crowdedness of New York City, how when it rained it seemed like the buildings were raining, not the sky. My mom held my hand tight as she walk-sprinted through the city.

Soon came a second star (excellent and worth a detour), but the third star proved elusive.\n\nCritics of the Michelin system had long said it was biased in favor of French cuisine and a certain type of formal dining that ran counter to Italy\u2019s more relaxed mealtime tradition.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that my dishes can honorably compete with anybody\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Marchesi told The New York Times in early 1985, his restaurant still stuck at two stars, \u201cbut maybe we still are somewhat lacking in choreography, also because we in Italy don\u2019t really have a three-star public.\u201d\n\nMr. Marchesi mixed ideas he had picked up during his sojourn in France with regional Italian recipes and ingredients.

He closed his Milan restaurant in 1992 but quickly opened another about 45 miles to the east in the luxury hotel L\u2019Albereta, in Erbusco.

How else to explain the staggering pile of self-help books where Americans are offered the path to a better life via the rituals and outlook of other countries? Last year there were lessons in happiness and well-being, via hygge from Denmark. And this year? Japan is teaching us to seize the day (humbly). Sweden is showing us how to find balance and simplify our lives. And France is showing us, well, everything else. Naturellement. Just because they invented Camembert and guilt-free sex, they think they\u2019re soooo perfect.\n\nA FRENCHWOMAN\u2019S GUIDE TO SEX AFTER SIXTY (Greystone, paper, $17.95), by the psychotherapist Marie de Hennezel, immediately catches your attention because the cover shows a woman of a certain age glancing coquettishly over the bedsheets. But that age isn\u2019t 40. It\u2019s perhaps 75. So this isn\u2019t the American version of old; it\u2019s the French version, which is to say: old. And that\u2019s what makes this volume uniquely French: It\u2019s deeply un-American in its realism. Aches and pains, medications that reduce libido, a diminution of hormones that mean friction is tougher on our naughty bits and of course the occasional urge to cover all the mirrors in the house: Aging ain\u2019t pretty, Hennezel admits. Yet for many of us, Eros lives, and Eros wants its due. What\u2019s called for, then, is a revolution in the way we look at sexuality: a de-emphasis on orgasms in favor of kissing and caressing, more solo play to connect with our erotic selves and \u201cmaking affection\u201d as an alternative to making love. Feeling good through exercise and a healthy diet is paramount; looking younger through plastic surgery is mentioned not at all. Reading the stories of septuagenarians and octogenarians who are finding love or intimacy or sometimes just sex, one is reminded that the very French concept of joie de vivre \u2014 a sense of joy that comes from curiosity and playfulness, from looking outward instead of inward \u2014 is its own form of Botox.\n\nThis joie is very much at the heart of Jamie Cat Callan\u2019s lively PARISIAN CHARM SCHOOL: French Secrets for Cultivating Love, Joy and That Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi (TarcherPerigee, $19). Maybe \u201cParisian Charm School\u201d seems so thorough because Callan, who has written several previous books on various aspects of French life, is an American; she approaches her subject with anthropological rigor. Here that subject is French charm, which is some combination of intellectual curiosity, spontaneity, style and a soup\u00e7on of reserve. Charm, she points out, can\u2019t be Googled; it must be cultivated. Yet, at its heart, it\u2019s a tangle of contradictions. As a fashion consultant Callan interviewed put it, \u201cNever be too feminine, too girlie. Never be too complicated. Too obvious. Never look like you\u2019re trying. But you must try!\u201d Being French seems kind of exhausting. Still, we clumsy Americans can worship at this shrine and maybe pick up a few tricks. Who, after all, doesn\u2019t want to be like the woman in this line Callan quotes from Colette: \u201cWhen she raises her eyelids, it\u2019s as if she were taking off all her clothes.\u201d", "title": "Guides for Better Living From Around the World", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "We live in a culture of digital now-ness, twitter-surfing, trivia bingeing \u2014 which has become a culture of not-knowing history. I became acutely aware of the imbalance at the time of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last August. Suddenly, there history was \u2014 an old history of American racism and nativism \u2014 speaking to the present loud and clear.\n\nThe rally was built around a single object: an equestrian monument to the Confederate leader and Civil War hero Robert E. Lee. A small alt-right army had gathered to protest its threatened removal by the city from a public park. Probably no one had given the statue a serious glance for years. But the alt-right had, and understood its power, which lay in its twofold history. This sculpture represented the Civil War, but it was of a later date. It was made in 1924, when a brew of Lost Cause nostalgia and resurgent racist anger was saturating the South. In that context, the image of Lee was both a memorial to the past and the standard for a white supremacist future.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Charlottesville rally was, as it was meant to be, explosive. And in the aftershock came a wave of monument-fever. In Durham, N.C., anti-right protesters pulled down a second Confederate statue. In the same week, in Baltimore, Md., on an order from city hall, workmen hoisted four Confederate statues onto flatbed trucks and drove them off into the night.\n\nThe iconoclastic impulse spread north to New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to review a number of controversial monuments, not necessarily Civil War-related, that stood on city property. He called together a group of historians and artists together to take on the task. And this week, the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments, and Markers \u2014 \u2014 led by Tom Finkelpearl, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, and Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation \u2014 released a statement of the group\u2019s findings.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s a very by-committee document; measured, all-bases-covered, weighted with consensus, short on surprise. If anything could bring a fever down, this could. It lists a set of wide-angle questions the commission applies in making judgments. If monuments have the power to write history, who, in any given case, is wielding that power? Was the history true when written, and has that truth changed over time? Does the history serve positive or negative ends? Promote inclusion or divisiveness? If monuments are, like history, intrinsically complex, not easily defined as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong,\u201d is complexity alone enough to justify a contested monument\u2019s continuing presence?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the questions, and a group vote, come suggestions for actions the mayor can take. He can let a monument stand as is; re-contextualize it through added signage or programming; move it to another public site, such as a museum; change or expand its meaning by adding new art; or remove it from view. (Destroying is not an option, and in my opinion should never be.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

{"date": "2018-01-20 00:00:00", "text": "Drawn to the romance of treks to kill lions, elephants and rhinos and to photograph native tribes and storybook landscapes, clients flocked from around the world to Selby safaris, which were booked for years with clients like Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the Maharajah of Jaipur, Prince Stanislas Radziwill of Poland and Western tycoons, industrialists and chief executives seeking thrills and self-fulfillment.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose were anticipated wonders not always to be found in the real Africa. In the Hollywood-inspired popular images of the 1950s, the great white hunter was a fearless Clark Gable or Stewart Granger, tall and deeply tanned, who brought down a charging rhino with a single shot while his arrogant client cowered behind him, and who later romanced the client\u2019s neglected wife after saving her from a snarling lion.\n\nThe reality was Mr. Selby: short and stocky, mild and self-effacing, a man who seemed to listen with his eyes. He had curly hair, a boyishly shy smile, and a wife and two children. He catered to men used to giving orders, not taking them, but did it with tact, avoiding upbraiding a client needlessly and almost never finding it necessary to save anyone. Neither he nor any client was ever seriously injured on a safari, though there were some close calls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not all shooting and campfire tales. A Selby safari required an army of bearers, cooks, skinners, porters, drivers and others; game licenses and financial transactions; transportation arrangements, from trucks and horses to planes and boats; and a complex coordination of supplies and equipment: guns and ammunition, food, water, tents, cots, radios, medicines, maps, clothing and a thousand other necessities.\n\nWithout cellphones or evacuation helicopters, Mr. Selby had to be the doctor, mechanic, chauffeur, gin-rummy-and-drinking partner and universal guide, knowledgeable about mountain ranges, grassy plains, rivers, jungles, hunting laws, migratory patterns, and the Bushmen, Masai, Samburu, Dinka and Zulu tribes. He spoke three dialects of Swahili. And he improvised; if there was no firewood, he burned wildebeest dung.\n\nHe was no Gregory Peck, but had an easygoing personality that made for good company in the bush. He coped with emergencies, pulling a client clear of a stampede or a vehicle from a bog, treating snakebites or tracking a wounded lion in a thicket \u2014 his most dangerous game. He was left-handed, but his favorite gun was a right-handed .416 Rigby, which can knock down an onrushing bull elephant or Cape buffalo in a thundering instant.\n\nSafaris changed dramatically in his time. In Kenya and Tanganyika in the late 1940s and \u201950s, he took parties hundreds of miles into trackless bush country by truck, pitched camps with comfortable though primitive amenities, drank gin by kerosene lamp, and pursued game by his own instincts. Safaris lasted two or three months. The showers were often cold, but the food was good and the game plentiful.\n\nIn his later years in Botswana, safaris went out for just a few weeks and focused as much, if not more, on photography as on hunting, although Mr. Selby preferred hunters. Photography buffs stayed in hotel-like lodges and went on day trips to scenic sites. More adventurous hunters and photographers were flown to rendezvous points and driven in Land Rovers to fixed camps elaborately equipped with electric power, refrigerators, flush toilets, hot showers, kitchens and dining facilities with silverware and table linen.\n\n\u201cAfrica itself has changed out of all recognition, both physically and politically, and the old-time self-contained safari would have no place to go in today\u2019s Africa,\u201d Mr. Selby wrote for Sports Afield in 2010, when satellite phones, computers and helicopters made life easy for the busy executive on safari.\n\n\u201cThere are hunters today,\u201d he added, \u201cwho would prefer to have experienced the sense of freedom of an old-time safari, as I am sure there were those who went on safari many years ago who would have preferred something along the lines of what is offered today. The two experiences are as different as night is from day; the only feature common to both is the name \u2026 that magical word, \u2018safari.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

When he was 3, his family moved to a 40,000-acre cattle ranch near Mount Kenya.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSurrounded by a game-rich countryside, the boy learned to hunt from an old Kikuyu tribesman. \u201cHe taught me to use my eyes and ears as well as my nose, and to be patient in order to remain motionless for long periods of time waiting for an animal to come within range,\u201d Mr. Selby told The American Rifleman.\n\nMr. Selby attended local schools, traveling by ox cart, and later the Prince of Wales, a boarding school in Nairobi. After World War II, he worked for Mr. Percival, who recognized his potential as a hunter-guide, and in 1949 he joined East Africa\u2019s foremost safari outfitter, Ker & Downey, based in Nairobi. In 1956, after Mr. Ruark\u2019s book had made him famous, he formed his own safari company, Selby & Holmberg.\n\nIn 1953, he married Maria Elizabeth Clulow, known as Miki. They had two children, Mark and Gail. Mark died in 2017. Mr. Selby is survived by his wife, daughter and a number of grandchildren.\n\nIn 1962, as Kenyan independence loomed and political upheavals dimmed prospects for safaris in East Africa, he accepted a partnership in his old company, which became Ker, Downey and Selby, and in 1963 moved as its trailblazer to Bechuanaland, a British protectorate that became independent Botswana in 1966. It was a hunter\u2019s \u2014 and a photographer\u2019s \u2014 paradise.\n\n\u201cWhat we found exceeded our wildest expectations \u2014 a land which the passage of time had passed by, where nature had remained unchanged in the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Selby said in a 2013 interview for this obituary. \u201cThe vast savannas were teeming with huge herds of elephant, buffalo, kudu, zebra, wildebeest and sable. Lions were everywhere, showing little fear of man.\u201d\n\nFor 30 years, Mr. Selby ran company operations in Botswana, and guided hunters and photographers into leased concessions covering thousands of square miles in the Okavango Delta in the north and the vast Kalahari Desert in the south, home of the click-talking Bushmen. He cut tracks and built airfields in the wilderness.\n\nIn 1970, he established Botswana\u2019s first lodge and camps for photographic safaris. He hired guides and a large support staff for what became a dominant safari business in Southern Africa. After Ker, Downey and Selby was bought by Safari South in 1978, he remained a director, and even after resigning in 1993 he continued to lead safaris privately until retiring in 2000.\n\nIn 2007, President Festus Mogae of Botswana awarded Mr. Selby the Presidential Certificate of Honor in recognition of his contributions to hunting and photographic tourism.", "title": "Harry Selby, Renowned Hunter and Safari Guide, Is Dead at 92", "authors": ["Robert D.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "FRUM: Here\u2019s what the Russians have achieved. 1) They blocked from office a capable and effective foreign-policy president who understood them, their aims and how to build effective coalitions against them. 2) They gained a president who for reasons of vanity or worse has left the country vulnerable and exposed to further attack. 3) They gained a president who is smashing apart America\u2019s alliance structures. What intelligent South Korean can look for protection to the United States when its president regularly tweets that it is to China, not the United States, that South Korea should look for protection \u2014 and who is contemplating sacrificing hundreds of thousands of Korean lives to protect mainland U.S.A.? 4) The Russians gained a United States that operates in ways they are comfortable with \u2014 open to corruption and oligarchy \u2014 and they have scored points for the argument that democracy is a joke and a fraud. 5) They have helped install a racial provocateur who identifies every stress point in American political culture and inflames it to the point that the United States polarizes and paralyzes \u2026 I could go on.\n\nDOUTHAT: That the Russians have gained a president who may be seriously endangering America\u2019s broad position in the world I don\u2019t dispute. My argument is just that, so far, your intelligent South Korean could look at the actual moves made by the American state and persuade themselves \u2014 as many world leaders have seemingly persuaded themselves \u2014 that they should act as though McMaster and James Mattis and a few others are really running foreign policy, and the official president\u2019s tweets are so much sound and fury. Likewise an intelligent Pole or Hungarian or Ukrainian, trying to make choices in the shadow of Putin\u2019s ambitions: You just don\u2019t see the kind of dramatic steps, with NATO or anything else, that would suggest that Trump is substantially changing American policy. Which is why despite our agreement about Trump\u2019s character and competence, my general level of alarm has lowered somewhat since his inauguration, and is currently lower than your own.\n\nFRUM: The United States is a big bureaucratic state. Change more often comes to the United States by changing the content of the American state than by changing its forms. For example, the Constitution contemplates a cabinet system of government, with the principal officers confirmed by the Senate. Yet the chief of staff and the national security adviser, two positions never contemplated by the Constitution, matter more than any cabinet officer. On constitutional democracy\u2019s periodic upswings, we develop expectations about how the president should behave that exceed the law \u2014 e.g., no Franklin Roosevelt Jr.\u2019s doing shady deals from the White House \u2014 and we go into reverse on the downswing. Trump has not changed any law or policy about presidential financial integrity. He\u2019s just ignored customs (publish his tax returns), rendered other laws meaningless (financial disclosures that conceal things the public most needs to know, e.g., the upstream debts of the Trump Organization) and simply defied other laws by official lying (the endless misstatements by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and the nation\u2019s de facto chief foreign affairs officer).\n\nDOUTHAT: I agree; this is a definite downswing, a return of certain kinds of presidential sordidness and their exacerbation on certain fronts. But part of what\u2019s been striking about the Trump era to me is how much its events have confirmed trends that are bigger than Trump, that he benefited from during his ascent and that loom larger to me as symptoms of continuing crisis than most of the specific policy moves he\u2019s attempted. In particular, the paralysis of Congress, it\u2019s abdication of power to the presidency and its inability to function as a legislative body \u2014 plus the ideological sclerosis of the Republican Party, its collapse into an entertainment-wing-driven grift \u2014 these have been defining features of life under President Trump, as they were under President Obama before him. Were Trump an effective authoritarian, he could use these features of our politics to claim new powers and execute unilaterally on grand ambitions \u2014 as both of the last two presidents, on matters of war and peace and domestic policy, attempted and sometimes succeeded in doing. But his ineffectiveness so far means that the pre-existing crisis in how the presidency and the legislative branch relate to each other, and how the G.O.P. all functions, is still percolating, but not necessarily becoming dramatically more dire.\n\nFRUM: Your use of the word \u201cunilaterally\u201d casts a useful clarifying light on what may be the foundation of our disagreement. Let me be very clear what I do not mean by \u201cTrumpocracy,\u201d at least not yet: Caesarism. The authoritarian-nationalist system Trump is building is not being built against Congress, but with Congress \u2014 and even more, with Republican Parties at the state level. The big reveal to Republicans in the second Obama term, continuing now into the first Trump term, is that you and Reihan Salam and Ramesh Ponnuru and Henry Olsen and other \u201creformicons\u201d were right on the politics of Paul Ryan-style conservatism: Such politics simply could not prevail in a free and fair democratic contest. You and they (and me, too) assumed, or at least hoped, that Paul Ryan\u2019s party would respond to this better-late-than-never recognition of the obvious by moderating their policies.

Researchers have studied the ways complexity can reduce sign-ups for workplace pension plans, participation in food stamps and turnout in elections, he noted. \u201cThese sorts of little barriers are ways in which humans get tripped up all the time when they\u2019re trying to do something that might benefit them.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever forgotten to pay a bill on time, or struggled to assemble all the necessary forms of identification before heading to the D.M.V., is likely to sympathize with how administrative hurdles can stymie someone. But these may be especially daunting for the poor, who tend to have less stable work schedules and less access to resources that can simplify compliance: reliable transportation, a bank account, internet access. There is also a lot of research about the Medicaid program, specifically, that shows that sign-ups fall when states make their program more complicated.\n\nThe Kentucky program won\u2019t just create a work requirement for some beneficiaries; it will set up a broader obstacle course of administrative rules. Many beneficiaries will be asked to pay monthly premiums to the state to retain their coverage, as little as $1 a month for some very poor families, who are unlikely to have bank accounts.\n\nThey will be asked to notify Medicaid officials any time their income changes. Their benefits could rise or fall depending on whether they get an annual checkup, or take a financial literacy course. Beneficiaries who fail to renew their coverage promptly at the end of a year will be locked out for as long as six months. Beneficiaries who are \u201cmedically frail\u201d can get an exemption from the work requirement, but they will need to submit a doctor\u2019s note.\n\nKentucky officials argue that the changes will give beneficiaries more dignity and promote personal responsibility. But they also estimate that around 100,000 fewer people will be enrolled in the program by the end of five years.

So when they declared it a legal interception of an American military incursion, American leaders, who knew this to be false, assumed Soviet leaders were lying.

State officials said that residents here would have as little as 12 minutes to find shelter once an alert was issued.\n\nWithin moments of the first announcement, people flocked to shelters, crowding highways in scenes of terror and helplessness.

It was the military \u2014 not Hawaiian officials \u2014 that was the first to declare there was no evidence of a missile launch.\n\nThe false alert was a stark reminder of what happens when the old realities of the nuclear age collide with the speed \u2014 and the potential for error \u2014 inherent in the internet age. The alert came at one of the worst possible moments \u2014 when tension with North Korea has been at one of the highest points in decades, and when Mr. Kim\u2019s government has promised more missile tests and threatened an atmospheric nuclear test.\n\nDuring the Cold War there were many false alarms. William J. Perry, the defense secretary during the Clinton administration, recalled in his memoir, \u201cMy Journey at the Nuclear Brink,\u201d a moment in 1979 when, as an under secretary of defense, he was awakened by a watch officer who reported that his computer system was showing 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles headed to the United States. \u201cFor one heart-stopping second I thought my worst nuclear nightmare had come true,\u201d Mr. Perry wrote.\n\nIt turned out that a training tape had been mistakenly inserted into an early-warning system computer. No one woke up the president. But Mr. Perry went on to speculate what might have happened if such a warning had come \u201cduring the Cuban Missile Crisis or a Mideast war?\u201d\n\nThe United States faces an especially difficult problem today, not just because of tense relations with North Korea but also because of growing fears inside the military about the cyber vulnerability of the nuclear warning system and nuclear control systems.\n\nBecause of its location, Hawaii \u2014 more than any other part of the United States \u2014 has been threatened by escalating tensions and the risks of war, and preparations have already begun there.\n\nOn Friday, the day before the erroneous alert, several hundred people attended an event in Honolulu sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in which military commanders, politicians and others discussed the threat to the islands\u2019 population.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the designated recipient \u2014 and that\u2019s because we are public enemy No. 1 to North Korea,\u201d Dan Leaf, a retired Air Force lieutenant general and Pacific Command deputy commander, was quoted as saying in The Honolulu Star Advertiser.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Hawaii Emergency Management Agency has been holding \u201care you ready\u201d drills. As a chain of islands, Hawaii is subject to all kinds of threats \u2014 hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis \u2014 but officials have made clear that none is more urgent now than the threat of an attack by North Korea, given how little time there would be between an alert and the detonation of a bomb.\n\nThe fifth page of an emergency preparation pamphlet issued by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency features a picture of a rocket lifting off: \u201cNuclear Threat \u2014 Unlikely But Cannot Ignore It.\u201d\n\nVern T. Miyagi, the administrator of the agency, said that during the drill, an employee \u2014 whom he did not identify \u2014 mistakenly pushed a button on a computer screen to send out the alert, rather than one marked to test it. He said the employee answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked by the system if he was sure he wanted to send the message.\n\nMr. Miyagi, going through a detailed timeline of the events at an afternoon news conference, said the agency tried to correct the error on social media. It took 38 minutes to send out a follow-up message canceling the original alert, which he acknowledged was a shortcoming with the alert system that the agency would fix.\n\nMr. Rapoza said he did not know if anyone would be disciplined for the mistake. \u201cAt this point, our major concern is to make sure we do what we need to do to reassure the public,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a time for pointing fingers.\u201d\n\nThe panic that followed the alert \u2014 if relatively short-lived \u2014 gripped the islands. There were reports of people seeking shelter by parking their cars inside a highway tunnel that cuts through a mountain. When the announcement was rescinded, a digital highway sign read: \u201cMissile alert in error: There is no threat.\u201d\n\nPeople in Hawaii tend to know what to do to protect themselves to threats of a tsunami or a hurricane. The prospect of nuclear annihilation was entirely new terrain.\n\n\u201cSo this was the most terrifying few minutes of my LIFE!\u201d Paul Wilson, a professor at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, said on Twitter. \u201cI just want to know why it took 38 minutes to announce it was a mistake?!?\u201d\n\nChris Tacker, a veteran who lives in Kealakekua, said the mistake had left her angry and frustrated.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know where to go,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone try to dig a hole in lava?

{"date": "2018-01-13 00:00:00", "text": "Webster\u2019s career lasted from 1974 to 1990, ending just before the advent of free agency and the massive increase in N.F.L. salaries it sparked. After Webster retired, his declining health, escalating medical bills, long slide into dementia and years of wandering the country took a toll on Garrett Webster, his three siblings and their mother, Pam.\n\nShe exhausted her savings long ago. She lives off credit cards, Social Security and an annuity. Unable to afford a home, she has spent the past five years staying with friends and family. Careful not to overstay her welcome, she traveled during one six-week stretch to Pittsburgh, the West Coast, Minnesota, Wisconsin and then back to Pittsburgh, where she stays with Garrett.\n\nThrough it all, she and her four children have continued a fight to receive a multimillion-dollar award from the N.F.L.\u2019s concussion settlement with retired players.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs a part of the settlement, the N.F.L. agreed to make compensation payments that will stretch into the millions to retired players with severe cognitive and neurological problems. On paper, at least, the Websters should receive nearly $3 million based on his age at the time of the diagnosis, 50, and the number of years he played in the N.F.L., 17. The criteria are an attempt to gauge how long players were exposed to head trauma and how directly that exposure could be linked to health problems: Younger players are paid more on the presumption that football, not old age, caused their problems.\n\nTo the Websters\u2019 dismay, they found out after the settlement agreement was announced that Iron Mike, as he was known in Pittsburgh, was not automatically part of it. That\u2019s because the deal excludes players who died before Jan. 1, 2006.\n\nThe N.F.L. pushed for a cutoff date to prevent a stream of families from filing claims for long-deceased fathers and husbands. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers ultimately agreed on 2006, which allowed more families to file claims, but was far enough back that it excluded the families of players who died before then from bringing wrongful-death and other suits against the league.\n\nThe Websters and other families in their position still have a glimmer of hope. The federal judge in the case, Anita B. Brody, left open a legal window for families of players who died before 2006 that their lawyers hope to utilize. Jason Luckasevic, the lawyer for the Websters, needs to show that the family still has the right to file a legal case against the league under their state\u2019s statute of limitations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChristopher Seeger, a co-lead counsel for the retired players who sued the league, declined to be interviewed on the phone. In an email, he explained that some players objected to the 2006 cutoff date, but without a settlement that at least captured players dating to 2006, many more would face the same stringent limitations as the Websters.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe 2006 cutoff date \u201cis the result of hard-fought negotiations between the parties,\u201d he wrote in court filings in 2015. \u201cHad the plaintiffs not secured this provision, claimants on behalf of all deceased class members would have had to show that their claims were timely.\u201d\n\nThe exclusion applies to players who died from all diseases covered by the settlement, including A.L.S. and Parkinson\u2019s disease. But it is a particularly crushing blow to the Websters and to the families of two other former Steelers, Terry Long and Justin Strzelczyk, who also died before 2006 and received the same posthumous diagnosis Mike Webster did. They spent many years listening to league officials question any connection between playing football and a degenerative brain condition, before 2016, when the N.F.L. grudgingly acknowledged a link between football and the disease.\n\n\u201cIf you asked the 20,000 retirees who are part of the class, they would say Mike Webster should be paid first,\u201d Mr. Luckasevic said.\n\nThe league and the administrator for the settlement say that despite early hiccups and the need to weed out fraudulent claims, the process is operating as intended. More than $150 million has been awarded and many hundreds of other claims are being evaluated.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the concussion settlement is proceeding as the parties and the court intended,\u201d Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman, said.\n\nPhoto\n\nJo-Ann M. Verrier, who was appointed by the judge to help resolve complicated cases, said there were about 40 claims filed by the families of players who died before 2006 that have the potential to set legal precedent. That means she must make sure to create a process to evaluate them fairly. Once that process is completed, the other special master, Wendell Pritchett, will begin to rule on the claims, which will be reviewed on a first-come-first-served basis.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a process where we can decide on these issues once and for all,\u201d Ms. Verrier said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGarrett Webster, though, is losing his patience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane that we haven\u2019t been paid because every suit uses my dad in their case,\u201d he said. Mr. Webster, who wore a Steelers sweatshirt to a sandwich shop here on a recent afternoon, sat near pictures of his father and other Steelers players on the walls. \u201cIf Mike Webster doesn\u2019t happen, this case doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added.\n\nSitting in a booth next to her son, picking at a salad, Pam Webster said she and her children were used to delays. Starting in the late-1990s, Mike Webster and his lawyers spent years fighting for full disability benefits. After he died, a court finally ruled against the league\u2019s disability board. That provided a hollow victory. The Websters are also seeking a so-called Legacy Benefit payment that the N.F.L. pays to families of deceased players. That is not likely to amount to more than a few thousand dollars per month.\n\nAn award in the concussion settlement could provide the Websters with a financial shot in the arm when they really need it. While Pam Webster travels from home to home, Garrett Webster has remained in Pittsburgh, where he lived with his father in his final years.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth Webster daughters, Brooke, 41, and Hillie, 30, have been treated for substance abuse. Pam Webster said those problems were a result of the stress of seeing their father\u2019s life disintegrate after his N.F.L. career. Her other son, Colin, 38, was in the military. He has kept football at arm\u2019s length for years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way it was supposed to end,\u201d Pam Webster said.\n\nAfter Mike Webster retired in 1990, he moved his family to Wisconsin, where he and Pam grew up. But after some poor financial decisions they lost their house. Webster occasionally made money when his friend Sunny Jani found him gigs signing autographs.\n\nTo help pay the bills, Pam Webster went to work at a restaurant, then became a personal care assistant after she found out the family had lost their health insurance. Mike Webster drifted through Pittsburgh, Wisconsin and places in between. Their marriage fell apart.\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with the Steelers is complicated. At times, the team helped its former player and his family. At other times, especially after his behavior became unpredictable, the organization kept its distance. In November, the team invited Pam and Garrett Webster to a ceremony honoring team legends during a home game. It was the first time she attended a game since 2002, when the Steelers honored her husband after his death.\n\nThey now proudly show off cellphone pictures of the steel football they received that day. They are careful to say they do not resent the Steelers. They want only what they believe the league owes them. Through a spokesman, the Steelers declined to comment on the settlement claim.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t hate football, we just are upset about Mike,\u201d Pam Webster said. But she added: \u201cEvery time we step forward, it\u2019s three steps back. One minute he\u2019s remembered, and one minute he\u2019s forgotten.\u201d", "title": "He Helped Ex-Players Get Benefits.

He was later told, without explanation, that his employment agreement had not been renewed, internal agency emails show.\n\nMr. Edelman has now filed a complaint with the Energy Department\u2019s inspector general and, according to his lawyer, is seeking protections provided to federal whistle-blowers. On its website, the Energy Department notes that it is illegal to retaliate against whistle-blowers, who are typically protected when they alert a supervisor or the inspector general to information that they reasonably believe to constitute an abuse of authority, or other misconduct.\n\nIn the complaint, Mr. Edelman accuses the agency of retaliation and asks for his job back or at least to recover his laptop and other personal belongings. In addition, Mr. Edelman accused a former colleague of encouraging him to delete the photos of Mr. Perry and Mr. Murray, which Mr. Edelman and his lawyer argue are public records.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Energy Department declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding Mr. Edelman\u2019s employment, the status of the photos or the details of his complaint, but a spokeswoman characterized his accusations as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Mr. Edelman supported his complaint with emails and other documents, but some claims were based on his statements alone.\n\n\u201cThey are based on his own subjective opinions and personal agenda,\u201d the spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, said in an email. \u201cIndustry and other stakeholders visit the Department of Energy on a daily basis. The secretary welcomes their input and feedback to strengthen the American energy sector. This meeting was no different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Murray said the coal executive \u201cdoes not have a recollection as to the exact statements allegedly made nearly a year ago.\u201d The spokesman, Gary Broadbent, added that \u201cMr. Murray has frequently said that the Trump administration must advance reliable and low-cost electricity for all Americans and protect coal mining jobs.\u201d\n\nThe confidential documents Mr. Murray brought to his meeting with Mr. Perry called for \u201crescinding anti-coal regulations of the Obama administration\u201d and cutting the staff of the Environmental Protection Agency \u201cin at least half,\u201d according to portions visible in Mr. Edelman\u2019s photographs.\n\nLast week, The New York Times obtained a copy of a separate memo written by Mr. Murray, and reported that the Trump administration had completed or was on track to fulfill most of the 16 policy and regulatory requests contained in it. Mr. Murray told The Times the two memos essentially covered the same material.\n\nMr. Edelman, a Democrat, came to the Energy Department under President Barack Obama two years ago after producing videos at a consulting firm in Chicago and serving as creative director for the electoral campaign of former Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Edelman said, he received greater responsibility, including photographing Mr. Perry\u2019s meetings.\n\nMr. Edelman\u2019s complaint offers a behind-the-scenes look at the meeting on March 29 between Mr. Perry and Mr. Murray, who have been friendly for many years. In addition to his company contributing $300,000 to the president\u2019s inauguration \u2014 and personally holding a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump during the campaign \u2014 Mr. Murray has been a financial backer of Mr. Perry, a former governor of Texas who has also run for president.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Murray\u2019s spokesman said the company had supported Republicans \u201cwho have been staunch defenders of the United States coal industry, and the jobs and family livelihoods that depend on it, and low-cost, reliable, fuel secure electricity for all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe meeting started, the complaint said, with Mr. Perry giving Mr. Murray \u201ca deep bear hug.\u201d Once they got down to business, Mr. Murray presented the memo. \u201cThis needs to be done,\u201d the complaint says Mr. Murray insisted.\n\nMr. Perry replied, \u201cI think we can help you with this,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nRattled by the exchange, Mr. Edelman said he stayed for about 15 minutes to keep listening, until he drew the attention of an agency official. \u201cHow much does a photographer need of us just sitting around?\u201d the complaint quotes the agency official as asking.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Climate Fwd: Sign up for our newsletter to get our latest stories about climate change \u2014 along with answers to your questions and tips on how to help.

The cover page of Mr. Murray\u2019s memo described a plan \u201cto assist in the survival of our country\u2019s coal industry, which is essential to power grid reliability.\u201d\n\nMr. Edelman said he decided to share the photos with the news media \u2014 The Washington Post published the images after In These Times \u2014 hoping to derail Mr. Perry\u2019s proposed rule. The rule faced opposition from a cross section of environmental groups, energy companies, free-market advocates and former regulators, and last week, the energy commission rejected it.\n\nMr. Murray has said that the meeting with Mr. Perry was primarily about the need to study the resilience of the power grid, not to ask for specific actions by the energy commission or other arms of the federal government. Mr. Broadbent, his spokesman, said that \u201ca word-for-word comparison\u201d of the proposed rule and Mr. Murray\u2019s action plan \u201creveals that they have only two words in common.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Dec. 7, the day after In These Times posted the photographs, and a day before they appeared online at The Washington Post, Mr. Edelman said he was summoned by his boss and told he was being placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe agency later declined to extend his two-year employment agreement, which ended late last year, effectively dismissing him despite previously agreeing to extend him for two more years, Mr. Edelman said.\n\nA security officer for the agency also refused to allow him to pack up certain personal belongings, Mr. Edelman said, including his laptop and camera equipment. The next day, a supervisor instructed Mr. Edelman in an email to provide the agency the administrative rights to the Google Drive folder where he stored the photos, according to a copy of the email reviewed by The Times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeparately, another colleague warned him over the phone that \u201cwe can come to your home and have someone watch you delete it,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. Mr. Edelman did not record the call.\n\nIn a phone call a few days later, which was recorded, the colleague reiterated that Mr. Edelman needed to transfer ownership of the folder. \u201cI would suggest that doing it sooner rather than later would probably be a good thing for you,\u201d the colleague said, according to the recording, which was heard by The Times.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou can get access to a computer,\u201d the colleague added, \u201ceven if you need to go to a freaking library to do it.\u201d\n\nMr. Edelman said the department had still not returned his laptop. Among the other items he said he left behind because of the hurried exit: a cake from his colleagues celebrating his 35th birthday.\n\nMr. Edelman hired a lawyer, John Tye, a former whistle-blower from the State Department who works at Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit firm. Mr. Tye defended Mr. Edelman\u2019s decision to keep the photos, arguing that they were \u201cin the public domain\u201d and were not classified, and that they had been stored on Mr. Edelman\u2019s private drive at the Energy Department\u2019s instruction.\n\nBy filing his complaint with the inspector general, Mr. Tye said, Mr. Edelman was seeking protections provided to federal whistle-blowers, including prohibition from \u201cadverse employment actions and dismissal.\u201d\n\nAfter Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, heard about the incident, his office contacted Mr. Edelman, who also shared the complaint with Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who is a neighbor in Washington. It was Mr. Whitehouse who shared the separate memo by Murray Energy with The Times.\n\n\u201cFederal employees should not be fired for doing their jobs,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe Department of Energy must investigate as to why Mr. Edelman was fired.\u201d", "title": "He Leaked a Photo of Rick Perry Hugging a Coal Executive.

I\u2019ll wait.\u2019 Because I wanted a storybook love affair.\u201d\n\nBut after she and Mr. Nelson had gone on four dates, \u201che asked me if we could have a committed relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI had read all these books about how to have a relationship, and there\u2019s a process. I didn\u2019t want it to happen so fast.\u201d\n\nStill, there was no denying she was falling in love.\n\nMs. Edwards, her friend, picked up on it immediately. \u201cI went out with them several times, and every time she talked to Fred she would use her LaToya Jackson-whisper voice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all baby-sweetie. They took off so fast.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McKenzie recalls the couple holding hands when he first met Ms. Cartwright. \u201cI was like, man, you\u2019re 50, not 15,\u201d he said.\n\nWithin months of their first date, Mr. Nelson was bringing Ms. Cartwright to concerts he conducted for Ms. Franklin in cities including Indianapolis and Detroit, and Ms. Cartwright was thinking long term. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll give him two years to give me a ring,\u201d she said. \u201cI was praying to God. I wanted us to be empty nesters together.\u201d After a year she grew impatient: \u201cHe told me several times he wanted to marry me. I never said it to him, but I started thinking, Why doesn\u2019t he put his money where his mouth is?\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2016, a year before their wedding day, he did. Between gigs in the waning months of 2016, Mr. Nelson and Mr. McKenzie had gone ring shopping in Chicago. As Ms. Cartwright ordered her second chocolate martini that night at Joe\u2019s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab, Mr. Nelson excused himself and went to his car, where he had left the princess-cut diamond solitaire ring that he and Mr. McKenzie had picked out.\n\nMr. Nelson said, \u201cI could tell she was getting tipsy, and I thought, Oh, God,\u201d but by the time he returned she had taken only a sip. He asked her to marry him from across the table. Ms. Cartwright, reserved even under the spell of a martini, quietly said yes. A flurry of waiters clapped, and they were engaged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe couple chose to get married in a simple ceremony just after regular Sunday morning services.

Before Dr. Felder, the officiant, completed a short, traditional marriage ceremony, there was a musical interlude: the platinum-selling gospel artist Percy Bady, who has known Mr. Nelson for more than 20 years, performed an original composition, \u201cLove Never Dies,\u201d on keyboard.

After many other large insurers abandoned the individual market created by the federal law and as President Trump has sought to dismantle the law, Centene doubled-down and has become one of the largest insurers still offering policies.\n\nBut the lawsuit underscores a critical question about whether Centene offers plans that provide its customers with access to the level of care required under the law. The suit claims that many doctors won\u2019t accept patients covered by Centene because of the company\u2019s refusal to pay legitimate claims.\n\nAs insurers like Centene have relied on smaller networks to control costs and better manage the care of patients, consumer advocates have raised concerns about whether some plans offered under the law provide sufficient access to doctors and hospitals. The law requires plans to meet certain minimum requirements.\n\nThe lawsuit recounts numerous examples of patients unable to find in-network doctors. In Washington State, Cynthia Harvey was billed for hundreds of dollars in medical costs after she discovered some of her care was out of network. When Ms. Harvey went to the emergency room last year, she was billed $1,544 by the doctor, and the lawsuit claims Centene had no emergency physicians participating in its network in the Spokane area at the time.\n\nThe insurer also denied some of the claims from a colonoscopy she had because she was at high risk for cancer, according to the lawsuit. Ms. Harvey successfully appealed many of the denials to state regulators, the lawsuit said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

State officials said they received more than 140 complaints from people who had trouble finding a doctor, particularly a specialist like an anesthesiologist, who accepted the insurance or from individuals who received a surprise bill after they received treatment.\n\nIn a statement about the consent order the company reached with the state to be allowed to continue selling policies for 2018, Centene said it was committed to addressing \u201cknown issues in our network in select regions of the state\u201d and said it had taken actions to make sure its customers had access to services.\n\nThe company announced this week that it now covers more than 1.4 million people through the state marketplaces, with its chief executive, Michael F. Neidorff, describing its growth in the market as \u201cso dramatic.\u201d Centene attributes some of its success to its experience providing care under the Medicaid program or in its low-cost networks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSteven A. Milman, a periodontist in Round Rock, Tex., who is one of the plaintiffs, signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan from Centene last year. He and his wife paid about $1,200 a month. Dr. Milman had a previous policy from UnitedHealth Group. \u201cThey had a good panel of doctors and easy access,\u201d Dr. Milman said in a telephone interview. But UnitedHealth lost money in the market and stopped selling policies.\n\nChoosing between the local Blue Cross plan and one offered by Centene, Dr. Milman picked Centene after seeing that its network included a large medical group in Austin and getting recommendations for several doctors at that group. \u201cI bought Centene on that promise,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Dr. Milman soon found out finding a doctor within the network was much harder than he anticipated. The medical group he had picked was no longer in the network. When he called the doctor\u2019s office assigned to him by Centene, it turned out to be a obstetrician/gynecologist.\n\nDr. Milman\u2019s wife had no better luck. When she came down with an earache, she was on the phone with the plan for five hours before being sent to a clinic where she was treated by a nurse.\n\nBy the summer, Dr. Milman was fed up. He continued to see the doctor he had under the UnitedHealth plan, paying out of pocket for the visits.

His father, Max, was a jeweler, and his mother, the former Hetty Frank, was a homemaker.\n\nMr. Schmertz grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Union College, in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1952 and a bachelor of laws from Columbia University in 1955. (He added a doctor of laws degree from Union in 1977.)\n\nHe did intelligence work in the Army in Washington from 1955 to 1957, then worked for the American Arbitration Association before becoming an organizer for John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign in 1960.\n\nThat work led to a lifelong association with the Kennedy family and, once Robert F. Kennedy became his brother\u2019s attorney general, a job as general counsel to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.\n\nMr. Schmertz joined Mobil in 1966 as a labor lawyer, but took a leave two years later to work on Robert Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign; he would take another to work on Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign in 1979.\n\nHe took charge of Mobil\u2019s public affairs department in 1969 and filled that role almost continuously until leaving Mobil in 1988 to form his own company. For most of that stretch he had the title of vice president and played a significant role in shaping the company\u2019s policies.\n\nCritical of the news media, Mr. Schmertz advocated what he called creative confrontation \u2014 a markedly different approach from that of most companies, which tried to do their influencing behind the scenes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFor a long time, business and business leaders didn\u2019t feel it was part of their responsibility\u201d to make their voices and opinions heard, he told United Press International in 1986. They believed, he continued, \u201cthat if they ignored unfair criticism it would go away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added, \u201cI believe you should meet it head on and deal with it.\u201d\n\nTo do just that, in October 1970, Mr. Schmertz began buying space on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times to express the company\u2019s views in essay form. Sometimes the essays responded to the news of the moment; other times they addressed broader issues, like mass transit. They advertorials appeared in other newspapers as well, and Mr. Schmertz made scores of television appearances.\n\nHis methods and visibility brought him all sorts of labels \u2014 \u201cMobil\u2019s superflack,\u201d \u201cthe Billy Martin of corporate P.R.\u201d and, as the headline on a New York magazine profile of him put it, \u201cOil Slick.\u201d\n\nPolitically, Mr. Schmertz was hard to pin down; in addition to working on the Kennedys\u2019 campaigns, he helped Bob Dole, the Republican senator from Kansas, in his 1988 presidential run. Mr. Schmertz often said that his public-relations philosophy was nothing more than applying the sharp-elbowed lessons of politics to the business world.\n\nHe once pulled Mobil advertising from The Wall Street Journal in a dispute over coverage. In 1986 he laid down his ideas and war stories in a book, \u201cGoodbye to the Low Profile: The Art of Creative Confrontation,\u201d written with William Novak.\n\nYet many in the public-relations business thought his blustery approach did as much harm as good.\n\n\u201cTo go out and argue with people in public, it\u2019s like seeing two people fighting in the street,\u201d Richard Cheney, another public relations executive, told The Washington Post in 1988. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to take sides, you just want them to stop.\u201d\n\nThe less flashy pillar of Mr. Schmertz\u2019s philosophy was what he called \u201caffinity of purpose\u201d \u2014 getting policymakers and the public to have a presumptive good opinion of your company by associating it with high-minded things like \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d (now known simply as \u201cMasterpiece\u201d). Countless viewers heard the phrase \u201cmade possible by a grant from Mobil\u201d as they tuned in \u201cThe First Churchills,\u201d \u201cI, Claudius\u201d and other British productions presented by \u201cMasterpiece,\u201d an anthology series produced by WGBH in Boston.\n\nBecause of its support from Mobil and other oil companies, PBS was sometimes called the Petroleum Broadcasting Service in those early years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCultural excellence generally suggests corporate excellence,\u201d Mr. Schmertz told New York magazine, explaining the millions of dollars Mobil put into arts ventures.\n\nAmong his clients after he formed his own company was the World Bank, which hired him in 1994 to try to improve its image.\n\nMr. Schmertz and his first wife, the former Ida Schaap, were divorced in 1976. His second marriage, to the former Susan Burley, ended in divorce in 1993.

(Those include cuffs, paddles, blindfolds and feathers, if rarely actual sex, according to Simone Justice, a pro-domme and BDSM educator in California.) Political applications of BDSM make sense when you consider the gender roles that trap women in submissive societal positions are the same as those locking men in sexually dominant ones \u2014 which lead men to dominatrixes, to escape, said Ms. Storm: \u201cWomen are socialized to be submissive little kittens. Men think they have to be some kind of alpha male.\u201d\n\nSeveral attendees were hesitant to give their names for this article, fearing friends\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 reactions. \u201cIf they caught wind I did a class with a dominatrix, I\u2019d be a laughingstock,\u201d said one 39-year-old investment bank vice president.

Neither is inherently superior. \u201cIf I\u2019m in control of you, my attention is outward, so precisely fixed on the other person that I almost forget I exist,\u201d Ms. Urbaniak told the audience.

It\u2019s a post-gender outlook, with as much in common with theories of performativity as with women\u2019s empowerment programs like the Makers Conference and Lean In, which focus on elite communities as a way to tap female power.\n\nDemographically, though, the Academy is similar to those peers. The participants I spoke with said most of the students are straight and cisgender (25 percent are nonwhite, according to the company), although the school is open to anyone who identifies as a woman.

I put $10 in each bag so the freshened-up lady can get a cup of coffee and a muffin. While I wait for the items to arrive, I case my Union Square neighborhood.

Or maybe she\u2019ll be one of those people who writes a play about being homeless a few years later.\u201d\n\nI widen my search to Grand Central. The few women I see seem to be in no shape to care for themselves. One is wearing a blue bunny costume and is seated next to a stack of garbage bags filled with clothing and magazines.

She may be a hustler, but if sitting on the sidewalk in December is the best way she\u2019s got to make a buck, it\u2019s a pretty bleak hustle. And she\u2019s age appropriate and I\u2019m tired.

There are no homeless people on the train or the street. Then, returning downtown, just past the gate of the 67th Street subway station, I spot someone. He or she is wearing a dark parka and a black face mask and holding a coffee cup with a few bills, and is asking for change. I think the voice is female but with the face covered I\u2019m not sure.

Mrs. Clinton said she did not want to, and instead he remained on her staff.\n\nMs. Doyle was fired shortly after that in a staff shake-up in response to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s third-place finish in the 2008 Iowa caucuses.

Then, of course, comes the question of whether Clinton lost because she was a woman. The answer is: sort of. Her gender was both a handicap and an enormous selling point. Would the Democrats have wanted Harry Clinton to be their nominee? (Just try to construct a Harry Clinton in your mind. I dare you.)\n\nAnd \u2014 wait a minute, don\u2019t get depressed. There\u2019s another side: Even if her sex was a problem, it allowed her to transform the country more than many men who won the job. While losing, she made it normal for women to run for the most powerful office on the planet.\n\nThis is critical. Look at all the breakthroughs women have made in the last century, and you\u2019ll notice how many of them involved just making their presence in some new place seem matter of fact. All that pain and struggle to win the right to vote, and what did it get us short term? Warren Harding. But long term, it created a world where the big gubernatorial election in Virginia was analyzed in terms of women in the suburbs and that knockout Senate race in Alabama was pretty much all about black women streaming to the polls.\n\nOr take a more modest example. There was a time \u2014 not all that long ago \u2014 when television executives believed a woman could not be the solo anchor on the national evening news because our voices didn\u2019t convey the proper sense of authority. Then in 2006, Katie Couric took over at CBS, to great hubbub and commentary. She did fine. Life moved on. In 2009 Diane Sawyer became the anchor at ABC. She did fine. There was barely a peep. The great triumph actually did not arrive until everybody found the whole matter boring.\n\nNow, when people handicap the next Democratic presidential nomination, there are lots of women in the mix \u2014 Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand. (And, O.K., Oprah.) Whoever runs, the important thing is that primary debates will no longer resemble Shriner conventions. Women will be all over the place. Soon, they\u2019ll be half the big decision-makers. It will be normal.\n\nWhen Hillary Rodham Clinton graduated from law school and started her career, virtually the only women who had made it into the Senate were either honorary appointees for a brief symbolic term (the first, Rebecca Latimer Felton, got one day) or a senator\u2019s widow. The exceptions proved the rule. The great Margaret Chase Smith came from the House, where she had succeeded her dead husband. Nancy Kassebaum happened to be the daughter of the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon.\n\nYou get the idea. And there was Hillary. On the one hand, another political wife. On another, a marker for the entire country, driving home the fact that Congress was never going to be just a guy thing again. At times of despair I like to recall that when she was sworn into the Senate in 2001, my little niece watched the coverage intensely, and asked my sister whether it was possible for men to be senators, too.\n\nCampaigning in 2000, almost everywhere Clinton went, she drew enthusiastic crowds. Partly, they were there to see the first-lady-turned-candidate, the one who had come through more disasters than the Titanic. Partly they were already imagining their party\u2019s next standard-bearer. But nobody seemed more excited than women around her own age, who turned out in droves, no matter how unpleasant the weather or remote the spot. I always thought they saw her and thought about second chances: If you put in the time as a stay-at-home mother or took non-dream jobs because of all the responsibilities at home, you could still move on at midlife to something new and totally terrific.

In June 2016, Mr. and Mrs. Palinkas paid $604,000 for a three-bedroom house in a gated 55-plus section there, after selling a 3,800-square-foot Country Classics house they bought in 1997 for $430,000.\n\nYounger families are also discovering Hillsborough.

The town\u2019s most distinguishing marker, however, is the line that runs down its middle, Route 206.\n\nThis north-south highway is the commercial spine of Hillsborough, with numerous shopping plazas, big-box stores, and individual and chain restaurants lining both sides. It is also the bane of many drivers\u2019 existence as they crawl from one intersection to the next on a busy Saturday afternoon.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnce meant to be a two-lane highway serving New Jersey\u2019s more rural areas, the stretch of Route 206 between Somerville and Princeton has become a major thoroughfare as towns like Hillsborough and neighboring Montgomery become increasingly populated. Plans to build a Route 206 bypass have been in the works since 1974, and a stretch of that 1.66-mile bypass was built in the early 2010s, but the project was halted in 2015 because of local opposition and a lack of funding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHillsborough Deputy Mayor Gloria McCauley said the project is scheduled to resume in 2018, and will hopefully be completed by 2020. By then, Ms. McCauley said, Hillsborough should be \u201cbetter able to compete for business against bigger towns like Bridgewater and Somerville.\u201d\n\nFor now, the highway serves as an unofficial dividing line, with larger properties, including older working farms, occupying the west side, and most of the newer homes, including the Country Classics development, on the east side. The more concentrated multifamily housing is found in the central and north sections of town.\n\nJacqueline Haren, an agent with Coldwell Banker who has owned three homes in Hillsborough, said that besides the school system, buyers are drawn to Hillsborough for its inclusiveness and diversity. \u201cThere\u2019s a great sense of community \u2014 there are tons of sports programs, all run by volunteers,\u201d said Ms. Haren, who volunteered as the Pop Warner cheerleading coach for seven years.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\n\nThere are currently 116 properties on the market in Hillsborough, about a third of which are townhouses or condominiums, according to Karl von Loewe, an associate broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Hillsborough.\n\nThe median selling price of homes in 2017 was $318,000, down from $335,000 in 2016. Mr. von Loewe attributed the drop to increased activity at the lower end of the market last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

Would it be changed beyond recognition by such a director? And, of prime concern to dance-goers and dancers alike: Can the company continue in its dual capacity as the world leader in new choreography and the foremost exponent of the Balanchine-Robbins repertory?\n\nSince Dec. 9, after Mr. Martins took a leave of absence, the day-to-day artistic direction of City Ballet has been in the hands of an impressively young foursome: Craig Hall and Rebecca Krohn (ballet masters), Mr. Peck and Jonathan Stafford (a former principal now on the school\u2019s faculty). The company also has an executive director, Katherine E. Brown, who runs business matters, reporting directly to the board. (The post was created for her in 2009.)\n\nHow now to move forward? For weeks, people on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have proposed candidates that include men and women, people of various races and sexual orientations. Please note, though, how few of them fulfill the multiple roles of the Balanchine-Martins model. The old creative ballet-master practice has been largely eroded.

It went back to at least the 18th century. (Its 19th-century exemplars included August Bournonville and Marius Petipa.) For Balanchine, like masters before him, a company\u2019s dancers had to be custom-trained by its school. And the choreographer who made the ballets had to keep developing his style by teaching, often daily, in the classroom, which became a kind of laboratory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf City Ballet is run by a person who neither teaches nor choreographs, it will move far in spirit from the Balanchine-Kirstein principle. Certainly this may well be the moment for greater artistic separation between the company and the school \u2014 and yet that\u2019s easier said than done, since no company depends more on works, by Balanchine and others, in which students of several ages dance.\n\nWe live in post-Balanchine times. \u201cBallet is woman,\u201d he said \u2014 but his kind of ballet was always a man\u2019s view of woman, and a solely heterosexual one. Though the Balanchine worldview made women empowered and inspiring, it did not include women\u2019s equality in the workplace or same-sex relationships. Balanchine brought many women to the top, and yet neither he nor Kirstein considered one to be his successor.\n\nWhen alive, Balanchine was controversial, not least in the demands he placed on his female dancers. Seemingly unstoppable, he transformed his art. And today, many of the teachers and choreographers influenced by him \u2014 including the team now at City Ballet\u2019s helm \u2014 either never met him or were born after his time.\n\nIt was Kirstein who labored to ensure the school and the company would outlive Balanchine. Conversely, Balanchine expressed no confidence that they would, at least on any scale of consequence. Some of his devotees, lastingly despondent about his legacy, still insist either that the flame died with him or that it passed elsewhere. Of the company after his death, Balanchine remarked, \u201cApr\u00e8s moi, le board.\u201d\n\nNow the boards of the company and the school are faced with big decisions about replacing Mr. Martins.

Afterward, some animals showed symptoms of a rodent version of a concussion, stumbling and performing poorly on memory tests.\n\nThe scientists then injected some animals with a dye that cannot cross a healthy blood-brain barrier and scanned the living animals\u2019 brains. In about half of the mice, they saw signs of the dye in their brains, indicated that their blood-brain barriers had become permeable.

Viewers at home could show their support by buying their own Time\u2019s Up products, offered at various price points \u2014 from a $12 tote bag to a $380 designer sweater.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn this commodified atmosphere, it was difficult to process the appearance of real activists on the red carpet: The #MeToo founder Tarana Burke came as Michelle Williams\u2019s date, while Meryl Streep brought along Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The tactic bucked expectation \u2014 namely, that actresses tie their public personas to their relationships with men \u2014 and gave these pioneering activists exposure that\u2019s hard to come by, but it also revealed the impossibility of dismantling an event bent on promoting a certain kind of femininity and luxury at once.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe image of white actresses paired with activists of color suggested a kind of moral accessorizing.

But when Ryan Seacrest interviewed Ms. Williams and Ms. Burke on the red carpet, E! made it clear which it valued most \u2014 women\u2019s appearance, or what they have to say.

The ugliness of rape and abuse is polished into optimistic hashtags and spun into glamorous dresses. In glad-handing Hollywood, criticizing the industry is verboten, but using one\u2019s platform to advocate for other people is so expected it\u2019s a clich\u00e9. (Mr. Weinstein himself was a master of linking his films to social causes, cynically pitching the award show ballot as a kind of morality test.) In focusing the messaging of Time\u2019s Up outward \u2014 as a campaign to end sexual harassment in all workplaces \u2014 actresses have stepped into a quite traditional role, actually, of the celebrity who is both superficially appealing and actually deep, an icon of beauty and virtue.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s goal to extend protections to working-class women is admirable. But it\u2019s canny, too: Turning the focus away from Hollywood makes Hollywood a lot more comfortable with the inquiry. It leaves an opening for the industry\u2019s response to the reckoning to also be a dodge. The most electrifying moments of this protest have come when Hollywood women choose instead to model what it looks like to interrogate their own industry\u2019s destructive norms: When Debra Messing broke red carpet geniality to speak out against E!\u2019s underpayment of women, straight into an E! microphone, or when Ms. Portman presented the Golden Globes\u2019 best director nominees as \u201call-male.\u201d\n\nWe often speak of a celebrity\u2019s influence in terms of \u201cexposure,\u201d but exposure can also be destructive, especially for women. In addition to installing a host, the SAG Awards seeded its show with female presenters, which Kathy Connell, the SAG Awards\u2019 executive producer, called \u201ca unifying salute to women who have been very brave in speaking up.\u201d But when actresses present an award, they also present themselves \u2014 their looks, their clothes, their beauty \u201cwork,\u201d their diets and ideally, their affability. In this environment, \u201ccelebrating women\u201d also means shielding problematic men, who are suddenly afraid to show their faces lest they get smacked for their own bad behavior. On the SAG Awards red carpet, the embattled nominee James Franco slipped past the microphones, leaving his sister-in-law, Alison Brie, to awkwardly answer for him.\n\nIt goes without saying that all of this is quite easier for men. Just as they\u2019re not required to uphold the same standards of beauty as their female peers, men are generally excused from carrying the moral weight, too. At the Golden Globes, they got by silently wearing Time\u2019s Up lapel pins. By the SAG Awards, even that small gesture of solidarity had all but vanished. (Kumail Nanjiani and Joseph Fiennes were notable exceptions.) Even men\u2019s financial contributions to the Time\u2019s Up legal defense fund have been overshadowed by women\u2019s. Many male celebrities haven\u2019t even seemed to have done the due diligence of a PR consult. Justin Timberlake captioned his pre-Globes Instagram snap: \u201cHere we come! And DAMN, my wife is hot! #TIMESUP #whywewearblack.\u201d The bar is so low for men that this was, according to Instagram, the most-liked post of the night.\n\nThere is something about the rank hypocrisy on display that is actually useful. One way to push Hollywood toward change is to heighten its contradictions, drawing out the gap between its shimmering idea of itself and its darker realities. The image Hollywood builds for itself at these self-congratulatory events can be used as a bargaining chip for behind-the-scenes activist wins. As the SAG Awards neared, pressure mounted for the guild to protect its workers by installing a real code of conduct to address harassment. And as \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d racked up award nominations, the revelation that Mark Wahlberg earned much more to participate in reshoots than his co-star Ms. Williams \u2014 reshoots necessary to scrub the film of Kevin Spacey, and make it palatable for post-#MeToo audiences \u2014 created such a PR nightmare that Mr. Wahlberg ended up donating his $1.5 million salary to Time\u2019s Up.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven the Time\u2019s Up pin \u2014 so easy to wear, so difficult to justify \u2014 has proved a quietly brilliant tactic for flushing out men who fail to live up to its symbolism. When Mr. Franco attended the Golden Globes earlier this month, grinned down the red carpet and bounded onstage to claim a statuette for \u201cThe Disaster Artist,\u201d he wore the Time\u2019s Up logo pinned to his lapel. As the night unfolded, female acting students and collaborators began filing complaints on Twitter about Mr. Franco\u2019s own behavior, noting the hypocrisy of the pin. When Mr. Franco appeared on Seth Meyers\u2019s show days later, he was grilled over the allegations. A Los Angeles Times report came next. Mr. Franco skipped the Critic\u2019s Choice Awards, and when he turned up at the SAG Awards last Sunday, his very appearance made news. This time, he didn\u2019t wear the pin. Aziz Ansari, who himself weathered his own hypocrisy scandal after wearing the pin at the Golden Globes, didn\u2019t even show up. All of a sudden, a Hollywood awards show is a perilous place for some men to be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill. When I watched Mr. Franco get questioned by Mr. Meyers, I thought about an incident from a few years ago, when Matt Lauer began a \u201cToday Show\u201d interview with Anne Hathaway by interrogating her about a paparazzi upskirt photo taken as she exited a car, capturing her image without underwear. Hollywood is still a place where women are punished more for doing nothing than men are for doing just about anything. For a woman, getting old is as much of a career-ending affront as an assault allegation is for a man. When Mr. Meyers opened his Golden Globes monologue by greeting the \u201cladies and remaining gentlemen,\u201d I thought of all the women who don\u2019t \u201cremain\u201d in Hollywood, either, pushed out through abuse or just discarded. One of those women \u2014 until recently \u2014 was Rose McGowan.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. McGowan, who made her name starring in 1990s indie films and later the TV show \u201cCharmed,\u201d spoke out this fall about being assaulted by Mr. Weinstein in 1997, during what she was led to believe was a business meeting in his hotel suite. She\u2019s now emerged as the most prominent actress to take aim not just at Hollywood abusers but at Hollywood itself. As Time\u2019s Up organizers walk red carpets, she\u2019s sniping from the sidelines. (Ms. McGowan and other accusers of Mr. Weinstein were not invited to the campaign\u2019s Golden Globes coming-out party.) On Twitter, she\u2019s called out \u201cfancy people wearing black to honor our rapes.\u201d Of Ms. Streep, she wrote: \u201cYOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You\u2019ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change.\u201d And after CAA opened its doors to hosting Time\u2019s Up organizing meetings, Ms. McGowan accused the agency of sending \u201cmany into the Monster\u2019s Lair\u201d itself.\n\nMs. McGowan\u2019s commentary is both a necessary critique of the smooth-edged Time\u2019s Up tactics and a way to differentiate her own activist content. In the coming days she will release a memoir, \u201cBrave,\u201d and an E! documentary series, \u201cCitizen Rose.\u201d The first trailer for \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d aired during E!\u2019s Golden Globes preshow, and again before the SAG Awards, and its opening line \u2014 \u201cI was in the middle of my second movie for his company, and I get assaulted\u201d \u2014 is itself more real and more damning than anything that\u2019s been said at these Hollywood events.\n\nIn the weeks before the show\u2019s debut, Ms. McGowan knocked the Time\u2019s Up activists who failed to support it: \u201cNauseating Hollywood \u2018progressives\u2019 celebrities suddenly so concerned with their images as sex harassment fighters but won\u2019t even retweet to support BRAVE or Citizen Rose.\u201d It seems absurd to judge another person\u2019s support of assault survivors on whether or not they tweet about your TV show. But in Hollywood, where product and cause are inextricable, it makes a kind of sense.", "title": "Hollywood Uses the Very Women It Exploited to Change the Subject", "authors": ["Amanda Hess"]}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "We \u2014 as writers and critics, as consumers of popular art, as a culture \u2014 have a lot of rethinking to do. One of the mantras of the moment is that \u201ceverybody knew\u201d about what the predators, rapists and gropers were doing, and that the ubiquity of such behavior was an open secret. That\u2019s a tricky phrase, of course, and it invites observers of the industry to assess our own complicity. Is the open secret that men in power frequently behave despicably and with impunity? Or does it involve the particular things Mr. Weinstein, Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, Mr. Lasseter, Mr. Ratner, Dustin Hoffman and others (so many others!) are alleged to have done? What did we know, and how did we know it?\n\nPhoto\n\nDARGIS All I ever heard about Mr. Weinstein was that he was a bully. Being a jerk isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 a lot of executives would be in jail if it were \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t news or novel. It was largely hearsay in an industry that runs on fear (which encourages silence) and traffics in gossip, some malicious, some diversionary and some strategic, as we know from too many Oscar campaigns. The difference now is the dozens of women who have publicly accused Mr. Weinstein and the investigations into their allegations by The New York Times and The New Yorker, which have turned hearsay into news. There\u2019s a preponderance of evidence, which brings me to Woody Allen.\n\nIn 1992, Mia Farrow learned that her longtime lover, Mr. Allen, then 56, had been seeing her daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, who was around 21. Later that year, allegations surfaced that he had sexually molested Dylan Farrow, his 7-year-old daughter with Ms. Farrow. The judge in their custody case wrote that evidence of abuse remained inconclusive and Mr. Allen was never charged. For her part, Dylan Farrow has been steadfast in her accusations that he assaulted her. I think that a lot of critics read about this case and tucked that information away. Jump to his latest, \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d which is about a desperate, morally reprehensible middle-aged woman whose lover, an Allen surrogate, ditches her for her bodacious, much younger stepdaughter.\n\nI\u2019ve liked and loved some of Mr. Allen\u2019s movies, and loathed others, but I\u2019ve always put the allegations against him aside because he wasn\u2019t charged and I wanted to review the work, not the man. Even so, Mr. Allen\u2019s movies can be hard to take if you\u2019re a woman. He has written great female characters \u2014 given humanity by brilliant performers \u2014 but too many are ditzes, shrews and dewy young things gaga over uncomfortably older men and Allen stand-ins. \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d manifests some of his worst tendencies; the sexism is overt and his blurring of life and art is repellent. In my review, I cited his marriage to Ms. Previn and Dylan Farrow\u2019s allegations, a history I\u2019ve seen as a malignant cloud. I had never referred to that history before because I hadn\u2019t seen it in the work. Now I did.\n\nMr. Weinstein was fouling up the air when I wrote my review, so sexual assault was certainly on my mind. But as you said to me when we later talked about the movie, it also felt as if Mr. Allen were trolling his critics.\n\nSCOTT He was also trolling his defenders \u2014 those who cling to the idea that an artist\u2019s work has nothing to do with his life. Mr. Allen and Roman Polanski have figured in can-we-separate-the-art-from-the-artist debates for a long time. Mr. Polanski, who was publicly forgiven by one teenage victim, remains both a fugitive from American justice and an active filmmaker. Mr. Allen continues to make a movie a year, and a dwindling chorus of apologists has insisted that to discuss those movies with reference to very public aspects of his personal life offends the integrity of criticism.\n\nBut the idea that you could separate the art from the life, a conceptually and practically incoherent notion in any case, is as ludicrous for him as it is for Louis C.K. The principal subject of Woody Allen\u2019s work has always been Woody Allen, and his insistence on putting himself into the picture leaves his defenders in the distasteful position of having to choose between denial and apology: Either \u201cbecause I like his movies, I can\u2019t bring myself to believe he molested his daughter,\u201d or \u201cbecause I like his movies, I have decided not to care if he molested his daughter.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNot that I can exactly let myself off the hook. Long before I became a film critic, I was a Woody Allen obsessive. I\u2019m hardly unusual among men of my generation for having learned a lot of what I know (but was afraid to ask) from him. About sex, Jewishness, literature, New York and a whole lot more \u2014 about myself, in sum. I kept his books by my bedside for most of my adolescence, and saw his movies over and over. It\u2019s not possible for me to separate art from life \u2014 his life or mine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDARGIS This year\u2019s anguished discourse about art and artists underscores that criticism is rooted in lived experience. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to review (well, there is, but that\u2019s a discussion for another time). But I\u2019m as impatient with critics who embrace self-serving auteurist fundamentalism or aesthetic formalism as I am with those belligerent fan boys who insist that only a comic-book obsessive can review a superhero movie. None of these camps want their pleasures challenged or their bubble worlds burst by reminders that a cherished director, say, denigrates women. I mean, by all means enjoy! But don\u2019t expect me to shut up about it.\n\nCriticism is always personal and so is movie love, which is why I\u2019ve been delighted by female-driven movies as different as \u201cLady Bird,\u201d \u201cFaces Places,\u201d \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d \u2014 all of which speak to me in some way. These are the movies that in some modest yet real way feel like rejoinders to all the stories of assault and abuse that reminded us, outrage by outrage, of what a cesspool the movie industry can be. Women had been assaulted, their careers derailed. And all because some grotesque excuse for a human being had gone into a business that has historically encouraged, profited from, ignored and rewarded sexism and misogyny.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSCOTT Some of the most insightful writing about the meaning of the Weinstein revelations \u2014 by you, by our colleague Amanda Hess, by Rebecca Traister in New York magazine and Melissa Gira Grant in The New York Review of Books \u2014 has argued that the sexual depredations of Mr. Weinstein and others are also a labor issue. The public record is now overflowing with testimony from women whose ambitions were thwarted, whose aspirations were sullied, whose efforts to get through a meeting or a rehearsal or a day\u2019s shooting were disrupted and derailed because the men they were working for and with saw them not as colleagues or collaborators but as bodies to be humiliated and exploited.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a matter of individual behavior. The boundaries of complicity have not yet been mapped, and the purging of the bad guys has an air of corporate damage control. If the creeps can be expunged, maybe the system can survive. It shouldn\u2019t. The stories that continue to emerge, in every industry, add up to more than just a catalog of crimes. They constitute a case for reparations.\n\nThe movie business might start by designating a pool of money \u2014 maybe equivalent to the value of the Miramax and Weinstein Company libraries, and the budgets of every Brett Ratner film and some fraction of Pixar\u2019s worldwide revenues \u2014 to fund movies written and directed by women. Some people might see that as a threat to meritocracy. I would challenge those people to use the words \u201cBrett Ratner\u201d and \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in the same sentence. The idea that Hollywood functions by rewarding excellence is laughable on its face.\n\nDARGIS Ha, ha \u2014 though honestly it is hard to laugh given that the revelations of abuse are further proof of what some of us have been saying for a very long time: that the industry\u2019s sexism isn\u2019t in our imaginations. It isn\u2019t a female fantasy or a \u201chysterical\u201d feminist myth. As for compensation, I think that\u2019s a good idea, but it\u2019s instructive that we haven\u2019t heard about many (any?) concrete institutional actions that the industry is taking to correct its wrongs from the inside. Some moves \u2014 like removing names from credits \u2014 evoke the old Soviet-era purges, when so-called undesirable elements were ousted. Of course getting fired isn\u2019t like a bullet to the head, though maybe it feels that way in Malibu.\n\nThe problem is that industry talk is cheap and its apologies feel the same. So what now? The recently announced activist group Time\u2019s Up, which seeks to end sexual harassment both inside and outside Hollywood, looks promising. But how about inside the corridors of power? Is it time for quotas? How about the Rooney Rule? Versions of that rule \u2014 which requires teams in the National Football League to interview at least one minority candidate for top positions \u2014 have been adopted by some tech companies. It\u2019s apparently stalled in the N.F.L., but it is a place to start. In 2014, the Directors Guild of America added language to its contract that required major television studios to maintain or establish director programs that \u201cfocused on diversity \u2014 complete with enforceable provisions.\u201d I\u2019d like to see enforceable provisions throughout the industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nSCOTT The deeply ingrained homogeneity of the business is reflected on the screen. It\u2019s hardly surprising that an industry that often functions as a protection racket for white male mediocrity should specialize in spectacles of white male self-pity. That description covers most of the comedies, action movies, superhero franchises and science-fiction epics produced by the big studios in the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that edifice of monochromatic machismo showed signs of cracking throughout 2017. \u201cGet Out\u201d opened the same weekend that \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture. \u201cWonder Woman\u201d temporarily shook the DC/Warner Bros. machine out of its rut. \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d is the most inclusive \u201cStar Wars\u201d chapter to date, thanks in part to the presence of nonwhite, non-male players on the creative team. Two of the most anticipated big-budget movies of 2018 are Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d both products of the ever-growing Disney empire. And of course right now there\u2019s Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which has been embraced with some of the same kind of ardor that critics and audiences brought to \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\n\nDARGIS Movies like \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cLady Bird,\u201d though, are reminders that there are subindustries in entertainment. One gives us small, personal movies like those made by Mr. Jenkins and Ms. Gerwig. The other, far more dominant part of the industry churns out movies that are sometimes good (\u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d), but are also primarily delivery systems for a company\u2019s branded content, including its action figures, bedsheets and theme parks. That\u2019s why Disney\u2019s acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox is so important. It\u2019s praiseworthy that Disney has hired Mr. Coogler and Ms. DuVernay; Disney understands the audience in all its multiplicities.\n\nAt the same time, the end of the old Fox and the Disneyfication of the entire movie mainstream are bleak.\n\nPhoto\n\nSCOTT Good movies are made as much in spite of the industry as by means of it. Disney is moving aggressively to consolidate its dominance of large-scale, global, branded entertainment \u2014 the Fox acquisition gives them more Marvel to go with Pixar and Star Wars \u2014 but the demand for other stories and experiences will persist, and other companies will try to turn that desire into profit: A24, for example, which released \u201cLady Bird,\u201d \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d \u201cThe Disaster Artist,\u201d \u201cGood Time\u201d and \u201cMenashe.\u201d Netflix may be hastening the demise of the theatrical experience, but it also brought us \u201cOkja,\u201d \u201cMudbound\u201d and the latest projects from Noah Baumbach and Errol Morris.\n\nI\u2019m always anxious about the state of ambitious filmmaking, and about the health of the independent audience, but I also shy away from fatalism. At any rate, the good work we saw this year \u2014 and the public and critical embrace of films as varied as \u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d \u2014 can at least give us a shred of hope to cling to.\n\nDARGIS So many movies of old racist, sexist Hollywood nonetheless give me pleasure and there are movies with Mr. Weinstein\u2019s imprimatur that I love. But it\u2019s heartbreaking that this pleasure was ever derived at the expense of someone else\u2019s humanity. The art form that we love should not carry such a ghastly price.

{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Traditionally the fish came from the shallower waters along the reef. Keoni Chang, the corporate chef of Foodland, a statewide supermarket chain founded by an Irish immigrant in 1948, remembers that his great-grandfather ate poke made of oio (bonefish), caught on the flats, the flesh roughly scraped. It was more of a poi-like paste than the slashed cubes of poke that mainlanders eat today, and funkier; in his memory, his great-grandfather always washed it down with Miller Lite.\n\nIn the 1970s, local preference shifted to the larger fish of the deeps, above all ahi (yellowfin tuna), typically anointed with shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) instead of sea salt. This was in part because of changing demographics: Japanese immigrants, with their own custom of eating raw fish, started coming to Hawaii in 1868 to work the sugar plantations. As of the 2010 census, 57 percent of the state\u2019s residents were of Asian descent, the largest groups being Filipino, Japanese and Chinese; the poke that locals eat is as much of a mix as they are.\n\nTwenty-three years ago, Judy Sakuma, a native of Vietnam who fled Saigon during the war, and her husband, Willy, began selling shoyu ahi poke from a cooler under a parking garage off Kapahulu Avenue, not far from Waikiki Beach. Now she and her daughter, Kim Brug, offer eight kinds of poke at Ono Seafood, a small, eternally besieged storefront with a couple of picnic tables, next to that same garage.\n\nPhoto\n\nHer shoyu ahi is a marriage of Hawaii and Japan, given a sheen of sesame oil and a \u201csecret shoyu\u201d made with premium soy sauce and ingredients known only to her and Ms. Brug, and seasoned with skinny, snaking strands of limu, inamona and a faint but menacing tattoo of chile. Better yet is the spicy ahi, veiled in mayonnaise with a streak of heat. Half the kick comes from ginger, and the pop from tiny beads of masago (capelin roe).\n\nFresh ahi is delivered daily and turned into heaps of translucent ruby cubes. (Tako, or octopus, poke is also available.) Order a \u201cbowl,\u201d and you receive a foam box of rice and poke, no more, no less. The rice itself is impeccably fluffy and exhaling warmth, just enough to leave the fish in a cool blush. Toppings are do-it-yourself from a case by the counter, stocked with seaweed salad, pickled onions, Korean taegu (spicy-sweet dried cuttlefish), tsukemono (Japanese pickles) and boiled peanuts. But you don\u2019t need them.\n\nFish flags \u2014 which fishermen fly over their boats when sailing back to harbor after the day\u2019s catch \u2014 hang from the second-floor railing of a strip mall in Moiliili. Up the stairs is Ahi Assassins, run by Joshua Schade, a third-generation fisherman from Kahaluu on Oahu\u2019s windward side, and his longtime girlfriend, Erika Luna. On their front door a bumper sticker declares: \u201cKeep the country country!\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Mr. Schade, poke is inextricable from his life as a fisherman and all its risks. Two summers ago, his boat sank. It was the Fourth of July; no one saw the flares. He swam two miles home in the dark, and brought the Coast Guard back to rescue his father and two uncles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the moment the fish leaves the boat to the moment it\u2019s served, at most two days pass. Its flesh is a barely muted incarnadine, sliced in larger hunks than typically found elsewhere, and beautifully tender.\n\nAny of a dozen types of poke may be on hand, including shoyu garlic with crisp, clarifying arcs of white onion; pake, Hawaiian for Chinese, contoured with ginger and scallions; and \u201clunatic,\u201d named after Ms. Luna (\u201cif you had to live with her, you\u2019d know,\u201d Mr. Schade said) and essentially spicy ahi, only with sriracha untempered by mayonnaise.\n\nAhi Assassins was supposed to be just a fish store. (There are no tables.) But after the owners invited the neighborhood to an opening-day blessing in the parking lot, with food and poke for everyone, people came by looking for more. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the food,\u201d Mr. Schade said. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling like you walked into my house.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nJunichiro and Ryojiro Tsuchiya, brothers from Kawasaki, Japan, started Maguro Brothers in 2014 as a stand along the back wall of the Kekaulike Market in Chinatown, with a few tables for diners. (They\u2019ve since added a takeout window in Waikiki.) Junichiro spent a decade working at Tokyo\u2019s famed Tsukiji fish market, and the seafood here, fresh from the nearby Honolulu Fish Auction \u2014 the largest in the United States and the only one to sell fresh tuna \u2014 is pristine and exactingly cut. Slabs of ahi sit in a glass case, with thin white rings like a tree trunk\u2019s and a deep, thrilling red at the center.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe recipes lean Japanese, with flavors like ume-shiso, tangy and bright from salted plum, and a tumble of hamachi (yellowtail) stung by wasabi. The brothers\u2019 take on spicy ahi is creamier, with more sweetness to the mayonnaise and a milder, if persistent heat. But they, too, honor Hawaiian tradition in a version strewn with little pronged fronds of limu. It tastes brinier than others around town, and closer to the sea.\n\nSome of Honolulu\u2019s longest-standing poke destinations are grocery stores, like Tamashiro Market, run by three brothers, Cyrus, Guy and Sean Tamashiro. Their grandparents opened the original store in 1941, in Hilo, on the Big Island; after it was destroyed by the 1946 tsunami, they moved to Oahu and set up shop in Kalihi.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey were prescient: The address is just a mile from what is today the Honolulu Fish Auction, where the Tamashiro brothers buy seafood before dawn six days a week. They make poke from almost everything they get their hands on: surf clams, kajiki (blue marlin), nairagi (striped marlin) and kawa kawa (mackerel tuna), whose flesh is the lushest red.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStrong flavors are ascendant here, with nuances that only a kamaaina might understand, like ahi with white onions (clean and sweet) versus ahi with green onions (mellower). Their tako poke, made with octopus caught in local waters, is lovely: The octopus is first lomi-ed, or massaged, with salt, then steamed into submission.\n\nAt Tamura\u2019s Fine Wine & Liquors in Kaimuki \u2014 one of six locations across the islands \u2014 the poke counter is tucked at the back but fills the whole wall. As at Tamashiro\u2019s, the variety of poke is giddying, including dried aku (skipjack tuna), concentrated and blood-rich; smoked marlin; clams, oysters and mussels; nearly a dozen variations with ahi; and even pipikaula (Hawaiian beef jerky). Some of the seafood has been frozen, as noted on signs, but most is fresh from the auction.\n\nPhoto\n\nRecipes are straightforward, with minute shadings. Here is ahi with inamona and sea salt; there, ahi with limu and sea salt. Shoyu is calibrated with little more than ginger. As for \u201cTamura\u2019s secret sauce,\u201d the manager I spoke with laughed and said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nThe Foodland near my mom\u2019s house, one of more than two dozen statewide, has a sign over the poke counter that says \u201cHawaii\u2019s home for poke,\u201d and it is \u2014 the never-fail poke you run to the store for when friends announce they\u2019re stopping by.\n\nThe shoyu ahi is strong and just salty enough (ask for the shoyu to be packed in a separate container, to add at home); the spicy ahi has a worthy heat. The recipes for all outlets are overseen by Mr. Chang, a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools and the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing ceremonial about his approach. He uses ingredients like sea asparagus, truffle oil and gochujang, and makes a deconstructed California-roll poke with avocado, furikake and sriracha, one of the stores\u2019 best-sellers. And he\u2019s not against the mainland poke craze, \u201cso long as you take time to understand the history and apply common sense and restraint.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s amazingly delicious \u2014 \u201d he said, and trailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country.\u201d\n\nIf You Go\n\nAHI ASSASSINS\n\n2570 South Beretania Street, second floor (University Avenue), Moiliili; 808-439-4045; ahiassassins.com\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFOODLAND\n\nAt Ala Moana Center, 1450 Ala Moana Boulevard (Piikoi Street), Ala Moana, and other locations; 808-949-5044; foodland.com\n\nMAGURO BROTHERS\n\nAt Kekaulike Market, 1039 Kekaulike Street, No. 113 (North King Street), Chinatown, and another location; 808-259-7100; instagram.com/magurobrothershawaii\n\nONO SEAFOOD\n\n747 Kapahulu Avenue (Hunter Street), Kapahulu; 808-732-4806; instagram.com/ono.seafood\n\nTAMASHIRO MARKET\n\n802 North King Street (Palama Street), Kalihi; 808-841-8047; tamashiromarket.com\n\nTAMURA\u2019S FINE WINE & LIQUORS\n\n3496 Waialae Avenue (10th Avenue), Kaimuki, and other locations; 808-735-7100; tamurasfinewine.com\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

But then Ashenfelter pulled away from the pack and moved behind the leader. Even as they splashed down in the final water pit, Kazantsev was slightly ahead.\n\nBut then, with a surprising burst of stamina, Ashenfelter rose out of the water as if propelled by a rocket. The exhausted Russian, grimacing in pain, stumbled momentarily, struggling to regain his footing, and churned mechanically forward on hopeless legs of iron as the American shot ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDown the 200-yard stretch, as 65,000 people shrieked from the stands, Ashenfelter\u2019s powerful sprint widened his lead with every stride.

Ashenfelter\u2019s time, 8 minutes 45.4 seconds, smashed the official record, the 1936 Olympic mark of 9:03.8 set by Volmari Iso-Hollo of Finland.\n\nIt was one of the great upsets in Olympic history and the triumph of a lifetime for Ashenfelter, whose unassuming demeanor seemed to personify the Wheaties box all-American athlete in a postwar ideological struggle with lock step Soviet Communism. The competition was heightened by fears of nuclear war, a stalemate in the Korean conflict, diatribes of propaganda from Moscow and a fever of anti-Communism in the United States.\n\nIn Helsinki, the lasting imagery was Ashenfelter beaming atop the victory stand with Kazantsev shaking his hand from a step below. The gold medal draped around his neck, Ashenfelter basked in \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and accepted a bouquet from a young Finn in a peasant dress. The crowd roared as he shook her hand, and there were cries of \u201cKiss her!\u201d Shyly, he complied.\n\nReporters later asked Ashenfelter if he had been sure he would win. \u201cIt would sound conceited if I said sure,\u201d he replied. \u201cJust say I was surprised.\u201d\n\nThere was also a telegram from the F.B.I. director, J.

He won the Sullivan Award as America\u2019s outstanding amateur athlete of 1952 and entered the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1975.

He joined the Army Air Corps in 1942, and became a pilot and stateside gunnery instructor.\n\nHe married Lillian Wright in 1945 and had four sons who survive him: Horace, James, Alan and John.

Four years after his triumph in Helsinki, he went to the Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, but did no better than sixth in a steeplechase heat.\n\nAfter nine years as an F.B.I. agent, investigating backgrounds of federal job applicants, Ashenfelter left in 1959 and joined Engelhard Industries as a metals salesman.

Snowden.\n\nThe Senate began considering the newly approved House bill on Thursday afternoon; Senators Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, are expected to oppose the measure in the coming days. But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, moved to essentially ensure that no amendments to the House legislation would be considered, and it appeared to be on a path to final approval when senators return to Washington next week.\n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures in 2013 ushered in a period of intense interest in surveillance. Civil libertarians and conservative skeptics of government power worked together to push for new limits, while intelligence and law enforcement agencies and their backers in Congress from across party lines \u2014 and in both the Obama and Trump administrations \u2014 tried to hold the line.\n\nThe post-Snowden privacy movement secured its largest victory in 2015 when Congress voted to end and replace one of the programs that Mr. Snowden exposed, under which the N.S.A. had been secretly collecting logs of Americans\u2019 domestic phone calls in bulk. But lawmakers who hoped to add significant privacy constraints to the warrantless surveillance program, too, fell short on Thursday.\n\nBefore voting to extend the law, known as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, the House rejected an amendment that would have imposed a series of new safeguards. That proposal included a requirement that officials obtain warrants in most cases before hunting for, and reading, emails and other messages of Americans that were swept up under the surveillance.\n\nSupporters of those changes contended that the overhaul was needed to preserve Fourth Amendment privacy rights in the internet era. But intelligence and law enforcement officials argued that it was unnecessary, and dangerous, to limit security officials from being able to freely gain access to information the government already possessed.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, the Republican of California who leads the House Intelligence Committee, celebrated the outcome. \u201cThe House of Representatives has taken a big step to ensure the continuation of one of the intelligence community\u2019s most vital tools for tracking foreign terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe program\u2019s surveillance can be used for all foreign intelligence purposes. The sharpest points of the debate centered on when information about Americans that is gathered by the program can be used for criminal investigations unrelated to terrorism.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepresentative Justin Amash, the Republican of Michigan who sponsored the privacy measures, expressed disappointment but vowed to keep fighting.\n\n\u201cWe had a bipartisan coalition who worked very hard to protect people\u2019s rights, and we will continue to fight and continue to educate our colleagues about it,\u201d Mr. Amash said.\n\nThe House bill that was approved on Thursday does contain a gesture toward requiring officials to obtain a warrant to read Americans\u2019 emails that are collected under the program. But it is written so narrowly that it will not protect the overwhelming majority of citizens\u2019 information that is queried in the warrantless surveillance repository.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Schiff said the committee had opened new avenues to investigate the Justice Department and F.B.I., a characterization disputed by Mr. Conaway.\n\nWhat comes next was less clear. Under the obscure House rule invoked by the committee, Mr. Trump now has five days to review the document and decide whether to try to block it from going public. The White House has repeatedly indicated that it wants the memo out, but Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department had been working to slow or block its release.\n\nShortly after Monday\u2019s vote, the memo was taken to the White House, where it was being reviewed by White House lawyers, according to a person familiar with the review.\n\nVoting as a bloc, Democrats tried to advance a series of motions on Monday that they said would help put the Republican memo in context. All but one of those motions failed along party lines. The committee did make a Democratic memo rebutting the Republican version available to the full House, but Republicans said they wanted time for members to review the document before considering its public release.\n\nThe Republican memo, which was made available to all members of the House, is said to contend that officials from the two agencies were not forthcoming to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge. Republicans accuse the agencies of not properly disclosing that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign helped finance research that was used to obtain a warrant for surveillance of Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser. The research presented to the judge was assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that the memo reveals that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, a top Trump appointee, signed off an application to extend the surveillance of Mr. Page shortly after taking office last spring. The renewal shows that the Justice Department under Mr. Trump saw reason to believe that Mr. Page was acting as a Russian agent.\n\nThe inclusion of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s action in the memo could expose him to a torrent of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from conservatives in the news media who have seized on the surveillance to argue that the Russia investigation may have been tainted from the start. Mr. Rosenstein is overseeing that investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. It was Mr. Rosenstein who appointed Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker who went on to found a New York investment company, was on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years. A trip he took to Russia in July 2016 while working for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign caught the bureau\u2019s attention again, and by the fall of 2016, shortly after he left the campaign, American law enforcement officials began conducting surveillance on him.\n\nTo obtain the surveillance warrant, the government would have had to demonstrate probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. Investigators must seek approval from the Justice Department for such a warrant, and then prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge.\n\nPeople familiar with the underlying application have portrayed the Republican memo as misleading in part, they say, because Mr. Steele\u2019s information was insufficient to meet the standard for a FISA warrant. They said the application drew on other intelligence material that the Republican memo selectively omits. That other information remains highly sensitive, and releasing it would risk burning other sources and methods of intelligence-gathering about Russia.\n\nDemocrats tried unsuccessfully on Monday to push forward a motion for the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to brief the entire House in a private session on that material before the release of the Republican memo so that they could make a more informed judgment about its contents.\n\nThere is no known precedent for the Republicans\u2019 action. Though House rules allow the Intelligence Committee to vote to disclose classified information if it is deemed to be in the public interest, the rule is not thought to have ever been used. Typically, lawmakers wishing to make public secretive information classified by the executive branch spend months, if not years, fighting with the White House and the intelligence community over what they can release.\n\nUntil this past weekend, the committee had refused to let anyone from the Justice Department or the F.B.I., who provided the materials underlying the memo, review it. Representative Devin Nunes of California relented on Sunday, allowing Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, to review the document. But Mr. Schiff said later in the day that Mr. Wray had conveyed to him that he still had concerns about its release.\n\nIn a letter last week to Mr. Nunes, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Stephen E.

{"date": "2018-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "The new House Republicans\u2019 stand underscored the uncertainty about immigration. Mr. Trump\u2019s positions vacillate daily. And members of both parties are divided. Some Democrats are pressing for confrontation, while others seem to fear a political backlash. Some Republicans are searching for compromise against a conservative tide of anti-immigrant fervor.\n\nLorella Praeli, the director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union, described the House legislation as a \u201ccollection of hard-line provisions designed to sabotage, rather than advance, the possibility of a bipartisan breakthrough.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear if the proposal would ever come up for a vote in the House, especially after Tuesday\u2019s White House meeting established the parameters for a bipartisan deal. And it is all but certain to have no future in the Senate, where immigration legislation would need 60 votes for passage and therefore could not make it through the chamber with only Republican support.\n\nThe immigration debate on Capitol Hill grew more complicated after a federal judge ruled Tuesday that, for now, the Trump administration could not end the DACA program.\n\nThe judge, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, wrote that the administration must \u201cmaintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis\u201d while lawsuits challenging the decision to end the program move ahead.\n\nMr. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying that the United States court system was \u201cbroken and unfair,\u201d and members of both parties and immigration activists struggled to understand the legal and political implications of the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security, which administers the program for young immigrants, said they are preparing to follow the order even as they await possible action by the Justice Department to appeal the ruling in the days ahead.\n\nAdministration officials expressed confidence that the ruling would be overturned on appeal.

Click here to receive our weekly Sports newsletter.\n\n\u2014-\n\nHere\u2019s a drive-by-drive look at how Alabama won the national championship:\n\nPhoto\n\n1Q, 13:38: Alabama\u2019s defense takes control early.\n\nThe Crimson Tide\u2019s defense showed its dominance immediately with an interception on the third play of the game.\n\nAlabama had won the coin toss and chose to defer, which resulted in Georgia receiving the ball to start the game. The ball was kicked out of the end zone for a touchback, which set the Bulldogs up at their own 25-yard line to start.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey got off to a slow start, with Jake Fromm dumping off two quick short passes that accounted for just three yards, but then he tried to be more aggressive, throwing deep to Javon Wims, and had his pass intercepted by Tony Brown.\n\nJoe Drape: Big play to open this slugfest. It was a fine throw by Fromm, but Brown took it away from Wims. Hard nosed play. Let\u2019s expect a lot of them. These are two top-10 defenses.\n\nPhoto\n\n1Q, 9:54: Tide fails to convert after interception.\n\nAlabama got painfully close to putting the ball in the end zone but they settled for a 40-yard field goal attempt by Andy Pappanastos that missed wide-left, keeping the game scoreless.\n\nThe Crimson Tide had started at their own 36-yard line thanks to Tony Brown\u2019s interception, and they made steady progress with their running game, picking up 30 yards on the ground to go with 17 through the air, generating three first downs. Jalen Hurts led the way with two carries for 22 yards.\n\nHurts then flirted with a touchdown when he found Calvin Ridley wide open in the end zone thanks to broken coverage, but the pass sailed over Ridley\u2019s head, taking away Alabama\u2019s best opportunity.\n\nPappanastos initially made a 35-yard attempt, but after a penalty he tried for 40 yards and missed badly.\n\nDrape: Couple of things: Nick Saban\u2019s process is unassailable on everything but the field goal kicking game. I hate criticizing Andy Pappanastos; He\u2019s a kid. But look back at Saban\u2019s Alabama years, and he\u2019s never developed a reliable kicker. What I mean by that, is someone who never gets any pub because he makes the kick he\u2019s supposed to. The false start was inexcusable. But this is exactly how they started against Clemson.\n\nPhoto\n\n1Q, 9:01: Georgia, a great running team, keeps passing.\n\nThrough two possessions, Georgia, which ran all over Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl, has passed on every single offensive play. Jake Fromm has completed just 3 of 7 passes for 17 yards as Sony Michel and Nick Chubb have been relegated to decoy work thus far. The strategy is not working as of yet, with Georgia having just one first down to go with one turnover and one punt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDrape: I like the fact Georgia is wide open. They do have a ground game, but they are challenging Bama\u2019s secondary. As our colleague Marc Tracy pointed out, Jalen Hurts is a game manager. He is there to make good decisions. These are the opening rounds of a heavyweight fight and neither team is backing down.\n\nPhoto\n\n1Q, 6:54: Alabama\u2019s offense sputters.\n\nAfter two short plays, Alabama was faced with a 3rd-and-3, and it was fairly obvious that Jalen Hurts would be running the ball. Georgia sniffed the keeper out immediately, easily stopping the quarterback for a loss of one yard. The quiet start to the game continues with Alabama punting the ball away.\n\nDrape: It\u2019s early, but this game is looking promising. Hurts is going to need to run tonight. He\u2019s more Blake Bortles than Drew Brees, and there is nothing wrong with that. But these two staffs have the other measured so far.\n\nPhoto\n\n2Q, 14:14: Georgia settles for a field goal, and the lead.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, Georgia finally had something working, but they failed to convert on 3rd-and-11 to start the second quarter and Rodrigo Blankenship came out to hit a 41-yard field goal to give the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead.\n\nIt took several frustrating attempts to get Georgia\u2019s running game on track, but on a 3rd-and-20 near the end of the first quarter the Bulldogs chose to run the ball and Sony Michel broke free on the right sideline, sprinting for a 26-yard run that woke up Georgia\u2019s offense.\n\nBefore Michel\u2019s run it had looked like yet another drive would end in a quick punt. Alabama\u2019s Anthony Averett delivered a huge sack on a 2nd-and-10 play, sending Georgia all the way from Alabama\u2019s 42-yard line to Georgia\u2019s 48-yard line. But despite the Crimson Tide\u2019s powerful front-seven having sniffed out and demolished both Nick Chubb and Michel on most of their previous attempts, Georgia went with a run on the 3rd-and-long and were rewarded with a huge gain, eventually setting up Blankenship\u2019s kick.\n\nDrape: Hot Rod Blankenship, the Dawgs kicker is a helluva story. Him of the Kurt Rambis glasses. He was a preferred walk-on with former Coach Mark Richt. But Kirby Smart was slow to put him on scholarship. He did eventually the day before the Notre Dame game, which Hot Rod won with a field goal. He went for 55-yards against Oklahoma. He may be the difference here. In fact, he already is.\n\n2Q, 12:52: Alabama fails to answer Georgia\u2019s scoring drive.\n\nAfter a touchback, Alabama started at their own 25 and they answered Georgia\u2019s scoring drive by going absolutely nowhere. Two runs and an incomplete pass generated only 4 yards before the Crimson Tide punted the ball away. Georgia had an injury delay early in the drive when David Marshall, a sophomore linebacker, was slow to get up after a running play before being taken to a medical tent for further evaluation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDrape: Here is what Alabama was worried about before the game, and is now in a full blown panic. The Georgia defensive front is strong and harassing. They totally owned Oklahoma\u2019s Baker Mayfield, the Heisman winner. Jalen Hurts looks lost. Unless the Tide opens up a ground game, Hurts is going to be hurting, and the Dawgs are going to be rolling over the Tide.\n\nPhoto\n\n2Q, 7:33: Another Georgia drive ends in a field goal.\n\nGeorgia started using all of their weapons and had the team\u2019s best drive of the game, but after failing to get into the end zone after reaching 1st-and-goal, they settled for a 27-yard field goal from Rodrigo Blankenship that increased their lead to 6-0.\n\nLooking to capitalize on getting the ball back so quickly after they had taken the lead, the Bulldogs started things off when Jake Fromm hit D\u2019Andre Swift with a screen pass that went for 15 yards. Runs by Nick Chubb and Fromm picked up a second first down. Then Fromm aggressively challenged the Alabama defense by throwing downfield, and it worked, with Riley Ridley contributing a 23-yard catch-and-run while Javon Wims made a circus catch on the sideline that stood up to an official review.\n\nThat set up a 1st-and-goal from Alabama\u2019s 10-yard line, but the Bulldogs stalled out, setting up Blankenship for yet another kick.\n\nDrape: Wow, how big has freshman Jake Fromm been? That was a big throw to Riley Ridley, and even a bigger one to Wims to take them into the red zone. He almost made a freshman mistake on 3rd & 6. The Dawgs should have had 7 there. A 6-0 lead over Alabama is not enough after you\u2019ve pushed them around.\n\nPhoto\n\n2Q, 5:15: Tide offense shows some life, but stalls out.\n\nAlabama got a huge start to the drive on a delayed keeper by Jalen Hurts that went for 31 yards, with Georgia seemingly having been caught on their heels. But the Bulldogs quickly made up for that mistake when Davin Bellamy got a huge 6-yard sack on 2nd-and-9. Josh Jacob ran the ball for 5 yards and then the Crimson Tide punted yet again, showing little sign of having figured out Georgia\u2019s defense.\n\n2Q, 2:14: Georgia\u2019s Javon Wims goes to locker room.\n\nA nice punt resulted in Georgia starting from their own 5-yard line, and with so little room to work they settled for two short runs by Nick Chubb before Jake Fromm stepped back into the pocket and found Riley Ridley in the middle of the field for a huge 16-yard completion. It was Ridley\u2019s third big catch of the game, helping somewhat alleviate the concern of Javon Wims having gone into Georgia\u2019s locker room to be evaluated for an injury.\n\nGeorgia quickly found itself in another third down situation, but this time Fromm\u2019s throw was well off its mark, skipping to the ground in front of Mecole Hardman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Bulldogs were forced to punt, but thanks to Ridley\u2019s catch the field position is not nearly as bad as it could have been.\n\n2Q, 1:19: Nothing for Alabama.\n\nAlabama\u2019s offense is not doing anything right now. Georgia forced a three-and-out, with the Crimson Tide getting seven yards on a pair of runs before an incomplete pass and a punt completed their drive.\n\nPhoto\n\n2Q, 0:07: Bulldogs head into the locker room with a 13-0 lead.\n\nGeorgia did not have much time to work with, but they had all three timeouts remaining, so they decided to be aggressive heading into halftime. It paid off, with Mecole Hardman taking a direct-snap into the end zone from 1 yard out for the first touchdown of the game and a 13-0 lead for the Bulldogs.\n\nThe drive started with 1:19 remaining in the half, and Jake Fromm immediately found Riley Ridley for a 10-yard gain. Fromm was nearly intercepted a few plays later, but when Alabama\u2019s Anthony Averett failed to get his hands on the ball, the Bulldogs capitalized by getting 14 yards on the ground from Sony Michel on the next play.\n\nAn Alabama penalty got Georgia 5 more yards, D\u2019Andre Swift ran for 7 and Fromm, not seeing any good receiving options, pulled the ball down and reeled off a 14-yard run of his own.\n\nWith a short field in front of him, Fromm threw aggressively to Terry Godwin for a 16-yard gain near the goal line setting up a 1st-and-goal from the 3. A roughing the passer call got Georgia all the way to the Alabama 1-yard line, and Hardman took the ball on a direct-snap, running into the end zone easily.\n\nDrape: Wonderful call by Georgia offensive coordinator Jim Chaney to run the Wildcat \u2014 a snap to Mecole Hardman, who waltzes to the corner. This game is far from over. Nick Saban is frustrated in his halftime interview, but he purposefully doesn\u2019t lay it on quarterback Jalen Hurts. Georgia\u2019s Kirby Smart is understated and says Jake Fromm is making good decisions. Fromm is going to make Dawg fans forget Buck Belue with another half like that (not really). I\u2019m not putting this in the victory column for Georgia yet. Saban and the Tide are too good \u2014 see five national championships \u2014 but that was a big score to end the half.\n\nTracy: To go off Joe\u2019s point, the past two national title games \u2014 both of which also involved Alabama \u2014 were shootouts whose final scores were 35-31 and 45-40. At halftime of those games, the scores were, respectively, 14-7 and 21-7. If past is prologue, the second half will involve substantially more scoring than the first.\n\nPhoto\n\n3Q, 13:03: Saban switches to freshman quarterback.\n\nAlabama started the half with Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback rather than Jalen Hurts. It was a somewhat surprising change, which means both teams are playing true freshmen at quarterback.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTagovailoa\u2019s opening drive did not make much of a change in the offense as he ran for 4 yards and passed for 2 before a sack left them with a 3rd-and-8, effectively ending their drive. Alabama had a short injury delay while Jonah Williams was treated on the field, but they eventually punted the ball away.\n\nDrape: Nick Saban is either panicking or a genius. He\u2019s put in Tagovailoa in at quarterback, a freshman, after saying it wasn\u2019t Jalen Hurts\u2019s fault the Tide struggled in the first half. I vote for panicking. He has decided that he can\u2019t stop Georgia, and needs to score with them. Hurts is 25-2. At least we know now that Robo-Coach Saban is human after all. Kirby Smart has gotten under Nick\u2019s skin.\n\nPhoto\n\n3Q, 10:51: Tide\u2019s defense picks up the intensity.\n\nAlabama\u2019s offense may have looked slow coming out of the locker room, but the Tide\u2019s defense was clearly fired up, forcing consecutive plays of negative yards before Georgia\u2019s drive fizzled out with a 4-yard run by D\u2019Andre Swift. The Bulldogs had the ball for just 93 seconds of clock time, but the team\u2019s fans were left angry about a missed face mask call on Swift\u2019s second-down run which went for minus-8 yards.\n\nPhoto\n\n3Q, 8:52: And just like that, Alabama is back in it.\n\nTua Tagovailoa showed why Nick Saban put him in. The true freshman led a drive that was far more impressive than anything Jalen Hurts had offered, and he got the Crimson Tide their first touchdown of the game, narrowing Georgia\u2019s lead to 13-7.\n\nHe started with beautiful deep pass to Calvin Ridley that nearly went for a 44-yard touchdown, but the ball was just out Ridley\u2019s hands and it fell incomplete. On the next play he saw no openings and fought for a 3-yard gain, lowering his shoulder into a defender at the tail end of the play.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His third down scramble was the key play. Chris Fowler says we have a \u201cFreshman Quarterback Duel.\u201d Hurts is the first one on the field to congratulate his rival on the touchdown. The balance inches back to Nick as a genius, but I\u2019m doubling down on panic.\n\nPhoto\n\n3Q, 6:52: Georgia answers with an 80-yard touchdown.\n\nAlabama had made it a football game with Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s thrilling touchdown drive, and their special teams piled on by pinning Georgia down at their own 7-yard line to start their next drive. But Jake Fromm was not intimidated. Fromm\u2019s 80-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman made the score 20-7 in Georgia\u2019s favor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFromm started the drive by immediately picking up a first down with a 14-yard pass over the middle to Terry Godwin, but Nick Chubb gave 8 yards of that back when Anthony Averett dropped him deep in the backfield.\n\nChubb ran up the middle for 7 yards, getting the Bulldogs to 3rd-and-11, and Fromm aggressively threw deep to Hardman on the sideline. The sophomore wide receiver fought past the coverage for the long touchdown and the play stood up to a review by officials.\n\nDrape: Wow! I say it again because we are a public forum. But Fromm to Hardman for 80 yards on 3rd and 18 is pretty spectacular. Saban, who some of our readers say never panics, has to be a bit puckered now. Still, it\u2019s a great game. Bring on Tua Tagovailoa!\n\n3Q, 6:32: Tagovailoa throws into trouble.\n\nNot wanting Jake Fromm to get all the fun, Tua Tagovailoa again threw deep on the first play of a drive, but this one fell incomplete just in front of DeVonta Smith. On second down he rolled out to his left and forced a bad pass down the sideline, which was intercepted by Georgia\u2019s Deandre Baker. As good as Tagovailoa looked on the previous drive, the pick was exactly what you would expect from a true freshman pushed into such a difficult circumstance.\n\nPhoto\n\n3Q, 6:21: Alabama\u2019s defense takes the ball back.\n\nAlabama answered an interception with one of their own. On the first play of Georgia\u2019s drive, Jake Fromm threw to his left, had it deflect off the helmet of a defensive lineman, and then fall into the hands of Raekwon Davis for the turnover.\n\nQ3, 5:15: Alabama cuts into Georgia\u2019s lead.\n\nAn Alabama field goal made it 20-10 in Georgia\u2019s favor.\n\nGiven a short field thanks to the interception, Alabama ran the ball twice, picking up a first down, and then Tua Tagovailoa took a shot at the end zone with a pass that sailed over the hands of Cam Sims. Tagovailoa was nearly intercepted on second down when a bad drop by Calvin Ridley popped into the air, and then the drive stalled with an incomplete pass on third down.\n\nAndy Pappanastos came out and hit a 43-yard field goal to pull within 10 points.\n\nDrape: Critical drive coming up here. Nick Saban rolled the dice with Tua Tagovailoa. Briefly looked like a genius, but ultimately gets an interception by the freshman, and eventually a field goal. Bad penalty sets up the Dawgs. A touchdown puts this out of reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nQ3, 1:55: Fromm\u2019s third-down magic runs out.\n\nAfter the kickoff, Georgia got 15 yards for free thanks to an unnecessary roughness call against Alabama\u2019s Mekhi Brown, who continued to rant and rave on the sideline when he was pulled out of the game.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNick Chubb did not get far on two runs, giving Jake Fromm yet another big third down opportunity, and the freshman capitalized with a 13-yard pass to Riley Ridley, who has been superb all game.\n\nThe third-down magic was nowhere to be found a few plays later on an incomplete pass to Ridley, setting up a Georgia punt.\n\n3Q, 0:08: Georgia\u2019s defense keeps Tagovailoa in check.\n\nAlabama got a quick first down with a 16-yard run by Bo Scarbrough, but a 7-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa to Calvin Ridley was followed by a run by Scarbrough for no gain and a pass from Tagovailoa to Scarbrough for 1 yard, leading to a punt.\n\nDrape: This title game delivered what it promised: two hard-nosed teams from the best conference in college football, the S.E.C. Every series matters. I still can\u2019t believe Nick Saban replaced his 25-2, two title-game starter, with a freshman.\n\n4Q, 11:39: Georgia starts working the clock.\n\nStarting the fourth quarter with a 10-point lead, Georgia was clearly thinking about the clock and they started their drive with four consecutive running plays by Sony Michel, accounting for 31 yards. Michel was spelled by Nick Chubb, who ran twice for 6 yards. But on 3rd-and-4, Nick Fromm dropped back to pass and was crushed to the ground by Raekwon Davis for a 9-yard sack, forcing the Bulldogs to punt and keeping Alabama in the game.\n\nPhoto\n\n4Q, 9:24: Another field goal for Alabama cuts into Georgia\u2019s lead.\n\nThe Crimson Tide would have liked a touchdown, but after a pass was nearly intercepted in the end zone they should be happy with a field goal that made the score 20-13.\n\nAlabama was steadily moving down the field, taking what Georgia would give them before Najee Harris uncorked a 36-yard run to the left side of the field, fighting past tacklers all the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarris had another short run before Tua Tagovailoa just missed Jerry Jeudy on a throw to the end zone, setting up a 3rd-and-8 from Georgia\u2019s 12-yard line. Georgia burned a timeout and then Tagovailoa took another shot into the end zone, just missing Jeudy on a ball that was very nearly intercepted by Dominick Sanders.\n\nThat brought out Andy Pappanastos, who hit from 30 yards out to pull within seven points.\n\nDrape: These two teams are hitting harder the deeper into the game we go. Harris was punishing on his 36-yard run. On the big 3rd-and-8 from the 12-yard line, Saban lets Tagovailoa throw it. It looked like it was intercepted by Sanders, who already has 16 interceptions, but it doesn\u2019t stand up to review. In Vegas, you are still ahead if you took the Dawgs plus 6.\n\n4Q, 7:10: Georgia stalls again, giving Alabama a chance.\n\nGeorgia is not able to keep its offense on the field, which is giving Alabama a lot of opportunities to get back into this game.\n\nA direct snap to Nick Chubb fooled no one and the running back was hit for a 1-yard loss. Georgia then got 9 yards from Mecole Hardman on a sweep to the right. Sony Michel went up the middle to try to extend the drive but he was stopped immediately, forcing a punt.\n\nThe Crimson Tide now have the ball down seven points with just over seven minutes remaining in the game.\n\nDrape: Georgia\u2019s offensive coordinator Jim Chaney got too cute on this drive.

{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Wardle\u2019s curiosity was piqued by recent news that Russian spies had used Kaspersky antivirus products to siphon classified documents off the home computer of an N.S.A. developer, and may have played a critical role in broader Russian intelligence gathering.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know if this was a feasible attack mechanism,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get into the complex accusations. But from a technical point of view, if an antivirus maker wanted to, was coerced to, or was hacked or somehow subverted, could it create a signature to flag classified documents?\u201d\n\nThat question has taken on renewed importance over the last three months in the wake of United States officials\u2019 accusations that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software was used for Russian intelligence gathering, an accusation that Kaspersky has rigorously denied.\n\nLast month, Kaspersky Lab sued the Trump administration after a Department of Homeland Security directive banning its software from federal computer networks. Kaspersky claimed in an open letter that \u201cD.H.S. has harmed Kaspersky Lab\u2019s reputation and its commercial operations without any evidence of wrongdoing by the company.\u201d\n\nFor years, intelligence agencies suspected that Kaspersky Lab\u2019s security products provided a back door for Russian intelligence. A draft of a top-secret report leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, described a top-secret, N.S.A. effort in 2008 that concluded that Kaspersky\u2019s software collected sensitive information off customers\u2019 machines.\n\nThe documents showed Kaspersky was not the N.S.A.\u2019s only target. Future targets included nearly two dozen other foreign antivirus makers, including Checkpoint in Israel and Avast in the Czech Republic.\n\nAt the N.S.A., analysts were barred from using Kaspersky antivirus software because of the risk it would give the Kremlin broad access to their machines and data. But excluding N.S.A. headquarters at Fort Meade, Kaspersky still managed to secure contracts with nearly two dozen American government agencies over the last few years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast September, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all federal agencies to cease using Kaspersky products because of the threat that Kaspersky\u2019s products could \u201cprovide access to files.\u201d\n\nA month later, The New York Times reported that the Homeland Security directive was based, in large part, on intelligence shared by Israeli intelligence officials who successfully hacked Kaspersky Lab in 2014. They looked on for months as Russian government hackers scanned computers belonging to Kaspersky customers around the world for top secret American government classified programs.\n\nIn at least one case, United States officials claimed Russian intelligence officials were successful in using Kaspersky\u2019s software to pull classified documents off a home computer belonging to Nghia H. Pho, an N.S.A. developer who had installed Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software on his home computer. Mr. Pho pleaded guilty last year to bringing home classified documents and writings, and has said he brought the files home only in an attempt to expand his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

But the company has since acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on Mr. Pho\u2019s computer and removing it, though the company said it had immediately destroyed the documents once it realized they were classified.\n\nThe company also said in November that in the course of investigating a surveillance operation known as TeamSpy in 2015, it had tweaked its antivirus program to scan files containing the word \u201csecret.\u201d The company said it had done this because the TeamSpy attackers were known to automatically scan for files that included the words \u201csecret,\u201d \u201cpass\u201d and \u201csaidumlo,\u201d the Georgian translation for the word secret.\n\nKaspersky continues to deny that it knew about the scanning for classified United States programs or allowed its antivirus products to be used by Russian intelligence. Eugene Kaspersky, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said he would allow the United States government to inspect his company\u2019s source code to allay distrust of its antivirus and cybersecurity products.\n\nBut Mr. Wardle discovered, in reverse-engineering Kaspersky antivirus software, that a simple review of its source code would do nothing to prove its products had not been used as a Russian intelligence-gathering tool. (Watch how he reverse-engineered the software.)\n\nMr. Wardle found that Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software is incredibly complex. Unlike traditional antivirus software, which uses digital \u201csignatures\u201d to look for malicious code and patterns of activity, Kaspersky\u2019s signatures are easily updated, can be automatically pushed out to certain clients, and contain code that can be tweaked to do things like automatically scanning for and siphoning off classified documents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn short, Mr. Wardle found, \u201cantivirus could be the ultimate cyberespionage spying tool.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Wardle said it was relatively easy to use a vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Windows software to manipulate the Kaspersky software. Because officials routinely classify top secret documents with the marking \u201cTS/SCI,\u201d which stands for \u201cTop Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,\u201d Mr. Wardle added a rule to Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus program to flag any documents that contained the \u201cTS/SCI\u201d marker.\n\nHe then edited a document on his computer containing text from the Winnie the Pooh children\u2019s book series to include the marking \u201cTS/SCI\u201d and waited to see whether Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus product would catch it.\n\nPhoto\n\nSure enough, as soon as the Winnie the Pooh text was saved to his machine, Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software flagged and quarantined the document. When he added the same TS/SCI marker to another document containing the text \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\u201d it, too, was flagged and quarantined by Kaspersky\u2019s tweaked antivirus program.\n\n\u201cNot a whole lot of surprise that this worked,\u201d Mr. Wardle said, \u201cbut still neat to confirm that an antivirus product can be trivially, yet surreptitiously, used to detect classified documents.\u201d\n\nThe next question was: What happens to these files once they are flagged? Mr. Wardle stopped short of hacking into Kaspersky\u2019s cloud servers, where suspicious files are routinely uploaded.\n\nHowever, he noted that antivirus customers, including Kaspersky\u2019s, agreed by default to allow security vendors to send anything from their machine back to vendors\u2019 servers for further investigation.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons for this: By uploading these items to Kaspersky\u2019s cloud, security analysts can evaluate whether they pose a threat, and update their signatures as a result.\n\nKaspersky Lab said Mr. Wardle\u2019s research did not reflect how the company\u2019s software works.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for Kaspersky Lab to deliver a specific signature or update to only one user in a secret, targeted way because all signatures are always openly available to all our users; and updates are digitally signed, further making it impossible to fake an update,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe company added that it applied the same security standards and maintained the same levels of access as other security vendors, and reiterated that it was willing to make its source code, threat detection rules and software updates available for audit by independent experts.\n\nBut, as Mr. Wardle\u2019s research demonstrated, an untrustworthy vendor, or hacker or spy with access to that vendor\u2019s systems, can abuse its deep access to turn antivirus software into a dynamic search tool, not unlike Google, to scan customers\u2019 computers for documents that contain certain keywords.\n\n\u201cAnd no one would ever know,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect cybercrime.\u201d", "title": "How Antivirus Software Can Be Turned Into a Tool for Spying", "authors": ["Nicole Perlroth"]}
{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "Sharon, meanwhile, had been maintaining constant pressure on Lt. Gen. Rafael Eitan, chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, for the operation to move forward. The air force put two F-15 fighters on alert for immediate takeoff from the Tel Nof air force base. Ivry, ever cautious, briefed the lead pilot himself. He understood the stakes. It was clear to him how disastrous it would be if Israel shot down the wrong aircraft. \u201cYou don\u2019t fire without my O.K.,\u201d he told the pilot. \u201cClear? Even if there\u2019s a communications problem, if you don\u2019t hear my order\u201d \u2014 he emphasized that part: hear my order \u2014 \u201cyou don\u2019t open fire.\u201d\n\nAt 2:05 p.m. on Oct. 23, one of the Caesarea operatives in Athens called Mossad headquarters. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d he said. \u201cPositive ID.\u201d His excitement was audible. He reported that he had watched the P.L.O. leader and his men making final preparations to board a DHC-5 Buffalo with a tail painted blue with brown marks and the registration number 1169.\n\nPhoto\n\nMossad passed the confirmation to Canary. To Ivry, though, something seemed off. \u201cI didn\u2019t get this whole story,\u201d he told me years later, sitting in his executive suite overlooking Tel Aviv, where he works now as the president of Boeing Israel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear to me why Arafat would be flying to Cairo. According to intelligence, he had nothing to look for there at the time. And if he was going there, why in that kind of transport plane? Not at all dignified enough for a man of his status. I asked the Mossad to verify that he was the man.\u201d\n\nThe two Caesarea operatives once again insisted that it was Arafat. \u201cThe objective has grown a longer beard to mislead,\u201d they reported. Mossad reconfirmed the positive identification.\n\nAt 4:30 p.m., the operatives reported that the plane had taken off. Ivry got the formal order, by telephone, from Eitan: Shoot it down. Ivry told his F-15 pilots to take off. It wouldn\u2019t take long to intercept the sluggish transport plane.\n\nAs the jets closed in, Ivry still harbored doubts. He told his aide to contact Mossad again and demand that it provide secondary confirmation that it was Arafat on the plane and not just someone who looked like him. Ivry seldom displayed any emotion. \u201cBut we could see he was very worried,\u201d said one of his subordinates who was present at the time.\n\nIvry needed to buy time. He also knew that pilots can be overeager, that sometimes they\u2019ll look for a reason to fire on a target, interpreting a burst of radio static as an order to shoot, for instance. \u201cHold your fire,\u201d he reminded his pilots. \u201cIf there\u2019s no radio contact, do not open fire.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEitan kept calling to find out what was happening and to see whether his order to shoot down the plane had been carried out. Even though the Caesarea operatives had confirmed and then reconfirmed that it was Arafat, Ivry gave the same reply each time: \u201cRaful,\u201d Ivry said, using Eitan\u2019s nickname, \u201cwe do not yet have final positive confirmation that it is him.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Ivry told the Military Intelligence directorate (known by its acronym AMAN) and Mossad that the visual identification was insufficient and he demanded yet another crosschecked confirmation that Arafat was on the plane. That\u2019s when the pilots picked up the radar blip and sought permission to engage.\n\nIvry couldn\u2019t stall much longer. He had been given a direct order. If he didn\u2019t take down the aircraft soon, he would have to explain why to Eitan and Sharon.\n\nTension was heightening. The minutes dragged on.\n\nAnd then, five minutes before 5 o\u2019clock, 25 minutes after the fighters took off, a phone jangled in Canary. It was the secure line that connected directly to Mossad headquarters. \u201cDoubts have arisen,\u201d said the voice on the line, with embarrassment. Mossad had other sources who insisted that Arafat had been nowhere near Greece, and that the man on the plane couldn\u2019t possibly be Arafat.\n\nIn the absence of another order, the pair of F-15s continued to track the Buffalo. Ivry repeated his orders. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for more information. Keep eyes on the target and wait.\u201d\n\nAt 5:23 p.m., another report came in to Canary. Sources from Mossad and AMAN said the man on the plane was Fathi Arafat, Yasir\u2019s look-alike younger brother, a pediatrician and the founder of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. With him were 30 wounded Palestinian children, survivors of the massacre that the Lebanese Maronite Christian Phalange militia had perpetrated in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut a month before. Fathi Arafat was escorting them to Cairo for medical treatment.\n\nIvry breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cTurn around,\u201d he ordered the pilot. \u201cYou\u2019re coming home.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe choice facing Ivry on that day in October 1982 was only one example of a dilemma that has confronted many Israeli authorities over the course of the nation\u2019s brief history \u2014 the violent and sometimes irreconcilable clash between the fundamental principles of democracy and a nation\u2019s instinct to defend itself.\n\nAs a reporter in Israel, I have interviewed hundreds of people in its intelligence and defense establishments and studied thousands of classified documents that revealed a hidden history, surprising even in the context of Israel\u2019s already fierce reputation. Many of the people I spoke to, in explaining why they did what they did, would simply cite the Babylonian Talmud: \u201cIf someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.\u201d In my reporting, I found that since World War II, Israel has used assassination and targeted-killing more than any other country in the West, in many cases endangering the lives of civilians. But I also discovered a long history of profound \u2014 and often rancorous \u2014 internal debates over how the state should be preserved. Can a nation use the methods of terrorism? Can it harm innocent civilians in the process? What are the costs? Where is the line?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIncreasingly, people want to talk. It was during a conversation in 2011 with a senior officer in a North Tel Aviv cafe that I heard for the first time about how Sharon had ordered that transport plane carrying Arafat to be shot down in 1982. He described everything in detail but set a stiff condition for publication of the story \u2014 another person had to describe the event on the record as well. Only by doing that could I publish the story. I went to see that person, knowing how difficult it would be to get him to speak about the episode. I approached in a roundabout manner before I touched on the relevant point. The man looked at me with his steely gaze, but then a softer and slightly sad expression came over his face. \u201cFor more than 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been waiting for someone to come and ask me about this story.\u201d\n\nNo target thwarted, vexed and bedeviled the Israeli assassination apparatus more than Yasir Arafat, the charismatic P.L.O. leader who died in 2004. Sometimes he would simply escape, and sometimes the officials overseeing an effort would call it off because the target could not be confirmed or because the price in civilian lives was deemed too high. Time and again, the desire to kill Arafat placed Israel at the center of the ongoing debate about what a nation can and cannot do to survive.\n\nIn the years after Arafat founded Fatah, a forerunner of the P.L.O., in 1959, Mossad dismissed him and his friends as students and intellectuals. By 1965, when Fatah was carrying out its first guerrilla and terror operations against Israel, Rafi Eitan, the chief of Mossad operations in Europe (no relation to Raful Eitan, the I.D.F. general), asked the Mossad director, Meir Amit, to order Caesarea to break into an apartment that Arafat was using as an operational base in Frankfurt and kill him. \u201cWe can do it easily,\u201d he wrote to Amit. \u201cWe have access to the target, and this is an opportunity that we may not get again.\u201d According to Eitan, Amit refused to sign off. He didn\u2019t see the group as much more than a gang of young thugs. \u201cToo bad they didn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d Eitan told me decades later. \u201cWe could have saved ourselves a lot of effort, heartache and sorrow.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, it was Eitan\u2019s attitude that prevailed. The belief that assassinating the P.L.O. leader would solve the entire Palestinian problem would be the predominant opinion in Israeli intelligence for many years to come. \u201cIsrael must strike at the heart of the terror organizations,\u201d Yehuda Arbel, the Shin Bet commander in Jerusalem and the West Bank in the late 1960s, wrote in his diary. \u201cThe elimination of Abu Ammar\u201d \u2014 Arafat \u2014 \u201cis a precondition to finding a solution to the Palestinian problem.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd this is exactly what Israel would try to do, numerous times. Sometimes the efforts involved direct military action. Right after the Six Day War, Arafat launched a series of guerrilla operations from East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Acting on a tip, Israeli soldiers stormed the house where he was based, minutes too late. They found his food still warm on the table.\n\nSome plans were more elaborate. Inspired by the movie \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate,\u201d the Israelis spent three months in 1968 trying to transform a Palestinian prisoner into a programmed killer. Within five hours of being released to carry out his mission, he had turned himself in to the local police, handed over his pistol and explained that Israeli intelligence had tried to brainwash him into killing Arafat.\n\nThese and many other attempts not only failed and not only caused Israel much embarrassment; they also increased Arafat\u2019s popularity, as he told the tales of his miraculous escapes.\n\nBeyond securing the adoration of his own people, Arafat also began to make many powerful friends abroad. The East German leader Erich Honecker regarded him as a true revolutionary, like Fidel Castro, and his spies provided Palestinians with intelligence and weapons. At the same time, the C.I.A. had cultivated Arafat through a back channel, an effort with support at the highest levels. As the 1970s drew to a close, Arafat seemed untouchable. He was a de facto head of state with broad support. Openly assassinating such a man would break all of the norms of international relations. The Israelis looked on and ground their teeth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy 1979, Israel and the P.L.O. had settled into a rote and seemingly endless pattern of strikes and counterstrikes. And then a horrifying murder raised the tension even higher. On April 22, 1979, a terror squad from the Palestine Liberation Front, a P.L.O.-affiliated group, landed in a rubber dinghy on the beach at Nahariya, an Israeli city six miles south of the Lebanese border. One of its four members was Samir Kuntar, then 16 years old. After trying to break into a house and being frightened away by gunfire, and after killing a policeman who tried to arrest them, the men broke into a family\u2019s apartment and took Danny Haran, and his daughter Einat, 4, as hostages. They dragged them to the beach, where soldiers and police had already deployed, and a firefight ensued. Kuntar shot Danny, killing him, and then smashed Einat\u2019s head with the butt of his rifle until she was dead. Danny\u2019s wife, Smadar, hid in a crawl space in their apartment with their 2-year-old daughter, Yael. Smadar covered the toddler\u2019s mouth with her hand, to keep her from crying out and allowing the attackers to find them. In her panic, she smothered her child.\n\nIn the wake of the Nahariya atrocity, Raful Eitan, the I.D.F. general, gave the regional commander Avigdor Ben-Gal a simple order: \u201cKill them all,\u201d meaning all members of the P.L.O. and anyone connected to the organization in Lebanon. With Eitan\u2019s blessing, Ben-Gal appointed the man he considered the I.D.F.\u2019s top expert in special ops, Meir Dagan, to lead the efforts in south Lebanon. The three of them set up the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon From Foreigners. The operation ran almost entirely without the authorization or knowledge of the rest of the military, the defense ministry, the intelligence agencies or the government. (I did not speak with Eitan, who died in 2004, about any of these events.)\n\nBetween 1979 and early 1983, when it disbanded, the Front killed hundreds of people. David Agmon was head of the I.D.F.\u2019s Northern Command staff, one of the few who knew of Dagan\u2019s secret ops. \u201cThe aim,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to cause chaos among the Palestinians and Syrians in Lebanon, without leaving an Israeli fingerprint, to give them the feeling that they were constantly under attack and to instill them with a sense of insecurity.\u201d In order to do that, Dagan and his crew recruited Lebanese locals: Druze, Christians and Shiite Muslims who resented the Palestinians and wanted them out of Lebanon.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 1981, Prime Minister Menachem Begin appointed Ariel Sharon as defense minister of Israel. Begin, a hero of the underground movement in Israel\u2019s prestate era, had a deep admiration for the former general \u2014 \u201ca glorious commander of armies,\u201d he called him \u2014 but he was somewhat apprehensive about Sharon\u2019s unwillingness to accept the authority of his superiors. \u201cSharon is liable to attack the Knesset with tanks,\u201d one of Begin\u2019s deputies half-joked two years earlier.\n\nSharon quickly raised the stakes. He put a renewed focus on Arafat and gave the greenlight for Ben-Gal and Dagan to carry out an operation that, if it succeeded, would change the course of Middle East history. Operation Olympia called for Israeli agents to plant a massive set of bombs under a V.I.P. dais under construction in a Beirut stadium where, on Jan. 1, 1982, the P.L.O. was going to celebrate the anniversary of its first operation against Israel. With the push of one button, they would achieve the destruction of the entire Palestinian leadership.\n\nEverything was ready, including powerful explosive charges already secreted beneath the dais, as well as three vehicles loaded with explosives that were supposed to be parked on the streets around the stadium; these were to detonate about a minute after the dais exploded, when the panic was at its height and the survivors of the initial blast were trying to flee the scene. The resulting death and destruction were expected to be \u201cof unprecedented proportions, even in terms of Lebanon,\u201d in the words of a very senior officer of the Northern Command. But a group of worried AMAN officers, as well as the deputy defense minister, went to Begin and demanded that he order Dagan to call it off. \u201cYou can\u2019t just kill a whole stadium,\u201d one officer recalled telling Begin. \u201cThe whole world will be after us.\u201d Begin shut down the operation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBy then, Sharon was at work on a far grander scheme. On June 6, the I.D.F. stormed across the border into Lebanon. An army of 76,000 troops, 800 tanks and 1,500 armored personnel carriers advanced northward and within two weeks had commenced a harrowing siege and bombardment of Beirut\u2019s western neighborhoods. Sharon presented the war as a limited incursion, aimed only at removing P.L.O. artillery that threatened Israelis, but he in fact had a far more radical vision: Israeli forces would conquer Lebanon and expel the Palestinians to Jordan, where they would be a majority able to establish a Palestinian state in place of the Hashemite Kingdom. This, Sharon reckoned, would eliminate the Palestinian demand for a state in the West Bank, which thus would become part of Israel. In that fantastical plan, there was one more critical element: killing Yasir Arafat. Sharon believed that in a war against a terrorist organization, symbols were as important as body counts.\n\nTo this end, a special task force was set up, code-named Salt Fish. Sharon appointed his two experts on special ops, Dagan and Rafi Eitan, who was then adviser to the defense minister on counterterror, to oversee it. \u201cI thought that hitting him would have changed the course of history,\u201d Dagan told me. \u201cArafat was not only a Palestinian leader, but a kind of founding father of the Palestinian nation. Killing him would unleash a large part of the internal conflicts inside the P.L.O. and significantly hinder its capability to make any strategic decisions from then on.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Uzi Dayan, the outgoing chief of the Sayeret Matkal, the Israeli army\u2019s elite commando unit, took command of Salt Fish. AMAN hooked up to the telephone exchanges in Beirut and tried to trace Arafat\u2019s movements. The preferred method of attack would be an airstrike. \u201cIt was a very complicated mission,\u201d Dayan said. \u201cWe had to collate the information from the various sources, to understand which building or cave was the right one, to pinpoint it on the map, to narrow it down to the precise coordinates, to transmit them to the air force, giving them enough time to put a plane in the air and bomb it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nArafat understood that it was not a coincidence that bombs were repeatedly falling on places he was about to enter or had just left, and he kept breaking his routine. The team, growing desperate, came up with increasingly provocative schemes.\n\nOn July 3, 1982, Uri Avnery, a left-wing Israeli magazine editor, along with a reporter and photographer, crossed the front line in Beirut to interview Arafat in the heart of the city. The meeting was highly controversial in Israel. Arafat was seen as the country\u2019s worst enemy, and this was his first formal meeting with Israelis. The Salt Fish team decided to take advantage of the opportunity to let the three journalists unknowingly lead a group of assassins straight to Arafat. An argument broke out among the Salt Fish team members: Was it right to endanger, and probably kill, the Israeli citizens? The answer, they decided, was that it was. But Arafat suspected that Mossad might be keeping tabs on Avnery. His security guards took strict deceptive countermeasures, and the Salt Fish team lost their trail in the alleys of south Beirut.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the days went by, Sharon and Raful Eitan (the I.D.F. general) put increasing pressure on the air force and the Salt Fish teams to get Arafat. \u201cThe feeling was that it was something personal for Sharon,\u201d Ivry said. \u201cI thought that it was messy, with the danger of harming civilians.\u201d Uzi Dayan had the same misgivings. \u201cArafat was saved by two things,\u201d he said. \u201cHis interminable good luck and me.\u201d\n\nDayan thought Arafat was a legitimate target but not if it meant killing many civilians. \u201cRaful used to blow up with anger,\u201d Dayan continued. \u201cHe\u2019d call me up and say: \u2018I understand you have information on such and such a place. Why aren\u2019t the planes in the air?\u2019 I replied that it was impossible because there were a lot of people around. Raful said: \u2018Forget about it. I\u2019ll take responsibility for it.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t prepared to allow it. Raful would not teach me the ethics of war.\u201d\n\nEitan would remind Dayan that he did not have the authority to decide whether or not to drop a bomb. But Dayan nonetheless found a way to take a hand in the decision-making. \u201cAll I had to do was to report when the target was ripe from the intelligence point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cSo from that point on, each time we knew that bombing would lead to massive civilian casualties, we reported that the target wasn\u2019t ripe from the intelligence angle.\u201d\n\nPerhaps sensing this resistance, Eitan at one point decided to take more direct action. On the evening of Aug. 4, he asked the head of the air-force operations department, Aviem Sella, to come and see him. The two men had a close relationship, and Eitan had a soft spot for Sella, a promising officer considered a potential commander of the air force.\n\nEitan greeted Sella and told him that the next day he wouldn\u2019t be working in Canary as usual but would be \u201cgoing on a trip.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything like our last trip together?\u201d asked Sella, alluding to a visit to Beirut in May, in preparation for the invasion and the operation to assassinate Arafat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSomething like it,\u201d Eitan replied. \u201cBut from above. Meet me tomorrow morning at Hatzor\u201d \u2014 an air force base to the south. \u201cYou\u2019ll fly the plane, and I\u2019ll navigate and operate the combat systems. We\u2019re going to bomb Beirut.\u201d\n\nSella was convinced he wasn\u2019t hearing right. \u201cIt was totally insane,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was in shock. If someone had told me that the chief of staff, who isn\u2019t really an airman, was taking the head of the air-force operations department for a break in the running of the war while they bombed Beirut, I would never have believed it.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the two met at Hatzor, climbed into an F-4 fighter jet and set out with three other planes on an expedition to bomb an office block in west Beirut, where, according to Salt Fish operatives, Arafat was supposed to be attending a meeting. \u201cRaful\u2019s functioning was so-so; I think he was feeling a little bit sick,\u201d Sella said. \u201cI did my own navigation. He operated the munitions systems, which by today\u2019s terms were rather primitive. We made two bombing runs over the target, and then another one to see if we\u2019d hit it. Raful was happy, and we flew home to Israel.\u201d Arafat was once again saved by timing: The bombs had fallen just before he arrived.\n\nSharon\u2019s intention to kill Arafat, however, never wavered. After the battles in Beirut were over and the P.L.O. leaders and their forces had been evacuated, Sharon and Eitan \u201cwere dying, simply dying, to kill him,\u201d said Amos Gilboa, who was then a brigadier general and the head of AMAN\u2019s Research Division. Sharon\u2019s team now realized, though, that an open assassination would only make Arafat a martyr. Undaunted, Sharon instructed the intelligence organizations to find a more subtle way to dispose of the P.L.O. leader. Operation Salt Fish morphed into Operation Goldfish. But the mission remained the same, and Sharon ordered that it be given top priority. Every day, the Goldfish team gathered in Gilboa\u2019s office. \u201cWe had a thousand matters that were a hundred times more important,\u201d Gilboa recalled. But Sharon insisted.\n\nEven the near disaster of October 1982 \u2014 coming within one jittery pilot\u2019s finger of murdering a flight crew, a doctor and 30 wounded children \u2014 did not weaken Sharon\u2019s hand or dissuade him from the idea of targeting Arafat in the air. In fact, he became even more reckless. When Mossad reported that Arafat was flying more commercial flights, with the P.L.O. often buying the entire first-class or business-class cabin for him and his aides, Sharon decided that such flights would be legitimate targets. The plane would have to be shot down over the open sea, far from the coast, so that it would take investigators a long time to find the wreckage and establish whether it had been hit by a missile or had crashed because of engine failure. Deep water would be preferable, to make recovery even more difficult. (Oded Shamir, Sharon\u2019s adjutant at the time, says that all the targeted planes were private aircraft. However, at least three officers present at these incidents have told me that some of the targets were commercial airliners.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe air force drew up a detailed plan. They found a spot over the Mediterranean where there was commercial air traffic but no continuous radar coverage by any nation and where the sea below was three miles deep, making a salvage operation extremely difficult, perhaps impossible. Executing the attack in this ideal spot, however, meant there would be a narrow window of opportunity.\n\nBecause the operation would take place far from Israeli airspace, beyond Israel\u2019s radar and radio range, the air force had to set up an airborne command post, in the form of a Boeing 707 fitted with radar and communications equipment. Sella would command the operation from this aircraft.\n\nUnder Sharon\u2019s direct orders, then, surveillance of Arafat was maintained continuously, and four F-16 and F-15 fighters were placed on interception alert. Over the course of nine weeks, from November 1982 to early January 1983, these planes scrambled at least five times to intercept and destroy airliners believed to be carrying Arafat, only to be called back soon after takeoff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGilboa expressed his sharp opposition to these operations time and again. \u201cIt was clear to me that the air force would execute it as well as could be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had additional responsibility.\u201d It was Gilboa\u2019s job to evaluate the political, military and economic implications of each operation. \u201cI told chief of staff Eitan that it could ruin the state internationally if it were known that we downed a civilian airliner.\u201d\n\nIn each instance, air-force commanders intentionally obstructed the operation, refusing to obey orders that they believed to be manifestly illegal. \u201cWhen we received the order,\u201d Sella said, \u201cI went to see Eitan. I told him: \u2018Chief of staff, we do not intend to carry this out. It simply will not happen. I understand that the minister of defense is dominant here. No one dares to stand up to him, and therefore we will make it technically impossible.\u2019 Raful looked at me and never said anything. I took his silence as consent.\u201d\n\nIn one instance, with a commercial plane believed to be carrying Arafat from Amman to Tunisia over the Mediterranean, and the Israeli jets closing in, Eitan asked Gilboa if he thought their target was definitely on the plane. The two were standing in the central space inside Canary.\n\n\u201cChief of staff, do you really want to hear what I think?\u201d Gilboa asked. Eitan nodded.\n\nGilboa could feel his heart thumping in his chest. He stalled, elaborating all the many reasons for believing Arafat might be on the plane, then enumerating all the many reasons to doubt he was on the plane.\n\nEitan grew impatient. \u201cGilboa,\u201d he barked. \u201cYes or no?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gut feeling,\u201d Gilboa said, \u201cis that he isn\u2019t on the plane.\u201d\n\nEitan turned around and went to the red secure phone at the side of the room. He told Sharon the operation would have to wait for another day.\n\nIn another instance, the radios on the flying command post, the air-force Boeing 707, were intentionally set to the wrong frequencies, blacking out communications long enough to make the whole operation impossible. In yet another, Sella simply misled Eitan, informing him that the target plane had been identified too late and there was a danger that the interception would be detected. On the remaining occasions, \u201cwe simply drew the time out until the plane had left the zones in which it would have been possible to hit them without discerning what had happened.\u201d\n\nIn the end, though, Sharon\u2019s plans for an intentional war crime were finally derailed by his own past unscrupulousness. Under intense pressure from the Israeli public and after heavy international criticism, Begin was compelled to establish a judicial inquiry into the massacre at the Beirut refugee camps. The commission determined that the Phalange militia was directly responsible for the massacre, but ruled that some Israelis, among them Sharon, had to be held accountable as well for permitting the Phalange to enter the camps when it was clear the organization would take the opportunity to commit atrocities. Sharon was forced to resign as defense minister. \u201cGradually,\u201d Gilboa said, \u201cthe awareness grew that Arafat was a political matter, and he must not be seen as a target for assassination.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSharon, of course, recovered from the blow, and in 2001 became Israel\u2019s prime minister. He came to a gradual understanding with the administration of George W. Bush under which the United States would support Israel even as it waged a massive campaign of targeted killings, the biggest in the country\u2019s history. In exchange, Sharon would cease settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories. And Arafat would be off limits.\n\nThe campaign seemed to work. Hamas sought a cease-fire and stopped dispatching suicide bombers. But Sharon, too, underwent a change, beginning for the first time to consider a political solution to the problem of the Palestinians. \u201cThe moment Sharon understood that the settlements are a burden and not an advantage,\u201d said Dov Weissglas, Sharon\u2019s chief of staff and close adviser, \u201che had no problem evacuating them and turning his back on the settlers.\u201d Sharon, the sworn hawk, \u201cwanted to exit the stage as a battle-worn general who became a great peacemaker.\u201d\n\nSharon had come to accept that there was no way to preclude the creation of an independent Palestinian state, but this didn\u2019t decrease his loathing for its leader. In Israel, a new round of discussions were held over how to deal with Arafat, and many suggestions were put forward: exile him to a desert island, put embarrassing videos of him on the internet, release the many documents seized from his office ordering the transfer of funds to terrorists. Some heads of the intelligence community and the army, as well as cabinet ministers, still thought that he should be killed.\n\nOn March 22, 2004, an Israeli helicopter gunship struck down Sheikh Ahmed Yassin on the streets of Gaza City. Yassin was a founder of the Hamas movement and, like Arafat, a political leader of world renown. On April 23, Sharon told an Israeli reporter that he was no longer bound by his 2001 agreement with Bush, saying \u201cthis commitment of mine no longer exists.\u201d Asked to clarify if he meant harming Arafat, he answered, \u201cI do not think this matter can be made any clearer.\u201d\n\nAnd then, suddenly, Arafat, the man who had managed to elude death so many times, succumbed to a mysterious infection that led to a stroke. He died on Nov. 11, 2004, at 75. To this day, an argument rages among forensic medicine experts and laboratory chiefs over the cause of death and whether traces of polonium, a radioactive material that has been used in assassinations, were or were not found on Arafat\u2019s clothes and remains. Israeli spokespersons categorically denied that Israel was in any way involved in Arafat\u2019s death.\n\nIn one of our last conversations before he succumbed to cancer in early 2016, Meir Dagan tried to explain why Sharon had spent so much of his life trying to kill Arafat, even as it became clear that killing him would do little to solve the larger problems that confronted his nation. \u201cSharon saw Arafat as a murderer, a Jew murderer,\u201d he said. \u201cSharon himself was quite a tough man, quite callous, and sometimes also quite a bastard. But he took to heart every casualty of every terror attack. There were some things that he simply could not let pass.\u201d", "title": "How Arafat Eluded Israel\u2019s Assassination Machine", "authors": ["Ronen Bergman"]}

In a statement released at midnight on Dec. 18, 2016, the four other members of the group suggested that Ms. Cabello had turned her back on them, communicating her intentions to leave \u201cthrough her representatives.\u201d Ms. Cabello, in a subsequent statement of her own, said that she had long been open about her desire to explore a solo career and was blindsided by what amounted to a public excommunication.\n\nOver a feast of Cuban food at one of her family\u2019s favorite restaurants in Miami, and in a subsequent interview in New York a week later, she agreed to speak at length about how things fell apart.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe said that her collaboration in late 2015 with Mr. Mendes \u2014 the first time a Fifth Harmony member released music under her own name \u2014 had created tension; that she had asked to help write lyrics for Fifth Harmony songs and was rebuffed; that she initially wanted to stay in the group while working on a solo album but the other members shut her out instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was just curious and I wanted to learn and I saw all these people around me making music, writing songs and being so free,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to do that and it did not work.\u201d\n\nMs. Cabello said that after the awkwardness of her collaboration with Mr. Mendes, things further soured when she began attending writing sessions with producers including Diplo, Cashmere Cat and Benny Blanco. Eventually, she said, she was given an ultimatum.\n\n\u201cIt became clear that it was not possible to do solo stuff and be in the group at the same time,\u201d she said. So she made her choice, basing it on what she said was her conviction that \u201cif anyone wants to explore their individuality, it\u2019s not right for people to tell you no.\u201d\n\nSince the breakup, Ms. Cabello has tried to move on from hard feelings, throwing herself into \u201cCamila.\u201d (She changed its name from \u201cThe Hurting, the Healing, the Loving\u201d partly to wash her hands of drama.)\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been easy. In August last year, the remaining members took a less-than-subtle jab at their former groupmate with a stunt that opened a high-profile performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. As the camera zoomed in on a dark, elevated platform showing five women in silhouette, one was dramatically yanked off the stage as if hit by a truck.\n\nMs. Cabello\u2019s eyes welled up as she recalled watching it live. She had been at home in the living room with her mother. \u201cIt definitely hurt my feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it, I wasn\u2019t prepared for it \u2014 especially because at that point I\u2019d moved on from it. I was just like, \u2018What? Why?\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe gathered herself. \u201cI have to make space for the good stuff to happen in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like holding onto the past, especially when it\u2019s stuff that, in my opinion, is just petty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike the pop astronauts who went solo before her, Ms. Cabello is now both a known quantity and a blank slate, caught between an outsize past and an uncertain future. Her first single as a solo artist was an early artifact of this wobbly developmental period.\n\n\u201cCrying in the Club\u201d \u2014 an arch, dancehall-flecked power ballad released last spring \u2014 was produced by Benny Blanco from an original demo written and recorded by Sia. The track underperformed commercially and was left off the final track list of \u201cCamila.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality of that song is it doesn\u2019t feel or sound like Camila,\u201d said Roger Gold, Ms. Cabello\u2019s manager and a former lawyer for Fifth Harmony. Mr. Gold said it took time for Ms. Cabello, free of the army of handlers and tacticians who maintained creative control of the girl group, to feel comfortable asserting herself in front of more seasoned collaborators. \u201cThe most important learning in this whole thing was that we were most successful when Camila trusted in her own instincts,\u201d he said.\n\nA breakthrough came while she was working with the producer Frank Dukes, born Adam Feeney, who has made his name as a prolific but low-key co-conspirator of self-styled stars like Drake and Lorde. Many potential collaborators had come to the studio armed with sleek, brassy Top 40 munitions in the style of Fifth Harmony hits. But Mr. Feeney\u2019s approach was more nonchalant.\n\nOver sushi during an early session with Ms. Cabello last winter, he played her a deceptively simple instrumental with a prominent salsa piano riff. It reminded the singer of her birthplace, and she wrote the chorus for what became \u201cHavana\u201d on the spot.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not another artist in the world who could have done that song \u2014 she just owns it,\u201d Mr. Feeney said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

Ms. Cabello said she took inspiration from the Latin music that soundtracked her childhood, as well as more contemporary reggaeton revisionists like Calle 13 and J Balvin. Then she blended those sounds with the auteur pop of artists like her friends Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, hoping to unearth her own original recipe.\n\n\u201cI feel like the best way to come up with something new and different is just to be the you-est you possible,\u201d Ms. Cabello said. \u201cIf you pull from all the different little parts of yourself, nobody can replicate that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Poleman, of iHeartMedia, said it is Ms. Cabello\u2019s sensibilities as a songwriter that will define her career. With \u201cHavana\u201d and \u201cBad Things,\u201d he said, \u201cshe has quickly established herself as one of the most important young artists in pop music.\n\n\u201cIt always comes down to whether or not you have a song that resonates,\u201d he added. \u201cI know she spends a lot of time thinking about that.\u201d\n\nIn an under-lit, overpriced restaurant in Midtown Manhattan after her break in Miami had ended, Ms. Cabello, who has lately imagined herself as a vegan, provoked a kale salad while bopping along to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Way You Make Me Feel.\u201d The song had been a highlight from a recent Christmas Eve karaoke night with her family (she was the only one who knew its final \u201cGive it to me\u201d pre-chorus), and she grieved for her cocoon.\n\nIn 48 hours, she would perform before Mariah Carey at \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest\u201d in a bejeweled, ankle-length coat and metallic jumpsuit that made her look like a glamorous conquistador. Then she had a tour to design, and music video concepts to finalize and a social media campaign to figure out.\n\nShe started to explain why things were trickier now, how she no longer had anyone to pick up the slack.\n\n\u201cEven when there\u2019s a day off, there\u2019s never really a day off, because there\u2019s so many decisions to be made and you\u2019re always rushing to make stuff,\u201d she said, as Jackson ad-libbed in the background.

Many of the pupils were children of cadres and party members killed during the wars against the French and the Americans. Pupils were brought from different areas of Vietnam, from the South as well as from the North. They reportedly represented around 30 nationalities, although the nationalities were not specified. They arrived at different times, they had different levels of education and they were different ages.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The schools were concentrated on a limited piece of land (less than a square kilometer) that lacked sufficient classroom space, as well as sufficient space for housing, outside activities, production or social activities. Moreover, despite their political pedigrees, the students came with a frustratingly broad range of political convictions. One group followed the Hanoi line. This group was \u201cin the care of the Party and of Uncle and that\u2019s why they had hatred toward the Americans and their lackeys\u201d \u2014 in other words, South Vietnamese anti-communists \u2014 \u201cwho sell the country.\u201d Pupils in this group were \u201cconnected to socialism, felt absolute trust in Uncle Ho, and in the Workers Party of Vietnam.\u201d On the other side of the spectrum, there were pupils who had experienced, in one report, the \u201cputrid American influence\u201d and who lacked discipline, a sense of national identity and love for the nation.\n\nIn addition to these difficulties, there was a shortage of teachers, and those who were there, according to an assessment by the North Vietnamese Ministry of Education, had very low educational levels. Many teachers wanted to return home. Many of them did not have revolutionary morale and thus made serious mistakes, such as illicit liaisons among male and female cadres and violations of the principles of socialist education, like hitting or harshly disciplining students.\n\nAdministrators were a problem, too. Many of them were still \u201cunder the old conventions and backward concepts,\u201d according to one analysis, that superseded revolutionary notions of friendship, love and service. Their bad attitudes, according to the Ministry of Education, prevailed over their commitments to the party and its youth organizations. Material problems aggravated ideological difficulties. Living quarters were overcrowded and did not meet hygienic requirements. Classrooms were not sufficiently equipped. Sometimes children of very different ages had to study together. Teaching materials arrived slowly.\n\nChina had three main considerations in hosting an extension of the Vietnamese educational system. First was solidarity with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. That feeling arose from the close alliance between the Chinese and Vietnamese communists during the war against France, when the Chinese provided the means for continuing the war and the Vietnamese responded with gratitude and emulation. Chinese communists saw the achievements of the Vietnamese communists as an extension of their own revolutionary agenda.\n\nSecond was competition with the Soviet Union for leadership of the international communist movement and for influence in what were then called \u201cthird world\u201d countries, which included Vietnam. The Sino-Soviet competition developed in the late 1950s and continued through the 1960s. Giving their Vietnamese allies a safe haven for schools just across the border was something that the Soviet Union was not in a position to provide to the Vietnamese, and this created a venue for nurturing both practical assistance and a spirit of sympathetic patronage.\n\nFinally, the program offered an opportunity to support a war that kept the United States militarily occupied beyond China\u2019s borders \u2014 rendering America less of a threat to China itself.\n\nDespite its difficulties, the system persevered until mid-1975, when it was terminated and all students, teachers and administrators returned to Vietnam. By 1975, North Vietnam was on the verge of conquering the south, and the need for educational facilities that were out of harm\u2019s way was lessening. But Sino-Vietnamese relations were souring as well. Hanoi\u2019s final push toward Saigon was fueled by Soviet assistance, and the consolidation of communist rule across Vietnam turned an ally of China into a threat. While it is possible that when Vietnam and China went to war in 1978 there were some Vietnamese soldiers who had once studied on Chinese soil, there are nevertheless many who continue to cherish their study years in China.", "title": "How China Used Schools to Win Over Hanoi", "authors": ["Olga Dror"]}

In ensuing years, more than 25 \u201cG.I. coffeehouses\u201d opened up near military bases in the United States and at a number of bases overseas.\n\nOver the course of six years, the coffeehouse network would play a central role in some of the G.I. movement\u2019s most significant actions. At the Oleo Strut coffeehouse in Killeen, Tex., local staff and G.I.s mobilized to support the Fort Hood 43 \u2014 a large group of black soldiers who were arrested at a meeting to discuss their refusal to deploy for riot control duty at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. A black veteran present at the meeting described its mood: \u201cA lot of black G.I.s knew what the thing was going to be about and they weren\u2019t going to go and fight their own people.\u201d Army authorities were caught off guard by the publicity the coffeehouse brought to the case, and began to examine their strategies for dealing with political expression among the ranks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

After G.I. and civilian activists created intense public pressure, officials quietly dropped all charges, signaling a shift in how the military would respond to soldiers expressing dissent.\n\nDuring its brief lifetime, the G.I. coffeehouse network was subjected to attacks from all sides \u2014 investigated by the F.B.I. and congressional committees, infiltrated by law enforcement, harassed by military authorities and, in a number of startling cases, terrorized by local vigilantes. In 1970, at the Fort Dix coffeehouse project in Wrightstown, N.J., G.I.s and civilians were celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day when a live grenade flew in through an open door; it exploded, seriously injuring two Fort Dix soldiers and a civilian. Another popular coffeehouse, the Covered Wagon in Mountain Home, Idaho (near a major Air Force base), was a frequent target of harassment by outraged locals, who finally burned it to the ground.\n\nThough their numbers dwindled as the war drew to a close in the mid-1970s, G.I. coffeehouses left an indelible mark on the Vietnam era. While popular mythology often places the antiwar movement at odds with American troops, the history of G.I. coffeehouses, and the G.I. movement of which they were a part, paints a very different picture. Over the course of the war, thousands of military service members from every branch \u2014 active-duty G.I.s, veterans, nurses and even officers \u2014 expressed their opposition to American policy in Vietnam. They joined forces with civilian antiwar organizations that, particularly after 1968, focused significant energy and resources on developing social and political bonds with American service members. Hoping to build the resistance that was already taking shape in the Army, activists at G.I. coffeehouses worked directly with service members on hundreds of political projects and demonstrations, despite relentless government surveillance, infiltration and harassment.\n\nThe unprecedented eruption of resistance and activism by American troops is critical to understanding the history of the Vietnam War. The G.I. movement and related phenomenon created a significant crisis for the American military, which feared exactly the kind of alliance between civilians and soldiers that Fred Gardner had in mind when he opened the first G.I. coffeehouse in 1968. Despite the extraordinary political and cultural impact that dissenting soldiers made throughout the Vietnam era, their voices have been nearly erased from history, replaced by a stereotypical image of loyal, patriotic soldiers antagonized and spat upon by ungrateful antiwar activists. In the decades since the war\u2019s end, countless Hollywood movies, books, political speeches and celebrated documentaries have repeated this image, obscuring the war\u2019s deep unpopularity among the ranks and the countless ways that American troops expressed their opposition.\n\nThis historical erasure serves a distinct purpose, casting dissent \u2014 from wearing an antiwar T-shirt to kneeling during the national anthem \u2014 as inherently disrespectful, even abusive, to American soldiers. A fuller reckoning with the era\u2019s history would begin by acknowledging the countless G.I.s and civilians who stood together against the war. G.I. coffeehouses are a vital window onto this history, showing us places where men and women came together to share their common revulsion at the war in Vietnam, and to begin organizing a collective effort to make it stop.", "title": "How Coffeehouses Fueled the Vietnam Peace Movement", "authors": ["David L.

Now, regulators have quietly steered many of the companies into mergers with larger banks to try to absorb their losses, but that has created a worsening problem of bad loans and overvalued assets throughout the banking system.\n\nEconomists say that as many as 40 percent of the loans carried on the books of Iranian banks may be delinquent.\n\n\u201cThe whole financial system in Iran is in a very fragile state,\u201d said Borghan N.

In December, a lawmaker, Mahmoud Sadeghi, released a document listing the Top 20 debtors who had failed to meet payment deadlines for Sarmayeh Bank, which is co-owned by a pension fund for teachers. The loans totaled $1.9 billion, and almost all appeared to be held by well-known insiders.\n\nAmong them was Hossein Hedayati, a business tycoon and former member of the Revolutionary Guards, whose swift rise was so conspicuous that websites speculated about the sources of his sudden wealth. The document released by the lawmaker showed that Mr. Hedayati owed $285 million, and in a television program discussing the loan, another lawmaker, Mohammad Hassannejad, accused Mr. Hedayati of using a series of front companies to swing the loans and hide his role.\n\nMr. Hedayati dialed in to the program, sputtering with rage; he denied borrowing from Sarmayeh and threated to \u201csue everyone,\u201d but has yet to follow through on the threat.\n\nAfter the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the new Islamic Republic initially nationalized all banks, among other industries. It also created a variety of semiofficial holding companies controlled by the supreme leader, senior clerics or top military commanders. Over the years, many of the companies have evolved into sprawling conglomerates with major roles in even the ostensibly private economy.\n\nClerics controlled religious foundations, called bonyads, that acquired commercial businesses. The largest of these, under the supreme leader, now makes up \u201c15 to 20 percent\u201d of the Iranian economy, according to an estimate by Hooshang Amirahmadi, an economist at Rutgers University who studies Iran. The elite Revolutionary Guard Corps controls a separate business empire.\n\nAll the semiofficial holding companies have major advantages over private businesses in favorable access to capital, tax exemptions and political connections.

The opening of private banks or the sale of shares in state banks soon followed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut under a conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who came to power in 2005, semiofficial bodies controlled by clerics, the Revolutionary Guards or their allies dominated the newly private financial sector. An internal study produced in 2013 showed that semiofficial state bodies owned seven of the 17 private banks. Among them, the Revolutionary Guards controlled at least two, while the army, the police, the municipality of Tehran and a giant religious foundation close to the Guards controlled the others.\n\nAmong those financial institutions not directly controlled by these semiofficial bodies, the largest were usually run by individuals close to the same ruling elite, economists and diplomats say. They say that made it almost impossible for even the best-intentioned regulators to police the banks.\n\n\u201cThe involvement of opaque government institutions like the Revolutionary Guards works contrary to transparency, and the lack of transparency is a recipe for poor banking practices,\u201d said Sir Simon Gass, who was the British ambassador to Tehran from 2009 to 2011, in a recent interview. \u201cThe Central Bank of Iran tries to inject discipline into the system but with limited success.\u201d\n\nThe outsize returns promised by the banks and financial institutions lured capital that might better have gone to more productive uses, contributing to an economic downturn brought on, in part, by international sanctions imposed because of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.

In 2016, Iranians were scandalized by leaks about the high salaries of executives at state-run companies, including $50,000 bonuses paid to eight managers of a state-owned insurance company (when an Iranian laborer might earn $200 a month).\n\nIn that context, the release of a draft budget that proposed raising outlays for clerics\u2019 pet projects and their families while eliminating the $12 a month cash subsidy provided to 30 million Iranians and raising fuel prices by 50 percent provided the spark that ignited the protests.\n\nThey were upset to read about the $2 million \u2014 a 9 percent increase \u2014 that went to the son of the late Ayatollah Shahab ad-Din Muhammad Hussein Marashi Najafi to maintain his father\u2019s library, and the $15 million provided to the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, to publish the late leader\u2019s works.\n\nBut some Iranians had already had enough. When Mr. Asgari was told in May that Caspian was closing without repaying his $42,000, he stepped outside and checked the encrypted social media app Telegram, where he found many groups for \u201cproperty losers\u201d victimized by Caspian and others like it.\n\n\u201cWe organized demonstrations in front of their head office,\u201d he said. Bowing to pressure, the government eventually refunded most of his original deposit but deducted the three interest payments he had received. (The government has since tried to block the use of Telegram in Iran.)\n\nArash Tajaloo, 42, a civil engineer in Tehran, deposited a total of $414,000 with Caspian in the spring of 2016, when the institution was promising him interest payments of as much as 30 percent a year. Caspian started restricting his withdrawals after six months, offering the excuse of temporary technical problems.\n\n\u201cThey kept buying time, week after week,\u201d he said in an interview over Telegram.\n\nA lawsuit he filed was consolidated into a class action, \u201cgiven the large number of cases,\u201d he said. He says he joined protests in front of Parliament, the presidential palace and the residence of the supreme leader, and took part in a 33-day sit-in outside the courthouse.\n\nCaspian has promised to repay him about one-eighth of his original deposits, he said, but he has yet to see any of it.\n\n\u201cWe still have not received either our deposits or the interest on them for 13 months,\u201d he said.", "title": "How Corruption and Cronyism in Banking Fueled Iran\u2019s Protests", "authors": ["Thomas Erdbrink", "David D.

If you have 60 years of radical individualism and ruthless meritocracy, you\u2019re going to end up with a society that is atomized, distrustful and divided.\n\nBut some emphasize the intellectual. The people who designed our liberal democratic system made fundamental errors, which are now coming home to roost. Notre Dame political scientist Patrick Deneen falls into this camp. His new book, \u201cWhy Liberalism Failed,\u201d is a challenge to those of us who want to revive the liberal democratic order. It will attract a cult following among those who are losing faith in the whole project.\n\nDeneen argues that liberal democracy has betrayed its promises. It was supposed to foster equality, but it has led to great inequality and a new aristocracy. It was supposed to give average people control over government, but average people feel alienated from government. It was supposed to foster liberty, but it creates a degraded popular culture in which consumers become slave to their appetites.\n\nMany young people feel trapped in a system they have no faith in. Deneen quotes one of his students: \u201cBecause we view humanity \u2014 and thus its institutions \u2014 as corrupt and selfish, the only person we can rely upon is our self.

This is not a penalty found in your lease, but instead an offer to let you out of it.\n\nThis type of agreement would not be found in the lease.

Relatively few of us know what to say or do that can be truly helpful to a relative, friend or acquaintance who is grieving. In fact, relatively few who have suffered a painful loss know how to be most helpful to themselves. Two new books by psychotherapists who have worked extensively in the field of loss and grief are replete with stories and guidance that can help both those in mourning and the people they encounter avoid many of the common pitfalls and misunderstandings associated with grief. Both books attempt to correct false assumptions about how and how long grief might be experienced.

The other book, especially illuminating in its coverage of how people cope with different kinds of losses, is \u201cGrief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving,\u201d by Julia Samuel, who works with bereaved families both in private practice and at England\u2019s National Health Service, at St. Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington.

If you can\u2019t finish the crossword, it feels like a personal failure. But when you lose HQ \u2014 which the vast majority of players do the vast majority of the time \u2014 it often seems arbitrary and unfair, the fault of the unskilled question writers or the unsophisticated technology. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s the game. And even if you do win, the big-sounding prizes \u2014 $1,000, $2,000, $10,000 \u2014 are often reduced to pocket change when split among the sometimes hundreds of other people who also won the game. HQ is a little app that channels big feelings about the fundamental lie of the meritocracy. Every session becomes an opportunity to rail against life\u2019s injustices.\n\nThe avatar for all those feelings is Scott Rogowsky, the game\u2019s usual host and its breakout star. Scott \u2014 players know him on a first-name basis \u2014 has been nicknamed \u201cQuiz Daddy\u201d by his fans. He calls his players \u201cHQties.\u201d On first viewing, Scott can come across as incredibly annoying. The moments in the game between the actual presentation of questions \u2014 when Scott is explaining the rules, making jokes, or dropping Phish references \u2014 can be excruciating. But after a few plays, Scott ingratiates himself into your psyche in a third-grade crush kind of way. Only after playing a game without Scott \u2014 a rotating crew of lackluster substitute hosts occasionally fills in \u2014 does his brilliance at his job become obvious: his unwavering eye contact; his punning proficiency; his confidence and coolness under pressure; his belief in himself, and in the game. Even when HQ crumbles, Scott is our rock.\n\nScott\u2019s folk hero status was cemented by yet another unforced error by the HQ team. When a reporter from The Daily Beast conducted an anodyne interview with Scott, Rus Yusupov, the co-founder and C.E.O., exploded at the \u201cunauthorized\u201d conversation, called the reporter and threatened to fire Scott if the story ran. The bizarre exchange only endeared players to Scott more. He may play our trivia overlord onscreen, but on some level, he, too, is a slave to HQ.

After incessant complaints of the app\u2019s video stalling, Scott acquired a new nickname: \u201cLag Daddy.\u201d The octopus question spawned its own in-game meme. Now the chat swims with octopus emoji.\n\nHQ\u2019s most impressive achievement lies in its re-establishment of appointment viewing in the Netflix age. You can now watch pretty much any TV show or movie whenever you want, but when your phone buzzes with an HQ notification, you have only a few minutes to enter the game. If you miss the window, you\u2019ll be forced to watch helplessly, tapping in vain, as it unfolds without you.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHQ is a throwback to TV scheduling in the pre-DVR era, the digital equivalent of NBC\u2019s Must-See TV lineup. (Scott is our Ross and our Rachel.) And the app has pulled it off by cultivating an unexpected sense of community amid the digital swamp. All the Darwinian competition, frustrating glitches and impossible questioning actually bring HQties together, bonding us through our performative trauma. The idea of actually downloading and playing the copycat app, \u201cThe Q,\u201d is preposterous, even though its relatively minuscule traffic increases players\u2019 chances of winning bigger sums.

For 15 years, he suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome so severe that he barely got out of bed. \u201cAnd for five of those years I was too weak to speak and too weak to have another person in the room with me,\u201d Mr. Bloom, now 74, said. Nonetheless, he managed to write three science-related books during those years, and recently published his seventh, \u201cHow I Accidentally Started the Sixties,\u201d a memoir of chemical and spiritual experimentation that begins in 1962. Mr. Bloom lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he runs several online discussion groups.\n\nSLEEP SOLUTION When I was fighting chronic fatigue syndrome, one of the first symptoms was insomnia. Eventually it occurred to me that my body was trying to tell me something. It didn\u2019t want to sleep the normal routine eight hours. So I broke the eight hours into two four-hour shifts, and started to do one of the four-hour shifts from 11 o\u2019clock in the morning to 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the other one from 4 o\u2019clock in the morning until 8 o\u2019clock in the morning. And it was one of those tiny incremental things that helped me get out of the bedroom.\n\nTAKE IT EASY Sunday is a day I don\u2019t force myself to do any exercises, any push-ups, or take a bath, because I\u2019m taking it easy.", "title": "How Howard Bloom, Writer and Former Publicist, Spends His Sundays", "authors": []}

The E is subterranean for its entire route, which keeps it warm.\n\nMy editor asked me to go back and ride the E. \u201cYou called it \u2018the shelter of last resort,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI thought we should go back out to test that hypothesis.\u201d\n\nReturning over the weekend with the photographer, Benjamin Norman, I found more and more homeless people on the subway as it got later and colder. At about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, I counted 45 homeless people sleeping on a single E train. It became the subject of a front-page article on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, I interviewed more than two dozen homeless people in two nights, and learned other things about them, too: the variety of reasons they were there, the strategies they deployed to survive.\n\nBen and I developed a routine. We assessed from a distance if a person was likely to be open to talking. I approached first, with my question; he followed. After the interview, Ben asked to take the person\u2019s portrait.\n\n\u201cThis is an unsheltered population that is always in public view, and I thought it was important to give them some dignity,\u201d Ben said of his approach. That meant shooting sleeping people only from angles that did not reveal their identities; it meant not taking photos that were sensational or suggestive.\n\nIt also required composing portraits that captured the individual. \u201cWe talk about the homeless or the undomiciled as a population, but every story was different,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThey had different backgrounds, they were there for different periods of time.\u201d That informed his choices, from lens to backdrop \u2014 all of which \u201cwill factor into how a subject is perceived,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nContrary to stereotypes of the homeless as belligerent, in just two cases were people angry that we had spoken to them.

Be careful. Be kind.\n\nWe approached the homeless with those things in mind. If they were seated on the train or in wheelchairs or on the ground, we crouched down, instead of towering over them.

{"date": "2018-01-02 00:00:00", "text": "Sandy is an ideal protagonist for a novel so interested in place and culture \u2014 an observant boy with a penchant for finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. He listens intently during warm nights spent on the porch with Aunt Hager, with an occasional visit from Sister Johnson or the speechifying Madam de Carter. He overhears grown black folks parsing out the psychology of whites who want to keep blacks close to them \u2014 nursing their children, preparing their meals \u2014 but always beneath them, and withholds his own judgment, already wise enough to know he doesn\u2019t yet know enough. As a teenager Sandy sweeps up at a neighborhood barbershop, a place \u201cfilled with loud man-talk and smoke and laughter,\u201d and gets a crude sexual education from the conversations of the shop\u2019s day laborer customers and barbers, as well as plenty of lessons in playing the dozens \u2014 \u201cthe protective art of turning back a joke.\u201d He inhabits this new space the same way he inhabits every other one, simultaneously attuned to its peculiarities and somewhat set apart.\n\nIn \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d Hughes addresses the issue of respectability, the belief that promoting only the best, brightest and most palatable forms of blackness might somehow temper white bigotry. \u201c\u2018Oh, be respectable, write about nice people, show how good we are,\u2019 say the Negroes,\u201d he laments. The respectability argument is so attractive to some that nearly eight decades later it still rears its head with regard to black art and representation. For Sandy, the pressure to be respectable comes from Aunt Tempy, Aunt Hager\u2019s oldest child, who avoids visiting her washerwoman mother in an effort to preserve the illusion of her middle-class upbringing. After Hager\u2019s death, Sandy moves in with Tempy, and with his usual levelheadedness is able to see the futility of her and her husband\u2019s way of thinking: They look down on the Baptist church for its \u201cnigger music\u201d but are still made to use the servant\u2019s entrance at some of the town\u2019s finer white establishments. Sandy is nobody\u2019s fool, though: He sees the benefits their lifestyle affords him, like his own room and the freedom to read as much as he wants.\n\n\u201cNot Without Laughter\u201d is an early Great Migration novel. Many blacks in Kansas arrived from the South after emancipation, and with the advent of automation and the decline of agricultural work, blacks kept traveling north and west in search of opportunities. A migration narrative is necessarily a story of change. The author\u2019s task is to replicate the nostalgia and hope his characters feel as they set out for new futures, or the fear, resentment and loneliness of those left behind. Jimboy, the novel\u2019s most frequent migrant, sings a song that encapsulates both sides of the experience:\n\nHe begins:\n\nI got a mule to ride. I got a mule to ride. Down in the South somewhere. I got a mule to ride.\n\nHis sister-in-law, Harriet, responds:\n\nO, don\u2019t you leave me here. Babe, don\u2019t you leave me here. Dog-gone yo\u2019 comin\u2019 back! Said don\u2019t you leave me here.\n\nAs a depiction of a period of transition, the migration novel often makes a priority of capturing life as it is led in its very moment, since there\u2019s no telling what might change when characters find themselves in new landscapes. The changing way of life between one generation and the next is a persistent point of tension in \u201cNot Without Laughter.\u201d Aunt Hager pumps water for her laundry washing, as well as for the cooking and cleaning, yet a few miles away Tempy lives with electric lights and indoor plumbing. Hager sees hotels as breeding grounds for vice and sin, but both Harriet and Sandy jump at the chance to work at one, motivated by a paycheck. Hughes uses the songs and dances of Jimboy and Harriet as well as the church revival culture of Hager and Annjee \u2014 in scenes taking place on the same night, less than a half mile apart \u2014 to depict the crossroads between the traditions that have given expression to the community in the past and those that might fill that role in the future.\n\nSandy\u2019s father, Jimboy, is caught in a cycle of desiring to be on the road to find better work (and freedom from responsibility) and of nostalgia for the culture and familiarity of the South. Jimboy\u2019s wanderlust is offensive to Hager, but Sandy idolizes his father, begging him to teach him how to box and fish and play guitar. The scene of Jimboy about to cut out for the road once again \u2014 this time for good \u2014 is one of the most poignant in the book. Sandy discovers his father \u201csitting dejectedly on the well-stoop in the sunshine, with his head in his hands,\u201d his posture conveying the sort of defeat only a man intending to abandon his family feels. The father takes his son in his arms and kisses him awkwardly. He does not say goodbye. Later that afternoon Sandy discovers Jimboy has left town.\n\nWhat prevents Hughes\u2019s characters from being mere archetypes of working-class black folks, or of the Great Migration, is their ability to change and respond to one another. \u201cNot Without Laughter\u201d is a novel not without forgiveness. Its characters ultimately prize family over their own ideological resolve, though it takes some longer than others to get there. After hearing news of Harriet\u2019s arrest for streetwalking, Hager doesn\u2019t speak her daughter\u2019s name for some time, but she does not disown her; Hager\u2019s dying wish is for Harriet to be happy. Even Tempy\u2019s taking in of Sandy can be seen as an attempt to pull her family close again after keeping her distance for so long. The one exception is Jimboy, who remains elusive throughout the novel, a father figure always out of reach.\n\nA poet who writes fiction can imbue his prose with a considerable amount of magic. For Hughes, his magic is an appreciation for the lyrics and rhythms of jazz and blues. It\u2019s one thing to appreciate the cultural aspects of these musical forms, yet another to home in on the lyrics, the power of the repetition employed therein, the subtle turns of phrase and uses of wit.\n\n\u201cNot Without Laughter\u201d includes lyrics to songs that are mournful, bawdy, vengeful and downright silly. They underscore the importance Hughes felt they played in black life and consciousness. One gets the sense that Sandy\u2019s upbringing has been shaped just as much by overhearing these songs as by Aunt Hager\u2019s teachings. As the novel progresses, Sandy\u2019s thoughts are rendered in musical streams of consciousness, quickly turning from anticipation to curiosity to anger to desire. The result is a realistic portrayal of the rhythms of a young man\u2019s inner life: Sandy lies in bed at night and riffs on his own past and future.", "title": "How Langston Hughes Brought His Radical Vision to the Novel", "authors": []}

(Because Russia\u2019s Olympic team is technically barred, the athletes would compete under the Olympic flag.)

Thomas will not, however, face his former teammates in Boston on Wednesday, as it will be a while before he is allowed to participate in back-to-back games.\n\nA frequent user of social media, Thomas had been hinting heavily that a return was imminent, and on Monday he seemed enthusiastic for what was ahead of him.\n\nThe excitement for Thomas\u2019s return, both from players and fans, is palpable, especially after he finished last season with a career-high average of 28.9 points a game.

{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "The American solution has been a robust package of assistance to Pakistan, beginning with the Bush administration in 2001. The United States sought to reimburse Pakistan for the costs of supporting our war in Afghanistan. In the eyes of the Pakistanis, this became payment for their war against domestic terrorism, which has cost Pakistan 50,000 lives and untold billions, and was widely perceived as a bad deal.\n\nDespite an infusion of about $1 billion per year of development assistance during the Obama administration, money never gave the United States the leverage it desired. The Pakistani generals who run Afghanistan policy from their headquarters in Rawalpindi were never convinced that they had to choose between their relationship with the United States and their relationship with the Taliban.\n\nI can vouch from bitter personal experience that I hammered away at the need to make that choice for four years, but never got any purchase. The generals knew that as long as the United States maintained an army in Afghanistan, it was more dependent on Pakistan than Pakistan was on it. This disconnect between Washington and Rawalpindi led to the decline in United States-Pakistan relations that was already highly visible in the last year of the Obama administration.\n\nThe harsh truth is that American leverage over Rawalpindi and Islamabad has been declining. And as United States aid levels have diminished \u2014 reflecting bipartisan unhappiness with Pakistani policy \u2014 aid from the Chinese has increased. China has invested around $62 billion in Pakistani infrastructure under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, an element of the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative. Its magnitude and its transformation of parts of Pakistan dwarf anything the United States has ever undertaken.\n\nThus, the Trump administration\u2019s attempt at humiliating and penalizing Pakistan is unlikely to work. Pakistan, like most countries, reacts very badly to public attempts to force its hand. It is likely to respond by showing how it can truly undercut our position in Afghanistan.\n\nA better approach would be to privately convey, at the highest levels and without equivocation that the only way to preserve any relationship with the United States is to cut all ties with the Taliban, including the Haqqanis. The Trump administration, with its hard-line reputation and willingness to reject all previous United States policy, could credibly deliver this message.\n\nBut the path of the tweet and highly public aid cuts is not a method that will engender success.

The ultimate answer to the Pakistan conundrum is to start a diplomatic initiative to bring peace to Afghanistan by opening talks with the Taliban.

Tom Steyer, a Democratic megadonor, is running a multipronged campaign calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment on grounds ranging from his North Korea policy to allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is true that impeachment is a political rather than a criminal device, but not like this. It requires the kind of political judgment concerned with the public good, not with gaining electoral advantage.

In broad terms, when people add fat, they produce more leptin, which then jump-starts processes in the brain that reduce appetite and should cause their bodies to drop that new weight.\n\nBut obviously this system is not perfect or no one would hold on to added pounds.\n\nSo for the new study, which was published this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international group of researchers began to wonder whether there might be other processes at work.\n\nTo find out, they first gathered groups of mice and rats. They chose both species, hoping that, if any results were common to each, this might indicate that they also could occur in other mammals, including, potentially, us.\n\nThen the scientists implanted tiny capsules into each rodent\u2019s abdomen. Some contained weights equaling about 15 percent of each animal\u2019s body mass. Others were empty.\n\nIn effect, some of the animals had just gained a big chunk of weight.\n\nThe scientists then left the rodents alone to deal with these added ounces as they would.

I resonate with that spirit. I respect that. And if somebody is feeling like making that kind of record, I want to protect it from any of the outside influences that might come in and say, \u2018You have a decision to make. You can either make your creative record or your commercially viable record.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat conversation of art versus commerce is so ignorant,\u201d he added. \u201cThe good albums are the ones that do both.

Those she returned to often \u2014 poached fruit; baked apples; a thick, sweet pancake; and a memorable rice pudding \u2014 were made in the spirit of au pif. I thought of them as this-and-that sweets: A little more of this or a little less of that, and they would still be fine. If precision were important and if recipes were required, Marie-C\u00e9cile, like so many good cooks faced with flour, sugar, butter and measuring cups, was timid.\n\nWhen I knew her, I was timid, too. I was just learning to bake and hadn\u2019t yet discovered that within the bounds of a recipe, a baker with an imagination could find room to play.\n\nBaking is a craft built on proportions (fat to flour, wet ingredients to dry, mass to leavening), metamorphosis (beating butter and sugar together until creamy, egg whites until firm, dough until it comes together in a ball) and observation (bake until the cupcakes are springy to the touch, the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, the custard no longer jiggles). It took me a long while to see that everything I needed to succeed was written into each recipe. If the recipe was good, and I followed it, I would have the dessert I set out to make. If I tinkered around its edges, I would have a dessert of my own.\n\nSimple rice pudding like Marie-C\u00e9cile\u2019s \u2014 rice and sweetened milk cooked until soft and thick \u2014 was the first dessert I found the courage to play with. It was easy and rewarding to simmer the rice with bits of dried fruit that plumped and flavored the milk, fat strips of orange or lemon zest, a cinnamon stick, a few crushed cardamom pods, a hunk of ginger or a spoonful of dried lavender, which no one liked as much as I did. One day I stirred some dark chocolate into the almost-finished pudding, and that became my family\u2019s favorite version. I folded cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche into the cold pudding when I was serving it to guests. Company pudding also got a drizzle of caramel, honey, maple syrup or raspberry sauce, and sometimes fruit on top or alongside: apples or pears saut\u00e9ed with butter and sugar in winter, berries in summer and orange slices year-round. Once, I topped the pudding with ice cream and hot fudge and called it a sundae.\n\nFrom pudding, I went on to cookies and cakes, pies, custards, brownies and blondies, finding them all amenable to tweaks and reshaping. The first time I follow a recipe, I make it just the way it\u2019s written: I want to understand what it\u2019s meant to be. And then, I follow my pif, often adding spices, nuts or extracts to batters, cajoling dough into new forms, making cupcakes from recipes designed for towering layer cakes, doubling up on frosting or going heavy on chocolate chunks in just about anything, because I now know I can. I don\u2019t tap my nose the way Marie-C\u00e9cile once did, but as I think about transforming her long-loved recipes, I\u2019m almost tempted to.", "title": "How Rice Pudding Gave Me Courage", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "There are various conclusions one could draw from this reality. Someone focused on building anti-Trump solidarity might argue that one defining effect of Trump\u2019s rise has been to make more white women feel the sense of marginalization and disempowerment that minorities already feel \u2014 which is why the female reaction is so much more notable than the reaction among groups more inured to prejudice.\n\nAlternatively, someone focused on the primacy of race might complain that white women have effectively hijacked anti-Trumpism, using their positions of influence in the media and elsewhere to turn what should be a \u201cGet Out!\u201d moment into a \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d moment, depriving Black Lives Matter, immigrants\u2019 rights groups and other like-minded movements of media oxygen in order to focus on their own more intimate sufferings at the hands of Trump-like elite men.\n\nMy own suggestion would be that the surprising gender-over-race dynamic might also reflect some underappreciated social shifts that could modestly depolarize racial issues even as the war over the sexes gets a little worse.\n\nIn particular, on two of the issues that drove racial polarization in the late Obama years \u2014 the justice system\u2019s seeming racial bias, which spurred so much minority activism, and elite support for ever-increasing immigration, which spurred populist backlash on the right \u2014 the underlying numbers have actually been moving in the direction desired by both sides\u2019 activists.\n\nMass incarceration isn\u2019t just in retreat (with prison populations falling 13 percent from their 2007-08 peak), it\u2019s retreated in a very race-specific way: Imprisonment rates for black men plunged by 24 percent in 2000s even as the white imprisonment rate slightly rose. Meanwhile, the immigration rate, legal and illegal, has also fallen quite dramatically since 2005. Neither issue is about to disappear, but it\u2019s still notable that trends feeding black disillusionment and white-identity politics were improving in the years leading up to Trump \u2026\n\n\u2026 even as trends related to sex, marriage and family continued to show a growing social divide between the sexes, with fewer marriages, fewer children and less sex all around. If \u201cless sex\u201d just means \u201cless for Harvey Weinstein,\u201d of course, that\u2019s good news for everyone else. But what\u2019s being exposed in the Trump era is more than just a few pigs and their crimes. Something is badly out of joint with male-female relations, our ability to woo and be wooed, our capacity to successfully and happily pair off.\n\nIt may be too much to hope that recent racial polarization has been driven by trends that are destined to improve. (We don\u2019t know, for instance, what\u2019s happening with the crime rate after the late-Obama-era spike.) But at the very least our race problems might not, the presidency\u2019s bigotry notwithstanding, be necessarily getting worse. Even Trump\u2019s recent \u201cwhat, me, racist?\u201d tweet noting an all-time-low in the black unemployment rate was not wrong: These are the best economic times for African-Americans in a decade.\n\nBut there is strong evidence that our problems with sex and gender and male-female relations are worsening \u2014 which is why it\u2019s understandable that they\u2019re at the heart of how the country has reacted to the Trump presidency, and fitting that this year of public protests and intimate revelations have thrown them into sharp relief.", "title": "Opinion | How Sex Trumped Race", "authors": []}

And for a while, that fear seemed totally justified. At one point, the growth trajectory for e-books was more than 1,200 percent. Bookstores suffered, and print sales lagged. E-books also made self-publishing easier, which threatened traditional publishers.\n\nBut in just the last couple of years, there has been a surprising reversal. Print is holding steady \u2014 even increasing \u2014 and e-book sales have slipped.\n\nOne possible reason is that e-book prices have gone up, so in some cases they\u2019re more expensive than a paperback edition. Another possibility is digital fatigue. People spend so much time in front of screens that when they read they want to be offline. Another theory is that some e-book readers have switched to audiobooks, which are easy to play on your smartphone while you\u2019re multitasking. And audiobooks have become the fastest-growing format in the industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nSocial media has also had an enormous impact on publishing, as it has on all corners of the media industry. It has definitely become a new way for readers to connect with authors and discover books, but it has probably also cut into the time that people spend reading. (A depressing article in Quartz estimated that if people spent the same amount of time reading that they did on social media, they could read 200 books a year easily.)\n\nMany new authors are skipping traditional publishers and use tech tools to go straight to self-publishing their own e-books or print books. What will be the fate of traditional publishers in the next few years?\n\nSelf-publishing has been one of the most fascinating corners of the industry to me. There have been a handful of massively successful self-published authors who have started their own publishing companies, and they\u2019ve started to publish other \u201cself-published\u201d authors. But publishers have survived so far through consolidation, and we\u2019ll probably see more of that.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And what do you think about Amazon\u2019s bookstores?\n\nIndie bookstores have made a surprising comeback in recent years (a trend that might be connected to the resurgence of print books). A lot of independent stores have been so successful that they\u2019ve expanded into mini-chains.\n\nThe future of Barnes & Noble looks uncertain, and the company has suffered setbacks after a few disastrous strategies. It made a huge and, in retrospect, unwise investment in digital hardware and its Nook device, and then tried to become more of a general-interest gift and toy and books store, which probably alienated some of its core customers. Lately, it has tried smaller concept stores, with cafes with food and wine and beer. There was some snickering online after its new chief executive announced that its latest strategy was to focus on selling \u2026 books. Snickering aside, I think it\u2019s the smartest thing the company can do. In many parts of the country, Barnes & Noble is the only place people can buy books, and it\u2019s still a beloved brand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmazon\u2019s entry into the physical retail space has been fascinating. I\u2019m not sure how successful the experiment has been. When I visited the Amazon bookstore at New York\u2019s Columbus Circle, it definitely felt like a device store that also sold books. The store even looks like a 3-D version of the website, with book covers facing out and curated sections that reflect what\u2019s popular with Amazon\u2019s customers. But they\u2019re expanding rapidly across the country, so something must be working.\n\nI\u2019ll be curious to see how Indigo Books, the Canadian chain, will do here next year when it expands into the United States. Maybe it will shake up the model.\n\nOutside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?\n\nI am, my family would confirm, not great with gadgets. It would be fair to say that I\u2019m actively bad with them. I\u2019m wary of some of the new home assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google Home, not necessarily because I\u2019m paranoid about my conversations being recorded \u2014 Amazon and Google already know everything about me \u2014 but because my kids would likely be yelling at the devices all the time, and the Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande songs would play in an endless loop.\n\nI have become a podcast junkie.

But to succeed in 2018 and beyond, the president should chart a course that returns to his roots in the 2016 campaign and breaks with the surprisingly conventional Republican nature of his policies. He has a golden opportunity to do so in the State of the Union by making a strong case for a policy few Republicans will even address publicly: paid family leave.\n\nDuring the campaign, it became clear that a major part of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal was that he frequently broke with Republican orthodoxies on a host of issues, including foreign policy, trade, entitlements, health care and, to some degree, immigration. His unorthodoxy proved to be an asset for his campaign and is among the reasons exit polls indicated he prevailed over Hillary Clinton among independent voters.\n\nYet these same independents are by and large the supporters Mr. Trump has lost over the past year. Much of this is no doubt due to the tenor of this presidency and the daily barrage of tweets, leaks, investigations and general partisanship that is the hallmark of Washington these days. But his loss of support among independents may also be partly because his presidency has turned out to be much more generically Republican than what many anticipated.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s tax cut bill, his repeal of the individual health insurance mandate, withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and rollbacks of regulations have extended Republican priorities or undone policies enacted under President Barack Obama.

{"date": "2018-01-06 00:00:00", "text": "The C.I.A. and other American intelligence services had predicted this moment would come, eventually. For decades, they accurately projected the broad trajectory of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Yet their inability to foresee the North\u2019s rapid strides over the past several months now ranks among America\u2019s most significant intelligence failures, current and former officials said in recent interviews.\n\nThat disconnect \u2014 they saw it coming, but got the timing wrong \u2014 helps explain the confusion, mixed signals and alarm that have defined how Mr. Trump\u2019s untested national security team has responded to the nuclear crisis.\n\nIn an interview, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, acknowledged that Mr. Kim\u2019s race to the finish line \u2014 a bid to establish the North as a nuclear power before any negotiations begin or sanctions take a more punishing toll \u2014 \u201chas been quicker and the timeline is a lot more compressed than most people believed.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he argued, \u201cwe have to do everything we are doing with a greater degree of urgency, and we have to accelerate our own efforts to resolve the issue short of conflict.\u201d\n\nSenior intelligence officials said they began investing more heavily in acquiring information on North Korea\u2019s weapons program in 2012, reaping benefits over the past two years. But they acknowledged they made two key assumptions that proved wrong.\n\nThey assumed that North Korea would need about as much time to solve the rocket science as other nations did during the Cold War, underestimating its access to both advanced computer modeling and foreign expertise. They also misjudged Mr. Kim, 33, who took control of the dynastic regime in late 2011 and made the weapons program more of a priority than his father or grandfather did.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Obama warned Mr. Trump during the transition a year ago that North Korea would pose the most urgent national security threat, and almost immediately the newly installed president began repeating, publicly and privately, that he inherited \u201ca mess\u201d in North Korea because his predecessors did not do enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFormer officials in the Obama administration dispute that. But some concede that the intelligence community\u2019s flawed assessment of the North\u2019s progress meant there was less pressure to bolster missile defenses, more vigorously enforce sanctions or consider stepped-up covert action.\n\nIt is not clear that even with more advanced warning the Obama or Trump administrations would have been able to slow Mr. Kim\u2019s progress.\n\nOver many years, the North Koreans have outmaneuvered several American presidents \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 with technological advances that seemed highly threatening but not worth the risk of a war that could kill millions in South Korea and Japan. A beefed-up military presence off the North Korean coast, cyberattacks, sabotage of imported parts and simulated bombing runs may have slowed but ultimately failed to stop the country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nNow, facing the biggest advances of all, Mr. Trump faces the same dilemma his predecessors did, but with less time to respond.\n\nAnd the shakiness of intelligence on North Korea \u2014 even on fundamental questions like how many nuclear weapons Mr. Kim possesses \u2014 casts a shadow over Mr. Trump\u2019s options going forward.\n\nHe has repeatedly raised the prospect of war with North Korea. He has also ordered up a range of new military plans, from a limited \u201cpunch in the nose\u201d to signal American resolve to a large-scale attack aimed at destroying the country\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities \u2014 all of which, his aides worry, could trigger a devastating wider conflict.\n\nYet many in the Pentagon see the failure to anticipate the North\u2019s recent breakthroughs as an ominous reminder of how much could go wrong. A successful pre-emptive strike, for example, might require precise knowledge of the locations of manufacturing facilities, nuclear plants and storage areas, and confidence that cyberstrikes and electronic strikes would cripple Mr. Kim\u2019s ability to retaliate.\n\nThe past year, one senior administration official said, had been a \u201chumbling lesson\u201d in the limits of American electronic, satellite and human intelligence operations against a sealed-off society with few computer networks, a high degree of paranoia about American covert action, and a determined young leader.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump, however, was not disturbed by the absence of warning, General McMaster said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the expectation of perfect intelligence about anything. He is very comfortable with ambiguity. He understands human nature and understands he will never have perfect intelligence about capabilities and intentions.\u201d\n\nThe North\u2019s rapid progress raises a number of awkward questions: Did the American sabotage effort, for example, prompt Mr. Kim to scrap an ailing missile program for a new generation of more capable rocket engines? Or was that his plan all along? And does the new program have similar vulnerabilities the United States can exploit?\n\nDuring a talk last fall, Gen. John E. Hyten, who heads the United States Strategic Command, which controls the American nuclear arsenal, acknowledged he had no idea when North Korea would pass its final technological hurdle: proving its warheads can survive fiery re-entry into the atmosphere to hit targets in the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWill they get there in 2017, 2018, 2019?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI see a lot of the detailed intel. I can honestly tell you, I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nMissing Critical Turns\n\nEver since the United States began tracking North Korea\u2019s efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon, a pattern has repeated itself: American intelligence agencies excelled at forecasting the direction and overall timeline of the program, yet repeatedly missed critical turns.\n\nRecently declassified documents show the C.I.A. recognized the North\u2019s ambitions in the early 1980s, when spy satellites first spotted evidence that it was building a reactor to produce plutonium, a main fuel for nuclear arms. A division of the agency immersed itself in studying the North\u2019s factories and reactors, trying to gauge how fast the backward state could build advanced rocket engines, specialty fuels and nuclear warheads.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, waves of its impoverished missile scientists began to head for North Korea. While Russian security forces intercepted some, others made it out or assisted the North from afar. In retrospect, former American intelligence officials say they almost certainly missed significant transfers of technology.\n\n\u201cThese are designs you can put on a thumb drive,\u201d said a senior official who has tracked North Korea for years and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the topic\u2019s sensitivity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe missiles Mr. Kim has launched in recent months bear numerous signs of Soviet provenance. But analysts and intelligence officials say the specific dates, places and means of transfer remain murky.\n\nOstensibly, North Korea suspended its nuclear weapons program in 1994 after a tense standoff with the United States that brought the two countries closer than ever \u2014 until recent months \u2014 to resuming the Korean War. With the Clinton administration weighing military options, former President Jimmy Carter negotiated a deal that ultimately resulted in a freeze of the North\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for fuel oil and the construction of nuclear power plants, which ultimately were never built.\n\nThat deal appeared to hold for six years but, in fact, the North began cheating on the agreement within a few years. Secretly, it was pursuing an alternative path to the bomb using uranium fuel.\n\nThe intelligence community eventually spotted shipments from Russia and Pakistan containing parts for centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Confronted with the evidence, North Korea acknowledged the program, prompting the Bush administration to suspend the agreement. But the North pressed ahead, and today analysts believe it uses uranium for many of its new warheads.\n\nFrom as early as 2000, the National Intelligence Council was remarkably prescient about North Korea\u2019s overall direction, predicting in an unclassified report that it would \u201cmost likely\u201d have a nuclear missile that could hit American cities by 2015.\n\nFour years later, when the United States was mired in the first year of the Iraq war, the council refined its prediction, saying a \u201ccrisis over North Korea is likely to come to a head sometime over the next 15 years,\u201d that is, no later than 2019.\n\nNone of this was ignored. President George W. Bush began a program to interdict ships delivering material for the North\u2019s weapons program, and he accelerated secret efforts to cripple the program by sabotaging its supply chain with bad parts.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Run of Successful Missile Firings Late in 2016, North Korea ditched a failing missile technology for a new type that in 2017 racked up major successes, potentially putting its nuclear warheads in range of American cities. 2016 Estimated ranges of major missiles launched in North Korea April 15 Failed April 27 Failed Intermediate-range missile (1,800 to 3,400 miles) April 28 Failed May 30 Failed Intercontinental-range missile (more than 3,400 miles) June 21 Failed June 21 Oct. 14 Failed Oct. 19 Failed 2017 April 4 April 15 Failed April 28 May 14 July 4 July 28 Aug. 29 Sep. 15 Nov. 28 2,000 miles 4,000 6,000 8,000 2016 Estimated ranges of major missiles launched in North Korea April 15 Failed April 27 Failed Intermediate-range missile (1,800 to 3,400 miles) April 28 Failed May 30 Failed Intercontinental-range missile (more than 3,400 miles) June 21 Failed June 21 Oct. 14 Failed Oct. 19 Failed 2017 April 4 April 15 Failed April 28 May 14 July 4 July 28 Aug. 29 Sep. 15 Nov. 28 2,000 miles 4,000 8,000 6,000 2016 Estimated ranges of major missiles launched in North Korea Apr. 15 Failed Apr. 27 Failed Apr. 28 Failed Intermediate-range (1,800 to 3,400 mi.)

One picture, eventually released by the C.I.A., showed the chief of North Korea\u2019s nuclear-fuel production at the Syrian site. Though the plant was less than 100 miles from the Iraqi border, the United States had missed it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, to visit and showed him a complete uranium-enrichment plant it had built inside an old building at Yongbyon. The Koreans had installed the facility, at a site under regular satellite surveillance, without being detected.\n\nIntelligence officials said there were good reasons for this spotty record.\n\nForeign governments almost never succeed in recruiting North Korean scientists as sources because they are rarely allowed to go abroad. The North also appears to have figured out the patterns of some American spy satellites.\n\nAnd while documents released by Edward J. Snowden showed the National Security Agency had penetrated North Korea, it is unclear whether its cybersnooping gleaned anything useful in a nation with minimal computer networking.\n\nA Remarkable Sprint\n\nFor years, North Korea devoted itself to short-range missiles that posed little threat to the United States.\n\nBut in 2008, two years after its first nuclear test, Condoleezza Rice, then secretary of state, warned allies that the North was on the verge of another leap: A Soviet rocket engine representing \u201ca substantial advance\u201d had aided its development of longer-range missiles, according to a secret memo disclosed in 2010 by WikiLeaks.\n\nInside the Pentagon, the alarms grew louder. In early 2011, while visiting Beijing, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters North Korea was within five years of being able to fire a long-range missile. Pyongyang, he added, \u201cis becoming a direct threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nThen, rather suddenly, the urgency seemed to recede.\n\nWhen Mr. Kim came to power, many in the intelligence community doubted he would survive: He was young, inexperienced and distrusted by his military. And over the next four years, during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, North Korea\u2019s missile program experienced repeated public failures, prompting more than a few jokes on late-night television in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe worst humiliation came in April 2012, two days after Mr. Kim\u2019s formal elevation to the highest level of state power, on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather\u2019s birthday. He marked the occasion with a satellite launch intended to demonstrate technology used in an intercontinental ballistic missile, and even invited foreign journalists. But the rocket shattered soon after launch and fell into the Yellow Sea.\n\nBy late 2013, the intelligence community had largely changed its view of Mr. Kim. He was eliminating his rivals, sometimes ordering public executions with antiaircraft guns that shredded their bodies. And he seemed far more serious about the nuclear and missile program.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis father and grandfather tested weapons to make a political point. Mr. Kim, however, turned the program into North Korea\u2019s version of the Manhattan Project, the race to develop the atomic bomb in the United States. He made the development of a nuclear arsenal one of the state\u2019s top priorities, on equal footing with economic development. Only with a nuclear deterrent, he argued, would the nation be secure enough to focus on growth.\n\nIt now appears that Mr. Kim had several missile programs underway simultaneously, and sped efforts to make parts and missile fuel indigenously, so that the United States and its allies could not cut off his supplies.\n\nPresident Obama, increasingly concerned, ordered multiple reviews, including the one in early 2014 in which he authorized an intensification of covert cyberstrikes and electronic strikes on the North\u2019s missile program.\n\nThe pace of missile tests accelerated, reaching a peak of more than two dozen in 2016. But at least 10 launches failed that year, including seven of an intermediate-range missile known as the Musudan.\n\nFormer senior officials in the Obama administration say it remains unclear whether the sabotage effort contributed to the failed tests; there are many alternative explanations. But this much is clear: In October 2016, Mr. Kim ordered a halt to the Musudan tests, and the missile program rapidly shifted in a different direction, focusing on a new generation of more reliable and potent engines.\n\nIn May, North Korea successfully tested the new design in an intermediate-range missile capable of hitting the American territory of Guam. Then, on July 4, it stunned the world with its first successful test of an ICBM \u2014 and repeated the success a few weeks later. In November, it tested a greatly improved ICBM, known as the Hwasong-15, that could fly about 8,100 miles, far enough to threaten all of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was a remarkable sprint, and there was surprise inside the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. Mr. Kim appeared to have solved the problems that plagued the Musudan \u2014 and perhaps outmaneuvered the American sabotage program.\n\nThe latest missiles appeared to have been based on old Soviet designs. In interviews, intelligence officials said \u201cfreelancers\u201d from the former Soviet Union \u2014 \u201ca handful\u201d by the estimate of one official \u2014 are almost certainly working with North Korea. The Russian government, they added, does not appear to be providing support.\n\nBetween the missile tests, in September, North Korea also detonated its most powerful underground nuclear blast yet. The North claimed it was a hydrogen bomb, and after initial skepticism, many experts now say it probably was.\n\nRichard L. Garwin, a main designer of the world\u2019s first hydrogen bomb, called the North\u2019s hydrogen claim quite plausible given the \u201cenormous advances\u201d in computer modeling and \u201cthe dedication of the small group of nuclear technologists in North Korea.\u201d\n\nSeveral officials who served under Mr. Obama said that was a real surprise; they had been told that moment was still years away.\n\nFor several weeks, as this article was being prepared, intelligence agencies declined on-the-record comment. After it was posted online Saturday, Brian P. Hale, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, issued a statement saying that \u201cany suggestion that we didn\u2019t see these tests coming is dead wrong.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community has always assessed that Kim Jong-un is firmly committed to developing a nuclear capability,\u201d Mr. Hale added. \u201cWe were, therefore, not surprised by his accelerated pace of testing over the past few years.\u201d\n\nHe said that the North\u2019s capabilities today \u201care within the projection windows\u201d of assessments in recent years and concluded: \u201cWe have no higher intelligence priority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForecasts and Physics\n\nEntering 2018, there are several disputes inside the intelligence world about the North\u2019s capabilities.\n\nMost intelligence agencies say the North has an arsenal of about 20 or 30 nuclear weapons, for example, but the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency puts the number above 50.\n\nIt is more than an academic argument. If Mr. Trump attempted to destroy the arsenal, or if the North Korean government collapsed, the challenge would be to neutralize the weapons without any launch taking place or any warhead falling into the wrong hands. The more there are, the more difficult that task becomes.\n\nThe intelligence agencies are also intently focused on not missing the next big milestone: the moment North Korea learns how to design and build a warhead that can survive the heat and stresses of re-entry into the atmosphere, continue to plunge downward and succeed in destroying its target.\n\nWhen the United States built its nuclear arsenal in the 1950s and \u201960s, that \u201cwas the hardest part for us,\u201d said General Hyten of the United States Strategic Command.\n\nBut the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, told an audience in October that predicting when North Korea crosses this final threshold is less relevant now because \u201cyou\u2019re now talking about months.\u201d\n\nAnd Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has urged diplomacy over military action, said the November ICBM test flight indicated the North already has the ability to hit \u201ceverywhere in the world, basically.\u201d\n\nHaving underestimated the North, though, Washington now faces some risk of overstating its capabilities and intentions, some experts hold.\n\nDr. Hecker, the former director at Los Alamos, recently argued that North Korea needs \u201cat least two more years and several more missile and nuclear tests\u201d to perfect a weapon that can threaten American cities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is still time \u201cto start a dialogue,\u201d he said, \u201cin an effort to reduce current tensions and head off misunderstandings that could lead to war.\u201d", "title": "How U.S. Intelligence Agencies Underestimated North Korea", "authors": ["David E.

Congress routinely funded the government, obstructionist tools like the filibuster were used sparingly, and the Senate used its power of advice and consent with prudence, routinely confirming qualified nominees. There were instances of executive overreach (Franklin Roosevelt, Richard Nixon), but the most egregious abuses were checked by Congress and the courts.\n\nHistory suggests, however, that democratic norms are vulnerable to polarization. Some polarization is healthy, even necessary, for democracy. But extreme polarization can kill it. When societies divide into partisan camps with profoundly different worldviews, and when those differences are viewed as existential and irreconcilable, political rivalry can devolve into partisan hatred.\n\nParties come to view each other not as legitimate rivals but as dangerous enemies. Losing ceases to be an accepted part of the political process and instead becomes a catastrophe. When that happens, politicians are tempted to abandon forbearance and win at any cost. If we believe our opponents are dangerous, should we not use any means necessary to stop them?\n\nThis is how democracy died in Chile. Before the 1973 coup, Chile was Latin America\u2019s oldest democracy, buttressed by vibrant democratic norms, including a well-established \u201cculture of compromise.\u201d Chileans liked to say that there was no political disagreement that could not be settled over a bottle of Chilean cabernet. But beginning in the 1960s, Chile\u2019s culture of compromise was shattered by Cold War polarization. Mutual toleration eroded, and political parties eschewed forbearance for a \u201cwin at all cost\u201d strategy. Chilean democracy fell into a death spiral, culminating in a bloody coup. (The intervention of the United States accelerated but did not cause this death spiral.)\n\nCould it happen here? It already has. During the 1850s, polarization over slavery undermined America\u2019s democratic norms. Southern Democrats viewed the antislavery position of the emerging Republican Party as an existential threat. They assailed Republicans as \u201ctraitors to the Constitution\u201d and vowed to \u201cnever permit this federal government to pass into the traitorous hands of the Black Republican Party.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | How Wobbly Is Our Democracy?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-26 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Pace\u2019s discovery is known as M77232917 and was announced on Jan. 3. It is expressed as 277,232,917 \u2013 1 and is 23,249,425 digits, nearly one million digits larger than the previous record-holder, which The New York Times wrote about in 2016. As we explained then:\n\nA prime number is not divisible by any positive integer except 1 and itself. Some prime numbers are named after Marin Mersenne, a French theologian and mathematician who studied them in the early 17th century. They can be written in the form 2n \u2013 1 where n is an integer. For example, 3 is a Mersenne prime. Plug in 2 for n, and you find 22 \u2212 1 = 4 \u2212 1 = 3. But not all integers plugged into this expression generate a prime number, and as integers get bigger, prime numbers become rarer.\n\nTo recruit hunters for them, a volunteer project called the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or Gimps, came on the scene in 1996.\n\nMr. Pace said that when he became a Gimps volunteer, 14 years ago, he was excited by the idea of finding the first Mersenne prime with at least 10 million digits, and winning the $100,000 prize. But that discovery was made on a U.C.L.A. computer in 2008.\n\nMore Reporting on Mathematics\n\nAs the years went by, and other Mersenne prime numbers were found, Mr. Pace kept running the software in the background. \u201cThe C.P.U. will only work on it if there is literally nothing else for it to do,\u201d he said. He started with computers at home and then used the ones at the Germantown Church of Christ, where he is a deacon and the network administrator.\n\nMr. Pace, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and an M.B.A., described growing up in a community so small and rural that there were \u201ccattle across the street.\u201d He said his passion for math was ignited by an inspirational high school teacher named Harold Knight, who had a reputation for putting together formidable math teams.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe was giving me problems that were unambiguous, as in there was one and only one correct answer,\u201d Mr. Pace said, explaining how this appealed to his problem-solver personality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d challenge me, and if I failed he\u2019d show me where I\u2019d made a mistake or used an incorrect method, then move to the next challenge,\u201d Mr. Pace recalled of the teacher, who died years ago.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe moment of the discovery on Dec. 26 was not immediately apparent. The system is supposed to tell you if you find a Mersenne prime, Mr. Pace said, but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead George Woltman, who founded the Gimps project, emailed him.\n\n\u201cCongratulations Jon!\u201d Mr. Woltman wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s either a new Mersenne prime (99.999%)\u201d or a \u201cbug (.001%).\u201d\n\nThe software itself can help spot problems. Mersenne prime software is used to test computers for hardware errors, Mr. Woltman said. Smaller prime numbers are important to cryptography, but larger ones, so far, mostly just dazzle us.\n\nTo demonstrate the length of the number, Mr. Pace said that it took 69\u00bd sheets of 11 by 17 paper to print out the number he found \u2014 in two-point font.\n\nDiscoverers of a Mersenne prime get their names recorded and, if it\u2019s not a benchmark number, a modest cash prize. Mr. Pace is eligible for a $3,000 award. He has been interviewed by TV crews from as far away as Brazil.\n\nAll that publicity has led his college-age son and daughter, who were less interested before, to proudly make it known that this nerdy discovery was made possible by their father.\n\nMr. Pace\u2019s son, Bryan, 22, who is studying computer engineering and shares an interest in math, said that the recent success had motivated him to set up the Gimps program again on his own computer.\n\nAnd Mr. Pace\u2019s daughter, Katherine, 19, has her own thoughts about the discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m oddly proud of, even though it isn\u2019t actually my accomplishment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe coolest thing about it is really seeing my dad\u2019s humility on display.

The poets were sitting across from me in a velvet banquette at the dark Temple Bar in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Dimitrov cut a sleek profile, wearing a black leather jacket and a nonchalant smudge of kohl eyeliner. Ms. Lasky wore piles of jewelry on every exposed surface of her body, and looked like a modern incarnation of the elegant mystic Madame Blavatsky. Together, under the light of the dim Edison bulbs, they looked like members of a long-lost 1970s prog-rock band. \u201cAries women just love me,\u201d Mr. Dimitrov went on. \u201cI wish I could get married to an Aries woman, but alas, I like men. So this is the next best thing. I guess we are in a \u2018spiritual marriage.\u2019 I always refer to our Twitter as a marriage.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter account he speaks of is Astro Poets, a feed of whimsical astrological musings that the two launched together in late November 2016 (their account is a Sagittarian) and that has grown exponentially in popularity since. The account now boasts more than 232,000 followers \u2014 fans include the pop artists Lorde and Michelle Branch and the actor/writer Lena Dunham \u2014 and a coveted book deal with Macmillan\u2019s Flatiron Books. (The book will be published in 2019.) The two recently hosted a sold-out poetry reading for 500 fans in the New York Public Library\u2019s Celeste Bartos Forum. The beige auditorium was sardined with admirers \u2014 average age somewhere between 18 and 25, many with unicorn-hued, asymmetrical haircuts \u2014 who came for a glimpse of their horoscope gurus.\n\nThe Astro Poets idea was born over text message, late at night. Ms. Lasky and Mr. Dimitrov, who are both published poets (Ms. Lasky with four books, Mr. Dimitrov two), were up into the wee hours in November of 2016 chatting about their favorite subjects: romance and astrology. Mr. Dimitrov had double-booked dates with two men, and he was waffling back and forth about which plans to cancel. He turned to a Twitter poll, and then directly to Ms. Lasky, for cosmic advice. \u201cI was choosing between a Taurus and a Virgo,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny is, I didn\u2019t go on either date.

Because Mr. Dimitrov and Ms. Lasky are creatures of the internet, they are as well-versed in pop culture as they are in literary history. As a result, the account has a very specific, charming tone, one that unites zeitgeisty interests with ancient knowledge about the solar system. A typical tweet will list the star signs as emoji, or punctuation marks. Early on, the pair developed the idea of \u201cthe series,\u201d a quick list of 12 tweets describing all of the signs in terms of a single conceit. They described the signs in terms of Britney Spears songs, Virginia Woolf novels, adverbs and passive-aggressive email signoffs.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI approach each series we do thinking about structure, really,\u201d Mr. Dimitrov said. \u201cI like the fact that there are 12 signs.

If they are going to make this a game, they need to score almost immediately.\n\nVikings have a touchdown taken away by replay.\n\nAdam Thielen pulled down a hugely improbable touchdown reception on a 4th-and-goal play, but after a review showed the ball had hit the ground before the wide receiver secured it, Philadelphia takes over from their own 7-yard line still leading 31-7.\n\nThe Vikings\u2019 offense looked considerably better than it had in quite some time, starting the drive with one first down before Case Keenum found Jarius Wright for a fantastic 33-yard gain on the sideline that could potentially have been a touchdown if Wright had not lost his balance.\n\nJerick McKinnon got Minnesota inside the Philadelphia 10-yard line with an 11-yard reception, but on 3rd-and-goal from the 7-yard line, Keenum missed badly on a pass to a wide-open Thielen, and on fourth down he threw to Thielen again. The ball was tipped at least once, with Thielen falling to the ground before reaching out to pull it into his chest. It was only when the play was shown from the other side of Thielen that it was clear where the ball made contact with the ground before he pulled it back in.\n\nPhoto\n\nFoles airs it out again and the Eagles build a huge lead.\n\nNick Foles was at it again, launching a 41-yard pass to Torrey Smith, who beat Harrison Smith to the ball and then dove across the goal line into the end zone. Philadelphia now leads 31-7 in what has turned into a blowout. Adding to the Vikings\u2019 woes is Andrew Sendejo, Minnesota\u2019s standout safety, being doubtful for the remainder of the game with a calf injury while Xavier Rhodes, their top cornerback, has been sitting out with a toe injury. Rhodes is probable to return, but if the Vikings\u2019 secondary is not at full-strength, coming back from this huge deficit seems nearly impossible.\n\nEagles add to their lead at halftime.\n\nAt halftime, the N.F.C. Championship game is all Philadelphia, with the underdog Eagles leading 24-7. Nick Foles has looked like a different player than what we had seen in recent weeks \u2014 maybe even something resembling his incredible run of success in 2013 \u2014 and the Eagles\u2019 defense forced two huge turnovers against the conservative Minnesota offense.\n\nThe Vikings allowed 21 consecutive points after starting out the game with a 7-0 lead, and they got the ball back with just 1:09 left in the half. They tried to get something going with a few fairly conservative plays that picked up one first down, but the drive ended with an awkward pass from Case Keenum to Kyle Rudolph that fell incomplete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith only 38 seconds left, the Vikings punted the ball away, hoping for better fortune in the second half. But the Eagles took advantage by driving down the field quickly to set up Jake Elliott for a 38-yard field goal attempt that increased their lead to 17 points.\n\nThe Eagles will receive the ball to start the second half and are currently outgaining the Vikings 242 to 185 despite trailing in time of possession.\n\nFoles finds Jeffrey for a 53-yard touchdown.\n\nSo much for Philadelphia running a conservative offense with Nick Foles. The team\u2019s backup quarterback looked like a starter on a 53-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, which along with the extra point gave Philadelphia a 21-7 lead late in the second quarter.\n\nAt the two-minute warning, the Eagles faced a tough 3rd-and-6 at their own 28-yard line. They converted thanks to a great effort from Corey Clement on an 8-yard pass, and then got another first down on an 11-yard pass from Foles to Torrey Smith.\n\nFoles threw a pair of incomplete passes, and then on 3rd-and-10 from his team\u2019s 47-yard line he dropped back, avoided a tight pass-rush, and nearly fell to the ground with effort as he launched the ball 50-plus yards in the air to Jeffery for the huge score.\n\nEagles\u2019 defense forces another turnover.\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 defense forced their second turnover of the game with a strip-sack by Derek Barnett that was recovered by Chris Long.\n\nThe teams had traded punts without much offense to show for either drive, but the Vikings got back to basics on a drive that saw them glide down the field with a succession of first downs provided by Stefon Diggs, Adam Thielen and Jerick McKinnon.\n\nBut on 3rd-and-5 from the Philadelphia 16-yard line, Case Keenum dropped back to pass and Barnett came up on the blind side and jarred the ball out of Keenum\u2019s throwing hand as the quarterback tried to get set to throw.\n\nPhoto\n\nEagles put together a balanced scoring drive.\n\nAfter Nick Foles got the Eagles close, LeGarrette Blount hammered the ball into the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown that made the Vikings\u2019 formidable defense look helpless to stop him. Philadelphia now leads by a score of 14-7, having successfully answered Minnesota\u2019s 7-0 start to the game.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the drive, Foles looked like a different quarterback than the one who struggled at the end of the regular season. He threw aggressively to his receivers, picking up several first down passes with confident throws to Alshon Jeffery and Zach Ertz.\n\nThe progress was slow and steady, but Jay Ajayi and Blount showed that the Eagles\u2019 running game is tough enough to keep Minnesota from keying on Foles, which should dramatically help the former backup quarterback succeed.\n\nEagles\u2019 defense making life difficult for Keenum.\n\nThe Vikings\u2019 first possession resulted in a Minnesota touchdown, and their second gave a touchdown to Philadelphia. On a third try, it was far less dramatic with the team going 5 yards on three plays before punting. The only good news on the drive came in the form of Stefon Diggs making his way back onto the field after leaving briefly with a back injury.\n\nPhoto\n\nPick-six gives Eagles a big boost.\n\nThe Eagles tied the game, 7-7, thanks to a pick-six by Patrick Robinson on a bad throw by Case Keenum.\n\nKeenum dropped back on 3rd-and-8 and was under pressure from Chris Long, who made contact with Keenum\u2019s throwing arm on a pass intended for Adam Thielen. Robinson stepped right in front of Thielen, taking the ball away and then he found his way through the crowd for a 50-yard touchdown.\n\nThe offensive drive for Minnesota not only resulted in points for the Eagles, but also saw the Vikings lose Stefon Diggs, the hero of the divisional round, to a back injury, at least temporarily. The wide receiver appeared to be ok after taking a knee to the back on an incomplete pass, but he was removed from the game as the team helped him get back to his feet.\n\nEagles can\u2019t answer Vikings\u2019 opening score.\n\nThe Eagles looked aggressive on their first drive of the game, but when they were asked to answer a quick 7-0 deficit, they ended up punting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPhiladelphia started from its own 25-yard line and Nick Foles started off with an 11-yard completion to Nelson Agholor. He went deep to Torrey Smith on the second play of the drive, and very nearly pulled out a huge gain, but Smith couldn\u2019t hang on to the ball.\n\nFoles recovered to get one more completion to Agholor, this one going for 6 yards, but on 3rd-and-4 Trey Burton, who was wide open, could not land inbounds on a ball thrown to him, resulting in the punt.\n\nPhoto\n\nKeenum has Vikings looking sharp at the start.\n\nThe Vikings did almost anything they wanted on the opening drive of this game. Case Keenum gave his team a 7-0 lead with a beautiful 25-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph that left the Eagles looking flat-footed. Latavius Murry and Jerick McKinnon combined for 27 yards on the ground during the scoring drive, keeping the Eagles from being able to pressure Keenum, and the journeyman quarterback took advantage of that by tearing them apart, completing all three of his passes for 48 yards and the score.", "title": "How the Eagles Beat the Vikings in the N.F.C.

{"date": "2018-01-28 00:00:00", "text": "For example, days after news broke of the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s history of sexual harassment, LawCash, a settlement-advance company, was trying to cash in. \u201cSexual abuse is a crime #HarveyWeinstein,\u201d read a LawCash tweet. The Brooklyn company offered cash upfront to sexual abuse plaintiffs \u201cif you or someone you know is in need of financial help.\u201d\n\nThe settlement-advance firms get paid back only if a plaintiff collects money from a lawsuit. They make money by charging interest rates as high as 100 percent, which they are able to do because technically the money is considered an advance \u2014 not a loan \u2014 and therefore is not subject to state usury laws.\n\nConsumer groups call the industry predatory. The companies counter that they are providing a vital service to people without other options.\n\nLegal and business experts said there are scores of firms providing advances to tens of thousands of plaintiffs each year. The largest firms make cash advances totaling up to $40 million a year, according to an unpublished 2014 report by Diligence, a business intelligence firm.\n\nLegal Bay of Fairfield, N.J., is one of the settlement-advance firms trawling for sexual harassment clients.\n\nIn one October news release, Christopher R. Janish, its chief executive, said he had \u201cset aside a large portion of their presettlement cash advance funding specifically for plaintiffs of sexual harassment cases.\u201d The next month, the firm trumpeted its \u201cspecial focus for victims of unwanted sexual advances.\u201d\n\nMr. Janish said he did not know if the pitches had landed any clients. \u201cIt just really is more of a public awareness and branding thing,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe firms advertise on television and include hot-button search terms on their websites to lure traffic. That was how Heather Rothermund of Redding, Calif., learned of Nova Legal Funding in Los Angeles last summer. She had sued her employer, an adult care facility, for failing to discipline a co-worker who she said had groped her breasts and forced his hands down her jeans. Along with a state civil rights agency, she sought $250,000 in damages. The facility\u2019s owner did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs. Rothermund, 41, said the alleged assault left her with bills for therapy and anxiety medications that she couldn\u2019t afford. Her car was about to be repossessed when she came across Nova\u2019s online advertisement. The company advanced her $2,000 against an anticipated future legal settlement, she said.\n\nThe money got her out of a financial hole and helped her avoid having to accept a lowball settlement offer. She said that if the case settled within the year she might owe $4,000 \u2014 double what she borrowed. If the case drags on, she will owe more.\n\n\u201cIt is expensive, but it does help and it is available,\u201d Ms. Rothermund said.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the past two decades, settlement-advance companies have been chasing the hottest \u2014 and most lucrative \u2014 trends in litigation. They have provided advances to victims of surgical vaginal mesh products; those suffering from ailments related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks; and former National Football League players with brain injuries.\n\n\u201cThere are some companies that are trying to ride that \u2018me too\u2019 thing, and we are not doing that,\u201d said T. Thomas Colwell, chief executive of TriMark Legal Funding in Oregon. \u201cThat is just opportunistic.\u201d\n\nMr. Colwell said his firm had been providing cash advances to women with sexual harassment claims for 15 years. He said many clients worked in less glamorous industries than Hollywood and needed money to cover basic living expenses.\n\nOnly a handful of states regulate or license the settlement-advance firms, and little more than a website is necessary to get into the business.\n\nMr. Janish formed Legal Bay in 2014, a few years after getting out of state prison in New York for orchestrating a $13 million stock manipulation scheme.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

D. Legal, claiming the New Jersey firm took advantage of former N.F.L. players who expected to receive money in the league\u2019s landmark concussion settlement. The authorities claimed that R. D. Legal had tricked the players \u201cinto costly advances on settlement payouts.\u201d\n\nJust last week, Colorado\u2019s attorney general announced a $2 million settlement with LawCash and another settlement-advance firm, Oasis Financial, saying they charged personal injury plaintiffs \u201cpredatory interest rates.\u201d\n\nThe industry says it charges high fees to compensate for the risk of not being repaid.\n\nBut the industry\u2019s lucrative model has attracted mainstream financial institutions. The D. E. Shaw hedge fund, the private equity firms Parthenon Capital and Victory Park Capital, and Germany\u2019s DZ Bank have either bought stakes in or lent money to settlement-advance firms. D. E. Shaw has sold its stake in Oasis Financial.\n\nIn addition to providing cash upfront to sexual harassment plaintiffs, some firms are pursuing the more traditional form of litigation finance, providing money to law firms in exchange for a cut of potential settlements.\n\nNova \u2014 the same company that advanced money to Ms. Rothermund \u2014 plans to announce that it will provide financing for lawyers pursuing Hollywood sexual harassment cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to level the playing field in cases against big Hollywood players,\u201d said Ron Sinai, Nova\u2019s founder.\n\nAnd Legalist, a San Francisco litigation finance start-up, said that a Weinstein-related marketing pitch had attracted new clients, and that the company was now bankrolling three lawsuits against alleged sexual abusers.\n\nThe practices used by the settlement-advance industry have proved particularly controversial, uniting consumer groups and big business in opposition. Consumer activists argue that recipients don\u2019t understand how quickly the costs accumulate.

Almost all young workers I met during my extended fieldwork in the past 15 years have been in irregular employment, rarely paid on time, with little protection from exploitative employers. Between 10 million and 13 million Iranians are entirely excluded from health, work or unemployment insurance.\n\nThe Iranian poor do see the vast riches of the Iranian elite. Since the early 2010s Iran has witnessed the growth of a consumerist culture and rising inequality. An increasing number of imported luxury cars have appeared on the roads; buildings whose price per square meter equals three years of a worker\u2019s wage have come up across the cities. Ice cream covered in edible gold \u2014 worth a worker\u2019s monthly salary \u2014 is on the menus of luxury restaurants.\n\nAfter the day\u2019s work, I would walk with workers from Darab\u2019s village from the construction sites in wealthy neighborhoods in North Tehran to their modest rented rooms in the poorer South Tehran.

A decade of sanctions has significantly increased the prices of groceries, medicines and fuel. The sanctions also excluded Iranians from the formal international banking system and forced them toward informal cash-based transactions, making them vulnerable to fraud and black market prices.

Amendola finished the game with 7 catches for 84 yards.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Patriots beat the Jaguars in the A.F.C. Championship game:\n\nPhoto\n\nPatriots\u2019 first drive ends with a field goal.\n\nNew England is up 3-0 after a drive that showed some serious promise before fizzling out in the red zone.\n\nThe Patriots got the ball first and Tom Brady immediately completed a 5-yard pass to Dion Lewis and a 31-yarder to Brandin Cooks. The offense then managed just 8 yards on three short plays \u2014 a short run by Brady, a reverse to Rex Burkhead and a short completion to Burkhead \u2014 before aggressively going for it on 4th-and-2 with Brady tossing a high floater of a pass that somehow found its way into Danny Amendola\u2019s hands for a 20-yard gain, putting the Patriots in the red zone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJacksonville then tightened things up considerably, and a sack on 3rd-and-goal from the 12-yard line forced New England to send Stephen Gostkowski in for the 31-yard kick.\n\nDespite having a stitched-up hand that was the subject of a great deal of speculation, Brady looked perfectly comfortable on the opening drive, completing all six of his passes for 57 yards.\n\nDropped passes hurt Jaguars as drive stalls out.\n\nThe Jaguars stayed true to their style of football on their opening drive, running the ball and going for conservative passes, but a pair of dropped balls resulted in them punting away the ball after picking up 23 yards.\n\nJacksonville started the drive from their own 26-yard line and they alternated between runs up the middle by Leonard Fournette and passes by Blake Bortles, which were on their mark even if they lacked much zip on them.\n\nBut after picking up two quick first downs, the Jaguars stalled thanks to a badly dropped pass by T.J. Yeldon on 2nd-and-8 from the Jacksonville 49-yard line, and a more difficult drop from Marqise Lee on 3rd-and-8.\n\nOften mocked, the Jaguars succeeded this season by executing their game plan each and every week. Dropping easy passes that Bortles threw accurately could be a major problem.\n\nPhoto\n\nJaguars grab the lead after a balanced drive.\n\nThe Jaguars defense produced a quick three-and-out, and given another chance on offense, Jacksonville was far more aggressive. The change in strategy paid off with a smooth-as-butter 76-yard drive that ended with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Blake Bortles to Marcedes Lewis. With the extra-point, the Jaguars are now on top 7-3.\n\nOnce they got the ball back, the Jaguars went to work immediately with a 20-yard catch-and-run by Corey Grant. They then had a series of solid gains with a 7-yard pass from Blake Bortles to Marqise Lee, a pair of runs by Leonard Fournette that combined for 10 yards, and a nice pass by Bortles that found Keelan Cole on the sideline for an 11-yard gain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first quarter ended after Cole\u2019s reception, but after changing sides of the field, the Jaguars picked up right where they left off with another impressive catch-and-run by Grant that went for 24 yards.\n\nSet up with a 1st-and-goal at the New England 4-yard line, everyone was expecting a Fournette run up the middle, but Bortles faked to his power back before lofting a pass over the right side of the line for the Lewis touchdown.\n\nPhoto\n\nFournette gives Jaguars a 14-3 lead in first half.\n\nLeonard Fournette barreled into the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown and the Jaguars, against all odds, are leading 14-3 in a game that is going exactly as they had hoped.\n\nThe Jacksonville defense did its part by following up the team\u2019s first touchdown by continuing to suffocate New England\u2019s offense. Tom Brady has completed just 1 of 3 passes since his 6-for-6 start, and the Patriots have resorted to punts on consecutive drives.\n\nAfter New England\u2019s second punt, Bortles and the Jaguars took over at their own 23-yard line and through a combination of Fournette, Corey Grant, and a beautiful 27-yard completion to Allen Hurns, they found themselves with yet another 1st-and-goal.\n\nThis time instead of using Fournette as a decoy, they just gave the ball to the huge rookie running back and let him take care of the scoring by himself. His injured ankle does not appear to be limiting him thus far as he has 38 yards on 9 carries despite a defense that seems designed to try to take him out of the game.\n\nJaguars threaten again, but Pats\u2019 defense holds.\n\nThe Jaguars had everything going their way, with touchdowns on consecutive drives and a third chance to score thanks to a miracle 26-yard reception by Keelan Cole that extended the drive. But a penalty pushed them out of scoring range, a sack forced them into a punt, and Jacksonville gave the ball back to Tom Brady and the Patriots with just over two minutes left in the half. An 11-point lead feels comfortable, but if the Patriots can narrow that to four points before halftime, the makeup of the entire game would be dramatically different.\n\nJaguars\u2019 mistakes give Patriots some relief.\n\nAs they have so many times, Tom Brady and the Patriots\u2019 offense willed the team back into contention in a game that seemed to be slipping away. A pair of gigantic penalties against the Jaguars defense provided most of the yardage, but James White took care of the scoring with a 1-yard run that narrowed Jacksonville\u2019s lead to 14-10. Unfortunately for the Patriots, they may have lost Rob Gronkowski in the process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew England got a strong start to the drive with Brady finding Brandin Cooks for a 10-yard gain. Short passes to Danny Amendola and James White picked up a second first down, and the Patriots got 15 yards by way of an unnecessary roughness call against Barry Church for going helmet-to-helmet on a collision with Gronkowski. The hit sent Gronkowski off the field so he could be evaluated for a concussion, potentially ending his day, but the Patriots immediately picked up another 32 yards on a pass interference call against A.J. Bouye, setting them up to score on the 85-yard drive that took just 67 seconds off the game clock.\n\nClosing the gap, especially with Jacksonville getting the ball to start the second half, was a huge development for New England, but Gronkowski\u2019s status going forward could determine the outcome of this game.\n\nPhoto\n\nHalftime: Jaguars have the lead, but not the momentum.\n\nAt halftime, the Jaguars are on top 14-10, but they ceded much of the momentum of the game by letting the Patriots sneak in a score in the final minute of the first half, thanks largely to penalties.\n\nThe Jaguars\u2019 offense got the ball one more time, and despite having a pair of timeouts and 55 seconds left, they stuck to a conservative game plan and knelt on the ball for two plays to ensure that they went into the locker room with a lead.\n\nJacksonville will get the ball to start the second half, which could let them regain some momentum, but the Patriots are known for second-half adjustments so it could be considerably more difficult for Jacksonville regardless of Rob Gronkowski\u2019s status.\n\nJaguars open second half with a field goal.\n\nBlake Bortles was as close to perfect as he gets in the first half, completing 13 of 15 passes for 155 yards and a touchdown. But after stretching his streak of consecutive completions to 12 to open the second half, he had a ball knocked to the ground on a 3rd down pass attempt, resulting in Jacksonville sending Josh Lambo out for a 54-yard field goal attempt that he sent right through the uprights for a 17-10 lead.\n\nJacksonville did not stray from what typically works for them on the drive, with Leonard Fournette running the ball several times and Tommy Bohanon, the team\u2019s fullback, contributing a solid 20-yard catch-and-run.\n\nThe Jaguars got some bad news on the scoring drive when Cam Robinson, a rookie who starts at left tackle, was removed from the game with a shoulder injury. He is listed as questionable to return.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith Gronkowski sidelined, Patriots stumble.\n\nStill without Rob Gronkowski, who is being evaluated for a concussion and is listed as questionable to return, the Patriots started the second half out of sync. A pair of deep passes from Brady to Brandin Cooks went for nothing thanks to fantastic coverage on one play and a drop by Cooks on the second, and the drive ended with New England punting the ball away.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJaguars build 10-point lead in fourth quarter.\n\nIt briefly looked like New England had made some terrific second-half adjustments to limit Blake Bortles\u2019s effectiveness, but the Jaguars\u2019 quarterback made some adjustments of his own. Jacksonville picked up 66 yards on 11 plays, setting Josh Lambo up for a 43-yard field goal that increased Jacksonville\u2019s lead to 20-10.\n\nThe teams traded punts, with the battle of field position resulting in Jacksonville starting its latest drive from the team\u2019s own 9-yard line. But a pair of runs by Leonard Fournette generated 7 yards, and that generated enough cushion for Bortles to pick up a first down with an 18-yard pass to Marqise Lee.\n\nBortles picked up two more first downs with passes to Allen Hurns and Lee, the first of which came on a flea flicker, and then Fournette rumbled for 14 yards on the ground.\n\nThe next two plays went nowhere, closing out the third quarter, and the fourth quarter began with Jacksonville facing a 3rd-and-8 from New England\u2019s 25-yard line. Bortles threw an incomplete pass, but the Jaguars had gone far enough to set up Lambo\u2019s kick.\n\nPatriots will have to come back without Gronkowski.\n\nRob Gronkowski is officially out for the remainder of the game with a concussion, which will continue to limit New England\u2019s offense as they start their first possession of the fourth quarter down 20-10.\n\nJaguars force a huge fumble to thwart Patriots\u2019 drive.\n\nThe Jaguars got a huge break when a 22-yard gain by the Patriots ended with Myles Jack jarring the ball out of Dion Lewis\u2019s hands for a fumble and a recovery, giving Jacksonville\u2019s offense a chance to extend its lead. Tom Brady had picked up a quick first down with an 18-yard pass to Brandin Cooks, and then the Patriots appeared to have a huge gain on a trick play that involved a short pass from Brady to Danny Amendola who then threw across the field to Lewis. Lewis rumbled for big yardage, but then Jack simply stole the ball out of his hands, and the call stood up to a review by officials for the first turnover of the game.\n\nPhoto\n\nTom Brady\u2019s not done yet.\n\nRepeatedly throwing deep down field, Tom Brady and the Patriots showed they are still fighting in this game, and they went 85 yards on 8 plays, with Danny Amendola diving into the end zone for a touchdown, that made it a 20-17 game.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Patriots dodged a bullet on their previous drive when a fumble by Dion Lewis gave the Jaguars a huge scoring opportunity that they proceeded to immediately waste. Jacksonville\u2019s three-and-out gave Brady the ball back on his own 15-yard line, and as so many teams have found out over the years, the more opportunities you give Brady, the worse off your team tends to be.\n\nThe 40-year-old quarterback, who was supposed to be limited by an injured hand, endured a sack by Marcell Dareus on the drive, but looked spry and aggressive, challenging Jacksonville\u2019s star-studded secondary and repeatedly finding success.\n\nBrady has now completed 23 of 32 passes for 263 yards against the most talented secondary in the N.F.L.\n\nPatriots grab the lead on Amendola\u2019s circus catch.\n\nIt had been a defensive clinic for both teams over the last few drives, but the Patriots showed why experience is so valuable in the N.F.L. by taking a 24-20 lead thanks to Danny Amendola\u2019s circus catch in the back of the end zone. It was Amendola\u2019s second touchdown of the quarter.\n\nThe Patriots started the drive on Jacksonville\u2019s 30-yard line after a series of punts by both teams finally broke New England\u2019s way with a 20-yard return by Danny Amendola giving them a short field.\n\nNew England then went into automatic mode, with a series of short runs and passes pushing the ball into the end zone in a span of 2 minutes and 10 seconds of game clock.\n\nJacksonville has plenty of time to score, but with New England\u2019s defense having tightened up considerably, that could be very difficult unless the Jaguars have something hidden up their collective sleeve.", "title": "How the Patriots Came Back to Win the A.F.C.

{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "So while the anti-abortion movement is often considered central to traditionalist culture-war politics, it also has an individual rights approach, owing to its progressive (largely Catholic) roots. Even before Roe, parts of the pro-life movement emphasized the universal rights of the unborn, drawing upon the language of human rights that was prominent in post-New Deal liberalism. These liberal pro-life activists sought to marry their cause to language used to support civil rights for African-Americans and promote human dignity by supporting antiwar efforts. The National Right to Life Committee, for example, was founded in 1968, intentionally emphasizing the rights of the unborn in its name.\n\nFollowing Roe, many evangelical Christians were slow to join the anti-abortion movement, and when their pace increased at the end of the 1970s, their public arguments against abortion focused more on the immorality of abortion than the right-to-life of the unborn. If one leader epitomizes this approach, it was Jerry Falwell, leader of the Moral Majority. Yet by the early 1990s, the right-to-life public argument would prevail, as evangelical advocates would emphasize, and the evangelical base would accept, the rights-of-the-unborn justification over the immorality of obtaining an abortion.\n\nNot only did the pro-life movement teach about public rights arguments, but battles over abortion forced the movement to frequently claim expansive free-speech rights. Most notably, pro-life groups fought legal and legislative battles to defend their right to protest at abortion clinics and health care facilities many times between the late 1980s and 2000s.\n\nIn doing so, conservative Christian legal organizations were formed, and pro-life groups marshaled liberal free speech precedents established by antiwar and anti-government protesters. In the most recent abortion protest case decided by the Supreme Court in 2014, McCullen v. Coakley, several conservative Christian groups filed a brief arguing that the court should strike down a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d outside a clinic in Boston. In their brief, the groups drew upon the pinnacle of free speech doctrine, Cohen v. California, in which the court in 1971 overturned a young man\u2019s citation for wearing a jacket with a vulgar antiwar slogan on it in a courthouse. These conservative groups claimed for themselves a precedent they would have despised four decades ago.\n\nThese Conservative Christian groups are not just using these precedents when it serves them: They have also been supporting free speech cases when abortion is not directly involved. For example, many defended the student who was suspended for holding a \u201cBong Hits 4 Jesus\u201d banner at an Alaska school event in Morse v. Frederick in 2007.", "title": "Opinion | How the Pro-Life Movement Has Promoted Liberal Values", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "And the cost for investors to save millions of dollars in taxes? A few thousand dollars in fees to the firm that manages the exchange proceeds.\n\nThis preferential treatment is great if you\u2019re a real estate investor. But it\u2019s baffling for anyone else and may be downright infuriating to homeowners in high-tax states who could end up paying more in taxes because of limits placed on their ability to deduct property taxes on their federal income tax.\n\nTake, for example, someone who bought real estate in San Francisco 20 years ago versus someone who bought an equivalent amount of stock in Apple, based nearby in Cupertino. Both assets have appreciated wildly and made a tremendous amount of money for their investors.\n\nBut here\u2019s where the investors\u2019 fortunes diverge. If the owner of Apple stock sold it all and put the proceeds into other technology companies, the stock sale would be subject to a capital-gains tax of 20 percent.\n\nIf the investor who bought real estate in San Francisco sold the property, the money could be used to buy another property in San Francisco \u2014 or anywhere in the country \u2014 without the seller\u2019s paying a tax on the appreciated gains in the original property.\n\n\u201cFrom the I.R.S.\u2019s perspective, the taxpayer gives up property and what they receive is other like-kind property,\u201d said Matthew K. Scheriff, a certified public accountant and executive vice president of Legal 1031 Exchange Services. \u201cWhy that should apply to real estate and not other property? Obviously, real estate received a little bit of a favorable outcome on that side of the tax package.\u201d\n\nFavorable, indeed.\n\nCombine those tax-free gains with the higher estate tax exemption, and it is possible that a real estate investor would never have to pay capital gains or estate tax on tens of millions of dollars in real estate. If, at the investor\u2019s death, the assets totaled less than the $22.4 million exemption for a couple, decades of embedded gains would be erased.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoreover, any property tax the investor paid over the years would have been deducted as a business expense \u2014 even though the deduction for property taxes for a homeowner has been capped at $10,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClever investors could even sell the properties tax-free. Mr. Scheriff, who completed about 400 exchanges for his clients last year, gave this example: A person sells a building in New York for $1 million and uses 1031 exchanges to buy two rental houses on a golf course in Florida. A few years later, the investor evicts one tenant and moves into the house. After a few years, the investor sells it and claims the personal residence exemption, then repeats the process with the second home.\n\nThere are some residency requirements, but if handled the correct way, the strategy produces tax-free gains to be enjoyed in the investor\u2019s lifetime \u2014 gains that would be taxed if they were from other investments.\n\nWhy is this allowed? \u201cIt\u2019s a result of tax law inertia,\u201d Mr. Pegg said. He pointed to the history of farmers swapping odd parcels of land to create contiguous farms that were easier to maintain.\n\nIn the last major tax overhaul, which occurred in 1986, a provision in the code allowed for a delay of 180 days between selling one property and buying another, without any tax on the gains from the sale of the first property. A ruling from the I.R.S. also allows people to do \u201creverse exchanges\u201d \u2014 buying a property first and then picking other properties of equal value to sell without paying tax.\n\nToday, 1031 exchanges can turn air into a McDonald\u2019s on Long Island, tax-free. Peter E. Buell, a partner at Marcum, the national accounting firm, said that one of his clients had sold the air rights over a three-story building on 125th Street in Harlem that he had owned for decades. Without doing a 1031 exchange, the client would have had to pay tax on the entire sale price. To avoid paying tax, the client used the proceeds to buy the land on which a McDonald\u2019s sits.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll collect his rent check for what was air rights,\u201d Mr. Buell said.\n\nIn keeping these exchanges just for real estate, lawmakers may have inadvertently signed a decree that will send some museum-worthy pieces of art outside the country.\n\nTop collectors, who may spend millions of dollars for a single work of art, have taken advantage of 1031 exchanges that allowed them to use sales from their collection to buy new art \u2014 and save the nearly 30 percent tax on the gains.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that stopped with the new law. Michael Kosnitzky, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, said American art collectors could lose their advantage over those in the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, who have been buying big-ticket works like Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d which sold for $450 million to a Saudi prince who did not have the same tax concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is really bad for U.S. collectors,\u201d Mr. Kosnitzky said. And, he said, it is a potential blow for museums in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen Steven Cohen or Steve Wynn or another significant U.S. investor \u2014 and there are only a handful of them \u2014 buys a piece of art, they\u2019re often going to place their artwork in U.S. museums,\u201d Mr. Kosnitzky said.\n\n\u201cNow, those works are going to be out of the U.S. because of that tax law change,\u201d he added. \u201cOr they\u2019ll be kept in private collections where no one will be able to see them unless you know the Saudi prince or the Malaysian billionaire. That\u2019s not cool.\u201d\n\nWilliam J. Kambas, a partner at Withersworldwide, a law firm that was particularly active in doing 1031 exchanges for art, hopes buyers\u2019 passion for collecting overrides their tax concerns. \u201cI think many collectors, with or without the tax benefit, are going to buy and sell art,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe a piece that someone had to reach for, it might be difficult.\u201d\n\nOne thing he is certain of: \u201cThis is a boon for those in real estate.\u201d", "title": "How the Tax Code Rewrite Favors Real Estate Over Art", "authors": ["Paul Sullivan", "Wealth Matters"]}

The classic version is the Haig Dimple whisky bottle, with its short neck and flattened sides. \u201cIt can\u2019t roll away,\u201d Alvey says.\n\nBeginners should consider constructing what\u2019s known as a waterline ship, which sits atop a sea usually made of modeling clay or plumber\u2019s putty, thereby saving you from having to make a full hull that needs to fit through the opening.

The point of this type of folk art is to evoke a sense of bewilderment in the viewer. \u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle,\u201d Alvey says. \u201cHow is it possible to get that in there?\u201d\n\nShape a hull from soft basswood. Using toothpicks or wooden sticks from cotton swabs, make masts, booms and the spar extending from the vessel\u2019s front prow, which is called the bowsprit. Attach your masts to the hull with a piece of wire that will serve as a hinge. Glue the sails (made from tea- or coffee-soaked paper for a seaworn-canvas look), the masts and booms and rig them all with strings that go through the bowsprit. Place a few drops of glue atop the putty sea inside your bottle. Loosen your rigging lines and bring the sails and masts down alongside the hull. Insert the boat into the bottle stern first, using a bent metal coat hanger or a surgeon\u2019s tool called polypus forceps. Hoist the sails up by pulling your strings. Glue them to the bowsprit. Let the glue dry for a few days.

Rose\u2019s patients tend to have severe gait abnormalities associated with neurological conditions like cerebral palsy that often require bone and muscle surgery. A more minor correction to increase your athletic performance, say, or to remedy a step torqued by high heels or an aging body can often be accomplished in as little as six weeks with regular practice (and maybe some in-shoe orthotics).\n\nTake off your shoes, stroll barefoot up and down a hallway and notice where you feel pressure.

{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "Next, think about how you\u2019re going to use the table. \u201cFigure that each place at the table needs 22 to 24 inches of table space and that larger-scale chairs will require more,\u201d said Max Dyer, a furniture industry veteran and a current vice president of casegoods (a category of hard furniture like tables, cabinets, and chairs) at La-Z-Boy Industries.\n\nAs a longtime apartment-dweller, I\u2019ve found that the \u201cvisual weight\u201d of a piece of furniture can really influence how big it feels in a room. It may technically fit, but it\u2019ll seem huge if it\u2019s a dark or bulky piece or if it\u2019s too close to other furniture.\n\nTo visualize how a bigger piece of furniture will look, take the time to block out the length and width on the floor (I like to use painter\u2019s tape), and also the height of the table. I usually stand on my tape corners with a tape measure, then try to fill in that space with furniture of a similar size (like a couple of chairs), and take a step back to see how it\u2019ll feel. It also helps to have a friend stand there with the tape measure while you have a look.\n\nIf you\u2019re tight on space, consider options like leaves that allow the table to extend. \u201cThese let you customize the table for different entertainment needs and party sizes,\u201d said Meredith Mahoney, founder and design director of Birch Lane.\n\nThe one thing Mr. Pourny warned against was too many mechanisms or leaves that are attached or hidden within the table (versus stand-alone leaves). \u201cIf you buy things that are too complicated, it\u2019s just more opportunity for something to fail,\u201d he said.\n\nConsider your needs before settling on shape\n\nPhoto\n\nSquare and rectangular tables are the most common, so you\u2019ll find the greater number of choices there with styles, sizes and extendable options. But a round or oval table can give you a little more space to move around since it cuts off the corners but still has a good surface area. \u201cFor tighter, rectangular spaces, the oval might be the best option,\u201d Mr. Dyer explained.\n\n\u201cRound or oval tables can be great for parties and conversation because there\u2019s no head of the table, too,\u201d said Ms. Harris. In terms of squeezing people in, you\u2019re only limited by the perimeter of the table \u2014 but you can lose a little space for serving pieces once you have all your place settings at a round or oval table.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

When you see a table in person, sit at it to see if your legs hit the table\u2019s legs. Verify you have enough space for your knees when you scoot all the way in, and if you can cross your legs underneath the table. The apron \u2014 the frame that holds up the tabletop \u2014 can cut down on your room to maneuver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you want to be more flexible with your guests, pay attention to the leg width and where the legs are placed. \u201cIn general, a table with thinner legs, or where the legs are at the corners, will make it easier to squeeze an extra chair in,\u201d said Ms. Harris. And, as Mr. Dyer noted, be aware: \u201cA leg table is generally limited to how long it can be extended without bowing in the middle.\u201d\n\nWith a pedestal or trestle table, you have more flexibility to add more people to the table. \u201cA center base is the best option to squeeze people in,\u201d said Ms. Harris. But Mr. Pourny told us he was wary of larger round pedestal-style tables because they can be a little less sturdy than those with four-legs.\n\nTrestle tables can give you flexibility along the sides of the table, but can limit space at the ends of it. Look closely at how much space there is between the edge of the table and where the trestle supports are attached to make sure there\u2019s room for your knees.\n\nChoose the right table materials for your style\n\nPhoto\n\nChoosing the material for your dining table can be difficult. You have to balance price, ease of care, and your personal style to choose the right one, and a table that\u2019s not a good fit on any of those could mean a buying decision you regret later. Here are the most common materials, and what to consider for each:\n\n\u25a0 Wood: Solid wood is a classic material because it is durable and easy to repair. Pine, acacia, mango and teak are popular, less expensive options. \u201cSolid wood is the most popular, though it\u2019s often the most expensive,\u201d said Ms. Hirschhaut. Manufacturers have been working to bring down the price of solid wood \u2014 Ikea has an unfinished solid pine table for just $69, but larger ones from other retailers can cost $1,000 or more. Wood expands and contracts with heat and humidity and can show scratches and wear, but is fairly easy to repair.\n\n\u25a0 Veneer/Wood-Look: Wood veneer is often a more affordable alternative to solid wood. Here a very thin layer of solid wood (or material printed to look like wood) is glued to a plywood or other wood core. To identify good veneer, look for tables with clearly-labeled core interiors, like kiln-dried hardwood. One way to spot cheaper veneers is to look underneath the table at the store. \u201cIf just the outside is finished, but the underneath looks like a different material, the manufacturer is cutting costs,\u201d Mr. Dyer suggested.\n\n\u201cMake sure particleboard says it\u2019s CARB compliant, which means it\u2019s passed emissions tests,\u201d said Thomas Russell, senior editor at industry newsletter Furniture Today. And you can always ask the salesperson exactly what the table is made of \u2014 if they\u2019re not sure, that\u2019s a red flag, says Mr. Dyer. You can expect to pay under $500 for a less expensive veneer, but the higher-end ones go into the thousands.\n\n\u25a0 Stone and Stone-Look: Stone tabletops can include marble, quartz composite or cast stone (like cement). Stone is durable but can be porous and can absorb stains easily. \u201cDepending on how it\u2019s made, it can chip or crack,\u201d said Ms. Hirschhaut, and once that happens, it can be tough or impossible to repair. They can also be quite heavy. The price of stone can really vary \u2014 cement-topped pieces can be under $500, but marble-topped ones will run into the thousands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u25a0 Glass: Glass tabletops can include clear, frosted or tinted versions. They\u2019re relatively inexpensive and \u201ccan create a feeling of space and openness,\u201d Ms. Hirschhaut said. Though glass isn\u2019t susceptible to moisture, it can chip, scratch or crack from heat. It also shows every fingerprint. A good glass table top can last decades if you\u2019re not too clumsy, but it will start to look bad quickly if you\u2019re prone to chipping the edges or scratching the tabletop. You can find large glass-topped tables under $750.\n\n\u25a0 Metal: Metal, including stainless steel, brass, zinc and lacquered or painted versions of these, is used more frequently for table bases than tops. \u201cMetal is durable and not easily damaged,\u201d Ms. Hirschhaut said. But because of its higher-shine, it shows every fingerprint and can require special cleaning tools. Also, painted metals can be hard to repair. These can be less expensive than wood tables, though it\u2019s rare to find an all-metal dining table beyond utility tables.\n\n\u25a0 Plastic and Laminates: Man-made materials, either molded into a shape or glued onto plywood or another core, are an inexpensive option. \u201cThey can last a long time, but aren\u2019t considered the nicest quality material,\u201d Ms. Harris explained. These materials tend to resist staining and require little upkeep, but they\u2019re often perceived as cheap.\n\nCheck for sturdy, reliable construction\n\nPhoto\n\nA good dining table will be sturdy and well-made, with a finish that withstands heavy use and shows little obvious wear. \u201cThe material is a major part of good construction, but a table is only as good as the joinery,\u201d Mr. Dyer said. The joinery is the industry term for the places where the base and tabletop fit together \u2014 the more solid this is, the longer the table will last.\n\nLook underneath the floor sample at the store: Wood joined directly with wood is very strong; too many attachments and hooks can weaken the construction. In general, simpler is better. \u201cLook at the connection points where the legs meet the table tops and at the corners \u2014 if the pieces are starting to separate, you see gaps at the corners, or it\u2019s wobbly when you move it, it\u2019s not well constructed,\u201d Ms. Harris said. And beware of really inexpensive tables: They could be held together just with staples and glue.\n\nA note on chairs for your new table: If you don\u2019t have dining chairs already, the most important thing is to make sure the new ones fit at the table. \u201cPeople used to always buy tables and chairs as sets, but don\u2019t do that as much anymore,\u201d explained Ms. Harris. If you\u2019re starting from scratch and buying online, Mr. Russell suggested buying as a set, but if you\u2019re in-store, you can try out different floor models. \u201cPeople should feel free to mix and match,\u201d Mr. Pourny suggested. In a small space, he also recommends buying extra chairs and using them in other rooms when you don\u2019t need them at the table to save space.", "title": "How to Choose the Right Dining Table for Your Home", "authors": ["Ayn-Monique Klahre"]}

It\u2019s written in a way that only a young person could speak. And the unabashed lostness of the protagonist \u2026\n\nSR Exactly. I love them because you can see elements of yourself in them.\n\nPG When I was a kid, coming-of-age films \u2014 like \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d \u2014 normalized the march to adulthood.

Do you know how you do it? Is it innate or craft?\n\nSR Well, there\u2019s definitely a practice. The more you do it, the more open you are to accessing feelings. But you know, sometimes you see little kids onscreen, and it\u2019s just amazing how open and uninhibited they are.\n\nPG I\u2019m thinking of you \u2014 and your eyes \u2014 in \u201cAtonement.\u201d\n\nSR And I hadn\u2019t had any training or even life experience at that stage.\n\nPG Are you better on the 13th take, Timoth\u00e9e?\n\nTC As Armie [Hammer, Mr. Chalamet\u2019s co-star in \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d] says, \u201cI wear my heart on my sleeve.\u201d That argues for innateness, I guess. But the greatest lesson for me in drama school was failing, time after time. In my sophomore year, I struggled with this one scene. I never did it right. It was always bad.\n\nPG What was it?\n\nTC It was from \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d\n\nPG You were playing Dustin Hoffman?\n\nTC I was playing Benjamin. But as bad as I was, there was a release that came with the failure. It let me stretch a little more, try something else. It didn\u2019t make me any better necessarily, but it gave me more freedom in my head.\n\nSR Some stage actors have difficulty when they come back to film. The camera can paralyze them. But I love knowing that the camera is watching me and what it needs to see. That\u2019s when craft develops. But I still come back to that childlike sensibility when I act \u2014 to be completely in it and give myself up to it.\n\nTC One of my favorite scenes in \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d is the morning after Elio and Oliver have made love for the first time, and there\u2019s this weird tension that develops. There was some dialogue, and we tried it a few times. Then we tried it without the lines. And it works so much better that way because it\u2019s unclear.

A writer, Kit Dillon, found the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus lamp to be effective, safe, and cheaper than several others. It also comes recommended by the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, a nonprofit collective of scientists and clinicians who research environmental therapies. Before you run out and get one, keep in mind that because SAD is a medical condition, even light boxes should be used under the care of a professional.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have SAD, but I did manage to shift my circadian rhythm a bit just from waking up early and taking in small doses of the light before dawn,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cI\u2019d compare it to something like a strong cup of coffee without the crash.\u201d\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy teaches you coping skills\n\nOne of the challenges facing SAD patients and the physicians who treat them is its annual recurrence. A SAD expert and the director of clinical training at the University of Vermont, Dr. Kelly Rohan, found that a form of cognitive behavioral therapy tailored to SAD patients works not only when SAD strikes, but can actually help break the cycle.\n\n\u201cCognitive behavioral therapy is a form of talk therapy that seeks to change thought patterns and behavior,\u201d Dr. Rohan said. She explained that C.B.T. and light therapy \u201ccould not be more different.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

Dr. Rohan\u2019s study found that over time, the behavioral skills C.B.T. instills reduced the recurrence of SAD in a greater proportion of patients than those who used light therapy alone.\n\nDr. Michael Young, past president of the the Society for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms, said it makes sense that changing one\u2019s behaviors would affect SAD symptoms. While he called Dr. Rohan\u2019s findings \u201ca little disappointing for those of us in the light field,\u201d he also touted the long-term benefits of C.B.T.\n\n\u201cOn the psychological side, part of [C.B.T.] teaches people skills to help themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce people learn those, they don\u2019t tend to forget them. It doesn\u2019t require putting aside half an hour [to sit in front of a light lamp] or continuous meds, which only work if you take them.\u201d He also emphasized the importance of finding a C.B.T.-trained practitioner who has experience treating SAD specifically, since more focused treatment is more effective, over all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExercise and small behavioral changes can keep depression at bay\n\nAll of the experts agreed that, especially when combined with either light therapy or C.B.T., small behavioral changes can make a big difference. Dr. Young recommended heading outside and getting some exercise, especially in the morning.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s behaviors can affect biology and psychology,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all sorts of depression, [sufferers] decrease activity, decrease social interactions and decrease activities that give us pleasure because we think we won\u2019t enjoy things. It\u2019s a biological phenomenon: Physical activity is good for our mood.\u201d Even on cloudy days, he noted, the amount of sunlight outside still has a better effect than artificial light indoors.\n\nSo-called natural antidepressants like getting out of the house and staying active can have a great effect on SAD symptoms, Dr. Rohan noted. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily push people to do winter activities, but find your own way to engage [with the season],\u201d she advised. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to change the hands and trying to change the head, but the hands can change the head.\u201d\n\nDr. Young also advised setting specific times for mood-boosting activities. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put it on the schedule, you\u2019ll get to the end of the day and somehow it didn\u2019t happen. Have a plan,\u201d he suggested. \u201cLife gets in the way, even if you\u2019re highly motivated.\u201d\n\nWhile he has not tested it extensively yet, Dr. Rosenthal has also found success with meditation. He uses Transcendental Meditation, but said other forms may have a similar effect. \u201cYou want to be able to internally enjoy every day,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of beating the winter, but a matter of embracing it.\u201d\n\nAntidepressant medication can help when nothing else does\n\nSometimes even light therapy, C.B.T., and behavioral changes don\u2019t quite cut it. Dr. Rohan noted that the Food and Drug Administration approves certain antidepressant medications for the treatment of SAD.\n\nSome studies have shown selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.s), sertraline (also known as Zoloft) and fluoxetine (also known under the brand name Prozac) in particular have improved SAD symptoms. Another study discovered that patients who started bupropion XL (also known under its brand name, Wellbutrin) before the onset of symptoms actually saw a lower recurrence. In those trials, early antidepressant treatment reduced the overall risk of SAD by about 44 percent.\n\nAs with any other disorder, what works for one SAD patient might not work as well for another. \u201cThe most important thing is, there are options,\u201d Dr. Rohan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to suffer in silence.\u201d", "title": "How to Cope With Seasonal Affective Disorder", "authors": ["Lizz Schumer"]}

To talk common sense?\u201d He added, \u201cWhy do you have to study something that is outdated, that is industry backed, that is biased, that is not getting the results?\u201d\n\nEngaging is difficult when the alternative-health proponents are on such a different astral plane that it is a challenge even to find common language for a conversation, especially when they promote spurious concepts such as \u201cpyrrole disease,\u201d which they can speak about in great, false detail, drawing the well-informed physician, dietitian or scientist into a vortex of personal anecdote and ancient wisdom, with quips about big pharma thrown in for good measure.\n\nIt is kind of like an aerodynamics engineer trying to argue about alien spacecraft with the founder of a U.F.O. museum. How can an aerodynamics engineer speak with authority on the matter when he or she has not even bothered to research the events at Roswell and is not even aware that there are alien dissection videos freely available on the internet?\n\nCountering the online health gurus is especially difficult when they offer the irresistible cocktail of medical language muddled with a much more pleasing aesthetic than medicine, far from the clinical world of linoleum and antiseptic, a better place where patients\u2019 conditions are diagnosed with metaphors (\u201cadrenal fatigue\u201d) and treated with poetry (holy basil, bone broth, Himalayan sea salt).\n\nJust like that naturopath on Facebook describing herself as a \u201cspecialist\u201d with a \u201cpractice,\u201d alternative-health gurus harness the language of medicine to seem authoritative.

And of course what they say is always half right, which is how pseudoscience works.\n\nBut it is not the vocabulary of science that is important \u2014 it is the methodology. It would be much better if they left the language and took the rigorous approach to evidence instead, which might mean, for example, Goop choosing not to sell an $84 water bottle with amethyst quartz to \u201cinfuse water with positive energy.\u201d\n\nIn the face of this circus, we doctors must hold tight to evidence. We must hold tight to our doubt, our knowledge of our fallibility as individuals and as a profession, knowing that humility is a strength, not a weakness.\n\nBut we must also as a profession engage in the public conversations about health, including on social media, along with our colleagues in allied health fields. If we do not, the discussion will be dominated by the passionately uninformed, who build trust only to sell false cures.

{"date": "2018-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "Most people agree that the federal government should tackle public health crises, and there is a particular consensus about the current epidemic involving opioids. The White House announced last fall that President Trump was \u201cmobilizing his entire administration to address drug addiction and opioid abuse by directing the declaration of a nationwide public health emergency to address the opioids crisis.\u201d\n\nYet as of today, there is no permanent head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The president\u2019s nominee for \u201cdrug czar\u201d to run the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy withdrew from consideration in October and no replacement has been named. The acting chief of staff and general counsel for that office was dismissed last month. All this as overdose deaths continue to rise faster than ever, killing some 64,000 people last year, making the opioid epidemic a top national priority.\n\nWe need to rethink how the federal government carries out this mission. The Food and Drug Administration, in approving new opioid drugs, puts more opioids in the marketplace because these drugs meet the standards for safety and efficacy in treating certain forms of pain. But the more opioids there are in the marketplace, the greater the opportunity there is for abuse. The D.E.A. tries to curb the amount by limiting the number of pills that can be manufactured, but when the agency cracks down on one form of the drug, opioid addicts move to other forms to sustain their addiction. Playing Whac-a-Mole is hardly a strategy.\n\nWhite House czars are largely ineffective because they do not control the agency heads who are legally responsible for carrying out the various congressional mandates of the czars. Historically, the relevant agency heads don\u2019t pay much attention to czars. There is a world of difference between someone whose authority is to coordinate and someone who has the true authority to impose change. Moreover, the president\u2019s drug control policy office has been more heavily focused on law enforcement than on public health strategies.", "title": "Opinion | How to Fight the Opioid Crisis", "authors": []}

Doing so not only discourages overuse, it also raises funds that can solve the larger need \u2014 to grow another field where cows can graze, say, or to build a well-functioning subway system. And, yes, I realize that both grazing cows and well-functioning subways sound far-fetched to today\u2019s New Yorkers.\n\nThe charge for using clogged roads is known as \u201ccongestion pricing,\u201d and it works well where it has been tried, like London, Singapore and Stockholm. In New York, the daily charge to drive below 60th Street might be around $8, with additional charges for vehicles that linger all day.\n\nKen Livingstone, the London mayor when congestion pricing began in 2003, has said it\u2019s the only thing in his political career that \u201cturned out better than I expected.\u201d\n\nLondon\u2019s vehicle speeds would be 20 percent to 30 percent lower without the charge to enter central London, the urban expert Charles Komanoff has estimated, and a separate study found a significant decline in crashes.\n\nThe reason more cities haven\u2019t adopted congestion pricing, Livingstone says, is \u201cpolitical cowardice.\u201d People cling to the idea that driving should be free, even though it imposes big costs on others.\n\nIn New York, de Blasio opposes congestion pricing. He instead favors a millionaires\u2019 tax to pay for subway improvements. Higher taxes on the rich are a fine idea, but won\u2019t unclog roads. For that, de Blasio has offered a series of small, complex measures, like banning deliveries during rush hour. Good luck enforcing that one.\n\nCuomo is more positive about congestion pricing, but has not filled in the details. He may ultimately support a charge only on taxis and companies like Lyft, Uber and Via. That\u2019s a strangely anti-environment compromise, because it encourages people to own their own cars. The New York of the future should have fewer space-clogging cars, not more.\n\nThe most serious argument against congestion pricing is that it hurts lower-income workers.

{"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "text": "Cheryl Strayed: A good place to start changing your ex\u2019s place in your psyche would be to reframe the story you\u2019ve told yourself about his power. You\u2019ve given an awful lot of it to him when in truth it resides within you. You describe your wish to be free of your ex as an exorcism, but I encourage you to think of it in another way: not an opportunity to rid yourself of a man you no longer love, but as an opportunity to know yourself and your desires more deeply. One act is an expulsion, the other is an expansion. One is about someone else, the other is about you.\n\nI\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re haunted by your ex not because of who he is (in the end, a man you loathe), but because he represents something to or about you. Danger? Shame? Your own dark impulses, which have thus far expressed themselves only through your relationship with him? Only you can know. I suggest you do the internal work it takes to find out. A therapist can help you in this process, but if that\u2019s not an option, you can also do this sort of emotional excavation on your own, through journaling, contemplation and perhaps conversations with a trusted friend.\n\nSA: We\u2019re often the most stubbornly attracted to those who represent forbidden, or unresolved, aspects of our personality. In this light, it\u2019s worth considering that you\u2019ve cheated on \u201cmultiple boyfriends\u201d with this man. Could it be that your overwhelming desire for him allows you to behave in ways that otherwise violate your sense of self? After all, it\u2019s not exactly \u201csensitive\u201d or \u201cempathic\u201d to betray a series of lovers. I say this not to make you feel guilty but because the path to the truth so often runs through shame. Perhaps being with this man allows you to indulge certain darker aspects of his personality that dwell within you while also disavowing them.\n\nCS: Bingo. This is precisely what I mean when I suggest you consider the narrative you\u2019ve established about your ex, which is all about dichotomy. You\u2019ve described him as your \u201ccomplete and utter opposite,\u201d and yet perhaps what draws you to him are not the ways he\u2019s unlike you, but rather traits or impulses you share. These emerge when you speak to him or even think about him \u2014 and they thrill you. Pay attention to that.\n\nLike Steve, I\u2019m struck by the fact that you cheated on several boyfriends with your ex. He has functioned in your life as someone who disrupts your romantic stability (even if he doesn\u2019t destroy it). We generally see that as a negative, but very likely, in your deepest truth, you wanted or needed that disruption. Do you want or need it now? Your concern about living near your ex \u2014 a concern, I\u2019ll note, you describe as terror \u2014 seems to me to be both a fear and a wish, and it takes you entirely out of the equation, as if his hold over you and your agency is inevitable. But it isn\u2019t. You ask us for advice about how to free yourself of him, but it\u2019s not him you need to be free of. It\u2019s your own desire for the part of yourself he makes manifest.\n\nSA: One other significant aspect of all this is the timing. You\u2019ve settled into a stable marriage and just had your first child. You\u2019re at a moment in your life when everyone expects you to behave like a dutiful and doting mother \u2014 to suppress the uninhibited and frankly destructive lust that made your affair with this man so exhilarating. Nobody knows the precise ingredients of temptation. We can only attempt to know ourselves. That\u2019s ultimately how we gain control of our lives. It\u2019s not that we banish our desires. We simply learn to manage them, so that they no longer hold the power to destroy our happiness.", "title": "How to Get Over an Infatuation", "authors": ["Cheryl Strayed", "Steve Almond", "The Sweet Spot"]}

These projections are not all that necessary, and the focus remains firmly on the concertgoers, who eventually begin flirting, smoking and drinking; every so often, some slink into the sound booth in the back and canoodle against the window.\n\nMr. Smith tries to freeze-frame a moment in American history.

A pratfall is a staged tumble, often onto your buttocks, for comedic effect. In addition to new walkers, these dramatic spills have long been a go-to move for physical comedians, including Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.\n\nIt will take you three months of intense physical training (situps, push-ups, squats) to get in shape for pratfalling. \u201cStart low and slow,\u201d says Cunningham, who suggests learning on a padded surface. Don\u2019t linger on the ground (your audience will begin to worry). Right yourself quickly, whether it\u2019s butt-over-head back to your feet or into a handstand. Cunningham has a general rule for impact: no bony parts. \u201cButts and thighs are great,\u201d he says. Avoid landing on your elbows, knees or head. Learn to control your descent and rebound. Once you have that restraint, restore the ungainliness. \u201cThe hard part is making it look gross and sloppy and scary and funny,\u201d Cunningham says.\n\nMost Clowns Without Borders performances occur in war zones or refugee camps, not on a stage. Check first to make sure you have sufficient space free of hazards, which for Cunningham might include broken glass or animal dung. Avoid looking obviously at your landing spot \u2014 to be humorous, your topple must be a surprise. If you can get one person giggling, others will probably follow. Be a catalyst for their joy; it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re laughing at you or at one another laughing. After performing for refugees fleeing Syria, the clowns have been approached by parents who said it was the first time in months they\u2019d seen their children smile.\n\nFind a reason to fall down. Pretend to be frightened by a balloon popping or a child squealing with glee. Or maybe you see someone so beautiful in the audience you trip over your shoelaces trying to get closer. The higher your social status, the funnier your fall is. As a white American, Cunningham often wears a tuxedo and plays the part of the perpetually stumbling boss alongside more sure-footed female clowns. \u201cA good pratfall is like a good story,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has a clear beginning, middle and end.\u201d", "title": "How to Pratfall", "authors": ["Malia Wollan"]}

Or equip them with external traction cleats, sold under brand names like Yaktrax.\n\nStep two: Take smaller steps, bend forward slightly, go slow and walk as flat-footed as possible when it\u2019s icy or snowy. Check the steps and sidewalk for black ice before going out in the morning, even if only to pick up the paper or mail. Do likewise when stepping out of a vehicle. Although the air temperature may be above freezing, dew or fog can freeze on a colder surface.\n\nRegardless of the season, scan the path six or more feet ahead of you for trip hazards. Avoid carrying items that block your ability to see the ground in front of you. I once tripped and landed hard on an irregular sidewalk while carrying two shoeboxes in my arms. Even when empty-handed, be sure to pick your feet up to avoid catching a shoe.\n\nNow for the most common place for falls: Your home. Most dwellings contain a catalog of trip hazards, including piles of papers, loose carpets or floorboards, extension cords and clothing carelessly dropped on the floor, not to mention water or grease on the kitchen or bathroom floor. Remove as many of these as possible and wipe up all spills as soon as they happen.\n\nWhile important at any age, these precautions are critical for the elderly. Falls are the No. 1 cause of injury to seniors, one in three of whom can expect to fall each year. Too often the result is a debilitating fracture, loss of independence or death. Nearly three times as many people die after falling (some 32,000 a year) than are killed by guns in the United States. Even when the injury from a fall is minor, it can create fear that prompts people to avoid certain activities lest they fall again.\n\nWhen walking indoors, always wear shoes or slippers with nonskid soles \u2014 not barefoot (unless you want a broken toe), and never just socks unless they have nonslip grips on the soles. My slippers, which are really shoes with rubber soles, reside next to my bed so I can slip directly into them when I get up.\n\nAlways use a handrail when going up and down stairs. Consider installing a railing on stoops that lack them. If the item you want to carry is too big to hold in one hand or arm, ask someone to help. Bathrooms are particularly dangerous, especially for the elderly, who can benefit greatly from safety bars in the tub or shower and next to the toilet. Nonskid mats in the shower and tub and on tile floors are a must for all ages.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If you\u2019re uncertain of your stability or agility, consider some sessions with a physical therapist and practice the recommended exercises regularly. Higher levels of physical activity have been shown to protect against falls in a study of Canadian men and women 65 and older.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThink before you climb. Always use a safety stool \u2014 not a chair or ledge \u2014 when trying to reach a high-up item.

The advice tends to focus on minimizing the risk and extent of injury by landing on soft tissue as gently as possible. It includes trying to stay relaxed as you fall; the stiffer you are, the more likely an injury. As you land, try to roll like a football player.\n\nWhen falling forward, the instinct is to stick out one\u2019s hands to break the impact, which often results in broken wrists instead. If possible, try to twist as you go down to land on a side and then roll over to your back.\n\nWhen falling backward, tuck your chin to your chest to avoid hitting your head, which can result in a concussion, and keep your arms in front of you.\n\nIn all honesty, these measures are more easily described than executed. Several friends of a certain age who have fallen maintain that there was nothing they could do to mitigate an injury in the split second between being upright and lying flat on the ground.

But among Indigenous Australians, the most popular words were invasion, survival and murder. That, in miniature, is why the country finds itself in the throes of an intense debate over the timing of Australia Day.\n\nJan. 26 is the day in 1788 when the first fleet of ships from Britain entered Sydney Cove. Put simply, the holiday commemorates the British colonization of Australia \u2014 and with it the dispossession of the indigenous population, a centuries-long story of subjugation and countless atrocities, like the Gippsland massacres in the 1840s, in which up to 1,000 indigenous people were killed by white settlers over the course of a decade.\n\nAboriginal Australians have been objecting to the celebration of this date for decades. Back in 1938, for example, around 100 indigenous people held a Day of Mourning on Jan. 26. In recent years, aided by a \u201cChange the Date\u201d campaign and a growing awareness among non-indigenous Australians of what Jan. 26 means to the Aboriginal population, scrutiny of the date has come to dominate public conversations about the holiday.\n\nThis year, a popular youth radio station decided to move its annual \u201cHottest 100\u201d countdown to avoid the date after surveying its listeners. Three local councils in Melbourne have refused to hold Australia Day celebrations this year, two of them suspending citizenship ceremonies for the day. At the federal level, the Green Party started a formal political campaign to change the date.

Most of the children and adult listeners accurately recognized the emotions, especially sadness (correctly identified by over 90 percent of the study\u2019s subjects).

Instead, faithful Christians would unite in assisting the poor and the vulnerable.\n\nUnfortunately, the problems the poor and the vulnerable face are inextricably bound up with the contentious social issues that Ms. Renkl would like to avoid. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014, about 75 percent of all abortion patients were low-income. These women are less likely to have access to birth control. To prevent unwanted pregnancies, and the need for abortion, and to permit women to plan their educational and professional lives, they must have access to affordable and effective birth control and to abortion when birth control fails or fails to be used or when a woman is a victim of coercion.\n\nAccess to accurate sex education for all our children that includes but is not limited to abstinence has also been shown to reduce the number of abortions. It has the added benefit of teaching our children about healthy sexual expression and that it is not limited to heterosexuals.\n\nIn my view, Ms. Renkl\u2019s call for a new right-to-life movement allows faithful Christians to remain ideologically pure while they ignore the real-life consequences of restrictions on access to abortion, birth control and real sex education for the poor and the vulnerable she purports to champion.", "title": "Opinion | How to Truly Help the Poor", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "The story of how Americans came to peer beyond their own properties is also, inescapably, about race. As urbanization brought blacks and whites closer together, white communities reacted with racially restrictive covenants, aiming to keep blacks and their perceived threat to property values out of white neighborhoods. The Supreme Court ruled such covenants unenforceable in 1948, but they had long-lasting effects on how homeowners looked at the world around them, and the need to control it.\n\n\u201cOne of them was to make white people think that the value of their homes depended on living in a segregated community,\u201d said Carol Rose, a law professor at Yale. \u201cThat outlived racially restrictive covenants.\u201d\n\nAnother shift came with the advent of citywide zoning in New York City in 1916. Nuisance laws had targeted problems like noxious odors or chemical spills that crept across property lines. Zoning, rather than punishing people for proven harms that came from their property, told people what they could do on their property in the first place. And it prohibited many things \u2014 like buildings of a certain height \u2014 that had never been considered nuisances before.\n\nZoning effectively invited homeowners to look beyond their properties in ways they hadn\u2019t. And it helped create the expectation that communities would change little over time \u2014 or that homeowners would have a say if they did.\n\n\u201cPrior to zoning, you didn\u2019t ask yourself if you were buying a piece of property, \u2018What\u2019s the use of the land next to me, or down the block, or half a mile away?\u2019 \u201d said William Fischel, an economist at Dartmouth. \u201cZoning becomes an opportunity for you to think outside the box of the lot lines of your own property. And people definitely start doing it.\u201d\n\nAmericans fretted about property values in the early 20th century (and government documents at the time warned of how racial integration would harm them). But Americans didn\u2019t broadly begin to think of homeownership as a means to create wealth until around the 1970s, when housing started to appreciate faster than many other assets. And once housing became a financial asset \u2014 the largest one many families own \u2014 homeowners began to take more seriously anything they feared would harm it, Mr. Fischel said.\n\n\u201cThe mere possibility that a funeral home three blocks away might cause a funeral procession to go down a street just when a buyer\u2019s there, these remote threats \u2014 almost imaginary threats \u2014 start to become more resonant,\u201d Mr. Fischel said.", "title": "How \u2018Not in My Backyard\u2019 Became \u2018Not in My Neighborhood\u2019", "authors": []}

The German actor Daniel Br\u00fchl (\u201cRush\u201d) stars as the titular doctor, with Dakota Fanning (\u201cAmerican Pastoral\u201d) and Luke Evans (\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d) rounding out the leads.\n\nMr. Carr said the past film attempts failed because producers like Scott Rudin sought to turn his layered psychological tale into a more conventionally formatted blockbuster, proposing to cut characters, add a love story and otherwise abandon the main focus on the team tracking the murderer.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get what the central dynamic of a book is, you\u2019re not going to be able to make a good movie out of it,\u201d Mr. Carr said. (\u201cI wish him well with the show,\u201d Mr. Rudin emailed in response.)\n\nPhoto\n\nFor all his exasperation, Mr. Carr remained eager for an adaptation \u201cthat enough resembled the book that I didn\u2019t have to fight that battle anymore,\u201d so he could move forward with the next chapter of the saga. He is now working on the third book in the series, \u201cThe Alienist at Armageddon,\u201d slated to arrive in September. (The second, \u201cThe Angel of Darkness,\u201d came out in 1997.)\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a really futile struggle to continue the series when there was no interest in making a decent product out of the first book, much less the second book, much less a future book,\u201d Mr. Carr said.\n\nThat pessimism lifted after the television arm of Paramount, which held the movie rights, was revived in 2013. \u201cThe Alienist\u201d was \u201cliterally the first book I took off the shelf,\u201d said Amy Powell, the studio\u2019s president.\n\nFor TNT, still best known for procedurals and ampersands \u2014 \u201cRizzoli & Isles,\u201d \u201cFranklin & Bash,\u201d \u201cLaw & Order\u201d reruns \u2014 \u201cThe Alienist\u201d heralds a new focus on shows \u201cthat engage people more, that have a stronger, deeper pull on them,\u201d said Sarah Aubrey, TNT\u2019s executive vice president for original programming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the past few years, the network has forged a new path under the president Kevin Reilly, with more provocative series like \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d and \u201cClaws.\u201d But \u201cThe Alienist\u201d represents its biggest swing yet.\n\nIt is the most expensive show the network has produced, Ms. Aubrey confirmed, though she wouldn\u2019t say how much \u201cThe Alienist\u201d cost. (Variety reported that TNT was paying $5 million per episode.)\n\nSet mostly in 1896, the series was shot in Budapest on an elaborate ersatz fin de si\u00e8cle Manhattan set that was designed to allow 360-degree movement of the cameras and actors, where designers obsessed over not just cobblestone streets, costumes and gas lamps but also pocket watches, hairpins and shop windows.\n\n\u201cEvery detail matters,\u201d said Jakob Verbruggen (\u201cThe Fall\u201d), a director and executive producer of the series. \u201cWe could only sell this world if we made it 100 percent believable.\u201d\n\nSuch historical specificity was a big part of what captivated readers of \u201cThe Alienist,\u201d which unfolds in a grimy New York teeming with beleaguered immigrants, sordid brothels, crooked cops and uptown oligarchs, and included real-world figures like Theodore Roosevelt, then a police commissioner, and the financier J.P. Morgan. The philosophical question at its dark heart \u2014 is evil born or bred? \u2014 is debated throughout by the agreeably ragtag group pursuing the killer, which in addition to the alienist includes a crime reporter for The New York Times; a police secretary who was the department\u2019s first female employee; and two quirky detective brothers. Their innovative tactics include what we now recognize as criminal profiling, fingerprinting and forensic science.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough the series is faithful to the team dynamic that animates the novel, there are differences. The killer\u2019s perspective, absent from the book, is introduced early in the series. The reporter character, played by Mr. Evans, is now an illustrator. Sara Howard, the secretary played by Ms. Fanning, has been broadened into a fuller portrait of a young woman trying to be tough enough to thrive in a man\u2019s world without losing her femininity and sexuality, Ms. Fanning said.\n\n\u201cAs women, I think that\u2019s something we all deal with and especially right now, it\u2019s being talked about a lot,\u201d she added, alluding to the ongoing national reckoning with toxic male behavior.\n\nMs. Powell said, \u201cWhen people see it, I think it will be even more relevant than we thought it was when we were working on it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His take on the story was too salacious and \u201cnearly completely mistaken,\u201d Mr. Carr said.\n\n(The reason given by the studio for his departure, then and now, was that production delays led to conflicts with his other commitments. Mr. Fukunaga, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, remains credited as an executive producer and is currently working on another Paramount series, an adaptation of the Norwegian comedy \u201cManiac\u201d for Netflix. \u201cCary put a huge fingerprint on the project,\u201d Ms. Powell said.)\n\nMr. Carr also said he liked much of the pilot, the only episode he\u2019s watched, praising in particular the visuals and performances by Mr. Br\u00fchl and Mr. Evans. Finally seeing his most famous story onscreen, after decades of starts, stops and misfires, brought a sense of bifurcation, he said, as he separated his author self from his viewer one in an effort to assess the series\u2019s chances in an overstuffed TV universe. But it brought no relief, at least not yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll feel a sense of relief if it succeeds,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s just further frustration.\u201d", "title": "How \u2018The Alienist\u2019 Finally Found a Screen", "authors": ["Jeremy Egner"]}
{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "Making \u201cThe Daily\u201d has been a singular experience, both for Mr. Barbaro, who had been a business and political reporter for The Times since 2005, and for the founding producers, who came from an equally august \u2014 and entrenched \u2014 tradition, in public radio. Ms. Tobin, the executive producer of New York Times Audio, formerly worked at WBUR; Andy Mills came from \u201cRadiolab,\u201d and Theo Balcomb from \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d\n\nAll four knew from the beginning that \u201cThe Daily\u201d would stand apart from both the kind of incremental, by-the-book radio news broadcasts that date back to the 1920s and the kind of pure narrative that has made shows like \u201cThis American Life\u201d so popular in more recent years. Rather, \u201cThe Daily\u201d combines elements of both \u2014 often in very different ways from day to day. Over two days last month, for example, an interview with the Times reporter Catrin Einhorn about her reporting on sexual harassment at Ford was followed by an episode consisting entirely of sound clips from throughout 2017, with no preamble or commentary: an audio time capsule.\n\nThe show\u2019s team has benefited from the free rein to produce boldly experimental work, as well as from the considerable intellectual resources represented by their colleagues in The Times\u2019s newsroom. Most episodes of the show center on Mr. Barbaro interviewing Times reporters, focusing especially on how the particulars of the day\u2019s breaking news are shaped by the contours of the beats they\u2019ve covered, in many cases, for years.\n\nIt was, at first, a big ask. \u201cSo often, we were asking the reporter who truly had the least time to spend the most time with us,\u201d Ms. Tobin said. But if the 126 journalists who have appeared on the show have been generous with their time, \u201cThe Daily\u201d has presented a fresh opportunity for them, too.\n\nThe Washington correspondent Matt Apuzzo, who has been featured on 19 episodes, said that taping a spot on the show in the middle of writing a big story often helped him to clarify his approach. The feedback, too, is better: \u201cI think people understand better the time that we put into the reporting, and the time it takes to try to figure things out,\u201d he said. In a particularly frenzied year for news out of the White House, talking with \u201cThe Daily\u201d also helped listeners understand \u201chow we\u2019re trying to make sense of it, in a way that you just can\u2019t do in the printed word,\u201d he added.", "title": "How \u2018The Daily\u2019 Comes Together, One Year In", "authors": []}

Sunnier sitcoms like \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d from \u201cThe Good Place\u201d creator Mike Schur, dealt with characters who were already decent, not striving to become that way.\n\nOver time, antihero culture spread from premium cable to the mainstream. The bristly protagonists of Fox\u2019s \u201c24\u201d and \u201cHouse, M.D.\u201d broke rules to get the job done. Reality TV made stars of people who, in the credo of that genre, weren\u2019t there to make friends. Antiheroes are de rigueur in noirish streaming dramas like \u201cBloodline\u201d and \u201cOzark.\u201d\n\nThe mind-set even bled into in public life. Donald J. Trump, reality-TV star, in many ways ran an antihero candidacy, contrasting himself with political nice guys like Jimmy Carter: \u201cWe want someone who is going to go out and kick ass and win.\u201d (When he suggested threatening the families of ISIS fighters, he was borrowing a tactic from Jack Bauer in Season 2 of \u201c24.\u201d)\n\nNone of this is to say that antihero stories are necessarily amoral. Some, like \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d assumed moral universes of retribution and consequences. But they were a kind of rebellion against the pat moral lessons of earlier TV, in which you could count on the good guys to win simply because they were good.\n\n\u201cThe Good Place,\u201d on the other hand, avoided falling into easy moralizing by committing to the idea that becoming good is hard work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So she gets her assigned \u201csoul mate,\u201d the moral-philosophy professor Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), to teach her to be a better person.\n\nThe result is a running crash course in remedial ethics, with the most madcap name-dropping of the greats of moral thought since Monty Python\u2019s \u201cBruces\u2019 Philosophers Song.\u201d (\u201cThe Good Place\u201d has something in common with the absurdist, meaning-of-life-obsessed humor of the 1970s, like Python and \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a Season 2 episode, for instance, Chidi brings up the \u201ctrolley problem,\u201d a thought experiment devised by Philippa Foot: You\u2019re driving a trolley and must either continue on the track and kill five people or switch tracks and kill one. Is it better to kill five innocents through inaction or one by choice?\n\nTo give the conundrum some oomph, Michael conjures up an actual trolley, forcing Chidi to live out his dilemma over and over, complete with copious blood spatter. The scene is slapstick, gross-out brilliance \u2014 and a clever illustration of how applying hypotheticals to real life (or a convincing illusion) becomes, er, messy.\n\nThe characters of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d ended up in hell for relative misdemeanors. Eleanor is an oaf, but hardly a murderer. Tahani (Jameela Jamil) is a vain social climber with a jealous streak; Jason (Manny Jacinto) is a sweet dimwit. Chidi\u2019s sins are intellectual paralysis and self-flagellation. (When he learns he\u2019s in hell, he assumes it\u2019s for drinking almond milk: \u201cI knew it was bad for the environment, but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film.\u201d)\n\nThis may seem unfair \u2014 is anyone good enough for The Good Place? \u2014 but it serves a purpose. It\u2019s easy to feel distance from a true monster like Tony Soprano. The characters on \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d on the other hand, have everyday failings. They have work to do \u2014 just like we do.\n\nIn \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d morality is not something you have; it\u2019s something you do. It\u2019s a muscle that requires exercise. The show shares with dramas like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d the belief that being good is hard. But it doesn\u2019t believe that being good is futile.\n\nThe series feels like part of a wider reaction against the dark TV view of human imperfection, something that was once groundbreaking but has become a commodity.\n\nCBS All Access\u2019 \u201cThe Good Fight, \u201d like its predecessor \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d is about the conflict between principle and the cynical practice of law. ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d (anyone notice a pattern in the titles?) is a sort of syrupy reverse \u201cHouse\u201d in which the diagnoses come not from a misanthrope but a well-meaning autistic savant.\n\nBut the upbeat sophistication of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d is still rare, in this world and, apparently, in the next. When Ms. Rudolph\u2019s judge agrees to hear the characters\u2019 case, she says that she\u2019s only doing it out of boredom. \u201cIt\u2019s either this,\u201d she says, \u201cor start \u2018Bloodline.\u2019 \u201d", "title": "How \u2018The Good Place\u2019 Became an Antihero Antidote", "authors": ["James Poniewozik"]}

When he sang, in the hoarse shout of the township music from Johannesburg, the band percolated behind him. The show ended with a tribute to Nelson Mandela, which had the audience both dancing and holding fists in the air.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Masekela tended to emphasize the breadth of the musical tradition that inspired him. \u201cI was marinated in jazz, and I was seasoned in music from home,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cSong is the literature of South Africa.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s no political rally that ever happened in South Africa without singing being the main feature.\u201d\n\nThroughout his time in exile, Mr. Masekela remained committed to seeing democracy implemented in his home country. His son, Sal Masekela, noted in a statement that \u201cdespite the open arms of many countries, for 30 years he refused to take citizenship anywhere else on this earth\u201d because of his belief \u201cthat the pure evil of a systematic racist oppression could and would be crushed.\u201d\n\nRamopolo Hugh Masekela was born on April 4, 1939, in Witbank, South Africa, a coal-mining town near Johannesburg. His father, Thomas Selema Masekela, was a health inspector and noted sculptor; his mother, Pauline Bowers Masekela, was a social worker.\n\nAs a young child, Mr. Masekela was raised primarily by his grandmother, who ran an illegal bar for mine workers. \u201cOne of the great things also about Witbank was that all these people brought their different music and their different stories about where they came from,\u201d he said of the miners. \u201cAs a little kid, I hung out with them in the backyard and the kitchen and I knew all about their countries.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 12, he entered St. Peter\u2019s Secondary School, a boarding school in Rosettenville, closer to Johannesburg. By that point he had already begun to pursue music, singing in groups on the street and learning piano in private lessons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe grew infatuated with the trumpet in 1950, after seeing Kirk Douglas in the film \u201cYoung Man With a Horn,\u201d based on a novel inspired by the life of the trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt St. Peter\u2019s, he was encouraged to pursue music by Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, an influential anti-apartheid advocate and organizer. He took lessons from Uncle Sauda, an esteemed local trumpeter, and quickly mastered the basics. Archbishop Huddleston established the Huddleston Jazz Band, a youth orchestra, partly to give Mr. Masekela an opportunity to play, and later, during a trip to the United States, he met Louis Armstrong, who had a trumpet sent to the band. The instrument made its way into Mr. Masekela\u2019s hands.\n\nBy 1956, Mr. Masekela was performing in dance bands around Johannesburg and in cities across the country. In 1959, he played in the pit band of the hit musical \u201cKing Kong,\u201d with music composed by the seminal South African pianist Todd Matshikiza.\n\nThe next year he joined Abdullah Ibrahim (then known as Dollar Brand) and four other upstart instrumentalists in the Jazz Epistles, South Africa\u2019s first bebop band of note. With a heavy, driving pulse and warm, arcing melodies, their music was distinctly South African, even as its swing rhythms and flittering improvisations reflected affinities with American jazz.\n\n\u201cThere had never been a group like the Epistles in South Africa,\u201d Mr. Masekela said in his 2004 autobiography, \u201cStill Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela,\u201d written with D. Michael Cheers. \u201cOur tireless energy, complex arrangements, tight ensemble play, languid slow ballads and heart-melting, hymnlike dirges won us a following, and soon we were breaking all attendance records in Cape Town.\u201d\n\nThe group recorded just one album, which was printed in a run of 500 and eventually became a kind of Holy Grail for collectors.\n\nAfter the so-called Sharpeville massacre in March 1960, in which 69 protesters were killed by police officers in a township outside Johannesburg, the government banned public gatherings of more than 10 black people. This forced groups like the Jazz Epistles to take their performances underground; Mr. Masekela and Mr. Ibrahim soon chose to leave the country.\n\nIn 1960, Mr. Masekela moved briefly to London, where he studied at the Guildhall School of Music, before the singers Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba helped him secure a scholarship to attend the Manhattan School of Music. He studied classical trumpet there for four years.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1962, he recorded his debut album, \u201cTrumpet Africaine,\u201d for the Mercury label. He followed it in 1964 with \u201cGrrr,\u201d also on Mercury. That album \u2014 which featured the trombonist Jonas Gwangwa, a veteran of the Jazz Epistles who had also relocated to New York \u2014 included a number of Masekela originals that reflected his devotion to his musical roots. On tunes like \u201cSharpeville,\u201d the effortless churn of the rhythms and the thrumming harmonies reflected the influence of marabi, an instrumental style developed in the early 20th century by workers in the townships outside Johannesburg.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring this time, Mr. Masekela often wrote instrumental arrangements for Ms. Makeba. Their partnership turned romantic, and the couple married in 1964. The marriage ended in divorce two years later, but the two later continued to collaborate.\n\nMr. Masekela is survived by a son, Sal Masekela, from his relationship with Jessie Marie Lapierre; a daughter, Pula Twala, from his relationship with Motshidisi Jennifer Ndamse; and his sisters, Elaine and Barbara Masekela. Three other marriages \u2014 to Chris Calloway, Jabu Mbatha and Elinam Cofie \u2014 also ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1964, Mr. Masekela and Stewart Levine, a fellow student at the Manhattan School, established the independent label Chisa, named for the Zulu word for \u201cburn.\u201d The two would remain lifelong collaborators and friends.\n\nThe label struck gold in 1968 when Mr. Masekela released the album \u201cThe Promise of a Future,\u201d featuring \u201cGrazing in the Grass.\u201d With a sanguine two-chord hook, the song registered as a beatific ode to summer; it was released in May and hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts in mid-July.\n\nBy that time, Mr. Masekela had begun to sing; on other tracks on the album, including \u201cVuca (Wake Up)\u201d and \u201cBajabula Bonke (The Healing Song),\u201d he sang in Zulu, sounding tones of uplift and resistance.\n\nBut alongside success came overindulgence. Mr. Masekela developed a dependence on alcohol early in his career, and by the early 1970s he was addicted to cocaine, as well. His substance abuse began to inhibit his work. \u201cNo recording company was interested in me,\u201d he told the music historian Gwen Ansell last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe sought solace on his home continent. \u201cFor me, songs come like a tidal wave,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this low point, for some reason, the tidal wave that whooshed in on me came all the way from the other side of the Atlantic: from Africa, from home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the 1970s, Mr. Masekela toured sub-Sarahan Africa and began a partnership with the Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, who had recently pioneered the genre known as Afrobeat. He also worked with the exiled South African saxophonist Dudu Pukwana and began fronting the Ghanaian group Hedzoleh Soundz. He recorded two albums with the group, \u201cIntroducing Hedzoleh Soundz\u201d and \u201cI Am Not Afraid,\u201d and toured the United States with them in 1974.\n\nPartly thanks to Mr. Kuti\u2019s influence, Mr. Masekela began to record longer, more immersive tracks, using electronic effects and letting grooves linger for minutes on end. That style is heard to perhaps its greatest effect on \u201cThe Boy\u2019s Doin\u2019 It,\u201d which Mr. Masekela recorded in Lagos with Nigerian musicians in 1975.\n\nWhen he kicked his addictions in the 1990s, Mr. Masekela established the Musicians and Artists Assistance Program of South Africa, to help South Africans battle substance abuse.\n\nIn 1980, Mr. Masekela returned to Africa. He settled in Botswana, where he set up a mobile recording studio and recorded two albums. In 1987, he traveled to London to record the album \u201cTomorrow,\u201d which included \u201cMandela (Bring Him Back Home).\u201d\n\nMr. Masekela moved back to South Africa in 1990, the year Mandela was released from prison. He continued to record and tour around the world into his mid-70s.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. Masekela was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in gold, South Africa\u2019s highest medal of honor. Since 2014, Soweto has been the site of an annual Hugh Masekela Heritage Festival, with the stated aim \u201cto restore our South African heritage and to uplift the local artisans of Soweto.\u201d", "title": "Hugh Masekela, Trumpeter and Anti-Apartheid Activist, Dies at 78", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"]}

After Mr. Wilson split off from them for a job at an advertising agency in Atlanta, Mr. Patchett and Mr. Tarses ended up in Los Angeles as comedy writers.\n\nWhen Mr. Wilson visited them on a West Coast trip and expressed a desire to switch to comedy writing himself, they arranged an interview with Grant Tinker, Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s husband and co-founder of her production company, MTM Enterprises.

She was trying to see if she could avoid an out-of-pocket payment of more than $1,200, one of two she would have to make this year, on top of her rising expenses for vitamins and supplements to manage the disease. She has relatively good insurance, but the payments will strain her budget.\n\n\u201cDuring the holidays, I was contemplating what am I\u2019m going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking should I just go on a liquid diet, because I can\u2019t afford this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult choice.\n\n\u201cIt does give you your life back,\u201d she said of the drug. \u201cI literally couldn\u2019t go away from the house or very far from a bathroom, 20, 25 times in the bathroom all day long, I can\u2019t imagine living like that,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI was becoming a hermit because I was so sick.\u201d\n\nHumira, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie\u2019s $25.6 billion in revenue in 2016, was not simple to develop. It is among a new class of drugs known as biologics, which are made from living cells rather than synthetic chemicals. The industry has argued that high American prices are needed to fund drug development, but a 2016 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found \u201cno evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear.\u201d\n\nCompetitive pressures have been muted. Copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars, are not as easy to produce as normal generic drugs, and AbbVie\u2019s aggressive patent strategy has allowed it to further push off rivals. While there are name brand competitors to Humira, they are not exactly alike, complicating efforts by doctors or insurers to switch a patient from one drug to another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLooking at the international picture tells its own story about drug costs.

But it does nothing to settle the question of how or whether Mr. Lee was involved. For years, he was the prime suspect in a mole hunt, but officials disagreed over whether he was actually to blame.\n\nOne government official said there was no plan at the moment to charge Mr. Lee with espionage, handing over American secrets to the Chinese or anything beyond the one felony count of illegally possessing classified information. That would leave open the mystery of how China managed to unravel the C.I.A.\u2019s web of informants.\n\nNeither the F.B.I. nor the Justice Department would discuss this high-stakes back story on Wednesday. \u201cThis is an example of the system working,\u201d said Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman. \u201cThe defendant arrived in this country, we apprehended him and he has been charged with an extremely serious offense.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Mr. Lee\u2019s college-age daughter declined to discuss the case and said that no lawyer or family member was available to speak on his behalf.\n\nThe New York Times revealed the decimation of the C.I.A.\u2019s network last year, citing 10 current and former government officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. Several of them identified Mr. Lee as the key suspect at the time.\n\nMr. Lee, 53, took an unremarkable path through the C.I.A. He became a United States citizen and, after four years in the Army, studied international business management at Hawaii Pacific University. He graduated in 1992 and received a master\u2019s degree in human resource management the next year.\n\nFrom there, he joined the C.I.A., posing as an American diplomat while serving as a clandestine case officer. From old address records, he appears to have served in Tokyo from about 1999 to 2002. Officials say he also worked at the East Asia Division at C.I.A. Headquarters and the agency\u2019s Beijing station before he left in 2007 and took a job in Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the C.I.A. noticed in late 2010 that its spies were disappearing, suspicion did not immediately turn to Mr. Lee, according to current and former officials. But as fears of a mole grew, the government set up a secret task force of C.I.A. officers and F.B.I. agents. A veteran F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, Charles McGonigal, was assigned to run it, former American law enforcement officials said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAs the disappearances continued, analysts concluded that Mr. Lee, even though he had been out of the C.I.A. for years, had known the identities of many of the those who had been killed or imprisoned. He showed all the indicators on a government matrix used to identify potential espionage threats, one former official recalled.\n\nBut warning signs can be wrong. At the C.I.A., top officials ruefully remembered the treatment of Brian J. Kelly, an agency officer who in the 1990s was wrongly suspected by the F.B.I. of being a Russian spy. More recently, the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to unearth Chinese spies have suffered embarrassing setbacks, including dropped charges against prominent Chinese-Americans.\n\nIn Mr. Lee\u2019s case, other possible explanations existed. Some investigators believed that China had cracked the C.I.A.\u2019s system for communicating with its informants. The spy agency had encountered similar problems in other countries, and some investigators believed the technology was too clunky to stand up to China\u2019s sophisticated computer specialists.\n\nAnother group accused C.I.A. officials in Beijing of being sloppy and allowing themselves to be identified when meeting with their informants. It was an acrimonious dispute, and some officials conceded that a combination of factors could account for the damage.\n\nSome former officials who reviewed the evidence described the case against Mr. Lee as strong but circumstantial, not bulletproof. Some at the C.I.A. argued that officials were too quick to suspect a mole \u2014 especially a Chinese-American \u2014 when there were other explanations.\n\nThe F.B.I. was watching in August 2012 when Mr. Lee returned to the United States with his family. Agents secretly entered his hotel rooms in Hawaii and Virginia and discovered two small books with handwritten notes that contained classified information, including the identities of undercover C.I.A. officials, court papers show.\n\nThe information the books contained, including details about meetings between C.I.A. informants and undercover agents, as well as their real names and phone numbers, matched documents that Mr. Lee had written while at the C.I.A., according to court documents. It was not clear whether any of the people identified in his documents were part of the Chinese roundup of C.I.A. sources.\n\nAgents spoke with him repeatedly in the following months. Both the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., and Robert S. Mueller III, then the F.B.I. director, were personally briefed on the investigation and pledged whatever resources were necessary. But senior government officials said they cannot recall any serious push to arrest Mr. Lee at the time or to try to charge him with espionage in connection with the lost Chinese informants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo in June 2013, the agents let Mr. Lee leave. Current and former officials have said that the C.I.A.\u2019s losses had ended by late 2012, so there is no evidence that the decision allowed more informants to be captured or killed.\n\nAt least once in recent years, according to a government official, Mr. Lee returned to the United States without attracting the F.B.I.\u2019s attention. It was not clear how or why he did so.\n\nAt some point the Justice Department decided that if it had the chance, it would charge Mr. Lee. Officials suspected that opportunity might come later this year when Mr. Lee\u2019s daughter graduated from college, an occasion that might draw him back to the United States.\n\nWhen Mr. Lee surprised the government recently by booking a trip to New York, prosecutors hurried to file the charge that they had kept waiting for years.", "title": "Hunting a C.I.A.

About $4.3 billion was said to be tied up in funding for other government agencies, even as utilities struggle to make ends meet.\n\nPuerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy last May, giving the island a way to decide how much to cut pensions, debt payments and other obligations under federal court supervision. The board will represent the Puerto Rican government in the proceedings \u2014 but first it must accept the governor\u2019s fiscal plan by Feb. 23. If it disagrees, it is empowered to impose its own fiscal plan on the island.\n\nThe board has been at odds with Puerto Rican leaders over how to restore fiscal balance after years of the island spending more than it had and borrowing to make up the difference. The board, for example, has insisted on reducing public employee pensions by 10 percent, on average, as a way to spread the economic suffering evenly among Puerto Ricans. Mr. Rossell\u00f3 maintained on Wednesday that the pensioners are too \u201cvulnerable\u201d a population.\n\n\u201cThe Oversight Board views implementing structural reforms and investing in critical infrastructure as key to restoring economic growth and increasing confidence in residents and businesses,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, the board\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cOur focus in certifying the revised plans will be to ensure they reflect Puerto Rico\u2019s post-hurricane realities and provide a realistic basis\u201d for recovery and sustainability.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 announced his intention to privatize the power authority. The governor said that privatizing it would make electricity cheaper and more reliable and attract more business to the island. He also suggested that the proceeds from selling Prepa to private investors could be used to pay the pensions of retired public workers.", "title": "Hurricane-Torn Puerto Rico Says It Can\u2019t Pay Any of Its Debts for 5 Years", "authors": []}

A tireless innovator, Heisman, promoting the forward pass, divided the game into quarters and, in 1898, came up with \u201chike\u201d as a way for an entire team to know when the ball would be snapped into the backfield.\n\nBefore then, backs used silent gestures to begin plays. Heisman, a part-time stage actor who had been trained as a lawyer, prized gifted oratory and preferred a dynamic sound that would spring his charges into action. Hike fit the bill and also aptly described what was happening: a ball hiked backward from the ground.\n\nQuarterbacks nationwide dutifully summoned the ball with a resolute \u201chike\u201d for most of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn time, however, like so many things in football \u2014 where there is too much time to think between game weekends \u2014 the unadorned hike became increasingly complicated.\n\nAgain, Heisman played a part. Another of his innovations was a sudden shift of backfield players before the snap, which allowed Heisman\u2019s teams to overload one side of a formation. To augment the advantage, an element of deception was added, with code words used to signal the shift.\n\nThen, as the forward pass became a bigger part of football in the 1910s, concealing the offense\u2019s play call became a major imperative. Some teams even approached the line of scrimmage knowing they might change the play called in the huddle before the ball was snapped. This required much more than a single, shouted \u2018\u2018hike.\u2019\u2019 Additional coded signals were soon developed, a system now known as an audible.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Fans watching at home hear a host of seemingly disconnected terms and words, even the names of cities \u2014 who can forget Peyton Manning\u2019s \u201cOmaha!\u201d \u2014 and animals.\n\nMuch of it is mumbo-jumbo, phony phrases meant to confuse the defense.\n\n\u201cMy friends outside of football ask me, \u2018What\u2019s all that chatter at the line?\u2019\u201d Weston Richburg, the Giants center, said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018Ignore it, because we do.\u2019 I mean, some of it matters. But a lot of it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen it does matter, yelling a color like blue or red can be a code for the play being changed. Or, barking \u201cEagle 18\u201d can be a signal that the ball will be snapped on the next sound coming from the quarterback\u2019s mouth no matter what that sound is.\n\nSometimes the directive to snap the ball is not a voice command at all. Known as a silent count, it is communicated with a hand motion or when the quarterback lifts his leg off the ground.\n\nWide receivers, lined up far from the center of the formation, usually cannot hear the quarterback\u2019s signals because of crowd noise. They try not to move until they see the football leave the ground.\n\nDefensive linemen, at least most of the time, do the same thing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t listen to anything,\u201d Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cThe fastest thing on the field is the football when it\u2019s snapped. When it moves, so do I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBecause those quarterbacks are paid to trick me. I shut them out \u2014 what are they saying anyway? Hike? Whatever.\u201d\n\nStill, for roughly the last 60 years, the signal has most assuredly not been hike.\n\n\u201cHike is a term used by people outside football,\u201d Spencer Long, the Redskins center, said. \u201cHike is too hard to say. That\u2019s probably why they got rid of it.\u201d\n\nThe Giants quarterback Eli Manning, referring to his father, Archie, a college and N.F.L. quarterback in the 1960s and 1970s, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think even my dad said hike. I think our family has always been hut guys. But it\u2019s a good question: Why do we say that?\u201d\n\nIt turns out hike evolved into hut because of football\u2019s longtime love of military terminology.\n\nAfter studying \u201chut,\u201d Ben Zimmer, a noted linguist and lexicographer, published findings several years ago that linked the term to the cadences used by marching soldiers. In American military settings, it was often a substitute in basic marching commands, as in \u201chut, two, three, four\u201d instead of \u201cone, two, three, four.\u201d\n\nAnd drill sergeants in the middle of the 20th century also called troops to order with, \u201cAtten-hut!\u201d\n\nMany football coaches and players in the late 1940s and early 1950s had served in the armed forces during World War II. Returning to football fields after the war, they borrowed hut as a clear, concise command that could be heard by a large group of men scattered across a plain.\n\nTheismann was happy to finally have an answer.\n\n\u201cWith the great synergy between football and the military, it figures that it had something to do with following orders,\u201d Theismann said. \u201cThen again, think of the chaos and the penalties there would be if we didn\u2019t have a word that got everyone moving together as a team.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what it comes down to. Why do we say hut? Because it works.\u201d", "title": "Hut! Hut! Hut! What?", "authors": ["Bill Pennington"]}

He\u2019d obviously put a lot of effort into it; the house was filled with flowers, he\u2019d cooked a wonderful meal, he\u2019d had the cat I was allergic to euthanized.\u201d\n\nWow, he sounds like a keeper!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I had been thinking, too.

A 1990 study conducted by the psychologists Ulf Dimberg and L.O. Lundquist found that when female faces are recognized as angry, their expressions are rated as more hostile than comparable expressions on the faces of men \u2014 as if their violation of social expectations had already made their anger seem more extreme, increasing its volume beyond what could be tolerated.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d her account of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton describes the pressure not to come across as angry during the course of her entire political career \u2014 \u201ca lot of people recoil from an angry woman,\u201d she writes \u2014 as well as her own desire not to be consumed by anger after she lost the race, \u201cso that the rest of my life wouldn\u2019t be spent like Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens\u2019s \u2018Great Expectations,\u2019 rattling around my house obsessing over what might have been.\u201d The specter of Dickens\u2019s ranting spinster \u2014 spurned and embittered in her crumbling wedding dress, plotting her elaborate revenge \u2014 casts a long shadow over every woman who dares to get mad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her suffering: ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. It\u2019s as if the prospect of a woman\u2019s anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized.\n\nConsider the red-carpet clip of Uma Thurman that went viral in November, during the initial swell of sexual-harassment accusations. The clip doesn\u2019t actually show Thurman\u2019s getting angry. It shows her very conspicuously refusing to get angry. After commending the Hollywood women who had spoken out about their experiences of sexual assault, she said that she was \u201cwaiting to feel less angry\u201d before she spoke herself. It was curious that Thurman\u2019s public declarations were lauded as a triumphant vision of female anger, because the clip offered precisely the version of female anger that we\u2019ve long been socialized to produce and accept: not the spectacle of female anger unleashed, but the spectacle of female anger restrained, sharpened to a photogenic point. By withholding the specific story of whatever made her angry, Thurman made her anger itself the story \u2014 and the raw force of her struggle not to get angry on that red carpet summoned the force of her anger even more powerfully than its full explosion would have, just as the monster in a movie is most frightening when it only appears offscreen.\n\nThis was a question I began to consider quite frequently as the slew of news stories accrued last fall: How much female anger has been lurking offscreen? How much anger has been biding its time and biting its tongue, wary of being pathologized as hysteria or dismissed as paranoia? And what of my own vexed feelings about all this female anger? Why were they even vexed? It seemed a failure of moral sentiment or a betrayal of feminism, as if I were somehow siding with the patriarchy, or had internalized it so thoroughly I couldn\u2019t even spot the edges of its toxic residue. I intuitively embraced and supported other women\u2019s anger but struggled to claim my own. Some of this had to do with the ways I\u2019d been lucky \u2014 I had experienced all kinds of gendered aggression, but nothing equivalent to the horror stories so many other women have lived through. But it also had to do with an abiding aversion to anger that still festered like rot inside me. In what I had always understood as self-awareness \u2014 I don\u2019t get angry. I get sad \u2014 I came to see my own complicity in the same logic that has trained women to bury their anger or perform its absence.\n\nFor a long time, I was drawn to \u201csad lady\u201d icons: the scribes and bards of loneliness and melancholy. As a certain kind of slightly morbid, slightly depressive, slightly self-intoxicated, deeply predictable, pre-emptively apologetic literary fan-girl, I loved Sylvia Plath. I was obsessed with her own obsession with her own blood (\u201cWhat a thrill ... that red plush\u201d) and drawn to her suffering silhouette: a woman abandoned by her cheating husband and ensnared by the gendered double standards of domesticity. I attached myself to the mantra of her autobiographical avatar Esther Greenwood, who lies in a bathtub in \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d bleeding during a rehearsal of a suicide attempt, and later stands at a funeral listening \u201cto the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.\u201d Her attachment to pain \u2014 her own and others\u2019 \u2014 was also a declaration of identity. I wanted to get it tattooed on my arm.\n\nWhenever I listened to my favorite female singers, it was easier for me to sing along to their sad lyrics than their angry ones. It was easier to play Ani DiFranco on repeat, crooning about heartbreak \u2014 \u201cDid I ever tell you how I stopped eating/when you stopped calling me?\u201d \u2014 than it was to hear her fury, and her irritation at the ones who stayed sad and quiet in her shadow: \u201cSome chick says/Thank you for saying all the things I never do/I say, you know/The thanks I get is to take all the [expletive] for you.\u201d\n\nI kept returning to the early novels of Jean Rhys, whose wounded heroines flopped around dingy rented rooms in various European capitals, seeking solace from their heartbreak, staining cheap comforters with their wine. Sasha, the heroine of \u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d \u2014 the most famous of these early picaresques of pain \u2014 resolves to drink herself to death and manages, mainly, to cry her way across Paris. She cries at cafes, at bars, in her lousy hotel room. She cries at work. She cries in a fitting room. She cries on the street. She cries near the Seine. The closing scene of the novel is a scene of terrifying passivity: She lets a wraithlike man into her bed because she can\u2019t summon the energy to stop him, as if she has finally lost touch with her willpower entirely. In life, Rhys was infamous for her sadness, what one friend called \u201cher gramophone-needle-stuck-in-a-groove thing of going over and over miseries of one sort and another.\u201d Even her biographer called her one of the greatest self-pity artists in the history of English fiction.\n\nIt took me years to understand how deeply I had misunderstood these women. I\u2019d missed the rage that fueled Plath\u2019s poetry like a ferocious gasoline, lifting her speakers (sometimes literally) into flight: \u201cNow she is flying/More terrible than she ever was, red/Scar in the sky, red comet/Over the engine that killed her \u2014 the mausoleum, the wax house.\u201d The speaker becomes a scar \u2014 this irrefutable evidence of her own pain \u2014 but this scar, in turn, becomes a comet: terrible and determined, soaring triumphant over the instruments of her own supposed destruction. I\u2019d always been preoccupied with the pained disintegration of Plath\u2019s speakers, but once I started looking, I saw the comet trails of their angry resurrections everywhere, delivering their unapologetic fantasies of retribution: \u201cOut of the ash/I rise with my red hair/And I eat men like air.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d loved Rhys for nearly a decade before I read her final novel, \u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d a reimagining of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d whose whole plot leads inexorably toward an act of destructive anger: The mad first wife of Mr. Rochester burns down the English country manor where she has been imprisoned in the attic for years. In this late masterpiece, the heroines of Rhys\u2019s early novels \u2014 heartbroken, drunk, caught in complicated choreographies of passivity \u2014 are replaced by an angry woman with a torch, ready to use the master\u2019s tools to destroy his house.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that these authors were writing exclusively about female anger rather than female sorrow; their writing holds both states of feeling. \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d excavates the deep veins of sadness running beneath an otherwise opaque act of angry destruction, and Plath\u2019s poems are invested in articulating the complicated affective braids of bitterness, irony, anger, pride and sorrow that others often misread as monolithic sadness. \u201cThey explain people like that by saying that their minds are in watertight compartments, but it never seemed so to me,\u201d Rhys herself once wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all washing about, like the bilge in the hold of a ship.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Near the end of the new biopic \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Tonya Harding\u2019s character explains: \u201cAmerica, they want someone to love, but they want someone to hate.\u201d The timing of the film\u2019s release, in late 2017, seemed cosmically apt. It resurrected a definitional prototype of female anger \u2014 at least for many women like me, who came of age during the 1990s \u2014 at the precise moment that so many women were starting to get publicly, explicitly, unapologetically angry.\n\nHarding was an object of fascination not just because of the soap opera she dangled before the public gaze \u2014 supposedly conspiring with her ex-husband and an associate to plan an attack on her rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan \u2014 but also because she and Kerrigan provided a yin and yang of primal female archetypes. As a vision of anger \u2014 uncouth and unrestrained, the woman everyone loved to hate, exploding at the judges when they didn\u2019t give her the scores she felt she deserved \u2014 Harding was the perfect foil for the elegant suffering of Kerrigan, sobbing in her lacy white leotard. Together they were an impossible duo to turn away from: the sad girl and the mad girl. Wounded and wicked. Their binary segregated one vision of femininity we adored (rule-abiding, delicate, hurting) from another we despised (trashy, whiny, angry). Harding was strong; she was poor; she was pissed off; and eventually, in the narrative embraced by the public, she turned those feelings into violence. But \u201cI, Tonya\u201d illuminates what so little press coverage at the time paid attention to: the perfect storm of violence that produced Harding\u2019s anger in the first place \u2014 her mother\u2019s abuse and her husband\u2019s. Which is to say: No woman\u2019s anger is an island.\n\nWhen the Harding and Kerrigan controversy swept the media, I was 10 years old. Their story was imprinted onto me as a series of reductive but indelible brush strokes: one woman shouting at the media, another woman weeping just beyond the ice rink. But after watching \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and realizing how much these two women had existed to me as ideas, rather than as women, I did what any reasonable person would do: I Googled \u201cTonya and Nancy\u201d obsessively. I Googled: \u201cDid Tonya ever apologize to Nancy?\u201d I Googled: \u201cTonya Harding boxing career?\u201d and discovered that it effectively began with her 2002 \u201cCelebrity Boxing\u201d match against Paula Jones \u2014 two women paid to perform the absurd caricatures of vengeful femininity the public had projected onto them, the woman who cried harassment versus the woman who bashed kneecaps.\n\nIn the documentaries I watched, I found Harding difficult to like. She comes off as a self-deluded liar with a robust victim complex, focused on her own misfortune to the exclusion of anyone else\u2019s. But what does the fact that I found Harding \u201cdifficult to like\u201d say about the kind of women I\u2019m comfortable liking? Did I want the plotline in which the woman who has survived her own hard life \u2014 abusive mother, abusive husband, enduring poverty \u2014 also emerges with a \u201clikable\u201d personality: a plucky spirit, a determined work ethic and a graceful, self-effacing relationship to her own suffering?\n\nThe vision of Harding in \u201cI, Tonya\u201d is something close to the opposite of self-effacing. The film even includes a fantastical re-enactment of the crime, which became popularly known as the \u201cwhack heard round the world,\u201d in which Harding stands over Kerrigan\u2019s cowering body, baton raised high above her head, striking her bloody knee until Harding turns back toward the camera \u2014 her face defiant and splattered with Kerrigan\u2019s blood. Even though the attack was actually carried out by a hired hit man, this imagined scene distills the version of the story that America became obsessed with, in which one woman\u2019s anger leaves another woman traumatized.", "title": "I Used to Insist I Didn\u2019t Get Angry.

None of the approved athletes were among those disciplined by the organization for doping in Sochi, and none have been suspended for a doping violation in the past. Each athlete\u2019s candidacy was considered anonymously, according to Olympic officials.\n\nBeyond being declared clean by the I.O.C., Russian athletes will need to have qualified for the Games by the standards of their respective sports. As a handful of qualifying events continue before Jan. 28 \u2014 the deadline by which athletes must be registered for the Games \u2014 the I.O.C. said Friday that it was impossible to estimate the number of Russian competitors.\n\nStill, the generous pool established Friday makes it possible for the number to rival the size of Russia\u2019s delegation in Sochi, where now-disgraced medalists used a cocktail of anabolic steroids and had their incriminating urine samples destroyed.\n\nIn Pyeongchang, Russian athletes will technically compete under the Olympic flag, with no Russian emblems identifying them or appearing at the opening ceremony on Feb. 9. Nonetheless, Russian athletes and officials have expressed pride that their athletes will be referred to by the acronym OAR: Olympic Athlete from Russia. In past cases in which athletes from suspended countries like Kuwait have competed under the Olympic flag, there have been no references to national origin.\n\nPhoto\n\nAntidoping officials from more than 20 countries have called the level of public detail about the I.O.C.\u2019s evaluation process insufficient, requesting on Thursday that Olympic officials publish specific criteria in light of the I.O.C.\u2019s own statement in 2016 that Russian athletes ought to be presumed tainted by a corrupted system and required to prove themselves innocent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.O.C. said Friday that the soonest it could publish the names of the athletes invited to compete would be Jan. 27, following an I.O.C. meeting on the matter to be held in Pyeongchang that day.\n\nLegal challenges, too, are to be considered by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which has 39 appeals related to Russian doping to be decided ahead of the Games.

If previous tax code changes are any guide, the number of queries is likely to rise significantly, pushing down the response figure even more.\n\nA preliminary estimate by the I.R.S. figured that the new law would require an additional $495 million over the next two fiscal years to handle tasks like updating programming, answering phone calls, drafting and publishing new forms, revising regulations and training employees on the new code.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Another possibility is that the Islamic State\u2019s media apparatus was disrupted after the group lost nearly 98 percent of its territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAdditionally, there have been reports of unrest among from Al Qaeda loyalists after Mr. Sahraoui made his pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. \u201cThere were even reports at one point that he was injured in a shootout with Al Qaeda,\u201d Mr. Joscelyn said.\n\nMr. Sahraoui cut his teeth in Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in the region, which reported to Osama bin Laden through letters that were carried across the desert by couriers. He joined the Qaeda branch sometime in 2010, according to one account, and became a deputy to Abdelhamid Abu Zeid, one of Al Qaeda\u2019s most notorious commanders in the area and among the first to discover that foreigners were lucrative bargaining chips. He bankrolled his operations through kidnappings for ransom, pioneering a business model that was later adopted by the terrorist group in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy 2011, Mr. Sahraoui was in charge of taking care of foreign hostages kidnapped by the group, according to Mariasandra Mariani, an Italian who was held by him for more than a year after her abduction in Algeria on Feb. 2, 2011.\n\nHe parted ways with Al Qaeda in 2012, after the jihadists seized most of northern Mali. He resurfaced as the spokesman of the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, a separate jihadist group based in Mali, which merged with a third group in 2013.\n\nThen in May 2015, he swore loyalty to the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But his video pledge was not released by the group\u2019s news agency for more than a year, until October 2016. Since then, Mr. Sahraoui\u2019s statements have not been promoted on ISIS media outlets, including Friday\u2019s claim, which was sent to the Mauritanian website. The Islamic State affiliate operating in Nigeria regularly succeeds in uploading messages and photo essays through established ISIS media channels.\n\nThat lack of a consistent media presence may suggest that Mr. Sahraoui\u2019s unit has not been fully accepted by the Islamic State, or else that the group has not managed to establish the logistical ties that have allowed other affiliates to post statements and videos of attacks on its platforms.\n\nIn Bangladesh in 2016, for example, a relatively new affiliate was able to send images of an attack on a restaurant to the Islamic State\u2019s Amaq News Agency before members of the security forces broke down the doors and ended the siege. Survivors later described how the attackers had demanded that employees turn on the restaurant\u2019s wireless network so that they could send their images.\n\nSimilarly last June, the assailants who broke into Iran\u2019s Parliament and the tomb of its revolutionary founder, managed to send a graphic, 24-second video to Amaq, showing them inside the building, walking past the dead and shouting Islamic State slogans.", "title": "ISIS Affiliate Claims October Attack on U.S. Troops in Niger", "authors": ["Rukmini Callimachi"]}

It was the first major attack in Iraq\u2019s capital since the government declared victory over the terrorist group last month.\n\nThe nearly simultaneous explosions occurred minutes apart just after 6 a.m. on Monday, with the first assailant detonating his explosives in a square where day laborers were gathering to find work. The second bomber set off his explosives as people rushed to help the wounded, according to a traffic police officer who witnessed the episode. That sequence is a well-established pattern for the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, and is aimed at killing the maximum number of civilians.\n\nBut the statement released on the messaging app Telegram had a number of errors, including the location of Monday\u2019s attack. It said that it had occurred at Aden Square in Baghdad, where the police said an attack was foiled on Saturday, rather than in Tayaran Square, where Monday\u2019s explosions took place. That error, and the delay in issuing a claim of responsibility, suggests that the Islamic State\u2019s media apparatus has been disrupted in the period since the group lost nearly 98 percent of its territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn addition, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, said that there were three attackers, not two. The communiqu\u00e9 identified them by code names, and said that the first two detonated their explosive vests in quick succession, while the third hit another gathering in the same area sometime after the first two explosions, according to a translation of the statement provided by SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nIn its statement, ISIS identified the open-air market that was attacked as a gathering of \u201crafidha\u201d and of \u201cpolytheists,\u201d two words they use to refer to Shiite Muslims in a derogatory manner. The first term, derived from the Arabic root meaning \u201cto reject,\u201d is a reference to the fact that members of the Shiite branch of Islam chose to follow a different lineage from the one followed by Sunnis after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The second refers to the group\u2019s view that Shiites have strayed from Islam\u2019s monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures, like Imam Ali.\n\nOf note is the length of time it took for the Islamic State to issue its claim of responsibility.

Despite his buttoned-up solemnity Deneen occasionally plays peekaboo with his sources, especially the left-wing ones, shining the klieg lights on certain parts of their arguments while eliding others that might complicate his own.\n\nIn an otherwise illuminating section on the development of capitalism, Deneen refers to the great economic historian Karl Polanyi, who showed how the state had to take a strong hand in the creation of ostensibly free markets: \u201cAs Polanyi pithily says of this transformation, \u2018Laissez-faire was planned.\u2019\u201d But Polanyi drew different conclusions from his own observations. An ardent social democrat who fled his beloved Red Vienna when the fascists took over, Polanyi went into exile four times, eventually landing in Canada. This cosmopolitan intellectual, born into a Hungarian-Jewish family, would most likely have been highly suspicious of Deneen\u2019s extreme disdain for what he calls \u201clives of deracinated vagabondage\u201d and his sentimentalization of communal norms enforced by \u201cpeople of good will.\u201d\n\nDeneen says that the only proper response to liberalism is \u201cto transform the household into a small economy.\u201d Home may be where the heart is, but it can also be the site for homegrown prejudice, petty grievances and a vicious cruelty. Deneen is so determined to depict liberalism as a wholly bankrupt ideology that he gives exceedingly short shrift to what might have made it appealing \u2014 and therefore powerful \u2014 in the first place. With all its abiding flaws, liberalism offered a way out for those who didn\u2019t conform to the demands of the clan.\n\nBesides, nobody is truly stopping Deneen from doing what he prescribes: finding a community of like-minded folk, taking to the land, growing his own food, pulling his children out of public school. His problem is that he apparently wants everyone to do these things \u2014 which suggests he may have more in common with his caricature of a bullying liberal than he cares to admit.\n\nOr perhaps it just goes to show that everyone has his blind spots \u2014 even erudite political philosophers keen to denounce the blind spots of others. Deneen and his fellow localists are cast as virtuous souls who would necessarily make discerning, merciful and respectful yeoman farmers once the revolution comes.

Ms. Merkel\u2019s first comment after Election Day, when her party came in first but also racked up its largest decline in votes ever, was that she was \u201cnot disappointed\u201d and that she could not see what needed to change now.\n\nNo wonder the public is no longer sure whether Ms. Merkel herself still knows the difference between serenity and fatigue. If one European, after all, has reason to be tired, it is Ms. Merkel.\n\nShe certainly has been confusing two things for far too long: quiet and silence. While one might still think it wise for a head of government to stay away from the hastiness of Twitter, to rarely speak to the public at all is the other extreme. With the exception of dutiful TV appearances during the election campaigns, Ms. Merkel speaks so little to the Germans that it appears she doesn\u2019t have anything to say, or doesn\u2019t see a reason to explain herself or doesn\u2019t deem it necessary to convince anyone of her sapience.\n\nAll this merges into the impression that she feels she herself embodies the country, similar to a monarch who makes rareness a sign of authority. It conveys a whiff of arrogance to tell the Germans, during the migration crisis, \u201cWe will manage this,\u201d and then to switch back to loaded silence instead of explaining exactly how \u201cthis\u201d will be managed.\n\nThat the lady\u2019s not for talking is a particular disappointment to reporters and politicians who have interacted with her in background conversations, where she is outspoken and charming. Had Ms. Merkel displayed more of the talent publicly, she could have spared Germany a good part of the rise of right-wing populism.\n\nIn times like these, it is simply not enough for the chancellor to be the country\u2019s first civil servant, particularly not when the electorate calls for action. That is what is on offer from President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria. Whatever one thinks of their aims (and in Mr. Kurz\u2019s case, of his far-right coalition partner), both manage to convey ambition. During a recent 24-hour stint in Berlin, Mr. Kurz delivered more clear ideas on migration than Ms. Merkel did in the past 24 months. You may take issue with his policies \u2014 which are more restrictive than many Germans would like \u2014 but at least they are clear.\n\nMs. Merkel has lost her message over too many issues. There is no reason to believe this is going to change in a shaky coalition with the Social Democrats, unless the chancellor is planning a surprise. After all, she has indicated that this is her last spin on the Berlin merry-go-round. And nobody knows yet how she\u2019ll behave, freed of the pressure to win \u2014 or lose \u2014 another election.

Several have pleaded guilty and forfeited their franchises, and have been ordered to pay millions of dollars in back wages owed to the workers.\n\n\u201cThis definitely sends a message to employers,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, the spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors more limits on immigration and stricter enforcement.\n\nAccording to ICE, federal agents served inspection notices to 7-Eleven franchises in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington State and Washington, D.C.\n\nEmployees at two 7-Eleven stores on Staten Island said that immigration agents visited the stores on Wednesday.

Agents dropped in on 7-Eleven stores in seven cities in southeast Florida, including Miami Beach, according to Nestor Yglesias, an ICE spokesman; he, too, declined to identify specific stores.\n\nUnder President George W. Bush, ICE grabbed headlines by rounding up unauthorized workers at meatpacking plants, fruit suppliers, carwashes and residences. In a shift, the agency under President Barack Obama focused on catching border crossers, deporting convicted criminals and pursuing employers on paper, by inspecting the I-9 forms that employers are required to fill out and keep to verify their workers\u2019 eligibility.\n\nBy targeting 7-Eleven franchisees and their workers on Wednesday, ICE under Mr. Trump appeared to be melding the approaches of his two predecessors: Go after employers while also detaining employees whom agents encountered without work authorization.\n\nOne of the biggest workplace immigration raids, in May 2008, resulted in the detention of nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, at an Iowa meatpacking plant. Sholom Rubashkin, the chief executive of the Agriprocessors plant, which was then the largest kosher meatpacking operation in the country, was eventually convicted of bank fraud in federal court.\n\nPresident Trump commuted Mr. Rubashkin\u2019s 27-year prison sentence last month, after years of lobbying by a number of prominent lawyers and politicians who considered his term unduly harsh, and perhaps even anti-Semitic.", "title": "Immigration Agents Target 7-Eleven Stores in Push to Punish Employers", "authors": ["Patricia Mazzei"]}

It remains to be seen whether Congress will legalize these so-called Dreamers, and what concessions will be made in return. But this much is certain: Any deal will include appropriations for enhanced border enforcement.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. The last major immigration reform bill, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed by President Ronald Reagan, legalized nearly three million undocumented immigrants in exchange for increased enforcement along the United States-Mexico border. (It also legislated sanctions against employers who knowingly hired undocumented workers.) The law was more than just a compromise between pro-immigrant liberals and pro-enforcement conservatives. It embodied the idea that we could \u201cwipe the slate clean\u201d by legalizing the undocumented already here and preventing future unauthorized entries.\n\nThis idea, which continues to shape the national debate about immigration, is based on the false premise that the nation\u2019s borders can be made impregnable. In truth, undocumented migration is not an aberration of \u201cnormal\u201d immigration. It is the inevitable result of any general policy of immigration restriction. Restriction creates two streams of immigration, lawful and unlawful. It is a conceit of the sovereign power to think that it can have only legal immigration.\n\nThe history of immigration in the United States demonstrates this. The Chinese exclusion laws of the late 19th century led to unlawful entry by so-called paper sons (those born in China who claimed they were sons of United States citizens) and spawned an immigration bureaucracy based on extreme vetting, detention and deportations, all tactics that were largely unsuccessful.", "title": "Opinion | Immigration\u2019s Border-Enforcement Myth", "authors": []}

O\u2019Brien, referring to the identification of a perpetrator by DNA when there are no other apparent clues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. O\u2019Brien, an expert on DNA fingerprinting and chief scientific officer of the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics at St. Petersburg State University in Russia, is co-author of a new paper, published on Monday in Current Biology, describing the anti-poaching effort.\n\nA similar attempt to use DNA to convict poachers is led by Sam Wasser, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington. His group\u2019s focus is African elephants.\n\nOver a period of 15 years, he and his colleagues have collected and analyzed DNA from dung to create a map of the ranges of various elephant groups based on their genetic differences. It helps show where ivory seized from poachers originated.\n\nThe project has not linked specific carcasses to specific tusks recovered from traffickers. But the analysis has provided valuable clues about the regions in which poachers are operating.\n\n\u201cTo our surprise, the ivory was consistently coming from two areas,\u201d Dr. Wasser said. Tusks from savanna elephants were initially coming from southeastern Tanzania and northern Mozambique, the data showed, but the illegal trade then shifted northward to southern Kenya.\n\nTusks from forest elephants originated in a small triangular area in northeast Gabon, northwest Republic of the Congo, and southeastern Cameroon.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Rhino horns may bring $60,000 or more per kilogram. A horn generally weighs a few kilograms, but a few have been as heavy as 10 kilograms, or about 22 pounds.\n\n\u201cPound for pound, a rhino horn is worth more than heroin or gold or platinum,\u201d Mr. Allan said. And prosecutions are so rare that the risks for the traffickers are \u201cvery low.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe poacher sells horns to a trafficker, who disguises them and ships them to destination countries, mainly Vietnam and China. Some horns are carved into jewelry while still in South Africa, which can make it extremely difficult to trace them.\n\nMost horns are ground and used as medicine in Asia, believed to cure cancer, impotence \u2014 or, Mr. Allan said, \u201cyou name it.\u201d More recently, people in Asia have begun wearing beads or bangles made from rhino horns thought to have curative powers and to be status symbols. Some horns are made into ceremonial cups.\n\nPhoto\n\nElephant tusks currently sell for $1,000 a kilogram, Dr. Wasser said. Unlike rhino horns, which are shipped in relatively small volumes, traffickers typically collect and ship at least half a ton of ivory, or 500 kilograms, in a container.\n\nSome seizures have uncovered as much as seven tons of ivory in a single shipment, Dr. Wasser said. Ivory is primarily bought by collectors or as an investment.\n\nDr. Wasser\u2019s primary target is traffickers, not poachers. Even when poachers are caught and convicted, he said, \u201cthere are 10 more waiting in line to replace them.\u201d\n\nBut traffickers form the basis of the business that makes poaching profitable. \u201cThe analogy is, are you after a serial killer or a one-time murderer?\u201d he asked.\n\nTo catch a serial killer, Dr. Wasser added, authorities require \u201cintelligence-based forensics to prevent future crimes.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper also hopes to disrupt the criminal networks shipping contraband \u2014 in this case, rhino horns \u2014 to destination countries. So far, the rhino database has been used to convict hunters and traffickers in South Africa, Namibia, Kenya and Swaziland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the group has not disrupted the criminal conglomerates at the top of the chain, she said.\n\nThe rhinoceros project began in 2010, when poaching was skyrocketing. Thirteen were poached in South Africa in 2007; more than 1,000 are now killed each year.\n\nIn 120 criminal cases completed or still pending, Rhodis has linked DNA on horns, equipment or clothing to particular carcasses, Dr. Harper said. But it can take years for a case to move through the courts and end in a conviction.\n\nThe first successful such conviction involved a Vietnamese smuggler who was caught with seven horns at O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg in 2010. Two were matched to carcasses, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nBut the case involving Mr. Mukwena was one of the first to involve a well-known smuggler. He was arrested on Jan. 16, 2012, after a police officer spotted him walking across a field carrying a black bag.\n\nWhen the officer confronted him, Mr. Mukwena dropped the bag and ran. It contained three rhinoceros horns, two from a cow and one from her calf.\n\nApprehended, Mr. Mukwena admitted to killing the cow but said an accomplice had killed the calf because it was bothering him.", "title": "In Africa, Geneticists Are Hunting Poachers", "authors": ["Gina Kolata"]}

And White House aides and reporters alike say that political reality is being refracted by the media in an unprecedented way.\n\nSome reporters, in unguarded moments, say that they fear for journalists\u2019 safety. Margaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, was moved to tears in an interview as she recounted the death threats that now routinely land in her colleagues\u2019 emails.\n\nOther journalists \u2014 ironic, cynical or simply enterprising, depending on your point of view \u2014 have embraced the moment as the wildest ride of their lives, and a lucrative one, too: The number of Washington reporters with cable television contracts, some with salaries verging on six figures, has surged.\n\nIt is a boom time for investigative reporting \u2014 witness the revelations unearthed by The New York Times, Politico, The Washington Post and others \u2014 and also for rank incrementalism. A story\u2019s \u201cbuzz,\u201d variously defined by the number of retweets, Facebook likes or panicked text messages from White House aides that it generates, is at a premium, fueling news outlets that condense political reporting from 1,000-word stories into stand-alone nuggets designed to set Twitter aflame.\n\nTrust in the press has eroded thanks, in part, to Mr. Trump and his allies, the ubiquitous phrase \u201cfake news\u201d osmosing its way into the American psyche. Yet newspaper subscriptions and television news ratings, once in free fall, have perked back up.\n\n\u201cWhen he says you\u2019ll miss me when I\u2019m gone, and your ratings will go through the floor, he\u2019s absolutely correct,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, mischievously, of Mr. Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s McLuhan talking through Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Bannon played a not-minor role in creating the current media atmosphere: At Breitbart News, where he was executive chairman until his abrupt exit this month, he whipped up anger against CNN and other major news organizations; upon entering the White House, he instructed the news media to \u201ckeep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWearing four visible layers of shirts (including a zip-up fleece from West Point, which one of his daughters attended), Mr. Bannon declined to speak on the record about his own role in making the fraught new media environment. But there were signs that, like Mr. Trump, he is aware he has benefited from the same news media that he likes to denigrate.\n\nPhoto\n\nA copy of \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d a chronicle of Mr. Bannon\u2019s rise to prominence by the Bloomberg Businessweek journalist Joshua Green, sat on the mantel above the fireplace. The book is being adapted into a television series by the powerful Hollywood producer Jason Blum, who recently flew to Washington to meet with Mr. Bannon at his home.\n\nA year ago, the worries of Washington journalists were manifold: eviction from the West Wing, the end of regular pool reports and briefings, a Breitbart takeover of White House coverage. None of these anxieties came to fruition; in fact, last week, when Mr. Trump wandered into a small reporters\u2019 briefing with his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, Breitbart\u2019s White House correspondent was one of the journalists grumbling afterward about not being invited.\n\nMr. Trump has forsaken formal news conferences, and his usual forum for sit-down interviews has been Fox News. (Last week, in Davos, the president acquiesced to interviews with CNBC and the British presenter Piers Morgan, who has usually been friendly toward Mr. Trump.) But he has embraced the so-called \u201cpool sprays\u201d \u2014 journalist jargon for a White House photo-op \u2014 to spar with reporters off-the-cuff, sometimes for nearly an hour at a time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To hear Mr. VandeHei tell it, the era of the in-depth newspaper story is over.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t reading that long and, to be honest, they shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Axios buzzword is \u201cilluminate\u201d \u2014 tell readers exactly what they need to know, and nothing more. Mr. Swan, a newcomer to Washington who regularly breaks news, does not attend White House briefings, where fresh information can be scarce.\n\nHis avoidance of the ritual is likely to cheer liberal critics who say the Washington press has been too meek and rigid in adjusting to the Trump juggernaut. There were groans, in November, after a briefing during which the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked White House reporters to preface their questions with a list of what they were thankful for \u2014 a schoolyard exercise that some journalists played along with.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. Talev, a Bloomberg News correspondent and the president of the Correspondents\u2019 Association, said that the briefing remains an opportunity to force the administration to speak on the record \u2014 a crucial forum in an era when truth is blurred. \u201cWe think briefings serve people; we think open dialogue serves people,\u201d she said in an interview at Peet\u2019s Coffee, a block from her West Wing desk.\n\nMs. Talev said that her father escaped Communist Bulgaria in the 1960s, where dissent was squashed and criticizing government officials was forbidden. Her work, she said, feels personal these days. Under her watch, the Correspondents\u2019 Association has created a new committee on reporters\u2019 security, to assist members who receive threats, an increasingly common occurrence.\n\nApril D. Ryan, the White House reporter for American Urban Radio Networks and one of the few black correspondents in the briefing room, has described receiving menacing and racist messages; she was subsequently derided as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d by a high-ranking official in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nLast week, a man in Michigan was arrested on suspicion of threatening CNN\u2019s Atlanta headquarters, the kind of real-world effect that reporters here worry may be the inevitable result of a president who once called the press \u201ca great danger to our country.\u201d\n\nWork in the capital, however, goes on. Beneath the White House briefing room, where about two dozen journalists occupy a warren of cramped offices and cubicles, the mood is like that of any other workplace, as it was under past administrations.\n\nBut subtle subversions do exist. For months, a New Yorker cartoon has been tacked to the wall in a prominent place by the stairs.

Mr. de Le\u00f3n introduced the so-called sanctuary state legislation \u2014 the California Values Act \u2014 that restricts state authorities from cooperating with federal immigration agents, and places limits on agents entering schools, churches, hospitals or courthouses to detain undocumented immigrants. The law went into effect Jan. 1, provoking a prankster \u2014 presumably a Trump supporter \u2014 to put up those highway signs, and setting off a war of words between California and the administration.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nThe state should \u201chold on tight,\u201d said Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in an interview on Fox News last week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the politicians in California don\u2019t want to protect their communities, then ICE will.\u201d\n\nMr. Homan went on to assail politicians who support the sanctuary policy, suggesting they should be arrested.\n\nDarrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento, California\u2019s capital, reacted angrily on Wednesday, saying on Twitter that \u201cthey certainly know where to find me.\u201d\n\nAlso this week, Mr. de Le\u00f3n introduced legislation to limit the impact of the new tax bill on Californians by essentially allowing residents to pay their state taxes in the form of a charitable contribution, which could then be deducted when filing federal income tax.\n\nMr. de Le\u00f3n also said he was working with Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under President Barack Obama, to push back against attempts to enforce federal marijuana law, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he would allow federal prosecutors to do.\n\n\u201cWhether Jeff Sessions likes cannabis is not the question,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said. \u201cThe people of California voted overwhelmingly to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump is the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to not take a trip to California in his first calendar year in office, not even to visit his golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles, or a mansion he owns in Beverly Hills, or to tour the vast damage left in the wake of a series of wildfires. By contrast, he has made multiple trips to other states hit by natural disasters, including Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n\nIn California, every state leader is a Democrat, including the governor and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly. Of the state\u2019s 53 members in Congress, only 14 are Republicans, and analysts believe several of them are in jeopardy of losing their seats to Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections because of opposition in California to Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, not every Californian is lining up to join the opposition. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House majority leader, has stood firm with the president, was a strong supporter of the tax bill, and has said he believes there is still an opportunity for Democrats and the administration to come together, particularly on immigration. In an interview with Fox News on Friday, he said, \u201cI think there is a plan for securing the border, for dealing with chain migration.\u201d He added, \u201cI think there is a common ground that both sides can get to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut California\u2019s diversity \u2014 40 percent Latino, and with an estimated 2.3 million undocumented workers, according to a Pew Research Center survey \u2014 is regarded by many people here as a powerful counternarrative to the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration policies and the ugly racial incidents and outbursts of white supremacy that have surfaced during his presidency in places like Charlottesville, Va.\n\nBeyond demographics and politics, charting its own course is part of the identity of California. \u201cWe are the frontier,\u201d said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. \u201cBeyond us, there\u2019s nothing but ocean.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is not the only liberal state standing up to the Trump administration.

The other, Balloon Adventures Dubai, co-founded by the Hungarian ballooning expert Peter Kollar, has been flying tourists over Dubai since 2005.\n\nThe first chicks designated for the project were hatched in May 2016 at Sheikh Butti\u2019s breeding center in Scotland, and then taken by Land Cruiser for training in Umbria, Italy, where Mr. Kollar runs a ballooning company during the summer. \u201cWe had no idea how they would react to the basket and to the burning jets. But we were surprised by how quickly they learned,\u201d Mr. Kollar told me. \u201cThe falcons look at the basket as their nest, and they\u2019re trained to return to it. They were very young, and they didn\u2019t even pay any attention to the fire.\u201d\n\nAt 3:30 on an October morning, a van picked me up at the Dubai Marina and shuttled me down the empty highway for an hour to Sheikh Butti\u2019s sprawling property near the Desert Conservation Reserve. Staffers were still inflating the balloon in the darkness; a thick jet of propane-fed flame filled the huge nylon sack with an eerie orange glow. Mr. Freeman, a stocky and bearded Zimbabwean, stood off to the side, stroking the feathers of his 17-month-old bird, Bomber. Bomber, he said, was a mix of gyrfalcon, a highly prized, nonmigratory species often found north of the Arctic Circle, and the more common saker falcon, a migratory species that crosses the Arabian Peninsula every winter. Arab falconers trapped them here until Dubai banned capturing birds from the wild in the 1970s.

The Palestinian actress Maryam Abu Khaled seems less shocked than downright confused when her new German boyfriend introduces her to his other girlfriend. Beyond navigating the complex sexual mores of their new homeland, the new arrivals struggle to comprehend German bathrooms (How do people clean themselves using only paper? What\u2019s with the ubiquitous toilet shelf?), the freezing weather and the even chillier vibe they often get from the natives.\n\nThe Israeli-born Ms. Ronen often builds her shows around biographical monologues that boldly examine her performers\u2019 emotional scars. Although the members of the Exil Ensemble are from countries torn apart by war and conflict, their stories are tempered with generous doses of humor.

The needs of my body were virtually irrelevant in this process as my diagnosis become a monetized affair where I had to jump through increasingly difficult hoops to \u201cprove\u201d it.\n\nLike most of us, I had been raised to see illness as something temporary: a stopover on the way to recovery or to death, not a place to live. But weeks, months and then years passed, and I did not get better. My doctors, and even some friends and family members, suggested that I could get better if only I tried harder, relaxed more deeply, thought more positively. I became a lightning rod for others\u2019 fears of disability, dependence and fragility. In a political moment where health care is treated as a luxury and hurricane victims are blamed for their own disasters, an ethic of personal responsibility reigns. But sometimes, sick people just stay sick. And there\u2019s no meditation, medication, positive outlook, exercise or smoothie that can fix it.\n\nEventually, I stopped hoping to be well, or even pretending that I lived in that future-heavy land of hope anymore. I stopped trying to \u201covercome\u201d my body and started living a present-tense life in chronic illness. As the pace of my life slowed, I could appreciate sensual pleasures in a new and heightened way: sunlight outside my bedroom window, my dog\u2019s velvety fur, a cool breeze in my garden, richly colored flowers. On days when my brain was too fogged to do anything, I let myself float in and out of a rich, infinitely layered dream world.", "title": "Opinion | In My Chronic Illness, I Found a Deeper Meaning", "authors": []}

Michigan State portrayed Mr. Fitzgerald as reviewing the Nassar cases even as he was hired to defend the university from lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMichigan State led the public to believe that there had been an independent investigation,\u201d Tom Leonard, the Republican speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said on Friday in an interview. \u201cAnd then as we continued to dig into this, we found out it was not an independent investigation. It was an internal investigation to shield them from liability.\u201d\n\nMr. Fitzgerald said on Friday that his team had never been \u201cengaged to produce a public report\u201d on the Nassar case. He suggested that his team\u2019s role had been misinterpreted by some. In fact, the initial contract between Michigan State and Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s firm makes no mention of carrying out an independent investigation or producing any report.\n\n\u201cWe were engaged to provide counsel regarding anticipated litigation and to make sure that any internal reviews did not interfere with the two law enforcement inquiries underway,\u201d he said, referring to criminal investigations that led to Dr. Nassar\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing. \u201cIn the course of gathering facts for the representation, the team of attorneys and investigators has conducted approximately one hundred interviews and reviewed a large number of documents. Our work is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the law firm\u2019s contract, the lawyers were to defend the university in civil lawsuits, facilitate \u201ccooperation\u201d with law enforcement and provide \u201ccounseling on any internal reviews conducted to make sure they are carried out in a manner that will best assist the university\u2019s response.\u201d\n\nThough some women say they told university employees about abuse years ago, Mr. Fitzgerald wrote in December that no one who knew Dr. Nassar believed he could be capable of such behavior. \u201cIt is clear that Nassar fooled everyone around him \u2014 patients, friends, colleagues, and fellow doctors at M.S.U.,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald wrote.\n\nOver the months since they hired Mr. Fitzgerald, 57, and his team of lawyers, Michigan State officials have highlighted his review \u2014 sometimes noting Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s involvement by name \u2014 as a sign of the seriousness of their response. Lou Anna K. Simon, who resigned as president on Wednesday, had portrayed the university\u2019s review as a robust and \u201ctireless effort\u201d that would go on as long as needed. \u201cEven as we examine \u2014 through both criminal investigations and a thorough internal review \u2014 how something so abhorrent happened here and went on for so long, we are taking action,\u201d she said last April.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday, after days of wrenching testimony from more than 150 women who have accused him of molesting them while he was a doctor for Michigan State and the national gymnastics team. The president stepped down hours later.\n\nBy week\u2019s end, Michigan State\u2019s athletic director, Mark Hollis, had also resigned. And two outside agencies \u2014 the federal education department and the Michigan attorney general \u2014 had begun what the university\u2019s critics hoped would be truly independent investigations into its handling of Dr. Nassar.\n\nBill Schuette, the state attorney general, said on Saturday that his office was leading a review that would \u201cput a bright light in every corner of the university.\u201d He promised that the investigation would look \u201cfrom the president\u2019s office down\u201d for answers about what had happened.\n\nMr. Schuette also said he would ask the university\u2019s trustees to have Mr. Fitzgerald \u201cturn over all information he has gathered in the course of his work.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir response to this simple request will speak volumes,\u201d said Mr. Schuette, whose investigation involves a special prosecutor and Michigan\u2019s statewide police agency.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Friday, Joel I. Ferguson, a Michigan State trustee, said he agreed with criticism of Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s role: \u201cWe have the person who was defending us investigating us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a conflict,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Brian Breslin, the chairman of the board of trustees, said that he had \u201cevery confidence\u201d in Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s interviews and information. \u201cHe never developed a report and was never asked to,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Blagojevich, the idiosyncratic former governor of Illinois accused of trying to get something in exchange for an appointment to the United States Senate seat that Barack Obama vacated when he was elected president.\n\nMr. Fitzgerald drew national attention by getting a conviction in a C.I.A. leak case against I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff for then Vice President Dick Cheney. And he had worked on high-profile terrorism cases from New York, including the trials of four defendants in connection with the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n\n\u201cAs far as investigating something, there\u2019s absolutely nobody better,\u201d Sam Adam Jr., one of Mr. Blagojevich\u2019s defense lawyers, said. \u201cAs a criminal defense attorney, I can tell you, he was so good at applying pressure to people.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s role in the Michigan State case is not as prosecutor. Since 2016, Michigan State\u2019s trustees have paid him and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, along with other lawyers, to deal with the Nassar case and to respond to litigation against the school. The true scope and purpose of the lawyers\u2019 internal review have become a matter of fierce debate in recent days, but the trustees last February said the lawyers\u2019 role was to \u201crepresent the university in all aspects of this matter,\u201d adding, \u201cThis representation will include conducting the factual review necessary to address the allegations being made and to assess Nassar\u2019s former work at the university.\u201d\n\nA Michigan State contract with Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s firm included an hourly rate of up to $990. The ABC affiliate in Detroit reported this month that Mr. Fitzgerald\u2019s firm has billed the university nearly $4.1 million.\n\n\u201cThe public relations team at Michigan State gave the impression that he was going to do some sort of dispassionate, independent investigation, and that simply was not true,\u201d said John C. Manly, a lawyer for more than 100 of the women who have sued or made claims against Michigan State.\n\nMr. Manly said that no one from Michigan State or their legal team had sought to interview his clients about what had happened. Mr. Fitzgerald said that his team took \u201caffirmative steps\u201d not to interview victims of the abuse because of ethics rules restricting contact with plaintiffs in civil cases.\n\nAmong the women suing are five who reported feeling uncomfortable or violated to coaches, trainers and counselors in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the women, Larissa Boyce, said she was molested by Dr. Nassar for over two years, beginning at age 16, while training with Michigan State\u2019s youth gymnastics program in 1997 and 1998. Ms. Boyce said she had told the women\u2019s gymnastics coach at the time, Kathie Klages. But instead of helping, the coach explained to Ms. Boyce that she was probably \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d the situation and implied Ms. Boyce would get in trouble if she filed a more formal complaint, according to a lawsuit.\n\nAnother gymnast said she had also told Ms. Klages about abuse by Dr. Nassar around that time. Ms. Klages retired last year amid the scandal. Her lawyer declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nMichigan State\u2019s policies require all employees to promptly report any sexual misconduct that they learn about involving a faculty member, staff member or student. But it is not clear that any of the people who heard the complaints in the late 1990s and early 2000s reported it to university administrators.\n\nIn a court motion two weeks ago seeking to dismiss the case against the university and its employees, including Ms. Klages, Michigan State said supervisors did not even know there were allegations against Dr. Nassar until 2014, when another woman complained to the head of the university\u2019s sports medicine clinic, Jeff Kovan, that Dr. Nassar had massaged her breasts, buttocks and vaginal area.\n\nIn that case, an investigator consulted with three doctors and a certified athletic trainer, who backed Dr. Nassar\u2019s explanation that his actions were medically appropriate to treat the patient\u2019s pain. Each of the four had a connection to Dr. Nassar: One of the doctors studied under him and was a colleague and friend, the investigative report said; one had known him since 1988 and was a classmate and teaching colleague; one had known him since 1995, and he had treated her daughter; and the trainer worked regularly with Dr. Nassar in the training room, an average of four hours a week for 17 years.\n\nThe university found that Mr. Nassar\u2019s actions were appropriate and \u201cnot of a sexual nature.\u201d\n\nDr. Nassar continued to molest patients, according to lawsuits, and even as late as August 2016, just before victims began to go public, some Michigan State employees told gymnasts that Mr. Nassar\u2019s methods were appropriate. The employees also sternly warned gymnasts not to speak to the media, according to allegations in court filings.", "title": "In Nassar Case, Michigan State Wanted Famed Ex-Prosecutor to Both Examine and Defend It", "authors": ["Monica Davey", "Mitch Smith"]}

He is said to have lived a solitary life. And though he wrote many books over his lifetime, including a celebrated work of nonfiction, \u201cSon of the Morning Star,\u201d it\u2019s his sublime first novel that I turn to.\n\nNot much that can be considered \u201cbig\u201d happens in \u201cMrs. Bridge, which has been called a quiet masterpiece, but many small \u201cbig\u201d things do, over 117 numbered, titled, short chapters (\u201cGuest Towels,\u201d \u201cLady Poet,\u201d \u201cAnother Victim of Circumstances\u201d), giving the book a spare, crisp quality that is something of an optical illusion, since it is also fully-lived-in and expansive.\n\nThe novel is an extended character study, and in understanding the desperately conforming Mrs. Bridge, whose first name is India (\u201cIt seemed to her that her parents must have been thinking of someone else when they named her\u201d), Connell shows us her desires, the limitations imposed upon her and, again and again, her own personal limitations. Scattered throughout the novel are various attempts on her part, followed by retreats. When, for instance, Mrs. Bridge wants to see a psychoanalyst, she seeks her husband\u2019s permission while he reads the newspaper: \u201c\u2018Walter,\u2019 she began in a tremulous voice, and went on rapidly, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking it over and I don\u2019t see any way out except through analysis.\u2019\u201d He did not look up. Minutes went by. Finally he muttered, \u201c\u2018Australian wool is firm.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage Credit Patricia Wall/The New York Times\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that the novel is an eerily perceptive character study, though it is. I\u2019m reminded of John Williams\u2019s \u201cStoner,\u201d or Jane Gardam\u2019s \u201cOld Filth.\u201d Like those other remarkable novels, \u201cMrs. Bridge\u201d offers not just a closegrained look at a character, but a wider view of what\u2019s around her. In this case, it captures a person moving \u2014 or not \u2014 through life. And it\u2019s not just that the novel is formally unconventional, about a supremely conventional person, or has much to say about repression, subjugation and emptiness. Its tone \u2014 knowing, droll, plaintive, shuttling rapidly between pain and hilarity \u2014 elevates it to its own kind of specialness. When Mrs. Bridge\u2019s former art instructor appears at the door in bad shape, selling magazines, out of pity she agrees to buy a subscription to The Doberman, despite not owning a dog. \u201cGadbury raised his head and looked at her in grave astonishment.\u201d As do we, repeatedly.\n\nConnell\u2019s 1969 novel \u201cMr. Bridge\u201d focuses on the man behind the newspaper, but I\u2019ve never entirely warmed to it. There was also a handsome 1990 Merchant-Ivory film, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Bridge,\u201d starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. But despite the impressive pedigree the movie didn\u2019t seem to do enough to make readers see \u201cMrs. Bridge\u201d as the particular achievement it really is. It\u2019s faithful to both books, but what\u2019s missing, to me, is that hard-to-describe thing that makes any good book singularly itself. It\u2019s the sensation that you get being inside it. This is more than a matter of character or social acuity or tone; it\u2019s also what might be considered the book\u2019s room temperature.", "title": "In Praise of Evan S. Connell", "authors": []}

And what happened in those countries illustrates the unintended consequences of such a change in an online service that now has a global reach of more than two billion people every month.\n\nIn Slovakia, where right-wing nationalists took nearly 10 percent of Parliament in 2016, publishers said the changes had actually helped promote fake news. With official news organizations forced to spend money to place themselves in the News Feed, it is now up to users to share information.\n\n\u201cPeople usually don\u2019t share boring news with boring facts,\u201d said Filip Struharik, the social media editor of Denn\u00edk N, a Slovakian subscription news site that saw a 30 percent drop in Facebook engagement after the changes. Mr. Struharik, who has been cataloging the effects of Facebook Explore through a monthly tally, has noted a steady rise in engagement on sites that publish fake or sensationalist news.\n\nA bogus news story that spread in December illustrates the problem, Mr. Struharik said. The story claimed that a Muslim man had thanked a good Samaritan for returning his lost wallet, and had warned the Samaritan of a terrorist attack that was planned at a Christmas market.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe fabricated story circulated so widely that the local police issued a statement saying it wasn\u2019t true. But when the police went to issue the warning on Facebook, they found that the message \u2014 unlike the fake news story they meant to combat \u2014 could no longer appear on News Feed because it came from an official account.\n\nFacebook explained its goals for the Explore program in Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bolivia, Guatemala and Serbia in a blog post in October. \u201cThe goal of this test is to understand if people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content,\u201d wrote Adam Mosseri, head of Facebook\u2019s News Feed. \u201cThere is no current plan to roll this out beyond these test countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe company did not respond to a list of questions about the Explore program, but Mr. Mosseri said in a statement on Friday that the company took its role as a \u201cglobal platform for information\u201d seriously.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to the people who read, watch and share news on Facebook, and every test is done with that responsibility in mind,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impact of the changes to the News Feed were also felt in Cambodia. Months into the experiment (Facebook hasn\u2019t said when it will end), Cambodians still don\u2019t know where to find trusted, established news on Facebook, said Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper.\n\nNongovernmental organizations working on issues like education and health care also complained that the changes broke down lines of communication to Cambodians in need.\n\nFacebook has become particularly important in Cambodia. The country\u2019s leader, Hun Sen, has cracked down on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state.

If he didn\u2019t know about it, what do you think the effects are on other parts of the country?\u201d\n\nIn Bolivia, the alterations to the News Feed also occurred in a country where the government and the press have found themselves at odds, with news sites like P\u00e1gina Siete frequently criticizing Mr. Morales, a left-wing populist who has accumulated enormous power since being elected president in 2006.\n\n\u201cWe became the only media to take on the government,\u201d said Rodolfo Huallpa, the web editor of P\u00e1gina Siete. Half of the site\u2019s traffic came from social media, with the lion\u2019s share of that from Facebook, he said. Since Explore was introduced, overall web traffic to the site has dropped 20 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe loss of visitors from Facebook was readily apparent in October, and Mr. Huallpa could communicate with Facebook only through a customer service form letter. He received an automatic reply in return.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter complaints from other outlets, Facebook eventually released a statement on a blog in Spanish explaining the Explore feature and the testing being done in Bolivia and other countries. But Facebook offered no means to contact it, Mr. Huallpa said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk to Zuckerberg, we can\u2019t even talk to a customer service representative,\u201d said Isabel Mercado, the editor of P\u00e1gina Siete, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe Explore experiment has reduced traffic by 30 to 60 percent at the website of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of Cochabamba, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, said Fabiola Chambi, the publication\u2019s web editor.\n\nMs. Chambi, however, fears the main consequence of the Explore function will be deepening polarization in a country already divided by ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see things from your friends and your family, but there needs to be diversity of information,\u201d she said. \u201cThe miscellany is good.\u201d\n\nBolivia has also seen an increase in fake news as the established news sites are tucked behind the Explore function.\n\nDuring nationwide judicial elections in December, one post widely shared on Facebook claimed to be from an election official saying votes would be valid only if an X was marked next to the candidate\u2019s name. Another post that day said government officials had put pens with erasable ink in the voting booths.\n\nVladimir Tirado, a social media expert in Bolivia, said the government might simply begin paying for posts to appear on users\u2019 News Feeds, an option that he said most newsrooms could not afford.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhoever has more money will appear more,\u201d Mr. Tirado said. \u201cIn this sense, the government will certainly win.\u201d\n\nMs. Chambi of Los Tiempos said her newsroom hardly had enough money to pay its journalists to report stories, let alone to distribute them as paid posts on Facebook. The situation has left her uneasy about the role that the tech giant may play in her country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a private company \u2014 they have the right to do as they please, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the first question we asked is \u2018Why Bolivia?\u2019 And we don\u2019t even have the possibility of asking why.

For years now, Asians, Africans and Hispanics have accounted for an expanding proportion of the country\u2019s visas.\n\nBut first came 1924, when the people in charge spoke openly of ranking immigrants of certain origins above others.\n\nThat was the year Congress passed an immigration overhaul that set strict quotas designed to encourage immigrants from Western Europe, block all but a few from Southern and Eastern Europe and bar altogether those from Asia. Overall immigration levels were slashed. The racial theories at play in the legislation, wrote the immigration historian Roger Daniels, would later become the first draft of \u201cthe official ideology of Nazi Germany.\u201d\n\nThere were some familiar refrains in the 1924 immigration debate. Cheap immigrant labor had depressed wages, the restrictionists said. Immigrants had seized jobs from Americans, they said. But it was also heavy on racist rhetoric aimed at preserving what eugenicists and social theorists of the time called the \u201cNordic\u201d race that, in their telling, had originally settled the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Reed of Pennsylvania, wrote in The New York Times on April 27, 1924.\n\nEnglishmen and Germans were welcome; Italians and Jews, not so much. No Asians need apply. (Incidentally, Norway, home to many Nordics, was also subject to a quota, though it was given significantly more slots than countries including Greece, Spain, Turkey and Hungary.)\n\nBy 1965, Congress had repealed the per-country quotas, replacing them with a system that emphasized new immigrants\u2019 family ties to American citizens and residents and, to a lesser degree, the skills they brought. Under the framework established then, people already admitted to the United States can sponsor their relatives overseas through the process Mr. Trump calls \u201cchain migration.\u201d Others now come for jobs, for study, as refugees or through the diversity visa lottery, a program put in place in 1990 and intended for nationalities that are underrepresented in the normal immigration stream.\n\nPhoto\n\nConservative members of Congress, including some Democrats, had fought to include the family-based preferences for relatives of people already living in the country, believing, according to historians, that more white Europeans were likely to come that way.\n\nBut fewer Europeans, and far more Latin Americans and Asians, knocked on the door.\n\nIn the 2016 fiscal year, according to government statistics, there were about 98,000 people from Europe who became lawful permanent residents. More than four times as many, 443,000, came from Asia, and half a million from North, South and Central America and the Caribbean. Africa sent another 111,000. Over all, nearly 1.2 million people obtained green cards that year, compared with about 700,000 in all the years from 1930 to 1939 combined.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe consequences of the 1965 law were unforeseen by all. They were downright alarming to some.\n\nIn an October 2015 radio interview with Stephen K. Bannon, who would become Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who would become attorney general, pointed out that the country\u2019s population was heading toward a historically high proportion of foreign-born Americans. Mr. Sessions, a longtime supporter of tighter controls on immigration, helped craft Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration proposals during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen the numbers reached about this high in 1924, the president and Congress changed the policy, and it slowed down immigration significantly,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Those who came to the United States through the 1924 quotas assimilated into the country and helped create \u201creally the solid middle class of America,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cWe passed a law that went far beyond what anybody realized in 1965, and we\u2019re on a path now to surge far past what the situation was in 1924.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions and Mr. Trump have called repeatedly for ending chain migration and the diversity visa lottery. Haitians, too, have found themselves partially shut out by the Trump administration. In November, homeland security officials announced that they would end a humanitarian program that had given some 59,000 Haitians temporary permission to live and work in the United States since an earthquake shattered their country in 2010.\n\nLiving conditions in Haiti, they said, had improved enough that Haiti could \u201csafely receive\u201d its citizens.", "title": "In Trump\u2019s Immigration Remarks, Echoes of a Century-Old Racial Ranking", "authors": ["Vivian Yee"]}

(At the time, he was in discussions about a move to Panerai but it had not been formalized.)\n\nMany watch companies have links to automobile companies and sports, like Parmigiani Fleurier\u2019s recent Bugatti model or Richard Mille\u2019s McLaren style. But at the boutique, there was the Excalibur Spider Pirelli with the yellow Pirelli colors and a rubber strap made from tires on winning Formula One cars as well as timepieces inspired by Lamborghini\u2019s Aventador S. And more variations are to be introduced at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva this week, including a black rubber and pink gold Aventador S and a black and white titanium Excalibur Spider Pirelli.\n\n\u201cWhen we were thinking about what could open new doors for our brand,\u201d Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said last fall, \u201cwe thought of motor sport with its different network, thinking process and rhythm, but with the same customers, same price level, in a different industry, so we are not competing and can be open-minded.\n\n\u201cI would never launch a car and they would never make a watch,\u201d he added.\n\nSince May 2016, the executive said, he had been spending about a third of his time nurturing such partnerships, including sponsorship of the FFF Racing Team, a GT championship series sponsored by a Chinese tycoon, and developing an eight-piece Excalibur Spider collection with the concept carmakers Italdesign.\n\nThe partnerships also have produced some unusual customer experiences, the kind of events that many luxury brands today consider crucial to turning buyers into fans with long-term brand affinity. A case in point: the Lamborghini racetrack events that Dubuis has organized in moneyed hot spots from Palm Springs, Calif., to Beijing. \u201cWhen you are at the circuit, it\u2019s all about the sport, experience and fun so the customers become your friends and are not in a business relationship,\u201d Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe strategy seems to work; according to the executive, 80 percent of Dubuis\u2019s new clients last year were drawn by the partnerships: \u201cWe are accessing customers who did not think about us before they had the watch on the tray or were buying a complication.\u201d\n\nDuring Mr. Pontrou\u00e9\u2019s tenure he also formalized the brand\u2019s made-to-order collection, Rarities, as a dedicated business unit and developed the Velvet line for women.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe brand\u2019s founder, Roger Dubuis, who died in October, had a significant impact on Mr. Pontrou\u00e9\u2019s approach to watchmaking. \u201cOf course you need to create spectacular platforms, spectacular products, limited editions, crazy materials but what makes you different is the human touch and that\u2019s what I learned from Roger big time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you can\u2019t buy today when you go to a store.\u201d\n\nAnd, Mr. Pontrou\u00e9 said, working with creative people like John Galliano and Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, where he was sales manager in the late 1990s, also taught him how to translate intense creativity into business operations, as \u201cyou can\u2019t drive these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t work with the same rhythm as the sales or business side, same as Roger,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that brands in the luxury world are forgetting \u2014 the capacity of an organization to integrate creativity, giving it the same rhythm as other departments.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It has always been this way: The best teams monopolize possession, which means their opponents have always focused on damage limitation.\n\nAnd sometimes, like Stoke did, they have decided that the gap is simply too wide to bridge, and have left their fate in the hands of fortune. In 2009, when Manchester United was the league\u2019s dominant force, Mick McCarthy, then the manager of Wolves, made 10 changes to his team for a game at Old Trafford. His decision forced the Premier League to alter its rules regarding the fielding of weakened teams.\n\nThe difference lies in both the scale and the ramifications of the problem. The Premier League has long sold itself as the most competitive league in the world, as a division where might does not make right, in which teams never know when they are beaten, where the emphasis is always on attacking.\n\nThat notion is central to the marketing that has made it such a fearsome, global success. The fans, of course, also play a crucial role, providing the sense of occasion that accompanies every game: the full stands, the echoing songs, the electric atmosphere.\n\nBoth, though, are threatened by the strain of thought made manifest by Stoke, Newcastle and Everton: The idea that all anyone outside the league\u2019s Big Six \u2014the Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool \u2014 can hope to do when confronting them is endure.\n\nIn part, simplistic as it sounds, that is because there are six of them.

Potter, an archaeologist at the University of Alaska, discovered the site in 2006.\n\nIt was apparently home to short-lived settlements that appeared and disappeared over thousands of years. Every now and then, people arrived to build tent-like structures, fish for salmon, and hunt for hare and other small game.\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Potter and his colleagues discovered human bones at Upward Sun River. Atop a hearth dating back 11,500 years were the cremated bones of a 3-year-old child. Digging into the hearth itself, archaeologists discovered the remains of two infants.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe two infants were given names: the baby girl is Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay (\u201csunrise girl-child,\u201d in Middle Tanana, the dialect of the local community), and the remains of the other infant, or perhaps a fetus, is Ye\u0142kaanenh T\u2019eede Gaay (\u201cdawn twilight girl-child\u201d).\n\nThe Healy Lake Village Council and the Tanana Chiefs Conference agreed to let scientists search the remains for genetic material. Eventually, they discovered mitochondrial DNA, which is passed only from mother to child, suggesting each had different mothers. Moreover, each infant had a type of mitochondrial DNA found also in living Native Americans.\n\nThat finding prompted Dr. Potter and his colleagues to begin a more ambitious search. They began collaborating with Dr. Willerslev, whose team of geneticists has built an impressive record of recovering DNA from ancient Native American bones.\n\nAmong them are the 12,700-year-old Anzick Child, the oldest genome ever found in the Americas, and the Kennewick Man, an 8,500-year-old skeleton discovered in a riverbank in Washington State. Questions over his lineage provoked a decade-long legal dispute between scientists, Native American tribes and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLiving Native Americans descend from two major ancestral groups. The northern branch includes a number of communities in Canada, such as the Athabascans, along with some tribes in the United States like the Navajo and Apache.\n\nThe southern branch includes the other tribes in the United States, as well as all indigenous people in Central America and South America. Both the Anzick Child and Kennewick Man belonged to the southern branch, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues have found.\n\nSo he was eager to see how the people of Upward Sun River might be related. But the remains found there represented a huge scientific challenge.\n\nThe search for DNA in the cremated bones ended in failure, and Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues managed to retrieve only fragments from the remains of Ye\u0142kaanenh T\u2019eede Gaay, the youngest of the infants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Eventually, they managed to put together an accurate reconstruction of her entire genome. To analyze it, Dr. Willerslev and Dr. Potter collaborated with a number of geneticists and anthropologists.\n\nXach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay, they discovered, was more closely related to living Native Americans than to any other living people or to DNA extracted from other extinct lineages. But she belonged to neither the northern or southern branch of Native Americans.\n\nInstead, Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay was part of a previously unknown population that diverged genetically from the ancestors of Native Americans about 20,000 years ago, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues concluded. They now call these people Ancient Beringians.\n\nBeringia refers to Alaska and the eastern tip of Siberia, and to the land bridge that joined them during the last ice age. Appearing and disappearing over the eons, it has long been suspected as the route that humans took from Asia to the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere has been little archaeological evidence, however, perhaps because early coastal settlements were submerged by rising seas. Thanks to her unique position in the Native American family tree, Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay has given scientists a clear idea how this enormous step in human history may have happened.\n\nHer ancestors \u2014 and those of all Native Americans \u2014 started out in Asia and share a distant ancestry with Chinese people. In the new study, the scientists estimate those two lineages split about 36,000 years ago.\n\nThe population that would give rise to Native Americans originated somewhere in northeast Siberia, Dr. Willerslev believes. Archaeological evidence suggests they may have hunted for woolly rhino and other big game that ranged over the grasslands.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t such a bad place as we kind of imagine it or as we see it today,\u201d he said. In fact, Siberia appears to have attracted a lot of genetically distinct peoples, and they interbred widely until about 25,000 years ago, the researchers determined.\n\nAncient Beringians DNA recovered from an infant who died 11,500 years ago has revealed a previously unknown population of early Native Americans. The Ancient Beringians are thought to have split off from the ancestors of all living Native Americans about 20,000 years ago, and to have remained in Beringia.

About 20,000 years ago, the new analysis finds, these people began dividing into genetically distinct groups.\n\nFirst to split off were the Ancient Beringians, the people from whom Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay descended. About 4,000 years later, the scientists estimate, the northern and southern branches of the Native American tree split.\n\nAccording to Ripan Malhi, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois and a co-author of the new study, these genetic results support a theory of human migration called the Beringian Standstill model.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBased on previous genetic studies, Dr. Malhi has argued that the ancestors of Native Americans did not rush across Beringia and disperse across the Americas. Instead, they lingered there for thousands of years, their genes acquiring increasingly distinctive variations.\n\nBut while the new study concludes early Native Americans were isolated for thousands of years, as Dr. Malhi had predicted, it doesn\u2019t pinpoint where.\n\n\u201cThe genetics aren\u2019t giving us locations, with the exception of a few anchor points,\u201d said Dr. Potter.\n\nIndeed, while the co-authors of the new study agree on the genetic findings, they disagree on the events that led to them.\n\nMore Reporting on Archaeology\n\n\u201cMost likely, people were in Alaska by 20,000 years ago, at least,\u201d said Dr. Willerslev. He speculated that the northern and southern branches split afterward, about 15,700 years ago as the ancestors of Native Americans expanded out of Alaska, settling on land exposed by retreating glaciers.\n\nDr. Potter, however, argues that the lineage that led to Native Americans started splitting into three main branches while still in Siberia, long before reaching Alaska.\n\nPointing to the lack of archaeological sites in Beringia from 20,000 years ago, he believes it was too difficult for people to move there from Asia at that time. \u201cThat split took place in Asia somewhere \u2014 somewhere not in America,\u201d Dr. Potter said.\n\nIf he is right, the mysterious earliest settlers of this hemisphere didn\u2019t arrive in a single migration. Instead, the Ancient Beringians and the ancestors of the tribes we know today took separate journeys. \u201cEven if there was a single founding population, there were two migrations,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut these scenarios all depend on timing estimated from changes in DNA, which \u201ccan be very sensitive to errors in the data,\u201d Dr. Reich cautioned. More tests are required to be confident that the Ancient Beringians actually split from other Native Americans 20,000 years ago, he said.\n\nAnd while the new study reveals the existence of the Ancient Beringians, it doesn\u2019t tell scientists much about their ultimate fate.\n\nBut knives and other tools found at the Upward Sun River site belong to a tradition, called the Denali Complex, that endured until at least 7,000 years ago. The people who made those tools elsewhere in central Alaska may have been Ancient Beringians.\n\nIf so, they survived for nearly 13,000 years after splitting from the ancestors of other Native Americans. \u201cThe archaeology fits with them lasting for quite long,\u201d said Dr. Potter.\n\nThe Native Americans who today live around the Upward Sun River site belong to the northern branch of the genetic family. The new study indicates that their ancestors returned north at some point to Alaska, perhaps replacing or absorbing the Ancient Beringians.\n\nIf the latter, and if geneticists are able to sequence more DNA from northern branch tribes, then they may stumble across living proof of an ancient North American people that no one knew existed.\n\n\u201cMy answer to the question, \u2018What happened to the Ancient Beringians?\u2019 is: \u2018We don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Potter. \u201cAnd I like that answer.\u201d", "title": "In the Bones of a Buried Child, Signs of a Massive Human Migration to the Americas", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

Paper, $16.\n\nThe first Chinese recipient of the Franz Kafka Prize and a frequent target of government censorship, the novelist Yan Lianke creates imaginary wounds in real blood. Yan was born in Henan province in 1958, and his childhood coincided with the worst years of the Great Leap Forward, when China\u2019s rush toward modernity thrust millions into biblical-level famine and privation. (His mother, Yan later recalled, was forced to teach him the most edible forms of bark and clay.) As his translator, Carlos Rojas, explains in his introduction, these experiences profoundly marked Yan\u2019s sensibility. Yan has called his style \u201cmythorealism.\u201d His books read like the brutal folklore history couldn\u2019t bear to remember, and his characters feel stranded, forgotten by time.\n\n\u201cThe Years, Months, Days,\u201d the first of the two novellas collected in this volume, begins with an arresting line: \u201cIn the year of the great drought, time was baked to ash.\u201d Set after a mass migration, the story has three major characters: a 72-year-old man known as the Elder, a sun-blinded dog and a cornstalk. The minimal staging recalls a Beckett play. Like Beckett\u2019s most memorable characters, the Elder is drawn from a long tradition of absurdist sages, barely lucid but often wise. He talks to his dog, weighs sunlight on a scale and waters the cornstalk with his own urine.\n\nThe Elder\u2019s world is nauseatingly vivid, reminiscent of the too-sharp smells and sounds associated with a migraine. When he licks the powder from a flour jug, \u201cthe pure white taste of wheat\u201d blossoms in his mouth. When the sun is at its height, he hears his hair burning. Desolation has rarely seemed so sensual, so insistently alive. In chronicling with extraordinary sensitivity the suffering of an ordinary man, Yan forces us to pay attention.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second novella, \u201cMarrow,\u201d revolves around the efforts of Fourth Wife You, the widowed parent of four epileptic and mentally compromised children, to marry off her third daughter to a healthy man \u2014 what they enviously call \u201ca wholer.\u201d Her children are what used to be called village idiots. (And the village is, in fact, named after them: Four Idiots Village.)

Fourth Wife You argues with her husband\u2019s ghost, exposes herself in exchange for help cultivating her field and tries to keep her son from sleeping with his sister. Everyone is out for himself. \u201cGood soil in this tomb,\u201d Fourth Wife You remarks, disinterring her husband.\n\nYan\u2019s world is earthy, male and often very juvenile: snot, urine, phlegm and voluminous breasts almost qualify as secondary characters. It\u2019s also funny, although Rojas\u2019s otherwise smooth translation mishandles Yan\u2019s curses. (\u201cThat ass caressed her breasts!\u201d conjures a mental image more surreal than even Yan would intend.)

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "This initial phase takes one to four days. \u201cThe more you inhale, the shorter the incubation period,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. \u201cIn the beginning, you don\u2019t feel sick. You don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nAs the virus colonizes your respiratory tract, your body starts to figure out something is amiss and rallies its immunologic troops in an inflammatory response, releasing proteins called interferons \u2014 because they interfere with alien invaders. Interferons flood your bloodstream and set up camp in your mucus, prompting more proteins called cytokines to join the battle. These protein soldiers circulate throughout your body, ready to rumble.\n\n\u201cParadoxically, our own soldiers created for the fight are what cause us to have symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Schaffner.\n\n\u201cWar creates damage and so you get fever and a headache and muscular aches and pains,\u201d which you experience as the abrupt and intense opening salvos of the flu. These early symptoms are usually what distinguishes the flu from just a normal cold.\n\nThe achiness and fever also signal that you need to start drinking a lot of fluids. The battle royal being waged inside you will dehydrate you more than you think. You may notice that your urine will get darker and you\u2019ll have to go less often. Experts say to make sure you drink a cup or so of water or other liquid every hour, avoiding alcoholic and caffeinated beverages.\n\nDrinking fluids will diminish your headache and also bolster your immune response because your protein soldiers are conveyed via bodily fluids. Dehydration hampers their movement. It\u2019s one reason people tend to want soup when they\u2019re sick and may crave watery fruits like citrus and melon.\n\nWhile you may feel rotten all over, the real battle is going on in your respiratory tract where the virus is localized. When the war is winding down, you stop feeling achy and feverish but you have residual inflammation in your throat, sinuses and bronchial tubes. All those cells lining your mucous membranes have been damaged and are like weeping sores, Dr. Schaffner said. That\u2019s why your nose is runny and you start to sneeze and cough to clear out the detritus.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I don\u2019t think you should suffer unnecessarily, but you need to weigh the true benefit.\u201d\n\nAlthough you want to rest, lying flat all the time can be problematic because it collapses your lungs so you can\u2019t cough as efficiently, trapping bacteria in your respiratory tract. If the virus destroys enough cells in your bronchial tubes it creates openings for bacteria to get into your lungs, which can lead to pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening complication of the flu.\n\nWhen your lungs are vertical rather than horizontal, \u201cyou\u2019re able to breathe deeply and freely and you\u2019re able to cough out any inadvertent material, even microscopic bacteria, that get down into bronchial tubes,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said.\n\nThe C.D.C. recommends people who are hospitalized or at high risk for complications of the flu, such as older patients, pregnant women and those who are otherwise immunocompromised, take the antiviral drug oseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu, because observational data indicate it might reduce the likelihood of death.\n\nOther researchers, including those at the Cochrane Collaboration, disagree, saying that there\u2019s not enough evidence to support taking oseltamivir or its chemical cousin zanamivir (brand name Relenza). They question the wisdom of spending billions stockpiling them as many countries, including the United States, began doing amid fears of a future flu pandemic in the mid 2000s. Indeed, the World Health Organization last year downgraded oseltamivir from its list of essential medicines. It may or may not help, depending on which study you look at.\n\nFor healthy people who get the flu, most researchers agree the data indicates oseltamivir taken within 48 hours of onset can reduce the duration by about two-thirds of a day. But at around $154 for a course of the medication, that may not be worth it, given that the side effects include nausea and vomiting.\n\n\u201cWe wish we had better drugs that could wipe out flu,\u201d said Angela Campbell, a medical officer with the C.D.C.\u2019s Influenza Division. But she said oseltamivir is \u201cwhat we have right now\u201d and in outpatient situations \u201cit\u2019s really the clinician\u2019s decision with the patient based on a number of factors,\u201d including cost and effectiveness, whether it should be prescribed or not.\n\nThe C.D.C. also still recommends getting this season\u2019s flu shot, despite its questionable prophylactic value, because it might reduce the severity of the flu should you contract it. In previous years, against strains other than H3N2, flu shots have had reported effectiveness of about 40 percent to 60 percent.\n\nBut beyond that, rest, fluids, not staying horizontal all day and perhaps also letting in fresh air and sunlight are the best things you can do for yourself. To prevent friends, family members and colleagues from getting sick, keep to yourself until 48 hours after your fever has subsided and you\u2019re feeling better.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile you may continue to cough for weeks, Dr. Schaffner said you probably aren\u2019t infectious.

They took captives, many of them children plucked from their homes, and sold them at auctions in village plazas.\n\nThe Spanish crown tried to prohibit slavery in its colonies, but traffickers often circumvented the ban by labeling their captives in parish records as criados, or servants. The trade endured even decades after the Mexican-American War, when the United States took control of much of the Southwest in the 1840s.\n\nSeeking to strengthen the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in 1865, Congress passed the Peonage Act of 1867 after learning of propertied New Mexicans owning hundreds and perhaps thousands of Indian slaves, mainly Navajo women and children. But scholars say the measure, which specifically targeted New Mexico, did little for many slaves in the territory.\n\nMany Hispanic families in New Mexico have long known that they had indigenous ancestry, even though some here still call themselves \u201cSpanish\u201d to emphasize their Iberian ties and to differentiate themselves from the state\u2019s 23 federally recognized tribes, as well as from Mexican and other Latin American immigrants.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut genetic testing is offering a glimpse into a more complex story. The DNA of Hispanic people from New Mexico is often in the range of 30 to 40 percent Native American, according to Miguel A. T\u00f3rrez, 42, a research technologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and one of New Mexico\u2019s most prominent genealogists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and other researchers cross-reference DNA tests with baptismal records, marriage certificates, census reports, oral histories, ethnomusicology findings, land titles and other archival documents.\n\nMr. T\u00f3rrez\u2019s own look into his origins shows how these searches can produce unexpected results. He found one ancestor who was probably Ojibwe, from lands around the Great Lakes, roughly a thousand miles away, and another of Greek origin among the early colonizers claiming New Mexico for Spain.\n\n\u201cI have Navajo, Chippewa, Greek and Spanish blood lines,\u201d said Mr. T\u00f3rrez, who calls himself a mestizo, a term referring to mixed ancestry. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m indigenous any more than I can say I\u2019m Greek, but it\u2019s both fascinating and disturbing to see how various cultures came together in New Mexico.\u201d\n\nRevelations about how Indian enslavement was a defining feature of colonial New Mexico can be unsettling for some in the state, where the authorities have often tried to perpetuate a narrative of relatively peaceful coexistence between Hispanics, Indians and Anglos, as non-Hispanic whites are generally called here.\n\nPointing to their history, some descendants of Gen\u00edzaros are coming together to argue that they deserve the same recognition as Native tribes in the United States. One such group in Colorado, the 200-member Gen\u00edzaro Affiliated Nations, organizes annual dances to commemorate their heritage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

In an important distinction with African slavery in parts of the Americas, Gen\u00edzaros could sometimes attain economic independence and even assimilate into the dominant Hispanic classes, taking the surnames of their masters and embracing Roman Catholicism.\n\nGen\u00edzaros and their offspring sometimes escaped or served out their terms of service, then banded together to forge buffer settlements against Comanche raids. Offering insight into how Indian captives sought to escape their debased status, linguists trace the origins of the word Gen\u00edzaro to the Ottoman Empire\u2019s janissaries, the special soldier class of Christians from the Balkans who converted to Islam, and were sometimes referred to as slaves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMois\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1les, a Gen\u00edzaro professor of architecture at the University of New Mexico, has identified an array of Gen\u00edzaro outposts that endure in the state, including the villages Las Trampas and San Miguel del Vado. Some preserve traditions that reflect their Gen\u00edzaro origins, and like other products of colonialism, many are cultural amalgams of customs and motifs from sharply disparate worlds.\n\nEach December in the village of Alcalde, for instance, performers in headdresses stage the Matachines dance, thought by scholars to fuse the theme of Moorish-Christian conflict in medieval Spain with indigenous symbolism evoking the Spanish conquest of the New World.\n\nIn Abiqui\u00fa, settled by Gen\u00edzaros in the 18th century, people don face paint and feathers every November to perform a \u201ccaptive dance\u201d about the village\u2019s Indian origins \u2014 on a day honoring a Catholic saint.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSome Natives say those in Abiqui\u00fa are pretend Indians,\u201d said Mr. T\u00f3rrez, the genealogist. \u201cBut who\u2019s to say that the descendants of Gen\u00edzaros, of people who were once slaves, can\u2019t reclaim their culture?\u201d\n\nEfforts by some Gen\u00edzaro descendants to call themselves Indians instead of Latinos point to a broader debate over how Native Americans are identified, involving often contentious factors like tribal membership, what constitutes indigenous cultural practices and the light skin color of some Hispanics with Native ancestry. Some Native Americans also chafe at the gains some Hispanics here have sought by prioritizing their ancestral ties to European colonizers.\n\nPointing to the breadth of the Southwest\u2019s slave trade, some historians have also documented how Hispanic settlers were captured and enslaved by Native American traffickers, and sometimes went on to embrace the cultures of their Comanche, Pueblo or Navajo masters.\n\nKim TallBear, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta, cautioned against using DNA testing alone to determine indigenous identity. She emphasized that such tests can point generally to Native ancestry somewhere in the Americas while failing to pinpoint specific tribal origins.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a conflation of race and tribe that\u2019s infuriating, really,\u201d said Ms. TallBear, a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribe of South Dakota who writes about tribal belonging and genetic testing. \u201cI don\u2019t think ancestry alone is sufficient to define someone as indigenous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe discovery of indigenous slave ancestry can be anything but straightforward, as Mr. Trujillo, the former postal worker, learned.\n\nFirst, he found his connection to a Gen\u00edzaro man in the village of Abiqui\u00fa. Delving further into 18th century baptismal records, he then found that his ancestor somehow broke away from forced servitude to purchase three slaves of his own.\n\n\u201cI was just blown away to find that I had a slaver and slaves in my family tree,\u201d Mr. Trujillo said. \u201cThat level of complexity is too much for some people, but it\u2019s part of the story of who I am.\u201d", "title": "Indian Slavery Once Thrived in New Mexico.

He drove a Porsche as well as the Volvo. His cut-rate flights, hotels and meals were taken in part as an exemplar to his executives, who were expected to follow suit, to regard employment by Ikea as a life\u2019s commitment \u2014 and to write on both sides of a piece of paper.\n\nIkea was indeed operated through a charitable trust in the Netherlands, and a complex series of holding companies, all controlled by the Kamprad family to avoid any chance that Ikea might be taken public or broken up. It also provided tax shelters and a structure for preserving the company intact after Mr. Kamprad\u2019s death.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe sought to control his work force, too. In 1976, he wrote a manifesto, \u201cThe Testament of a Furniture Dealer,\u201d with biblical-style commandments listing simplicity as a virtue and waste as a sin. Employees were expected to absorb \u201cthe Ikea spirit,\u201d to be humble, clean-cut and courteous, not just knowledgeable about Ikea\u2019s products but enthusiastic about its corporate ideology \u2014 principles to work and live by.\n\nMr. Kamprad was, like his designer wares, a studied Everyman. He cultivated a provincial openness: curious about everything, but a face lost in the crowd. He was bespectacled and balding, with wisps of graying hair plastered down the sides, jowls and a pointed chin. His blue denim shirts and khaki pants might have been a gardener\u2019s, but there was hard individuality in the dark eyes and compressed lips.\n\nWhile he lived mostly in seclusion, he traveled to Ikea stores around the world, sometimes strolling in anonymously and questioning employees as if he were a customer, and customers as if he were a solicitous employee. He spoke at Ikea board meetings and occasionally lectured at universities. He rarely gave interviews, but made no secret of his alcoholism, saying he controlled it by drying out three times a year.\n\nTo millions of Ikea customers and the general public, he was largely unknown beyond the authorized version of his life and Ikea\u2019s success \u2014 his \u201cLeading by Design: The Ikea Story\u201d (1999), written with Bertil Torekull. Its themes had been sounded for decades in Ikea publicity and reiterated in profiles of Mr. Kamprad and the company.\n\nIkea had been achieved, he said, by frugality: building stores on less costly land outside cities; buying materials at a discount; minimizing sales staff to let customers shop without pressure; putting no finishes on unseen furniture surfaces, and packaging items in flat boxes to be carried away by customers for home assembly (instructions provided).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1994, the Stockholm newspaper Expressen uncovered Mr. Kamprad\u2019s name in the archives of Per Engdahl, a Swedish fascist who had recently died. They showed Mr. Kamprad had joined Mr. Engdahl\u2019s fascist movement in 1942, and had attended meetings, raised funds and recruited members. Even after the war\u2019s end in 1945, he remained close to the leader. In a 1950 letter to Mr. Engdahl, Mr. Kamprad said he was proud of his involvement.\n\nMr. Kamprad responded humbly to the disclosures. In a message to his employees, he said his fascist activities were \u201ca part of my life which I bitterly regret,\u201d and \u201cthe most stupid mistake of my life.\u201d He said that he had been influenced by his German grandmother, who fled the Sudetenland before World War II, and that he had been drawn to Mr. Engdahl\u2019s vision of \u201ca non-Communist, socialist Europe.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Swedes, the revelations reawakened disquieting memories of World War II. While Sweden was officially neutral, German troops had traveled across the country from occupied Norway, and an unknown number of Swedes were Nazi sympathizers. After the disclosures, Jewish groups called for a boycott of Ikea, but its business suffered little, if at all, and Mr. Kamprad soon returned to themes of frugality.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m known as a very thrifty person, and the stores are meant for people like me,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1997 when asked about his contributions to the culture of Ikea. \u201cI don\u2019t fly first class on the airplanes, and the stores\u2019 executives don\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nIngvar Feodor Kamprad was born in Pjatteryd, Sweden, on March 30, 1926. He attended local schools and studied business in Goteborg. He founded Ikea in 1943, using money his father gave him for chores to register his mail-order business.\n\nIn 1950, he married Kerstin Wadling. They had a daughter, Annika, and divorced in 1960. In 1963, he married Margaretha Sennert. They had three sons, Peter, Jonas and Mathias. His second wife died in 2011. He is survived by his daughter and sons, The Associated Press reported from Stockholm.\n\nIn 1953, he opened a showroom in Almhult; in 1958, it became the first Ikea store. In the 1960s, Ikeas opened in Stockholm, elsewhere in Sweden, as well as Denmark and Norway. Alarmed by the company\u2019s growing sales, its competitors organized a boycott by Ikea\u2019s suppliers, but it backfired: Mr. Kamprad went to Poland for materials and manufacturing, which cut costs further.\n\nIn the 1970s, Ikeas opened in Switzerland and Canada. In 1985, the first Ikea in the United States opened near Philadelphia. In the 1990s, Ikea became popular across Eastern Europe, and by 2000, there were Ikeas in Russia and China. The company owned the vast majority of its stores, though about 10 percent were franchise operations.\n\nIn 1976, Mr. Kamprad moved to Switzerland. In 1982, he transferred control to the Dutch foundation, and in 2013 he stepped down from the board of Inter Ikea Group, a key company within the business, and named his youngest son, Mathias, as its chairman. His other two sons also held key positions.

Often they say that the plea is the best way to ensure a guilty man remains convicted because effectively prosecuting a new trial may be too difficult for a variety of reasons, including that evidence had been destroyed or simply too much time had passed. The subtext is that the prosecutors may no longer be able prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn the nearly two dozen cases I\u2019ve investigated, seemingly insurmountable holes were blown in prosecution cases by recanting witnesses, newly discovered alibi records, debunked forensics or, most damning of all, DNA results that didn\u2019t match the defendant.\n\nIn the interest of justice, prosecutors should have acknowledged that they couldn\u2019t meet their burden of proof and cleared those inmates. Instead, they offered Alford pleas.\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent conflict of interest at play for prosecutors because the same office that might have wrongfully convicted the defendant in the first place is in charge of deciding the innocence claim. States could overcome this hurdle by setting up independent commissions or conviction integrity units to investigate and decide the outcomes.\n\nAlford pleas are also endorsed by judges, who have to sign off on them. Legal experts told me that if a judge doesn\u2019t accept the deal, he\u2019d be standing in the way of freedom for an innocent man. But some experts have suggested that, at the very least, a judge should directly ask a prosecutor in open court whether he is upholding his duty to the truth by offering an Alford plea.\n\nThe misuse of Alford pleas is not a partisan issue. These deals happen in blue and red states, with liberal district attorneys and conservative ones. In my reporting, there has often been a common denominator: official misconduct.\n\nIn Alabama two years ago, for example, prosecutors were trying to keep Montez Spradley on death row until his lawyers uncovered multiple constitutional violations \u2014 including that the state had not disclosed payment to a key witness. Prosecutors eventually agreed to let Mr. Spradley go, though they insisted on an Alford plea, which ensured there was no further investigation into their conduct.\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about these cases is that the real culprit in the crime is often forgotten. With the Alford plea, the police and prosecutors consider the case closed because the defendant, after all, has entered a guilty plea. In the cases of Alford pleas involving murders, the authorities, whose very job it is to keep a community safe, are effectively shrugging at a killer on the loose.", "title": "Opinion | Innocent but Still Guilty", "authors": []}

Others said criminal prosecutions for not reporting John Doughs would deter ethical hackers who would otherwise come forward, causing even more security breaches.\n\n\u201cAnything that causes organizations to take a step backwards and not welcome contributions from the security community will have a negative impact on all of us,\u201d said Alex Rice, a co-founder of HackerOne, a security company whose business is to work with customers, including Uber, to manage interactions with and payments to hackers.\n\nThe situation is complicated by Uber\u2019s track record for pushing boundaries, which put it under scrutiny last year and helped spur the resignation of Travis Kalanick, its longtime chief executive, in June. Mr. Khosrowshahi has since vowed to change the way the company conducts itself.\n\nThis account of Uber\u2019s hacking and the company\u2019s response was based on more than a dozen interviews with people who dealt with the incident, many of whom declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of their exchanges. Many are current or former members of Uber\u2019s security team, who defended their actions as a prime example of how executives should respond to security problems. The New York Times also obtained more than two dozen internal Uber emails and documents related to the incident.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Sullivan disputed the notion that the 2016 episode was a breach and said Uber had treated it as an authorized vulnerability disclosure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was surprised and disappointed when those who wanted to portray Uber in a negative light quickly suggested this was a cover-up,\u201d he said, adding that he was proud its engineers had been able to fix the issue before it could be abused. He declined to discuss disclosure because of the active state investigations.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said, \u201cWe stand by our decision to very publicly disclose the 2016 data breach \u2014 not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.\n\nUber started its bounty program in March 2016, challenging hackers to find bugs that could specifically lead to the exposure of sensitive user data. The higher risk the bug was, the more Uber would pay. In Uber\u2019s calculus, the payouts were better than learning about a vulnerability only after attackers had abused it.\n\nBy the time Mr. Sullivan got John Doughs email, Uber had paid rewards to hundreds of hackers. Mr. Sullivan forwarded the John Doughs note to his team for vetting and, if all checked out, patching and payment.\n\nUber\u2019s security team used nicknames for hackers, particularly the colorful, anonymous ones who engaged with the company. John Doughs was called \u201cPreacher\u201d for his admonitions that Uber should be better at security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to be finding this vulnerability in such way,\u201d the hacker wrote in an email to Rob Fletcher, Uber\u2019s product security engineering manager. \u201cEspecially coming from a company like Uber.\u201d\n\nOther emails obtained by The Times show Mr. Fletcher treated the incident as a bounty and encouraged Preacher to provide proof of the vulnerability, including sending a few lines of data from the database he had breached.\n\nAccording to the emails obtained by The Times, Uber soon discovered that some of its employees had left certain computer code known as keys on a programming site called Github. Those keys had allowed Preacher to gain access to Uber\u2019s Amazon web servers, where it stored source code as well as 57 million customer and driver accounts, including driver\u2019s license numbers for some 600,000 Uber drivers. It was a major oversight. To fix it, Uber had to inform everyone at the company that it was temporarily shutting down access to Github.\n\nEmails between the hacker and Mr. Fletcher continued. In some, Mr. Fletcher thanked the hacker for helping the company fix the oversight. In two emails, Preacher\u2019s motivations appeared to veer closer toward blackmail. In one, he demanded \u201chigh compensation\u201d for his findings. After Mr. Fletcher said the company\u2019s maximum bounty was $10,000, Preacher said he and his team would only accept \u201csix digits.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Fletcher said he would need to seek authorization for a $100,000 payment, and would need Preacher\u2019s reassurances that he would delete the data he had downloaded. Mr. Fletcher also pushed the hacker to take payment through HackerOne, which requires bounty recipients to disclose their real identities for tax requirements.\n\nMr. Fletcher drew further details about the hacker out through emails, including tidbits about his identity, his internet hosting provider, the location of his computer and proof that he deleted his copy of Uber\u2019s downloaded data by looking at a virtual copy of his system provided by his host.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Uber asked the hacker to discuss his security techniques and offered to introduce him to companies that might be interested in his skills. Preacher declined.\n\nBy then, Uber\u2019s executives had decided what to do. Mr. Kalanick signed off on the $100,000 payment, so long as the hacker signed an agreement to destroy any data exposed in his discovery, according to the emails.\n\nPreacher\u2019s trail of digital bread crumbs eventually led to a 20-year-old whose first name was Brandon and who was living in a Florida trailer park with his family, according to the emails. In one email, Uber offered to send someone to meet Brandon at a local coffee shop. Brandon declined to leave his home and suggested that the employee meet him there. It was there that Brandon signed agreements assuring Uber that he had deleted the data he had downloaded.\n\nThe Times was unable to learn Brandon\u2019s full name. An email to the John Doughs account bounced back.\n\nPhoto\n\nUber\u2019s security team was soon celebrating its response to what could have been a major security breach. Mr. Sullivan and his colleagues were praised in year-end performance reviews, including by Mr. Kalanick, according to current and former employees.\n\nWhat is now at issue is whether Uber executives broke the law with the $100,000 payment and should have quickly notified customers or officials of the discovery. The issue is not legally clear cut.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLaws concerning bug bounties are ambiguous. The Justice Department weighed into bug disclosure programs for the first time in July and largely left it to organizations to decide what access they will authorize for hackers and what they can do with the data. In Uber\u2019s case, its bounty guidelines authorized and encouraged hackers to look for vulnerabilities that exposed its most sensitive user data.\n\nBreach disclosure laws also differ state to state. The state laws most relevant to Uber\u2019s case require disclosure if names are exposed in combination with driver\u2019s license numbers in a \u201cbreach of security.\u201d\n\nBrandon received two payments of $50,000 each from Uber on Dec. 8, 2016, according to the emails. Uber continued trading emails with Brandon during 2017, until the conversation dwindled.\n\nLast fall, when two outside law firms for Uber learned about the payment to the hacker, they advised the company that the incident should have been disclosed, according to an Uber employee familiar with the matter. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Clark, the lawyer who directly oversaw the bounty payment, were fired for not seeking outside counsel on the issue of whether to disclose, this person said.\n\nThat prompted a call to Mr. Sullivan while he was preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to two people familiar with the matter. He was fired, effective immediately.", "title": "Inside Uber\u2019s $100,000 Payment to a Hacker, and the Fallout", "authors": ["Nicole Perlroth", "Mike Isaac"]}

It documents the whole of his public career, including the development of classic plays like \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d and \u201cThe Crucible\u201d and his showdown with the House Un-American Activities Committee and advocacy against censorship around the world.\n\nThere is also intensely personal material, including early family letters and drafts of an essay about the death of Marilyn Monroe, Miller\u2019s second wife, begun the day of her funeral and revised over many years but never published. But the richest vein may be the journals, which span more than 70 years, often mixing fragments of works in progress with intimately diaristic reflections.\n\n\u201cArthur wrote about everything in his journals,\u201d said Julia Bolus, Miller\u2019s longtime assistant and director of the Arthur Miller Trust, who is coediting a volume of selections. \u201cThey were the place where all the elements of his life came together.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose journals are closed to researchers until after publication of that volume, by Viking.

But their journey to Texas also unfolded over a nearly 60-year period that tracks the rise of the modern market in writers\u2019 papers, as it evolved from a clubby business governed by gentlemen\u2019s agreements to a highly competitive arena marked by sometimes eye-popping prices.\n\nMiller began his relationship with the Ransom Center in the early 1960s, a moment when the center, flush with oil wealth, was emerging as the field\u2019s most unabashedly aggressive player. Short on cash and facing a big tax bill, he donated 13 boxes of material, including multiple manuscripts and working notebooks for the plays that made his name \u2014 including \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d \u201cAll My Sons\u201d and \u201cThe Crucible\u201d \u2014 in exchange for a tax deduction.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1983, after a fire damaged Miller\u2019s house in Roxbury, Conn., he shipped another 73 boxes to Texas for safekeeping. In a letter held at the Ransom Center, he said he\u2019d like to eventually formalize the transfer either by sale, or by donation should the tax deduction (which had been eliminated in the early 1970s) be restored.\n\n\u201cI am in full agreement with your suggestion that I give them absolute first refusal in whatever decision I make for the disposition of the archive,\u201d he wrote to the Manhattan bookseller Andreas Brown, who was serving as his archival consultant.\n\nIn January 2005, a few weeks before his death at the age of 89, Miller shipped 89 more boxes to the Ransom Center, whose extensive American theater holdings also include the papers of Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman and Stella Adler.\n\n\u201cHe always told me the stuff would go down to Texas, which is the only logical place,\u201d said the British scholar Christopher Bigsby, a longtime friend of Miller\u2019s who was given access to Miller\u2019s archive for his 2009 biography.\n\nMr. Enniss said he contacted the estate in Sept. 2013, shortly after becoming director of the Ransom Center, to discuss formally acquiring the balance of the archive. A few months later, he visited the Miller home, to see the journals and other material there.\n\nIn March 2014, the Ransom Center made what it called \u201ca good faith offer.\u201d But it said the estate\u2019s representative, the Wylie Agency, \u201cnever meaningfully engaged in a negotiation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the summer of 2015, three staff members from Yale\u2019s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library visited the Ransom Center to inspect the Miller collection. Yale then made an offer of $2.7 million for the materials on deposit, plus some 70 boxes still held by the estate.\n\nThe Ransom Center matched the price, which Mr. Enniss called \u201caggressive,\u201d but refused to go higher, citing Miller\u2019s 1983 letter.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On a recent afternoon, inside a locked laboratory at Stanford University Medical Center\u2019s nuclear medicine department in Palo Alto, Calif., a technician held a lead-lined, plastic cylinder containing a syringe of fragile atoms that had traveled around the globe.\n\nOnce the imaging agent is injected into a patient\u2019s body, it emits gamma rays that can be detected by gamma cameras that look like X-ray machines. The radioactive tracer lights up on a computer monitor wherever the heart\u2019s blood vessels are blocked or bones are riddled with potentially cancerous tumors. The imaging agent was first used in medical applications in the 1960s because its short half-life meant that patients were getting less exposure to radioactivity than from other diagnostic tracers.\n\nBut at Stanford\u2019s nuclear medicine department that day, a patient had missed his appointment. This meant the dose \u2014 which cost the medical center an irretrievable $500 \u2014 had decayed and was now useless. The technician threw the syringe in the trash.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe supply chain\u2019s vulnerability, acutely felt during a severe worldwide shortage in 2009 and 2010 when two reactors shut down unexpectedly, has led some doctors to shift to more dependable, but more toxic, imaging agents. \u201cFor cardiac imaging, we had to shift to a more expensive agent and expose patients to more radiation,\u201d said Dr. Andrei Iagaru, chief of the division of nuclear medicine at Stanford Health Care.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the worldwide shortage, the volume of nuclear medicine tests went down, and stayed down. \u201cIt definitely had an impact on the way many practices run their cardiac stress tests,\u201d Dr. Iagaru said.\n\nDepending on Other Countries\n\nAmerican patients consume nearly half of the world\u2019s supply of moly-99. And despite plans to ramp up production in Australia, reactor construction is notoriously tricky. In addition, reactors that are converting for security reasons to low-enriched uranium have lower yields and more waste, according to nuclear scientists.\n\nConcerns about moly-99 shortages heightened in October 2016, when the Canadian government mothballed a reactor in Chalk River, Ontario, that supplied about 40 percent of the American market. The government\u2019s decision to shutter the plant was, in part, due to frustration that Canada had had to spend $70 million in 2009 to repair the facility \u2014 in effect, subsidizing the American health care industry. That is a complaint of European governments as well.\n\nWilliam Magwood, director of the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, said that moly-99 production at Chalk River \u201cwent from being incidental to being the only reason to operate the reactor.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanadians didn\u2019t want to continue to operate a high-cost reactor to sell isotopes to the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nSome European governments have begun charging moly-99 producers higher rates to rent reactor time, and prices are expected to rise sharply when governments strip for-profit companies of subsidies originally meant to support academic research.\n\n\u201cHow much will get passed on to the health care providers?\u201d said Leah Gannon, senior portfolio executive of radiopharmaceutical distribution sourcing for Vizient, a company that negotiates contracts for hospitals. \u201cProbably almost all of it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWith no source of moly-99 anywhere in North America, American nuclear medicine specialists appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine warned in a 2016 report commissioned by Congress of a more than 50-percent likelihood of another severe shortage in the coming years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoly-99 suppliers refute the report\u2019s findings, a position echoed by the Nuclear Energy Agency, which has fostered closer ties between producing nations.

While the Pentium chip underpinned most PCs running Microsoft operating systems in 1994, Intel processors are now also used in all Apple Macintosh systems and more than 95 percent of the chips used by cloud services and data centers run by corporations.

In a statement, Iran\u2019s interior minister said that social networks were \u201ccausing violence and fear.\u201d\n\nIn the past, some Iranians have found ways to get around government restrictions by using tools that evaded Iran\u2019s censorship technology. But economic sanctions imposed on the country have made access to some of those tools more difficult, said Collin Anderson, a cybersecurity researcher who planned to publish a report this week about Iran\u2019s capabilities.\n\nTake, for example, the Google App Engine, a service intended to be used as a platform for developing and hosting web applications. In countries where they are otherwise banned, messaging apps that encrypt conversations often use the Google App Engine to conceal their activity within Google\u2019s traffic.\n\nBut Google believes that it is not allowed to offer its Google App Engine in Iran because of the sanctions. That makes it tough to offer Iranians apps like Signal, which is commonly used in other countries to protect internet communications from surveillance.\n\n\u201cGoogle has chosen to adhere to the strictest letter of the law regarding sanctions in Iran, and by doing so they are blocking Iranians from this service,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Google could be worried that technology would be used by nuclear scientists in a potential violation of sanctions. But \u201cthe reality is that the ban affects everyday Iranians\u2019 ability to use a tool that could keep them safe,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Anderson argued that Google could white list, or unblock, certain applications like Signal. In doing so, Google could allow the app to become widely available in Iran in a matter of hours.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on its policies regarding the use of its technology in Iran.\n\nSanctions have also forced many Iranians to use smartphones and applications that have been jailbroken, a term used when a manufacturer\u2019s restrictions are removed to allow a user to install unauthorized software. But jailbroken phones and apps cannot be updated, leaving their users open to hackers and government monitors that take advantage of bugs in outdated software.", "title": "Iranian Authorities Block Access to Social Media Tools", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "M.B.S. has issues. He\u2019s been impulsive and autocratic in ways that have hurt his country and his credibility: bullying the prime minister of Lebanon to resign; diving into the Yemen war, and contributing to Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis; and buying gazillion-dollar paintings and yachts while declaring war on corruption at home.\n\nBut to his credit, M.B.S. has been in tune with, and even ahead of, Saudi youth when it comes to social reforms (political power-sharing is not on the agenda), taking steps that none of his royal cousins ever dared: pulling the religious police off the streets, permitting Saudi women to drive, curbing the power of the clerics, letting women attend sporting events with men, opening cinemas, inviting Western and Arab pop stars to perform in the kingdom and vowing to restore Saudi Islam to a more \u201cmoderate,\u201d pre-1979 iteration \u2014 all part of a plan called \u201cVision 2030.\u201d\n\nM.B.S. is, in effect, trying to build a Saudi version of China\u2019s \u201cone-country, two systems,\u201d a gulf businessman remarked to me. If you\u2019re religious and want Mecca, it will be there for you. If you\u2019re not religious and want Disney World, M.B.S. is ready to build that now, too. M.B.S. is no longer wedded to just one Saudi Arabia \u2014 and the still dominant tribal culture there means a lot of youth still defer to the monarchy and the military. Where M.B.S. has to watch his way is with the religious establishment, which can still activate the large pool of less-educated and pious rural and small-town Saudis, if they feel social norms are changing too fast or massive youth unemployment isn\u2019t being fixed.\n\nIran\u2019s hard-line leaders, by contrast, have no interest in one country, two systems. And Iran\u2019s more modern society has moved away from monarchy, so youth are not afraid to take to the streets. And the more the ayatollahs rule like a religious monarchy \u2014 plundering their society while wrapping themselves in the cloak of religion \u2014 the more young Iranians resent them.\n\nIran\u2019s more moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, said as much in public remarks on Monday: \u201cOne cannot force one\u2019s lifestyle on the future generations. The problem is that we want two generations after us to live the way we [want] them to.\u201d\n\nTherefore, one of the most interesting questions today, says Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment, \u201cis whose strategic vision is more sustainable and attainable \u2014 M.B.S.\u2019s Vision 2030 or Ali Khamenei\u2019s vision of 1979. M.B.S. is a modern ruler presiding over a predominantly traditional society, and Khamenei is a traditional leader presiding over a more modern society.\u201d\n\nIn Saudi Arabia there\u2019s a move, from the bottom up and from the top down, to get past 1979 and birth a different social future. In Iran, there\u2019s a move from bottom up by many youth to get past 1979, but regime hard-liners want to crush them from the top down.\n\nWe should root for both the Iranian and Saudi youth movements to bury 1979. It would be a gift for Muslims the world over \u2014 and for the world at large, which has spent trillions of dollars countering the furies fueled by that pivotal year.", "title": "Opinion | Iranian and Saudi Youth Try to Bury 1979", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-06 00:00:00", "text": "If there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran\u2019s domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today\u2019s protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don\u2019t speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong.\n\nFor instance, the conventional wisdom inside and outside Iran has long held that the lower and working classes in Iran were clients of the state and the core hard-line constituency. Kevan Harris, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a study of welfare recipients and political affiliation that called this assumption into question. It turns out that loyalty is not so easily bought. Welfare recipients are not more politically predictable than other Iranians. And now it seems that when members of this cohort turn up on Iran\u2019s streets, after years of being told that there is nothing wrong with an economy that can\u2019t keep factory doors open or food on the table, their slogans are more radical than those of the presumptive middle class.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man \u2014 with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary.\n\nEvery decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account \u2014 because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn\u2019t fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive.\n\nA political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It\u2019s the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change.\n\nIranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country\u2019s economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can\u2019t or won\u2019t address the root cause of Iran\u2019s chronic unrest.", "title": "Opinion | Iran\u2019s Protesters Want One Thing: Accountability", "authors": []}

Asked if he would favor a relaxation of the laws, Mr. Varadkar said: \u201cI\u2019ll be campaigning for them to be changed and to be liberalized, yes.\u201d\n\nMr. Varadkar\u2019s announcement came one day after The Irish Times published an opinion poll that suggested a majority of Irish people, 56 percent, favor repealing the constitutional ban and permitting abortion for up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, as recommended by a parliamentary committee. Only 29 percent were opposed to repealing the ban, a stark change from 1983 when nearly 67 percent of voters approved the introduction of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nPro-repeal campaigners had contrasted Mr. Varadkar\u2019s initial reticence with the stance of his chief rival, Micheal Martin, who heads the country\u2019s main opposition party. On January 18, Mr. Martin announced that, despite having previously opposed repealing the ban, he now supported unrestricted access to the procedure in Ireland up to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Martin\u2019s decision, which he said was based on the medical, legal and personal testimony given to last year\u2019s parliamentary committee on abortion, put him at odds with factions of his own conservative Fianna Fail party, which at its most recent annual conference voted overwhelmingly against repealing the ban. Mr. Martin\u2019s directness also put Mr. Varadkar \u2014 whose Fine Gael party, although economically conservative, has a large socially liberal wing \u2014 in an uncomfortable position with elements of his own base.\n\nMr. Varadkar was the fresh face of leadership last year when, at 38, he became Ireland\u2019s youngest prime minister. He is the first Irish prime minister to have a nonwhite parent, and he came out as gay in the run-up to the successful 2015 initiative to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nPreviously, while a junior member of Parliament, Mr. Varadkar had taken a number of socially conservative positions. In 2010, he spoke against legalizing abortion for victims of rape, saying it would lead to abortion on demand. In 2009, he opposed changing the law to allow gay couples to adopt children.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

You know, I think even people who are in favor of abortion in certain circumstances are pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe in life, but I understand that there are circumstances in which pregnancies can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added: \u201cEvery single person I know who says they are pro-choice believes in some sort of restriction. These terms pro-life and pro-choice don\u2019t really comprehend the complexity of this issue, which is a very private and personal one and one I think contains a lot of gray areas.\u201d\n\nIf repealed, the constitutional ban would be replaced by legislation regulating abortion, most likely permitting it under at least some circumstances. Mr. Varadkar\u2019s government says it will disclose its proposed legislation before voters act on the constitutional provision, but it has yet to formally agree on what the measures might be. An all-party parliamentary committee voted in December in favor of permitting unrestricted abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and later in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal abnormality.\n\nMr. Varadkar has yet to say whether he will support the parliamentary committee\u2019s proposal. The proposal, though more restrictive than abortion laws in many Western countries, was more liberal than had been anticipated.\n\nSeveral committee members who had previously described themselves as anti-abortion said they had changed their minds after listening to medical and legal evidence, and personal testimony from women.\n\nMr. Varadkar\u2019s cabinet on Monday will try to agree on the wording of the referendum.\n\nSeveral thousand Irish women travel abroad for abortions each year, the majority to Britain. Figures from the United Kingdom\u2019s health care service for 2015 showed that at least 3,400 Irish women had gone to England and Wales for abortions that year.", "title": "Ireland Prime Minister Says He Will Campaign to Repeal Abortion Ban", "authors": ["Ed O Loughlin"]}
{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Varadkar\u2019s party, the center-right Fine Gael, does not have a majority in Parliament; it depends on five independent lawmakers and a pact with its main rival, the socially more conservative Fianna Fail. A poll published by The Irish Times on Friday showed that a majority of lawmakers in both houses support repealing the constitutional ban. In the lower house, or Dail, 82 lawmakers said they would vote yes, and 40 no, with 36 undeclared. In the upper house, the Senate, 31 said they supported removing the ban, 11 oppose it and 17 are undeclared.\n\nEarly public opinion polls suggest that a majority of Irish voters would favor removing the constitutional ban in a referendum. A poll published in The Sunday Business Post this weekend showed 60 percent support for repeal, though support for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks was weaker, at 51 percent.\n\nIn view of this, and the continuing opposition to abortion within the larger conservative parties, it is not certain that a bill allowing unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks would be approved by Parliament.\n\nUnrestricted abortion has always been illegal in modern Ireland, although terminations were sometimes carried out in hospitals when considered necessary to save the mother\u2019s life. In 1981, however, the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign, a lay group backed by the Roman Catholic Church, began lobbying for a constitutional amendment that would prevent terminations on any grounds.\n\nA 1983 referendum on such an amendment passed with 67 percent of the vote, despite warnings from some constitutional and medical experts that the resulting ban would create difficult legal and medical situations.\n\nOne such affair \u2014 known as \u201cThe X Case\u201d \u2014 emerged in 1992, when the then-attorney general secured a court order to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim, identified only as \u201cX,\u201d from leaving the country to obtain an abortion in England, the most common destination for Irish women seeking terminations. Ireland\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the decision, reinterpreting the constitutional ban as allowing terminations in cases where pregnancy threatened a woman\u2019s life. The teenager had expressed a wish to kill herself rather than carry the baby to term.\n\nAnti-abortion campaigners went on to lobby for two further referendums to exclude a suicide risk as a reason to allow abortion, but \u2014 in a sign of changing attitudes \u2014 were defeated both times.\n\nSuccessive Irish governments, seemingly unwilling to alienate sections of their supporters or to anger the church and the anti-abortion lobby, nonetheless ignored a Supreme Court recommendation after the X Case that laws be passed to explicitly legalize abortions in cases where the mother\u2019s life was at risk.", "title": "Ireland to Hold Abortion Referendum by End of May", "authors": []}

No \u2014 with a big caveat.\n\nIt is not a mistake for substantive reasons: History shows that racism becomes even more dangerous when it\u2019s allowed to go unchecked. And it\u2019s not a mistake for political reasons too: There are a significant number of independents and Republicans, including minorities and suburban college graduates, who are turned off by Trump\u2019s race-baiting.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to distinguish between the current moment and the remainder of 2018. Calling out Trump as a racist is the right thing to do in the days immediately following comments like his vulgar denigration of Haitians and others last week. It should not become the centerpiece of the Democrats\u2019 2018 strategy.\n\nThat centerpiece needs to be a principled populism that causes voters \u2014 white, black, Latino and Asian \u2014 to think about their economic interests. Trump certainly can be a huge part of the strategy. The president is almost always the central issue in a midterm election. The key is how Democrats talk about him.\n\nEmphasizing the ways he\u2019s hurting the middle class and working class has almost no downside. It turns off no substantial group of voters. It can win over swing voters and motivate reliably progressive ones.\n\nRace is different.

Grumblings are heard within the party too, which did relatively poorly in the elections. Recently, members of the Junge Union, the party\u2019s youth organization, directly called for her to step aside.\n\nMs. Merkel may be one of the world\u2019s most admired leaders and an inspiration for a new generation of women politicians, but at home her appeal has been more pragmatic: Her political capital derives from her ability to react to crises rather than on her conceptualizing and shaping of the country\u2019s political agenda. To be blunt, she\u2019s not much of a vision person.\n\nFor a time, that worked. But over Ms. Merkel\u2019s three terms as chancellor, she led so-called grand coalitions with the center-left Social Democrats twice. Such a coalition should be able to use its supermajority to enact major reforms, to get big projects done. And yet very little has come of it.

Instead, he said, MAGA endorses the concept that Americans, by electing Mr. Trump, allowed his obsessions to be given form that qualifies as an artistic statement. The fact that the prototypes were designed and built by six private contractors matters less, he said, than the impression that, upon completion, they constitute an unintended sculpture garden willed into existence by the president and his supporters. \u201cThis is a collective sculpture; people elected this artist,\u201d Mr. B\u00fcchel said.\n\nMr. B\u00fcchel insisted that the petition was not a jab at Mr. Trump\u2019s signature policy-achievement-in-waiting. . Even if the border wall is never built, Mr. B\u00fcchel said, the prototypes \u201cneed to be preserved because they can signify and change meaning through time. They can remind people there was the idea to have this border wall once.\u201d\n\nMr. B\u00fcchel is accustomed to stirring controversy. His installations include a mosque built inside the walls of a former Catholic church, a project that created an uproar at the 2015 Venice Biennale, and he has spent years seeking approval to bury a full-size Boeing 727 in the Mojave Desert near Boron, Calif., for an installation called \u201cTerminal.\u201d But Mr. B\u00fcchel said he was not playing art provocateur with his quest to preserve the prototypes. \u201cI just see that fact, an objective fact, that they\u2019re standing here, now,\u201d he said. \u201cMy political position, that\u2019s not interesting in this context.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. B\u00fcchel invokes the precedent of the ready-made, championed by that pioneer of Dada, Marcel Duchamp, in which the act of choosing an object, however banal \u2014 emphatically, in Mr. Duchamp\u2019s case, a urinal \u2014 recontextualizes it as art. He also points to the prototypes\u2019 aesthetic impact, however unintended, rising up from the desert like a postapocalyptic vision of drive-in movie screens or the monolith in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is sculptural value these things have,\u201d Mr. B\u00fcchel said, citing the precedent of Land Art created by Donald Judd and others in Marfa, a tiny West Texas town, as well as the monumental art of antiquity. When he first saw images of the prototypes, Mr. B\u00fcchel said, \u201cI thought about Stonehenge. It\u2019s so strong.\u201d\n\nMichael Diers, a German art historian, currently a research scholar at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, defended Mr. B\u00fcchel\u2019s vision.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt seems reasonable to imagine that the President has erected a monument, in the very tradition of Land Art, that could serve as compensation for the virulent iconoclasm of the present, when other monuments have to be taken down out of political correctness and their history erased,\u201d said Mr. Diers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the divisive nature of the prototypes undermines their aesthetic merit, argued Tom Eccles, the executive director of the center of curatorial studies at Bard College, who has curated more than 100 exhibitions and outdoor projects for the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum and other institutions.\n\n\u201cHistory, and thus our landscape, is replete with terrible and terrifying structures,\u201d Mr. Eccles said in an email. \u201cSculpture and art should speak to our better selves. Naming the Berlin Wall a Land Art project \u2014 or conceptual art \u2014 doesn\u2019t make it such.

The design guidelines for the prototypes stipulated that the side facing the United States be \u201caesthetically pleasing\u201d but made no provisions for the Mexican side. The $470,000 prototype submitted by Texas Sterling Construction presents a pleasant stone facade to the United States and an unsparing concrete wall bristling with razor wire to Mexico.\n\nMr. B\u00fcchel took in the tableau from his stepladder \u2014 the squalor on the Mexican side, the prototypes bathed in flattering afternoon sunlight \u2014 and added: \u201cWhen you look at it here, and you see everything, it\u2019s quite a strong conceptual impact.

It is one reason, for example, they want to revise the Chinese-history curriculum in Hong Kong schools in order to bring it in line with that on the mainland.\n\nBut doubling down on political brainwashing this way is unlikely to serve their cause. It was an attempt to promote this so-called patriotic education in Hong Kong in 2012 that sparked the student protest movement Scholarism, which later became part of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which in turn helped spawn new political parties that today advocate varying degrees of self-determination.\n\nBeijing\u2019s recent efforts to get the Hong Kong government to punish expressions of disrespect for the Chinese national anthem also seem to be backfiring. In one school commencement ceremony after another, newly minted graduates have flouted the hymn, even at the risk of jeopardizing their job prospects in a market increasingly dominated by firms from the mainland. Scorn for the Chinese Communist Party is extending to symbols of the Chinese state.\n\nYet even as the political schism deepens between Beijing and Hong Kong separatists, the traditional pan-dems seem to be losing their power to mobilize protests. What would once have been hot-button issues now draw only thin crowds into the streets. When throughout the fall, a self-described \u201cconcerned group\u201d backed by the major pan-dem parties called for various marches to oppose a plan to enforce Chinese immigration law at a new train terminal in Hong Kong, only a few hundred people participated.\n\nThis disconnect reveals a rift within the pro-democracy camp. All democrats here essentially hate the authoritarian Chinese government, its bullying and its meddling with Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. But they disagree over the nature of their own Chinese heritage, and Hong Kong\u2019s.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by the University of Hong Kong that asked local residents if they identified as \u201cHong Kongers,\u201d \u201cHong Kongers in China,\u201d \u201cChinese in Hong Kong\u201d or \u201cChinese,\u201d nearly 70 percent of respondents aged 18-29 called themselves \u201cHong Kongers.\u201d Just 0.3 percent called themselves \u201cChinese\u201d \u2014 by far the lowest such figure since the poll was first conducted, in August 1997.

More and more Hong Kongers seem to feel less and less Chinese.\n\nThe sociologist Chan Kin-man, a founder of Occupy Central \u2014 the precursor to the Umbrella Movement \u2014 told an interviewer this summer that if Chinese nationalism ever required him to \u201csuppress the quest for democracy and freedom\u201d for Hong Kong, he would \u201cwithout hesitation commit treason.\u201d By an honest reading of the city\u2019s history, he would be blameless.", "title": "Opinion | Is Hong Kong Really Part of China?", "authors": []}

In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that \u201cwe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Mr. Stutz said.\n\nSalesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. \u201cThis is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon\u2019s top priorities, according to its proposal: \u201cA stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth officials \u201cwere very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,\u201d said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis\u2019s Amazon proposal. \u201cThat made it so much easier for us.\u201d\n\nNeither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon.\n\nIn opening the competition, Amazon also said that \u201ca strong university system is required.\u201d Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it\u2019s the geographic center of \u201ca surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,\u201d said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater).\n\nThese include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation\u2019s No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years.\n\nMany university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, \u201cattracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,\u201d Dr. McCoy said. \u201cOver 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay.\u201d\n\nWith a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it\u2019s home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race.\n\nMr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. \u201cAustin was never a cool place,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn\u2019t quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities.\u201d\n\nLast year Bon App\u00e9tit magazine devoted a feature to the \u201cBrooklynization of Indy\u201d that focused on the city\u2019s explosion of craft breweries, artisanal bakeries and farm-to-table restaurants.\n\nTransportation facilities are also prominent on Amazon\u2019s wish list. The city\u2019s light-filled new international airport has been voted the best in North America for five years running by Airports Council International and the best airport in the United States for four years by readers of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndianapolis\u2019s central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there.\n\nWhile Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon\u2019s Seattle employees value).\n\nOf the 20 finalist cities, Indianapolis has the least traffic congestion and the lowest average home prices, according to the Chamber of Commerce. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t high-end options: A 21,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 1930s-era mansion, currently home to the Indiana University chancellor, is on the market for just under $7 million. (It might be perfect for the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos.)\n\nFor all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge.\n\nUnlike Amazon\u2019s home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana\u2019s governor before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s vice president.\n\nA strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation.\n\nPartly as a result of pressure from Salesforce, other companies and the N.C.A.A., Mr. Pence, when he was governor, amended a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015 that had allowed business owners to discriminate against gays and lesbians on the grounds of religious principle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said.\n\nIndianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn\u2019t count it out.\n\nMaureen Krauss, the chamber\u2019s chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis\u2019s proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight.\n\n\u201cWe finished it two days early,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that\u2019s the kind of proposal we tried to deliver.\u201d\n\nShe and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. \u201cWe hunkered down and started on Phase 2,\u201d Mr. Huber said.", "title": "Is Indianapolis Cool Enough for Amazon?

Clearly, this is not a good situation, but is it better to have the child ripped from yet another home and placed yet again?\n\nOf all the neighbors, we probably know them the least, so why are they asking us? My partner says it\u2019s probably because year-rounders would refuse. We can say no, but I don\u2019t want to make enemies.

That simply can\u2019t be right. You don\u2019t know nearly enough to make that decision. Our child-welfare-and-adoption system is notoriously imperfect, but it is run by trained people who are required to assemble all the relevant information before a decision is made. No doubt Karen and Bob have chosen you because they think you will tell a story that helps their case. But your only obligation is to be truthful. That will mean providing your best judgment about something you don\u2019t say much about, namely whether the child is being well cared for. You might think you shouldn\u2019t agree to provide a reference unless you think it will help your neighbors get what they want. That\u2019s a mistake. You can agree to provide one if it will do what they ought to want, which is to help the authorities make the right decision. That\u2019s what you owe them, and at least as important, that\u2019s what you owe the child.\n\nI am a physician often approached to write letters for people. These letters generally fall into two classes: 1. Asking for work accommodations based on illness, or 2. Requests to be exempted from some requirement, like participating in jury duty. Recently I was asked to provide a letter for an elderly woman with a medical illness that would enable her to apply for citizenship without taking the exam, which she would be unable to pass because of her illness. She has been in the U.S., legally according to her family, for less than 10 years, has never held a job and has never paid taxes. They want her to have citizenship because it will allow her to receive more in benefits. (I am not sure this is true, but I am not a lawyer or even that interested. I have no interest in seeing a person without a valid status be deported either.) My concern is that she is requesting an exemption in order to collect benefits toward which she has contributed absolutely nothing. In a world of scarce resources, this makes me uncomfortable. On one hand, she is one person, whose costs will not be particularly burdensome to the state in which she lives, which is large. On the other hand, she is asking not to play by the rules. However, the illness is real, and I am not being asked to falsify anything; she truly has the illness, and it truly prevents her from taking the exam. However, I\u2019m not 100 percent comfortable doing this for her. Finally, she is not even my patient. She came to see me only to get the letter because only a doctor in my specialty can certify that she has the illness in question. What\u2019s your thinking? Name Withheld\n\nOf all these testimonies about testimony, your case is the most straightforward. Your job in this process is to certify what, in your professional judgment, is true about her medical condition. Your only objection to doing so is that the truth here could entitle her, under the law, to benefits she wouldn\u2019t otherwise get. You think this is wrong because she didn\u2019t pay into the system that\u2019s going to help her. Note, first, that this has nothing to do with her being an immigrant. There are native-born Americans who never pay into the system. But also note the assumptions you\u2019re making about giving and taking. Our social welfare system is, in effect, a system of social insurance. It\u2019s designed so that people get out what they need, not what they put in. There\u2019d certainly be no point in the system if we were allowed to take out only what we put in. We could just stash money away for a rainy day. Once people join our society, we should surely want them to flourish like everyone else. Even if you think I\u2019m wrong about this, though, the right thing to do is to focus on changing the laws, not preventing someone from doing what, at present, she may be lawfully entitled to do.", "title": "Is It O.K. to Surprise Someone With a Negative Reference?", "authors": ["Kwame Anthony Appiah", "The Ethicist"]}

It produced a scandal. The prime minister was forced to respond, of course, to this affair. No doubt, it was a distraction \u2014 and from something important: According to reports, the same night the younger Netanyahu was exposed as an imbecile, the Israeli air force was attacking Syrian military installations, the kind of attack that most likely requires the prime minister\u2019s authorization \u2014 and his attention.\n\nThe possibility of distraction is the most serious argument used by Israelis who say that it will soon be the time for Mr. Netanyahu to leave office. And the source of that distraction pales in comparison with an unruly, crude son: The prime minister is under investigation for corruption.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister of the State of Israel is one of the busiest world leaders,\u201d two scholars recently said in a paper for the Israel Democracy Institute. When he spends time on and preparing for police interrogations, clearly his capacity to give his full attention to the affairs of the state is impaired.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party has itself invoked this argument before, when Ehud Olmert, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, was in legal trouble. \u201cNo place of work \u2014 surely not the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 can afford a manager who spends most of his time consulting with his attorneys,\u201d said Gilad Erdan, then a Knesset member who is now minister of public security in the Netanyahu government.

Despite what some feared, the move didn\u2019t spark widespread unrest in Muslim countries.\n\nWhile the world rejected the new policy \u2014 the United Nations General Assembly voted 128 to 9 to condemn it \u2014 Arab states seemed to tacitly accept it. As The New York Times reported last week, an Egyptian intelligence officer even called influential talk-show hosts urging them to steer their audiences away from anti-Israel outrage.\n\nFor some conservatives in the United States, the apathetic Arab response proves that Trump was right. The Daily Caller gloated about Trump\u2019s refusal to allow \u201cPalestinian threats of violence\u201d to sway the United States. In National Review, Douglas Murray wrote that the \u201cU.S. has stared down the men of violence and \u2014 for the time being at least \u2014 come out from the encounter on top.\u201d\n\nThis argument misses the main reason to oppose the Jerusalem announcement, apart from the continued suffering of the Palestinians, which few in American politics particularly care about. Trump\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t disastrous because it risked causing riots but because, long-term, it endangers whatever thin chance remains of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And the alternative to a two-state solution is one state, a greater Israel that includes the occupied territories. That state can be Jewish or it can be democratic, but it cannot be both.

Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t undergone a mental-health evaluation, at least not one made public. But even if his behavior were diagnosed as an illness, what would that tell us that we don\u2019t already know? Plenty of people with mental disorders or disabilities function at high levels of society. Conversely, if Mr. Trump were found to have no diagnosable illness, he would be no more fit for the office he holds than he is today.\n\nThe problem lies in trying to locate the essence of Mr. Trump\u2019s unfitness in the unknowable reaches of his mind, as opposed to where we can all openly see it and address it in political terms. As the psychiatrist Allen Frances told The Times: \u201cYou can\u2019t say enough about how incompetent and unqualified he is to be leader of the free world. But that does not make him mentally ill.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a number of psychiatrists, politicians and others who should know better have increasingly taken up the Trump-is-crazy line. In \u201cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\u201d released last October, more than two dozen contributors, most mental-health professionals, concluded that Mr. Trump presents a grave and immediate danger to the safety of America and the world. No argument there, but why do we need to hear it from psychiatrists relying on their professional credentials? Dr. Bandy Lee, one of the book\u2019s editors, said the authors are \u201cassessing dangerousness, not making a diagnosis.\u201d Anyone with access to newspapers or Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed can do the same.\n\nThe psychiatrists say they have a duty to warn the public about what they see as a serious threat to the nation. That\u2019s commendable, but they should consider how their comments will be taken by the vast majority of Americans, particularly in a highly politically polarized time. The language of mental health and illness is widely used yet poorly understood, and it comes loaded with unwarranted assumptions and harmful stereotypes. There\u2019s a good reason the profession established an ethical guideline in 1973, known as the Goldwater Rule, that prohibits psychiatrists from offering professional judgment on public figures they have not personally examined.\n\nIn the future, it would be a good idea if presidential candidates voluntarily submitted to a mental-health evaluation, just as they often do a physical one \u2014 and in that case, psychiatrists would have a critical role to play.

And it points to growing concern that two tenets of American democracy \u2014 the concepts of majority rule and protecting the rights of minorities \u2014 are being supplanted by a third doctrine: the winner takes all.\n\nOnly a decade ago, partisan gerrymandering appeared all but a dead legal issue. This week\u2019s rulings underscore its return to center stage in the debate over the health of democracy \u2014 and how rapidly demands to rein it in have grown.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court justices agree that gerrymandering needs to be curtailed remains an open question. Experts agree that the court\u2019s four liberal justices are prepared to rein in the practice, and that the crucial question is whether Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a moderate conservative appointed by President Reagan, will join them, and even bring another conservative with him.\n\nJustice Kennedy did not tip his hand during oral argument last fall over a Republican-drafted gerrymander of district maps for Wisconsin\u2019s lower house, the State Assembly.

North Carolina is a classic swing state, narrowly electing a Democratic governor in 2016 even as it narrowly chose Donald Trump for president. But of its 13 House seats, only three are held by Democrats \u2014 and that, a Republican legislator said in 2016, was \u201cbecause I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have hardly shied from gerrymandering House maps in states like Illinois and Maryland, where they control the levers of government, according to David Wasserman, an editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report who tracks House elections. Even so, he said, the larger number of Republican gerrymanders accounts for roughly half of the 24-seat advantage the party now holds in the House.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, challengers showed that the Republican legislature used detailed data on the partisan and ethnic makeup of more than 9,000 voting districts to draw a map in 2011 that has limited Democrats to five of the state\u2019s 18 House seats since then, even though statewide elections tend to split evenly between Republican and Democratic supporters.\n\nThe challengers argued that the map was an abuse of what is known as the elections clause in Article 1 of the Constitution, which allows states to set the rules for federal elections. Setting the rules, the plaintiffs said, does not mean twisting them to ensure the defeat of political opponents.\n\nJudge D. Brooks Smith, a Reagan appointee who is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected that argument. \u201cThe framers provided a check on state power within the text of the elections clause,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut it is a political one \u2014 action by Congress.\u201d There was no room for the judiciary to enforce a limit of its own, Judge Smith argued.\n\nThe other judges on the panel disagreed. Judge Patty Shwartz sided with Judge Smith in rejecting the gerrymandering claim, but flatly rejected the idea that the courts had no role in settling elections-clause disputes. The problem in the Pennsylvania case, she wrote, was that the plaintiffs offered no reasonable standard for determining when a map was in violation.\n\nIn a 141-page dissent, the third judge on the panel, Judge Michael M. Baylson, reviewed the evidence and reached another conclusion: the House map, he said, violated long-accepted rules for redistricting, including requirements that districts not be contorted to take in specific groups of voters without good reason.\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania ruling looked to the past, experts said, the North Carolina decision drew on an explosion of recent research that has begun to change legal minds on the constitutional question of partisan redistricting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe North Carolina opinion cites an array of work by social scientists and statistical experts that documents new methods of measuring the partisan impact of political boundaries. The opinion draws on fresh historical research to argue that partisan gerrymanders are not an accepted practice that the Founding Fathers chose to overlook, but a clear threat to the checks and balances at the heart of their new government.\n\nReferring to a sheaf of historical research, Judge James A. Wynn of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit wrote that the elections clause allowed states to set procedural rules for elections, but did not allow them \u201cto disfavor the interests of supporters of a particular candidate or party in drawing congressional districts.\u201d The panel of judges gave the state\u2019s Republicans two weeks to devise a new map.\n\nEdward B. Foley, a professor and election-law scholar at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, suggested that the reliance on new historical and social-science research was not accidental; rather, he said, it was meant win over conservatives on the Supreme Court who have been loath to tinker with past legal precedent or enmesh the court too deeply in political matters.\n\nThose elements of the decision, Mr. Foley said, send a message to Supreme Court conservatives. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will carry the day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it might be that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito\u201d \u2014 Samuel Alito, named to the court by President George W.

In virtually every detail, Trump seems like the perfect manifestation of postmodernism.\n\nAlong parallel lines, Ernst wrote,\n\nif the only one true thing in the world is that all truth and morality are relative, then anyone who pretends otherwise is either an idiot or a fraud. Hence the contemporary appeal of the antihero, and the disappearance of the traditional hero.\n\nScholars of contemporary philosophy argue that postmodernism does not dispute the existence of truth, per se, but rather seeks to interrogate the sources and interests of those making assertions of truth. As Casey Williams wrote in The Stone in The Times last April:\n\nCall it what you want: relativism, constructivism, deconstruction, postmodernism, critique. The idea is the same: Truth is not found, but made, and making truth means exercising power.\n\nIt is not usually the job of political journalists to analyze postmodernism, so I turned to some scholars who are devoted to the subject.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201ctruths,\u201d as Alan Schrift, a professor of philosophy at Grinnell College, pointed out,\n\nare not socially constructed but emerge from his own personal sense of what will promote his popularity, his power, and his wealth. This is why his particular, and acute, narcissism is so dangerous: he appeals to no social standards at all, only his own imagination as to what is in his own personal interest.\n\nPut in the most straightforward terms, Johanna Oksala, a professor of social science and cultural studies at the Pratt Institute, responded by email to my inquiry:\n\nI don\u2019t think Trump should be called a postmodern president, but simply a liar.\n\nFor something to be objectively true, Oksala wrote,\n\ndoes not mean that we have to have (or can have) absolute and eternally infallible knowledge of it. But our knowledge claims have to be available for public scrutiny by the scientific community and go through a rigorous peer-review process in order to qualify as scientific or objective truths.\n\nIn the Trump era, the core concept of truth has become deeply politicized and among Trump supporters there is scant appetite for \u201ca rigorous peer-review process.\u201d Andrew Cutrofello, a professor of philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, argues this point in an email:\n\nIn the present political climate truth and power have become uncoupled to a certain extent. It\u2019s natural to wonder whether this means the notion of objective truth has been undermined. But it could be the opposite, namely, that what we\u2019re living through isn\u2019t the loss of the category of objective truth but rather a battle over who has objective truth on their side. In other words, the very category of objective truth has become an ideological weapon, having been displaced from relatively neutral territory to the political battlefield.\n\nFor some scholars, the attempt to link Trump\u2019s lies \u2014 his falsehoods, his prevarications, his exaggerations, his duplicity, his \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d \u2014 with postmodernism grows out of a misperception of the term.", "title": "Opinion | Is President Trump a Stealth Postmodernist or Just a Liar?", "authors": []}

Indeed, if it is true, it has devastating implications for the entire Republican Party, since many officeholders enjoy lavish financial support from the N.R.A. Still, an N.R.A. role in Russiagate would explain a few things, including why the N.R.A. has, in recent years, developed such a close relationship with Russia.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of reporting about that relationship, which is widely seen as part of Russia\u2019s efforts to cultivate right-wing groups throughout the United States and Europe. As The Washington Post noted last year, \u201cOn issues including gun rights, terrorism and same-sex marriage, many leading advocates on the right who grew frustrated with their country\u2019s leftward tilt under President Barack Obama have forged ties with well-connected Russians and come to see that country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Is This the Collusion We Were Waiting For?", "authors": []}

(The last fatal crash on a domestic commercial airline in the United States was in 2009.) But one thing that Mr. Trump almost certainly managed to do, without effort or notice, is alter our perception of time.\n\nWe\u2019re all aware that our experience of time is fungible: Days fly by, conversations drag on, that weeklong vacation seems to last forever until suddenly it doesn\u2019t. As long ago as 1890 the psychologist William James noted that our feelings of time \u201charmonize with different mental moods.\u201d There now exists a large body of scientific literature demonstrating that emotions play a large part in generating these temporal flexions.\n\nFor instance, when viewing faces on a computer monitor, lab subjects report that happy faces seem to last longer onscreen than nonexpressive ones, and angry faces seem to last longer still. Fear, alarm and stress are factors too. Forty-five seconds with a live spider seems to last far longer to people who are afraid of spiders.

{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "For parents, the findings present something of a paradox. We want our children to be clever enough to lie but morally disinclined to do so. And there are times when a child\u2019s safety depends on getting at the truth, as in criminal cases involving maltreatment or abuse. How can we get our children to be honest?\n\nIn general, carrots work better than sticks. Harsh punishments like spanking do little to deter lying, research indicates, and if anything may be counterproductive. In one study, Professor Lee and the developmental psychologist Victoria Talwar compared the truth-telling behaviors of West African preschoolers from two schools, one that employed highly punitive measures such as corporal punishment to discipline students and another that favored more tempered methods like verbal reprimands and trips to the principal\u2019s office. Students at the harsher school were not only more likely to lie but also far better at it.\n\nWitnessing others being praised for honesty, meanwhile, and nonpunitive appeals for the truth \u2014 for example, \u201cIf you tell the truth, I will be really pleased with you\u201d \u2014 promotes honest behavior, Professors Lee and Talwar have found.\n\nSo does a simple promise. Multiple studies have shown that children as old as 16 are less likely to lie about their misdeeds, and the misdeeds of others, after pledging to tell the truth, a result that has been replicated widely. The psychologist Angela Evans has also found that children are less likely to peek at the toy while the researcher is out of the room if they promise not to. Curiously, this works even with children who don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201cpromise.\u201d Merely securing a verbal agreement \u2014 \u201cI will tell the truth\u201d \u2014 does the trick. By the end of infancy, it would seem, children already grasp the significance of making a verbal commitment to another person.\n\nAs for those childhood morality tales, you might want to skip the more ominous ones. Professor Lee and others have found that reading stories to children about the perils of deceit, such as \u201cThe Boy Who Cried Wolf\u201d and \u201cPinocchio,\u201d fails to discourage them from lying. Reading them the story of George Washington and the cherry tree, on the other hand, in which truthfulness is met with approval, does reduce lying, albeit to a modest degree. The key to fostering honest behavior, Professor Lee and his colleagues argue, is positive messaging \u2014 emphasizing the benefits of honesty rather than the drawbacks of deception.\n\nYou can also simply pay kids to be honest. In research involving 5- and 6-year-olds, Professor Lee and his colleagues attached a financial incentive to telling the truth about a misdeed. Lying earned children $2, while confessing won them anywhere from nothing to $8. The research question was: How much does the truth cost? When honesty paid nothing, four out of five children lied. Curiously, that number barely budged when the payout was raised to $2.\n\nBut when honesty was compensated at 1.5 times the value of lying \u2014 $3 rather than $2 \u2014 the scales tipped in favor of the truth. Honesty can be bought, in other words, but at a premium. The absolute dollar amount is irrelevant, Professor Lee has found. What matters is the relative value \u2014 the honesty-to-dishonesty exchange rate, so to speak.\n\n\u201cTheir decision to lie is very tactical,\u201d Professor Lee said. \u201cChildren are thinking in terms of the ratio.\u201d Smart kids, indeed.", "title": "Opinion | Is Your Child Lying to You?

Parents sometimes hand down their old iPhones as a first phone for a child in elementary school. I encourage parents to get their kids flip phones first, and wait until they have developed good overall habits before giving them a smartphone.\n\nJust as kids learn to ride bikes with training wheels or get junior licenses when they learn to drive, kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to manage their first smartphones all by themselves. Fortunately, there are ways to manage use and help kids develop better tendencies, and much of it requires a delicate balance of parental modeling and involvement.\n\nMake a Plan\n\nTaking the time to discuss appropriate use, establish guidelines and come up with a family agreement before kids get a phone is ideal, because it can be harder to put rules in place afterward. Family agreements can include rules about when and how the phone may be used, and potential consequences for broken rules. Agreements are more likely to be successful if they are followed consistently and revisited frequently as kids grow older and new apps become available.\n\nMonitor Use\n\nFor parents of teens who have smartphones, making the effort to understand how, where and why kids are spending time on their phone is critical.\n\nIt can be helpful to think about imbalances over a span of time rather than on a single evening or weekend. After all, binge-watching a television series on a smartphone while feeling sick or heartbroken isn\u2019t the same as lying about phone use over an extended period of time. An app like Moment can help track usage and display the time spent in each app.\n\nTake a Time Out\n\nApple\u2019s Family Sharing and Google Play have settings to help parents monitor use, and most phone carriers have their own parental control options. Devices like Circle and apps like OurPact give parents the ability to automate access, disable access to certain apps after a certain hour and build in structured time off to promote rest. The psychologist Larry Rosen, who has researched technology and the brain and is a co-author of \u201cThe Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World,\u201d said one of the most important steps is to remove the phone from the bedroom at night.\n\nBe a Role Model\n\nOf course, parents trying to set healthy guidelines for smartphone use may themselves be struggling with similar issues: The 2015 Pew survey found that 46 percent of American adults believed they could not live without their smartphones.

Enriching shareholders is not enough.\n\nWe interrupt this column for a paragraph of cynicism. Tycoons always claim to cherish ordinary people\u2019s best interests even as they rip them off. American tobacco executives have killed more people than Stalin managed to, and pharma executives recklessly peddling opioids may have killed as many people as Colombian drug lords, yet these business leaders sometimes seem to get moist-eyed describing the work they do.\n\nBut the business toolbox is too important to give up on. To me, the most interesting people in Davos aren\u2019t the presidents or celebrities, but the social entrepreneurs \u2014 those using business tools to address social problems \u2014 and their work offers an inspiring window into what can be accomplished.", "title": "Opinion | Is the Business World All About Greed?", "authors": []}

But in the United States, the population of unauthorized immigrants is declining, disproving one of Mr. Trump\u2019s core claims to power.\n\nEconomists studying the changes in the nature of work that produced such an angry political response suggest, however, that another wave of disruption is about to wash across the world economy, knocking out entire new classes of jobs: artificial intelligence. This could provide decades\u2019 worth of fuel to the revolt against the global elites and their notions of market democracy.\n\nAs Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted this month in an analysis on the potential impact of artificial intelligence on American politics, \u201cGiven globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term A.I. and globalization replace many of the same jobs.\u201d\n\nConsider the occupation of truck drivers. Mr. Levy expects multiple demonstrations of fully autonomous trucks to take place within five years. If they work, the technology will spread, starting in restricted areas on a limited number of dedicated highway lanes. By 2024, artificial intelligence might eliminate 76,000 jobs driving heavy and tractor-trailer trucks, he says.\n\nSimilarly, he expects artificial intelligence to wipe out 210,000 assembler and fabricator jobs and 260,000 customer service representatives. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about the future of work in the next 25 years,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to worry about in the next five or six years.\u201d\n\nThese may not be big numbers, but they are hitting communities that expressed their contempt for the status quo in 2016. White men and women without a four-year college degree accounted for just under half of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters \u2014 compared with fewer than a fifth of Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Seventy percent of truck drivers, 63 percent of assemblers and fabricators, and 56 percent of customer service representatives share these characteristics.\n\nThe Surge of Populism Populist parties\u2019 share of the vote is rising around the world. Populist parties\u2019 share of vote worldwide* 25 % 20 15 10 5 0 \u201961- \u201965 \u201966- \u201970 \u201971- \u201975 \u201976- \u201980 \u201981- \u201985 \u201986- \u201990 \u201991- \u201995 \u201996- \u201900 \u201901- \u201905 \u201906- \u201910 \u201911- \u201916 Populist parties\u2019 share of vote worldwide* 25 % 20 15 10 5 0 \u201961- \u201965 \u201966- \u201970 \u201971- \u201975 \u201976- \u201980 \u201981- \u201985 \u201986- \u201990 \u201991- \u201995 \u201996- \u201900 \u201901- \u201905 \u201906- \u201910 \u201911- \u201916\n\nTo be sure, economic dislocations don\u2019t have to produce populist politics. Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. notes that geography makes a difference: If the dislocation from A.I. is concentrated in big cities, where workers have more options to find new jobs, the backlash will be more muted than it was when trade took out the jobs of single-industry company towns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Acemoglu added, the political system can respond in different ways to workers\u2019 pain: The Great Depression not only led to Nazi Germany, it also produced Sweden\u2019s social democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately obvious that artificial intelligence will produce the same kind of reaction that trade did. Sure, machines inspired the most memorable worker rebellion of the industrial revolution \u2014 when the Luddites smashed the weaving machines that were taking over their jobs. The word \u201csabotage\u201d comes from the French workers who took to destroying gears.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In New York, the local of the \u201csandhogs\u201d who dig subway tunnels negotiated a deal where it gets $450,000 for each tunnel-digging machine used, to make up for job losses caused by \u201ctechnological advancement.\u201d\n\nYet though automation has displaced many more jobs than trade ever could, robots have never inspired the fury that trade routinely does. \u201cBy all accounts, automation and new digital technologies played a quantitatively greater role in deindustrialization and in spatial and income inequalities,\u201d wrote Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. \u201cBut globalization became tainted with a stigma of unfairness that technology evaded.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easier to demonize people \u2014 especially foreigners \u2014 than machines, the children of invention. What\u2019s more, imports from countries with cheaper labor, weaker worker protections and threadbare environmental standards will be seen as unfair. Thea Lee, a former deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who now heads the Economic Policy Institute, notes that workers\u2019 anger is directed against \u201cthe particular set of rules about globalization that we chose,\u201d which spreads benefits among financiers and corporations while disregarding workers.\n\nThis time could be different, though. \u201cThat sense of unfairness can be attached to technological changes, too,\u201d Mr. Rodrik told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Bill Gates, who came out of nowhere, but big corporations that are getting bigger and becoming monopolists.\u201d\n\nIndeed, artificial intelligence could move populism in a different direction. Mr. Rodrik proposes two varieties, of right and left. The two share an anti-establishment flavor and claim to speak for the people against the elites. Both oppose classic liberal economics and globalization. Both are often authoritarian.\n\nBut right-wing populism \u2014 like that harnessed in Europe \u2014 is provoked by immigration. Its clan consciousness exploits cleavages of race, religion and nationality. On the left, by contrast, the \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative focuses on the economic divide between the capitalists and the working class. Populists of the left mostly take aim at trade.\n\nThe United States was ripe for both reflexes. Over the last 50 years, as the nation opened its markets to foreign trade, it never set up a social safety net to help workers dislodged by change, as Europe did. It also experienced large-scale immigration across the southern border. And it was walloped by a financial crisis that proved to typical workers that Wall Street would always get a better deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s discourse straddles the divide between the ideological domains, vilifying both trade and immigration. But his policies \u2014 tax cuts and immigration restrictions \u2014 hew decidedly to the right.\n\nIt is not a great fit for a big-tech future. A world in which immigration is on the decline yet some Google technology is taking the jobs of truckers and cashiers sounds compatible with a leftist policy platform that takes on Wall Street and corporate behemoths.\n\nThat is a world in which, say, Bernie Sanders would thrive.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "BERLIN \u2014 It has been almost a year since Donald Trump took office, and Germany is still debating what, exactly, his administration means for Europe. Is Mr. Trump just a hiccup in the American political system or an indicator of a chronic disease? Will the trans-Atlantic relationship ever be the same again or is it time Germany and Europe prepared for a post-Atlantic era? But rather than providing insight into the future of the United States, the debate is turning into a Freudian analysis of Germany\u2019s own troubles.\n\nIt started in May, when Chancellor Angela Merkel, shocked by Mr. Trump\u2019s first visit to Europe as president, said that \u201cthe times we can fully rely on others are somewhat over\u201d and that Europe had to become more self-reliant. Since then, two factions have formed: those who believe Germany can wait out Mr. Trump and then return to normal and those who call for a strategic shift because they think the days of American leadership are over.\n\nThe first faction is represented by a group of foreign policy experts who published a \u201cTrans-Atlantic Manifesto,\u201d which appeared in October in The New York Times and the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. They argue that guarding the trans-Atlantic relationship is crucial to the liberal world order and that a firm trans-Atlantic commitment gives Germany the liberty to act as a leader in Europe without stirring old fears of German predominance. They find supporters in conservative policymakers such as Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the head of the Bundestag\u2019s external affairs committee. He, too, stresses that mutual values, not just mutual interests, constitute the trans-Atlantic relationship.\n\nThe other side is represented by Germany\u2019s acting foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat. In a speech at a foreign policy forum in Berlin in December, he stated flatly that \u201cthe relations between the U.S.A. and Europe won\u2019t be the same anymore \u2014 even when Donald Trump leaves the White House.\u201d He called for Germany to reconceive its strategic posture and to plan for a new era when it could no longer rely on American leadership.", "title": "Opinion | Is the Trans-Atlantic Relationship Dead?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "Bowyer-Chapman, a die-hard fan of the show who is a frequent guest judge, later told me that he felt the scene was cutting commentary on both the racial discrimination of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d which has never had an African-American star, and the way television warps people. The contestants \u201cbecame caricatures of themselves in ways that were the polar opposite of what usually happens on \u2018Drag Race,\u2019 which is about finding the authenticity of yourself and showcasing it,\u201d he said. The show reveals, Bowyer-Chapman argued, that regardless of gender and orientation, \u201cwe all have more in common than not.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDrag has been featured in popular culture for decades. Movies like \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d \u201cTootsie,\u201d \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d \u2014 even \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d \u2014 have showcased men, some gay, some not, who dress and perform as women. But most tended to treat drag as high jinks. Nothing about the inner lives of queens has hit critical mass quite like \u201cDrag Race,\u201d not even the 1991 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d which followed the black and Latino drag ball circuit in New York during the 1980s. \u201cIt is a popular movie, but it didn\u2019t reach everyone the way a weekly television show does,\u201d said Lady Bunny, a drag queen in her 50s who is often regarded as one of the legendary figures of American drag culture. \u201cMany people have never had any interaction with a drag queen, and barely know what it is,\u201d Bunny continued. \u201cAnytime Middle America gets a taste of a community that they\u2019re not familiar with, it does normalize the L.G.B.T. experience.\u201d\n\nCharles has said that he feels he is beyond categorization \u2014 he\u2019s black but he\u2019s not; he\u2019s gay but he\u2019s not. These days, when someone says that, it\u2019s usually met with a polite eye roll, the kind reserved for out-of-touch elders. The personal politics of this moment are almost entirely defined by naming. There\u2019s space for every pronoun, every hyphen and every politically correct portmanteau. But Charles belongs to a different generation, one that fought so hard for visibility that they feel they\u2019ve earned the right to eschew all political decorum and enjoy the anarchy of reinvention, co-opting and bending language beyond recognition. When \u201cDrag Race\u201d first began, it seemed like a fun window into an underground culture, but over the nine years it has aired, the show has evolved to reflect America\u2019s changing relationship to queer rights and acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDrag, to Charles, is about the perversion of our understanding of gender, and by extension, ourselves. \u201cWe queens take on identity, and it is always a social statement,\u201d Charles explained to me. \u201cIt\u2019s all nudge, nudge, wink, wink. We never believe this is who we are. That is why drag is a revolution, because we\u2019re mocking identity. We\u2019re mocking everyone.\u201d\n\nAnyone familiar with reality television will recognize the premise of \u201cDrag Race\u201d: Loosely modeled on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d hosted by Tyra Banks, the show features 12 (or so) contestants who gather to compete for the title of America\u2019s Next Drag Superstar and a cash prize that varies per season but can be as much as $100,000. To determine who will advance to the next round, the queens are given elaborate challenges, like creating haute-couture runway looks from scratch or starring in music videos. \u201cDrag Race\u201d is entertaining in the way that every show that structures itself around transformation is: There\u2019s a pleasant thrill that comes from watching a bland room metamorphose into something out of Architectural Digest, or the creation of an impossibly elaborate meal in under an hour, or a generic-looking man morphing into a gorgeous and statuesque woman.\n\nIn 2009, the year that the first season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d was broadcast, the buzziest reality shows on television tended to be the most melodramatic and cattiest \u2014 \u201cSurvivor\u201d or \u201cThe Hills.\u201d \u201cProducers were just looking for the nasty side of the human experience, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Charles told me. Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, founders of the production house World of Wonder, talked him into it. The trio had been collaborating since the 1980s, when Barbato and Bailey were in an electro band called the Fabulous Pop Tarts. Charles appears in one of their videos in a skin-tight leopard dress. They produced Charles\u2019s VH1 variety show in the 1990s. \u201cI knew they loved drag the way I loved drag, and they would celebrate the art of drag,\u201d Charles said. Tom Campbell, head of development at World of Wonder, told me that the idea for the show was to create a competition that would groom the next generation of drag superstars by replicating all the major milestones of Charles\u2019s career \u2014 model, television personality, performer. \u201cThis was his turn to give back and create his legacy,\u201d he said.\n\nAt first, \u201cDrag Race\u201d wasn\u2019t an easy sell. \u201cEveryone felt like it was too much,\u201d Barbato said. Even when Viacom\u2019s L.G.B.T. channel, LogoTV, picked it up, Charles had to fight to realize his vision for the show. According to Charles and the producers, in the first season Logo resisted including a queen named Tammie Brown, who called to mind a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Prymaat, the matriarch in the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch \u201cConeheads.\u201d Charles felt it was important to reflect the oddballs of drag, a staple of the culture.\n\nDespite airing on a niche cable channel, the show found a loyal audience that included an elite coterie of celebrity fans who appeared regularly as guest judges, including Lily Tomlin, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Margaret Cho, Amber Rose, Rosie Perez and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. It was the most-watched show in the history of Logo. Last year, the show moved to VH1 and grew significantly: The ninth season averaged nearly 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double that of Season 8, according to data collected by Nielsen. In 2016, Charles won an Emmy for host of a reality show, and in 2017, he won again and the show picked up two more. Time magazine recently named Charles one of its 100 Most Influential People of the year.\n\n\u201cDrag Race\u201d has become a staple of modern television for the way it skewers expectations and attitudes about gender, much as a show like \u201cblack-ish\u201d works to challenge stereotypes about black families in America. That isn\u2019t to say contestants on \u201cDrag Race\u201d don\u2019t bicker or trade petty insults, as in other reality-TV shows, but the program doesn\u2019t leave viewers with the same existential dread about the future of humanity as, say, any of the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchises. In Season 5, for example, a contestant named Jade Jolie criticized her competitor, Alyssa Edwards, for having back fat. In a cutaway reaction, Edwards cocked an eyebrow, recoiled in disbelief and managed to completely defang the insult with a single word: \u201cBackrolls?\u201d \u2014 signaling that the word was both ludicrous (she is rail-thin) and so untoward that it could not be taken seriously. Some five seasons later, \u201cbackrolls\u201d still pops up on the show as a kind of venomless meta-reference.\n\nEach season is imbued with a sense of optimism in the face of relentless adversity; Charles believes that is central to the gay and queer experience. \u201cThere is a sisterhood here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to do with the shared experience of being outsiders and making a path for ourselves.\u201d The camaraderie Charles describes is evident: Even after their season ends, \u201cDrag Race\u201d contestants work together, live together, travel together. Their Instagrams are full of photos of one another. The kinship feels real, and it\u2019s what initially caught my attention and endeared the show to me.\n\nAmid the glitz and glamour of drag, the show doesn\u2019t obscure the violence and terror that accompanies the life of the marginalized. On the first season, a contestant named Porkchop described being shot at while standing outside a gay bar. In Season 8, Kim Chi, a shy Korean-American queen known for elaborate outfits, talked about hiding her colorful drag persona from her parents out of fear of shaming them. Trinity K Bonet talked about living with H.I.V. Last season, Cynthia Lee Fontaine revealed that if not for a last-minute change in her schedule, she would have performed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando the night of the mass shooting there; one of her friends, Martin Benitez Torres, unaware of the change, came to see her and was killed in the massacre. When I asked Charles if there was a deliberate decision to infuse the show with overt political messaging, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s inherent in our experience. We don\u2019t have to do much to infuse a consciousness into the show. It is such a part of our story, and we walk with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs \u201cDrag Race\u201d matures, it continues to find a broader and younger audience. Charles told me that some of the most dedicated viewers are women, especially teenagers and women in their 20s and 30s. \u201cThere is so much programming by social media, and how you have to construct your sense of self in line with how everyone else is constructing their sense of self. I think they see our show as a handbook for a navigation, and think, How can I rig this conveyor belt where I don\u2019t have to go down that thing?\u201d That awakening feels familiar to him because he went through it himself at 13. He looked like a girl, with sharp cheekbones, a soft brow and a red Afro that he let grow so big that it flopped down. \u201cWhen I first started doing drag in clubs, it was like the blurry picture that people had of me became clear,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the queens were kicked out of their homes, bullied or ostracized from society, and here they are looking gorgeous and confident. I know that\u2019s what kids are relating to. They\u2019re having a great time, but they\u2019ve overcome the pain too.\u201d\n\nCharles thinks these new fans who follow him and the queens on Instagram or who show up at live events for the show are embracing the spirit of drag and the freedom it offers. \u201cThey are shifting the balance of masculinity and femininity. And that makes me so optimistic.\u201d I was slightly skeptical that so many young people were watching the show, but as we sat over breakfast at Palihouse in West Hollywood, I noticed a middle-aged woman hovering with a nervous grin, waiting for her moment to approach. As Charles stood up, unfolding his lanky frame \u2014 sheathed in a slightly iridescent emerald-green suit \u2014 and leaned down to pick up his brown leather handbag, the woman rushed over. She wanted a photograph. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, but for my kids,\u201d she explained. Her children were 9 and 5, she told Charles. \u201cThey watch you every week,\u201d she gushed. \u201cThey love you.\u201d\n\nThe story of Charles\u2019s name goes like this: His mother, Ernestine \u2014 friends called her Toni \u2014 was thumbing through the July 1960 issue of Ebony Magazine, where there was a spread of the singer and piano player Fats Domino\u2019s new $200,000 home in New Orleans. A photograph of Domino enjoying a cocktail with the architect who designed his new home, Albert J. Saputo, as well as his wife and Domino\u2019s friends Louis Diamond and Ripoll Roberts, caught Toni\u2019s eye. She drew an arrow to Ripoll\u2019s name and wrote \u201cboy\u201d underneath. Ernestine was Creole, and she wanted her next child\u2019s name to reflect her heritage. She changed \u201cRi\u201d to \u201cRu\u201d to symbolize roux, the base of Louisiana dishes like gumbo. A psychic had told her that her unborn child would be famous, and she was determined to give the baby a name meant for a marquee.\n\nA few months later, in November 1960, that boy was born. His full name was RuPaul Andre Charles. His parents were living in San Diego at the time, having moved with their twins, Renetta and Renae, from Louisiana during the second wave of the Great Migration. Charles\u2019s parents traveled to the farthest coast, the literal end of the country their ancestors were forcibly brought to, only to discover that the mythos of the West \u2014 that it was a land of fresh starts \u2014 was far more complicated for black people, who still faced discrimination. \u201cShe was heartbroken by this world,\u201d he told me, with tears in his eyes. His parents were poor, and Charles\u2019s mother suffered from a debilitating depression throughout his youth. \u201cMy folks, and other folks in the South, had such traumatic experiences. I was able to dissect and deconstruct some of my feelings. I could afford to do it. They couldn\u2019t afford to do it.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1976, Renetta and her husband, Laurence, moved to Atlanta and invited Charles, who was 15, to join them. \u201cIt was like my bar mitzvah,\u201d Charles told me. \u201cSouthern culture has always had a place for eccentrics. I was ready to bust out and become who I am today.\u201d Those years imbued Charles with confidence. He enrolled at a performing-arts high school, where he took drama and theater. Atlanta\u2019s night life was a Warholian village of underground clubs, art shows, D.I.Y. movie shoots and warehouse parties. Under the governance of Maynard Jackson, the city\u2019s first African-American mayor, Atlanta was also a boomtown for African-Americans, creatively, socially and economically. He had never seen so many black people in one place \u2014 he didn\u2019t even know that many black people existed.\n\nHe saw his first drag performance: Crystal LaBeija, an icon in drag-queen history, was singing Donna Summer in black fishnets and a bustier. Charles was floored. He used Renetta\u2019s sewing machine and drafted the first iteration of his new persona, blending the new-wave punk aesthetic of Bow Wow Wow, the goth freakiness of \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d and jungle prints. A favorite look was a jock strap with football shoulder pads, fishnets and knee-high wading boots and dramatic eyes, all finished with a pile of hair whose volume rivaled Tina Turner\u2019s. He started bands, made music videos with friends, appeared on public-access variety shows and worked as a go-go dancer. He papered downtown Atlanta with handmade posters of himself that read, \u201cRuPaul Is Everything,\u201d and \u201cRuPaul Is Red Hot.\u201d\n\nAlthough drag has a long cultural history in America, it remained largely underground till the late 1980s. During the 1920s, the height of speakeasy culture in America, illicit venues and establishments that catered to gay clientele frequently hosted drag performance. By the 1940s and 1950s, postwar America had become more conservative, and the gay community was more heavily policed: A \u201cpervert inquiry\u201d in government agencies led to dismissals of federal and military personnel suspected of homosexuality. Cross-dressing was a punishable offense; in New York, men wearing fewer than three pieces of clothing could be arrested. But with the end of McCarthyism and the beginning of the sexual revolution, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the United States was home to about 500 regularly performing drag queens, with several, like Divine, reaching cult status. When Charles settled in Manhattan in the late 1980s, drag was a full-on cultural phenomenon in the city, and Charles was determined to be at its center.\n\nAt 28, Charles became a fixture as a dancer at downtown clubs like Pyramid, Tunnel and Limelight. His popularity and career exploded when he teamed up with a D.J. named Larry Tee for the roving underground party Love Machine. It quickly became a trendy scene \u2014 even Liza Minnelli made an appearance. By then, Charles had transformed his look from what he called \u201cfright drag\u201d to something much more glamorous. The B-52s asked Charles to appear in their 1989 video \u201cLove Shack,\u201d which was shown regularly on MTV; four years later, Charles released the album \u201cSupermodel of the World\u201d on Tommy Boy Records, a label that had introduced acts like De La Soul and Queen Latifah. The album featured the song \u201cSupermodel (You Better Work),\u201d in which he gave models runway advice like \u201cshantay,\u201d a word Charles described as casting a bewitching spell. The song became a club anthem. The designers Todd Oldham and Isaac Mizrahi used it in their runway presentations during fashion week, and a cover of it appeared in \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie.\u201d In 1993, it was nominated for best dance video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Charles landed a regular modeling contract with MAC Cosmetics \u2014 the advertising campaign featured him in full glamazon drag, alongside the tag line \u201cI am the MAC girl.\u201d He had become the most successful queen of his era.\n\nI asked Charles if his mother ever got to see him perform. She did, once, in 1993. She was on her deathbed at home, suffering from cancer. She and Charles watched a Kurt Loder segment on MTV News around the release of \u201cSupermodel.\u201d It showed Charles prancing around a mall in New Jersey before a recorded voice-over declared him a \u201csupermodel of the world.\u201d His mother turned to him, he recalled, and said, \u201cNigga, you crazy.\u201d But Toni could also see that the psychic\u2019s premonition \u2014 that Charles would be famous \u2014 had come true. \u201cI could see her thinking, It\u2019s happening,\u201d he told me.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor two years, he hosted, accompanied by his close friend Michelle Visage (a regular judge on \u201cDrag Race\u201d), \u201cThe RuPaul Show,\u201d a kind of variety program featuring pop-culture celebrities like Cher and Eartha Kitt. It was the first national show to have a drag queen as host. He released 10 more studio albums, but none were as successful as \u201cSupermodel.\u201d Then Bailey and Barbato, his World of Wonder co-producers, urged him to pitch the reality-show competition that would become \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d \u201cWe thought, Everyone is ready for drag \u2014 it\u2019s mainstream now,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cDistribution is part of the reason it hadn\u2019t been realized as a cultural phenomenon.\u201d\n\nSince \u201cDrag Race\u201d first aired in 2009, the conversation around identity and gender has shifted tremendously. For all the show has done to challenge its audience\u2019s notions of masculinity and femininity, it has shied away, until the most recent season, from any serious discussion about the ways the drag community intersects the trans one. There have been trans queens on the show, but the topic is a touchy one in the drag community. For most drag artists, the point is the performance; it is not their sole identity. But for those queens who identify as trans or nonbinary, their stage persona is not necessarily a performance. The centerpiece of the show is the contestants\u2019 transforming themselves into queens, and then, after each competition, taking off their wigs and removing synthetic breasts to reappear as men. For years, \u201cDrag Race\u201d prioritized entertainment over any nuances of the culture. Much of the queens\u2019 vernacular, body language and movements come from the drag world\u2019s \u2014 especially white queens\u2019 \u2014 interpretation of black femininity. I\u2019ve always been uncomfortable with that phenomenon, despite how much I enjoy the show. In his essay \u201c \u2018Draguating\u2019 to Normal,\u201d the academic Josh Morrison argues that by using the bodies of women, people of color and other marginalized groups, \u201cthrough an often loving, well-intentioned impersonation of them,\u201d drag \u201cunintentionally does them discursive violence.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d Banks would send the contestants a video message called \u201cTyraMail\u201d when she wanted to communicate with them; \u201cDrag Race\u201d had a version of this called \u201cShe-Mail.\u201d There were also challenges in which contestants were shown body parts and asked to guess \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cshemale.\u201d Some viewers complained on Twitter, and trans activists and writers started a public campaign advocating against the terms \u201cshe-mail\u201d and \u201cshe-male,\u201d arguing that they were transphobic. Charles and his producers initially defended their position. Charles tweeted, \u201cOrwell\u2019s book \u2018Animal Farm\u2019: The rebels eventually forgot the purpose of the revolution.\u201d But eventually the show dropped the term. Carmen Carrera, who competed in the show\u2019s third season and came out as transgender after her season aired, wrote on Facebook that although she didn\u2019t think the show meant any harm, \u201c \u2018shemale\u2019 is an incredibly offensive word, and this whole business about if you can tell whether a woman is biological or not is getting kind of old.\u201d For Charles, the controversy represented the antithesis of drag, which he sees as a subversive, countercultural reminder not to take the world so seriously. But for members of the trans community, language isn\u2019t a magic trick. Stepping into an identity other than the one you were assigned at birth isn\u2019t a performance \u2014 it\u2019s a confirmation and a correction.\n\nThe controversy speaks to how quickly the culture has changed over the past 10 years. When I was on the phone with Lady Bunny, I used the word \u201cqueer.\u201d Bunny let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cOh, God, do I have to say it, too, now?\u201d During her youth, which is still recent history, \u201cqueer\u201d was a slur \u2014 what \u201cthey\u2019d say right before they bashed you in the head,\u201d she reminded me. The boundary-pushers of Charles and Bunny\u2019s time reveled in making a mockery of identity politics and political correctness; ours is defined by sharpening categories as a means to demand inclusion and recognition. (Facebook now has more than 50 options for listing gender identity, including pangender and agender.)\n\nThroughout my conversations with Charles, I got the sense that he is a sensitive person who is actively trying to evolve with the times. \u201cEvery season the girls come and they challenge me. A new nose contour technique or a new way to see themselves and identity, and it helps me stay on my game and stay engaged in the conversation.\u201d Last season, midway through the show, a queen in her late 30s named Peppermint revealed she was transgender, the first time being trans became a significant part of a character\u2019s narrative arc. Peppermint talked openly about her transition with Charles and the other contestants. Peppermint had auditioned twice for the show, and she didn\u2019t mention her transness. \u201cI was always careful to separate my trans identity from my drag career,\u201d she told me in a phone conversation. When she finally made it onto the show, she was asked if she would feel comfortable speaking about it. She has gorgeous features and deep dimples, but on the show, she described how her figure and hair, which were perceived as masculine, invited critiques from people who felt she should transition further or appear more feminine. \u201cI came to terms with my womanhood, even if I naturally have a beard growing in,\u201d she said. \u201cMen don\u2019t own gender and gender performance. We all can turn gender on its head.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPeppermint noted the ways the popularity of \u201cDrag Race\u201d has bolstered an entire community, and in turn, an entire economy. In the \u201990s, she recalled, it was only lucrative to be a drag queen if you were one of the chosen queens \u2014 Lady Bunny, Candis Cayne, Miss Understood and, of course, RuPaul. She reminisced about doing drag seven days a week to pay the rent. \u201cReally, only 10 or 15 queens were benefiting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now the show has given so much exposure that it gives everyone a chance to earn very good money and recoup all the investments that we\u2019ve put in over the years \u2014 you know, the money we\u2019ve spent on glitter and rhinestones.\u201d\n\nJack Halberstam, a professor of English and gender studies at Columbia University and author of the book \u201cFemale Masculinity,\u201d a study of the history of diverse gender expressions, told me that we\u2019re in a watershed moment for gender visibility and equality, and he doesn\u2019t want to play down the importance of a mainstream drag show on television. Even now, gay life on television is limited \u2014 typically it\u2019s a side plot or narrative device. Representation still matters. But he raised an interesting point: \u201cNotice that there\u2019s no \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Kings,\u2019 \u201d Halberstam said \u2014 meaning the culture of drag where people, usually gay women, dress up as passable versions of men. \u201cIt\u2019s as equally raucous and raunchy, with lip-syncing and costume competitions. We still have this idea that femininity is malleable, and masculinity is a protected domain of real power and privilege. It is not transferable or attainable. The public has no appetite for artificial masculinity.\u201d\n\nI tried to imagine a version of the show where contestants won prizes for making fun of male archetypes and stereotypes, and demonstrated that male identity can be deconstructed as easily as whipping off a toupee and a soft prosthetic penis. It was impossible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCharles\u2019s dressing room on the set of \u201cDrag Race\u201d is actually two rooms: One for his suits, the other for his gowns. In the room with gowns, there were tables full of costume jewelry and impossibly large (and tall!) stiletto heels; there was a table devoted to makeup, and on racks, an enviable number of ball gowns in all sorts of materials and shades \u2014 pink sequins, purple plaid taffeta, black tulle. Charles made sure I noticed the size of the mirror \u2014 it was at least seven feet tall, purchased specifically to accommodate his height. Charles loves clothes. He has a staggering number of shoes and bespoke suits, which were handmade by the Los Angeles label Klein Epstein & Parker. Each includes a custom label: The words under the collar read, \u201cBorn Naked,\u201d and inside, \u201cThe Rest Is Drag,\u201d an adage that Charles coined.\n\nCharles frequently described his relationship to drag as \u201cthe Superman to my Clark Kent.\u201d The first time he stepped into his drag persona, Charles felt fully alive, electric with a power to command attention and desire. One day his therapist told him he could be Superman regardless of his attire. \u201cShe said, \u2018The power you feel in drag is available to you 24/7,\u2019 \u201d he told me. That realization, he said, is what he is trying to relay in each season of the show, to both the queens and the viewers. Charles is rarely in drag these days \u2014 only for special occasions, and during the judging and elimination rounds on the show \u2014 a shift that he made about a decade ago. For Charles, the confidence and fun of drag is a state of mind, not an outfit change. But he is always keenly aware of the power dynamics (the ones Halberstam noted) that favor men, even when they are taking on female personas. \u201cWe never forget the fact that we are men in a male-dominated culture where masculinity is a currency that is valued more than gold. For men to do anything with femininity, to use femininity as a palette, it\u2019s basically an act of treason in our culture.\u201d\n\nDuring a break in taping while I was on set, Charles rounded up people for a game of dirty charades, which he loves so much that he keeps a list of clever ideas on his iPhone that is several swipes long. Empty director\u2019s chairs were dragged into an approximation of an audience around the giant stage where the show\u2019s contestants usually walk the runway. About half a dozen crew members arranged themselves accordingly. Charles, impeccable in his petal-pink three-piece suit, leapt onto the stage, lit by fuchsia lights, and signaled the start of the game. He used his hands to simulate the whirring of an analog film camera, and then held up three fingers, indicating a three-word movie title. He pinched his forefinger and thumb to indicate that the first word was short. He curled his hands into soft fists and raised them to his mouth. He mimed licking himself, and then spun around and squatted, reaching his hands around and motioning as if he were pulling something from his ass. The group, including me, burst into laughter. Someone yelled, \u201cThat Darn Scat!\u201d and Charles slapped his thighs and released a peal of laughter so distinct and delightful \u2014 like a throaty giggle \u2014 that as a child his older sisters regularly tickled it out of him.\n\nNo one wanted to try and top that performance, so Charles cycled through several more R-rated versions of movies and songs like \u201cIt\u2019s the Hard-Knock Life,\u201d \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cThe Blue Lagoon.\u201d After each round, there was wild applause. I had the discomfiting sensation of catching a glimpse of something deeply private, like walking in on someone in a state of undress or using the bathroom. I had seen more than 100 episodes of \u201cDrag Race.\u201d I had watched Charles play the matriarch and patriarch, dispensing wisdom, jokes, admonishments and pep talks. Here, he looked carefree as he moved seamlessly between impersonations of a tough biker, a coquettish flirt, a naughty schoolgirl. Onscreen, he was always slightly removed, distant, ruling the show with a steely reserve that bordered on conservatism. The contrast between that Ru and the Ru pantomiming masturbation onstage was so disorienting it made my head spin. Watching him shape-shift onstage, I finally understood what he was trying to get at, how he refuses the outward ways in which people try to characterize him \u2014 and really, all people.\n\nCharles has been with his husband, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met on the dance floor at Limelight. On their second date, they flew from London to D\u00fcsseldorf on Elton John\u2019s private jet. They married in early 2017, 23 years after they met. The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Wyoming, where LeBar, a ruggedly handsome man somehow taller than Charles, has a 60,000-acre ranch. When they can, they take quick trips to San Francisco, New York or Maui. One time they took a helicopter from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, had lunch and took a boat down the Colorado River. \u201cHaving money is great when you have an imagination,\u201d Charles told me. I asked him if LeBar likes that sort of thing. \u201cHe loves luxury and doesn\u2019t give a [expletive] about culture,\u201d Charles replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who the Kardashians are. He doesn\u2019t know who Lil Yachty is. He couldn\u2019t name a Taylor Swift song.\u201d It\u2019s a reprieve from the celebrity status of Charles\u2019s world.\n\nBut Charles thrives on that culture. He is working on a scripted television series for Hulu with the director J.J. Abrams based on his own life, and he recently appeared in the fourth season of \u201cBroad City,\u201d as Marcel, the manager of a haughty Brooklyn restaurant where Ilana works, who encourages her to be mean to the customers as a tactic to pressure them into spending money. Ilana eventually pushes back against Marcel\u2019s tyranny and realizes she is more successful as herself \u2014 the ultimate Ru message. \u201cWe wrote this character with Ru in mind,\u201d Abbi Jacobson, the creator of the show with Ilana Glazer, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a [expletive]-it mentality of being and owning yourself, and experimenting with yourself,\u201d she said of his appeal. Jacobson and Glazer watched \u201cThe RuPaul Show\u201d when it aired during the 1990s and remembered the fun freakiness of the cast and characters. At the time, Glazer was also watching the sitcom \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d which featured model-looking teenagers; the show made her feel \u201cugly and fat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a relief to change the channel and see Ru dancing and partying in the margins, and making space for his identity. He elbowed his way into the room in such a way that includes so many more people than him, and that representation trickled all the way down to these two little weird Jewish girls.\u201d\n\nI arrived at a Midtown Manhattan convention hall early on a Sunday morning in September to find the new drag economy, the one that Peppermint noted, at work. In 2015, Charles and World of Wonder created RuPaul\u2019s DragCon, a multiday convention about all things drag. Charles had mentioned to me it several times \u2014 he is nothing if not media-savvy \u2014 as the future of his empire and a way to widen the culture of drag beyond a television show and nighttime acts.\n\nTables were laden with items for sale: intricate corsets, leather gloves, beaded jewelry, sequined pasties, gel breastplates and elaborate bouffant-style wigs in every shade of pastel. There were makeup counters and queens giving attendees makeovers. One aisle was marked \u201cbackrolls.\u201d Past winners and former contestants paraded the halls, with everyone holding court in their best looks. Ginger Minj was dressed as Snow White, while Bob the Drag Queen looked like a cute clown in a blue tulle top and yellow party hat. Nearby, a queen named Detox lounged near the kind of bubble pit usually reserved for children at a fast-food restaurant. There were local queens, too, as well as children like Lactatia, a 9-year-old drag queen from Montreal (born Nemis Quinn M\u00e9lan\u00e7on Golden), who strutted the convention floor in an iridescent hologram three-piece suit and a cotton-candy-pink bobbed wig. Peppermint was there, too, resplendent in a sheer polka-dot caftan.\n\nHordes of young people swarmed around the queens, eager to have their photos taken with them. There were long lines of men and women excited to take photographs with Charles, who was holding court in a section reserved for the V.I.P.s who bought special badges. There were people dressed as mermaids, muppets, cartoon characters and ghouls. There was a queen dressed as a sea captain being half-eaten by a shark. The atmosphere was the freakiest I\u2019d ever seen in Midtown during the daylight. I flashed back to a conversation with Charles when he told me about the early days of throwing wild, gender-bending parties in New York. People came out for the simple sake of experimenting. They dressed weird and let loose on the dance floor \u2014 the only place such liberation was possible back then.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point, I spied a pack of children, of indeterminate gender, outfitted in suits and dresses. They could have been dressed for the occasion, or just in their daily wear. Amid of sea of six- and seven-foot queens in stilettos, they stood out, doll-size and adorable. Their cuteness drew gasps and oohs, but I also couldn\u2019t help thinking that we were also captivated by them for another reason: They felt like a glimpse of a future \u2014 and maybe even, someday, the new normal.", "title": "Is \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u2019 the Most Radical Show on TV?", "authors": ["Jenna Wortham"]}

We must not insult people who insult us because of our religion \u2014 and we must always be on our best behavior.\n\nThe truth is, Muslims in America are held to a different standard. If, for example, a husband is seen yelling at his wife in a restaurant, people might think that he\u2019s having a bad day, or he\u2019s just a jerk. But if that same man appears to be a Muslim and his wife is wearing a head scarf, fellow diners might assume that the Quran told him to behave that way.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the burden of being Muslim in America today, even more so when those kinds of ideas are put forward by politicians.

Why wasn\u2019t she getting better? \u201cGo see Cindy,\u201d her daughter said \u2014 Dr. Cindy Mitch-Gomez, her mother\u2019s longtime physician.\n\nUpon returning home to Miami, she went to her doctor. When Dr. Mitch-Gomez saw her patient, she, too, was alarmed. She had lost weight. And she seemed to have lost so much more; she slouched in her chair as if it were too much work to sit up straight. During her routine physical five months earlier, the woman was her normal, lively self. Now she was a skinny, sullen shadow.\n\n\u2193\n\nA Battery of Tests\n\nThe patient explained to Dr. Mitch-Gomez that she had suddenly developed anxiety and depression. She was taking four medications and meeting with a therapist, and still she felt terrible. She gave up her daily morning exercise class because she didn\u2019t want to see anyone. She wasn\u2019t suicidal, but she couldn\u2019t bear feeling like this for the rest of her life.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe was one of the last patients of the day, so Dr. Mitch-Gomez settled in for a full investigation. The patient had a few vague complaints \u2014 she felt nauseated sometimes and occasionally awoke covered in sweat, as if she were going through menopause again. To Dr. Mitch-Gomez, it seemed clear that something beyond depression had to be going on. Although the patient was focused on the psychiatric symptoms, her doctor was worried about the fatigue, nausea, weight loss and sweat. The patient was treated for breast cancer nearly 15 years earlier. Could it have come back and invaded her liver, lungs or brain? It would be unusual after so many years, but not impossible.\n\n\u2193\n\nFinally, a Clue\n\nIf not cancer, what? Hypothyroidism is common in older adults. So is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Each can cause depression. She frequently visited the Northeast; could this be some form of advanced Lyme disease? She sent the patient to the lab for blood tests and ordered a chest X-ray, a scan of her brain and another of her abdomen and pelvis.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The head CT was completely normal. But the scan of the pelvis was not. There was an abnormality around the left ovary and uterus. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a small mass on the ovary. After some testing, a gynecologist recommended removing the ovary and uterus.\n\nThe patient\u2019s partner heard the news before she was even out of the O.R.: It was ovarian cancer, which had spread to a fallopian tube. But the surgeon assured him that they had gotten it all.\n\nThe patient no longer had cancer, but, she was still depressed. Dr. Mitch-Gomez referred her to a psychiatrist who specialized in cancer and depression. She wasn\u2019t sure how the two were related \u2014 but it would be an odd coincidence, she thought, if they weren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2193\n\nThe Depression-Cancer Link\n\nThe patient went to see Dr. M. Beatriz Currier, an expert in the biochemical connection between cancer and depression. Patients with cancer are up to three times as likely to have depression as those without cancer, Dr. Currier told her new patient. It\u2019s not simply that having cancer is depressing. It is that some cancers \u2014 perhaps most of them \u2014 can trigger the body to release chemicals that signal the brain to develop depressive symptoms. It\u2019s a phenomenon first reported in 1931, when Dr. Joseph Yaskin, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, published a case series on four otherwise-healthy middle-aged patients who were initially thought to have a late-onset depression and anxiety and who within months were found to have pancreatic cancer. The depression, Yaskin hypothesized, was a reaction \u201con the part of the central nervous system to the toxic or metabolic changes produced by the progressive visceral condition\u201d \u2014 the cancer.\n\nMore recent research suggests that the body\u2019s response to an injury like that caused by a tumor or an infection is to release messenger chemicals known as cytokines. These messengers communicate with other parts of the body \u2014 the immune system, the brain, the gut \u2014 to trigger a response to that injury. Different messengers elicit different responses, and the cytokines triggered by certain cancers have been found to set off not only a robust immune inflammatory response but also the neurological changes that cause depression. Some researchers hypothesize that the behavioral changes caused by depression and anxiety \u2014 lethargy and avoiding contact with others \u2014 might have provided a survival benefit in the face of infection or injury.\n\nYour body released a flood of cytokines in response to the invasion of abnormal cells, Dr. Currier told her, and these chemicals triggered your brain to become depressed. For the first time in months, the patient felt a flicker of hope. Hearing that she was depressed for a reason somehow made the depression a little easier to bear. With the cancer gone, she asked Dr. Currier, would her depression subside? That\u2019s the theory, Dr. Currier agreed.\n\nAnd it did, slowly, over months. During the last year Dr. Currier has weaned the patient off the psychiatric medications she was taking. She gained back her lost weight. She started going to her exercise class again. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she told me triumphantly \u2014 and it\u2019s all thanks to her doctor, who suspected that what looked like a familiar depression could be something more.", "title": "It Looked Like a Familiar Case of Depression, but Could It Be Something Else?", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}

But discovering the details required questioning dozens of people. Was the testimony of former White House counsel John Dean credible? In May 1974, Senator Lowell P. Weicker, a Republican, answered that question in the affirmative, telling The New York Times that the real question was \u201cthe credibility of the president of the United States.\u201d But even today, the website of the Nixon Foundation features a long, somewhat hyperbolic argument attacking Dean\u2019s \u201ccredibility.\u201d\n\nNow, each seismic cultural event sends information flying around the internet with such force and velocity that no individual could possibly sort through it all.

Just last month, Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, said he had received \u201ccredible evidence, credible information, regarding terrorist infiltration through the Southern border\u201d connected with the shooting. The fact that few news outlets gave this claim any credence is as remarkable as the claim itself: We can now look at a stunning statement from an elected lawmaker, immediately discount its credibility and move casually along.\n\nRight now, lawmakers are doing the same among themselves, batting around claims about a private memo, compiled by the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, containing either shocking revelations about abuses of government surveillance or misleading, politically motivated nonsense.

After all, they had side jobs in college; they ate Ramen noodles. That\u2019s just how it goes.\n\nBut what is happening today is very different. For decades, many students survived on little to afford college. But over time, the situation worsened to the point where now, hunger and homelessness routinely undermine students\u2019 very ability to learn.

If you see a code on your W-2, you\u2019ll be asked to include it on your return. (The code isn\u2019t used for returns filed on paper, according to the I.R.S.) The codes will appear on roughly a quarter of all W-2 forms, the agency said.\n\nHow can I track my tax refund?\n\nThe I.R.S. recommends using its IRS2Go app for smartphones or its online refund tool to check the status of refunds.

They needed dresses and gloves and jewelry. You can\u2019t go out and buy clothes for \u201cStar Wars.\u201d We had a milliner. It was like M.G.M. in the \u201930s. We had hats made, gloves made.

We looked at 1950s muscle cars. The costumes had to be on stuntmen who were fighting very hard. They use weapons and they need to have complete range of motion.

Even the original \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d which didn\u2019t have all the characteristics of a science fiction film, was still totally disregarded. And look what it has become. And with sequels, I think they think it\u2019s already designed. It\u2019s done.\n\nI do find it a bit odd, because when you\u2019re doing a period piece you can do research. You can look at costumes that someone else made. But with the future you\u2019re actually blazing new territory.\n\nWhat was Carrie Fisher like to work with?\n\nShe commented on everything.

{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "Government regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who\u2019s left?\n\nThe same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.\n\nI got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?\n\nBut when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.\n\n\u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.\n\nImagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d\n\nAnother idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.\n\nMr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\n\nApple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).\n\n\u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\n\nThere\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.\n\nDone right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.\n\n\u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.\n\nHe suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.\n\nApple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.\n\nApple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called.

Shikaki, the pollster, told me that Palestinian support for two states is now about 46 percent, down from about 80 percent in the mid-1990s. Still, he said, a two-state solution remains viable. Surveys show that various incentives \u2014 like the release of prisoners for Palestinians, or a wider peace with the Arab world for Israelis \u2014 can quickly shift opinion.\n\nSooner or later, whether in the next several months through an indictment or later through the ballot box, Netanyahu will be gone. It\u2019s idle to think any successor will easily cede territory for peace. Yet it\u2019s possible; it\u2019s happened before. Trump, too, will be gone one day. Abbas could live on for several years, but the damage he is doing the Palestinian cause is such that he should quit now if he is not prepared to organize an election in 2018.\n\nIn the current vacuum, a dream of one state with equal rights for all peoples \u2014 a kind of United States of the Holy Land \u2014 has gained some traction. It is pure, if seductive, illusion \u2014 flimsy code for the destruction of Israel as the national homeland of the Jews. It will not happen.\n\nTrump\u2019s instinct to blow up the status quo is dangerous. So is Abbas\u2019 comfort with that status quo. It corrodes. The threat from Trump to cut off aid could leave millions of Palestinian refugees without access to schools or hospitals. That\u2019s unacceptable. But it\u2019s equally unacceptable that Arab states only contribute about 3.5 percent of the budget of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinians refugees, compared with the American contribution of about 25 percent.

Advisers were concerned that \u201ccoverage of the royals was constantly just going out and opening a supermarket,\u201d Mr. Geffen said, and were looking for ways to focus attention on the more solemn aspects of the monarchy.\n\nVideo\n\nNothing could be as solemn as the coronation, in which the monarch is anointed with oil and is believed to be brought into direct contact with God.\n\nAncient rules surround every aspect of the ceremony. Mr. Geffen was surprised to discover that he was prohibited from filming the two crowns used in the ceremony from above, because that is the vantage point reserved for God.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want you to really stand above them at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realize, the crowns are considered quite sacred, and even filming them is seen as if it could devalue them in some way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Coronation\u201d marks the first time the crown jewels, a collection of regalia used in British coronations, have been filmed, and offers loving, hypnotic footage of crowns rotating slowly on velvet-swathed stands, with resolution so high that you can see motes of dust circulating in the light beams.\n\nVideo\n\nFor decades, Britain\u2019s royal family has measured out media access with teaspoons.\n\nQueen Elizabeth led this approach at the age of 26, siding with palace traditionalists who feared that allowing cameras into her coronation would erode the monarchy\u2019s mystique. The decision provoked such public outrage that she then backpedaled, allowing the BBC to broadcast the early stages of the ceremony, though not her anointing.\n\nIn the years that followed, royal gatekeepers have retained stringent control over broadcasters seeking interviews.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA 15-page contract leaked to The Independent, a daily newspaper, in 2015, laid out an eye-popping list of conditions for interviewing Prince Charles, including the right to preapprove the wording of questions, and to review the film at the \u201crough cut\u201d and \u201cfine cut\u201d stages, with the option to withdraw the interview at any point.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlienating the royal family, meanwhile, has proved damaging to broadcast careers.\n\nIn 2007, a trailer for a BBC documentary was edited, inaccurately, to make it appear that the queen had angrily left a photo session with Annie Leibovitz. (The footage had actually shown her walking into the session.) The corporation waited until the next day to publish a correction, allowing the story to proliferate in tabloids and stoking such resentment that the head of one of the BBC\u2019s TV networks, Peter Fincham, was forced to resign.\n\nA reminder of that hazard came this week, when Rigby & Peller, a bra manufacturer that had designed undergarments for the royal family since 1960, lost its royal warrant, a coveted designation, after its director, in her autobiography, \u201cStorm in a D-Cup,\u201d described interacting with the queen. Buckingham Palace gave no reason for the decision.\n\nFor the most part, Britain\u2019s broadcasters have refrained from pushing back against the palace, which has the power to curtail access altogether, said Valentine Low, who covers the royal family for The Times of London.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe broadcaster is essentially going to play ball,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they have got a massive property on their hands and therefore you have to accede to any palace demands.\u201d\n\nThough \u201cThe Coronation\u201d does not interrogate the monarchy \u2014 indeed, it comes off as a lush advertisement for the institution \u2014 it does capture Queen Elizabeth in revealing, unscripted moments.\n\nIn preparation for the shoot, two crowns were removed from the Tower of London and transported, under secretive conditions, to Buckingham Palace, where the queen is given the chance to examine them. She does so with an unsentimental, appraiser\u2019s eye, as if they were racehorses or hunting dogs, and deems them, with a perfect deadpan, \u201cunwieldy.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look down to read the speech,\u201d she remarks. \u201cBecause if you did, your neck would break.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Geffen, whose previous subjects have included Barack Obama and Saddam Hussein, said he was pleasantly surprised at the queen\u2019s relaxed manner during the shoot, especially when she reached out to touch one of the crowns. According to custom, she is one of three people on earth \u2014 along with the archbishop of Canterbury and the crown jeweler \u2014 who are allowed to touch it, he said.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere during the filming, even for the courtiers looking on, was \u2018Wow, this is the queen we might not have seen before,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone was delighted to see that happen. Because she was quite free-flowing. She wasn\u2019t guarded.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe impression is one of a woman considering her legacy, but Mr. Geffen warned against reading too much into that.\n\n\u201cSome people thought, \u2018Gosh, now that she\u2019s done that, she\u2019s going to resign,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut from what I gathered, from everything in that room and from that day, there was absolutely never an intention of that.\u201d\n\nHe added, though, that the next monarch is almost certain to simplify and shorten the ceremony. Mr. Geffen, whose lineage can be traced to Anne Boleyn, a queen beheaded by her husband, Henry VIII, stopped there, noting jokingly that Tudor-era statutes made it a crime to plan the next coronation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to talk about the next coronation, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s treason.

Soon after a researcher went through a cardboard box left behind in the vacated flat \u2014 and inside, to his astonishment, he discovered a welter of remarkable unpublished materials by the taciturn Nobel laureate. But they were not manuscripts. They were photographs: sheafs of yellowing prints that depicted \u201cscenes from provincial life,\u201d as his three volumes of autobiography are subtitled, as well as undeveloped negatives.\n\nBefore he turned to literature, it turns out, Mr. Coetzee was a committed teenage photographer \u2014 and his black-and-white impressions of his family, his school and daily life on his uncle\u2019s farm are on view for the first time, in an exhibition at the Irma Stern Museum in Cape Town. Mr. Coetzee had never showed the photographs to anyone; he was suspicious, when the exhibition was proposed, whether a writer\u2019s early experiments with the camera had any importance at all. But the images, shot in 1955 and 1956, when the author was 15 and 16 years old, offer a crucial vista onto the formation of an author as restrained in his personal disclosures as in his prose. More than that, they give a new depth to his fiction, which owes as much to the arts of the lens as of the page.", "title": "J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Boyhood, in Black and White", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "\u2014 Mr. Smith, 59, is head of the bank\u2019s consumer and community bank. He oversees 140,000 of the bank\u2019s 240,000 employees. Mr. Smith joined JPMorgan in 2007 from American Express.\n\nThe question now is whether the move positions one of the two to succeed Mr. Dimon as chief executive of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Both Mr. Pinto and Mr. Smith are old enough that it is unclear whether they will be serious contenders for the top job.\n\nIn the press release annoucing their appointments, the bank said Mr. Dimon planned to stay on the job for another five years. That would mean both executives would be in their 60s when Mr. Dimon retired.\n\nBut both men could be prepared to step in if unforeseen events cause Mr. Dimon to leave. There has been, of course, much speculation that Mr. Dimon may run for president. (Mr. Dimon has said he is not running.)\n\nMonday\u2019s moves feel similar to the promotion of Jes Staley to run JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank in 2009. Mr. Staley was close in age to Mr. Dimon, so he was viewed less as a long-term solution to JPMorgan\u2019s succession planning and more an executive who could step in if something happened to Mr. Dimon.\n\nAntonio Weiss is back in the deal business, thanks to Keurig\n\nListed in the phalanx of bankers and lawyers behind the $18.7 billion acquisition of Dr Pepper Snapple is a name that you might easily miss, \u201cAFW LP.\u201d\n\nThat happens to be short for \u201cAntonio Francesco Weiss,\u201d the former Lazard banker and Treasury Department official \u2014 and an adviser to Keurig.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his career at Lazard, Mr. Weiss became one of the investment bank\u2019s biggest deal makers, eventually becoming the firm\u2019s global head of investment banking after having done tours of duty in New York and Paris.\n\nAmong the deals he worked on were InBev\u2019s acquisition of Anheuser Busch, Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of fellow cigarette maker Lorillard, Burger King\u2019s takeover of Tim Hortons and Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola Mobility. (He was also publisher of The Paris Review.)\n\nDuring his career, he came to know the executives who run JAB, which is Keurig\u2019s majorityshareholder, and sold the company D.E. Master Blenders, the international coffee business then owned by Mondelez. JAB later combined D.E. Master Blenders with Keurig in a nearly $14 billion deal.\n\nBut Mr. Weiss left Lazard to become a counselor at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, taking on issues like Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis and the marketplace lending practiced by the likes of Lending Club.\n\nSince leaving government, Mr. Weiss has taken up residence as a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rhamani Center for Business and Government at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, as well as a directorship at the Volcker Alliance. (He\u2019s also a prolific op-ed and briefing writer.)\n\nHe has weighed whether to get back into investment banking, and has been courted by many an investment bank. It\u2019s unclear whether he will ultimately join an existing shop or start his own, as rain makers like Paul Taubman have done.\n\nThe other advisers on the deal\n\nFor Keurig Green Mountain:\n\n\u2022 Goldman Sachs, BDT & Company (which is also investing in the deal), Mr. Weiss, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firms Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and McDermott, Will & Emery\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan, Bank of America and Goldman are also providing financing for the deal. (The combined company is expected to have some $16.6 billion in debt if the deal closes, though it also anticipates keeping an investment-grade credit rating.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Dr Pepper Snapple\n\n\u2022 Credit Suisse and the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\n\nFor Mondelez\n\n\u2022 The law firm Clifford Chance\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of an I.P.O.?\n\nCompanies want to go public. They just want to avoid the initial public offering process.\n\nThat\u2019s at least one take away from Monday morning\u2019s deal news.\n\nExhibit #1: Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s $18.7 billion deal for Dr Pepper Snapple Group.\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed transaction, Keurig, which was taken private in 2016 by JAB Holding, would merge with Dr Pepper Snapple. The deal would create a new company to be called Keurig Dr Pepper, which would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Keurig\u2019s current shareholders would own about 87 percent of the combined company, with Dr Pepper Snapple investors owning the remainder.\n\nExhibit #2: Speculation that Dell could merge with VMware through so-called reverse merger.\n\nAlex Sherman of CNBC reports:\n\nDell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter. The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing.\n\nThe news comes as Spotify is planning to hit the public markets through a so-called direct listing. Such listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. That would be bad news for Wall Street since direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.\n\nSpoofing.\n\nA small provision in the Dodd-Frank Act outlawing something called \u201cspoofing\u201d has generated the latest round of criminal charges against eight traders along with civil settlements by Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and UBS. All for doing something that happens every second of the trading day: entering and then canceling orders.\n\nThe law makes it illegal to engage in \u201cbidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the first criminal conviction for spoofing last year in United States v. Coscia, in which the judges rejected the argument that no one was deceived by orders placed and then quickly canceled because other traders do that routinely. \u201cHis scheme was deceitful because, at the time he placed the large orders, he intended to cancel the orders.\u201d\n\nApparently, the only requirement to prove spoofing is that the defendant enters orders without any real hope they will be filled to pull the market in one direction so that other orders can be filled, generating a small profit. Proving the case requires showing multiple orders were used and not just isolated transactions, such as one defendant who engaged in what the government claims was 36,000 different instances of spoofing.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be a case involving traders if there weren\u2019t the usual messages showing how they were gladly abusing the market. In one chat, a trader wrote \u201cso glad I could help . . . got that up 2 bucks . . . that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it.\u201d Describing something as manipulation sure does help prove intent.\n\nWho is fooled by the spoofing? It turns out that most of the time it is competing computer algorithms of other high-frequency trading firms. So this isn\u2019t a case in which mom-and-pop investors are taking it on the chin.\n\n\u2014 Peter J. Henning\n\nPhoto\n\nThe activists pushing Avon to sell itself\n\nMeet Shah Capital, Barington Capital Group and NuOrion Partners, who together own about 3.5 percent of the cosmetics maker and today publicly called upon the company to consider selling itself.\n\nBarington and NuOrion were behind a previous campaign to force out Avon\u2019s C.E.O., Sherilyn McCoy. Ms. McCoy has already announced plans to step down.\n\nFrom the hedge funds\u2019 letter:\n\nThe shareholder group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current board. The shareholder group is also dismayed by the Board\u2019s failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer \u2013 a step that has been long overdue and members of the shareholder group recommended over two years ago.\n\nThe context\n\nAvon is just over two years removed from an agreement to spin off its North American business into a privately held company that was majority-owned by Cerberus Capital Management. After the sale, Avon announced a three-year strategic plan to focus on its remaining operations outside the U.S. and reduce costs.\n\nAvon reported $12.5 million in profit for its third fiscal quarter, after previously reporting three consecutive quarterly losses. The company is set to report its fourth quarter results next month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Chad Bray\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Steve Wynn\n\nIn the wake of a WSJ investigation into allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, the casino magnate\u2019s empire has already taken a hit. He has also resigned as the Republican National Committee\u2019s finance chairman.\n\nBut more pain is probably in store for Mr. Wynn, whom the veteran reporter Jon Ralston calls \u201cthe biggest name in the history of Nevada business.\u201d\n\nThe corporate fallout\n\nThe Wynn board \u2014 long criticized as too cozy with its chairman \u2014 has already said that it will form an independent investigating committee.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of what will happen to Mr. Wynn\u2019s casinos, particularly in Macau, which accounts for the vast majority of Wynn Resorts\u2019 revenue.\n\nMore from Daniela Wei and Bruce Einhorn of Bloomberg:\n\nAny fallout from the allegations could have a major impact on Macau. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are looking into the accusations, and punitive actions in the U.S. could prompt Macau regulators to ramp up their scrutiny, said Wang Changbin, director of the Gaming Teaching and Research Centre at the Macau Polytechnic Institute.\n\nWhether Mr. Wynn will be ousted \u2014 for a second time \u2014 is unclear. He owns 21 percent of Wynn Resorts, but has no extra voting power.\n\nThe political fallout\n\nLawmakers are starting to distance themselves, with House Speaker Paul Ryan donating $1,000 he had received from a Wynn affiliate to charity. \u201cWe were in the dark for 24 hours,\u201d one unnamed R.N.C. member fumed to Robert Costa of the WaPo.\n\nMr. Wynn wasn\u2019t among the top 100 political donors in the 2016 election cycle. But President Trump chose him as the R.N.C.\u2019s finance chair, and he hosted a fund-raiser for the president at Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 20.\n\nMore misconduct news\n\n\u2022 Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, fired his chief of staff this weekend over inappropriate relations with lower-level employees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Investment funds are piling into the settlement-advance industry, in which firms pay plaintiffs in anticipation of a big court victory.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow did Trump do at Davos?\n\nAndrew\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cAll week, Davos-goers worried that he was going to try to humiliate and verbally attack them. He did the opposite. He stayed on script and made a compelling argument for investment in the U.S. C.E.O.s from around the world wanted selfies with him.\u201d\n\nPer Daniel Yergin of IHS Markit:\n\n\u201cHe was selling America, he was selling the economic story and he was selling himself to an international business community who expected something else.\u201d\n\nAnd Ishmael Sunga of the Southern Africa Confederation of Agricultural Unions:\n\n\u201cHe made no controversial statements. He was talking to the crowd of people that he\u2019s been brought up to be part of.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s speech, largely written by Gary Cohn and the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, was both a defense of the White House\u2019s nationalist policies and a case for international cooperation, on U.S. terms. (\u201cAmerica first does not mean America alone.\u201d)\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhile Mr. Trump sought to play down any isolationist tendencies \u2014 and the director general of the World Trade Organization said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything at this point that we are in a trade war\u201d \u2014 China was still in his sights.\n\nA headline from The South China Morning Post: \u201cChina should \u2018be ready for a trade war\u2019 after Donald Trump\u2019s Davos speech.\u201d\n\n(To many attendees, China remained the real star of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum.)\n\nA bit of color: Many C.E.O.s left Davos before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nAlso, this happened: Andrew was pelted with a snowball by Steven Mnuchin.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow would nationalizing 5G work?\n\nDepends what we\u2019re talking about. Axios reported that the White House has considered creating a centralized, national 5G network for national security reasons, citing a National Security Council memo.\n\nMore from Jonathan Swan, David McCabe, Ina Fried and Kim Hart of Axios:\n\nThe memo argues that a strong 5G network is needed in order to create a secure pathway for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and virtual reality \u2014 and to combat Chinese threats to America\u2019s economic and cyber security. A PowerPoint slide says the play is the digital counter to China\u2019s One Belt One Road Initiative meant to spread its influence beyond its borders.\n\nBloomberg, citing its own sources, paints a slightly different picture: \u201cThe U.S. is in talks with private companies to build a secure 5G network amid concerns about China and cybersecurity.\u201d The decision deadline is the end of September.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and others have already spent billions of dollars on 5G networks. Given its speed and data capacity, it remains their biggest initiative, and it\u2019s unclear how much control, if any, they would be willing to give up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAny nationalization effort would run counter to how the government has handled wireless infrastructure for decades: by auctioning off the airwaves and letting private companies do the work.\n\nFrom AT&T\u2019s statement on the issue:\n\n\u201cThanks to multibillion-dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201d\n\nThe policy flyaround\n\n\u2022 Republican lawmakers warned Mr. Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, but showed little interest in a bill to protect him.

We\u2019re into a global aesthetic here, and anyone that doesn\u2019t see that has a real old-fashioned way of thinking.\u201d\n\nThat curious and all-embracing spirit led him to create works on subjects as diverse as quantum physics and the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. It also led him to experiment with different ways to use paint, and even occasionally to try other art forms. In April the Baltimore Museum of Art is scheduled to open an exhibition featuring 40 sculptures he made, beginning in 1963.\n\nMr. Whitten was born on Dec. 5, 1939, in Bessemer, Ala., near Birmingham. His father, Mose, was a coal miner who died when Jack was young. His mother, Annie B. Cunningham, was a seamstress and, as Mr. Whitten put it in a 1994 interview with Bomb magazine, \u201ca believer in education\u201d; she later opened a private kindergarten.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Whitten attended Tuskegee University in Alabama and briefly met the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957 when Mr. Whitten went to hear him speak in Birmingham. After he transferred to Southern University in Louisiana, he said, he joined student civil rights protests, trying to practice Dr. King\u2019s precepts of nonviolence, but a march on the state Capitol was a personal turning point.\n\n\u201cWe made it all the way to the state Capitol building as they were hitting us with sticks,\u201d he told the arts journal The Brooklyn Rail in an interview last year. \u201cI did it then, but I made a vow I would never put myself in that position again. That march is what drove me out of the South. I took a Greyhound bus to New York City.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe studied art at the Cooper Union from 1960 to 1964, falling in with the Abstract Expressionists of the day. Willem de Kooning was a particular influence and mentor.\n\n\u201cI came in one night after a horrific critique when one of my professors put me down for concentrating too much on process,\u201d Mr. Whitten recalled in a 2013 interview with The Boston Globe. \u201cThat was not a word used much then, in 1961. He said I accepted too many accidents. I spoke to de Kooning, and he said to me, \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as accidents in painting!\u2019 That was very helpful to me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the 1960s advanced, Mr. Whitten began venturing into different ways to paint, trying to avoid the pop trends of the decade.\n\n\u201cAnybody with any sense from my generation who was serious about painting by the late \u201960s had to realize that the psychedelic was a perpetual dog chasing its tail,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Brooklyn Rail. \u201cAnd in our way, we had to invent our way of making paintings.\u201d\n\nHe became interested in process art, which espouses the idea that the making of a work is as vital as the end product. In 1970, he and three other artists received grants from the Xerox Corporation, which invited them to experiment with its equipment and work with its engineers.\n\nAnd Mr. Whitten moved beyond the paintbrush, creating art by dragging paint across a canvas with a squeegee, an Afro comb or a large rakelike tool he had made. He began to attract attention.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Whitten does is to rake across a richly prepared paint substance with a 12-foot-wide instrument of his own devising,\u201d John Russell wrote in The New York Times in 1974, describing an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. \u201cIt is, as he says himself, a gambling situation, and sometimes the gamble doesn\u2019t come off; but in the best pictures the immediacy is captured intact.\u201d\n\nOver the years Mr. Whitten worked in paint so heavily layered that he could, and did, cut slices out of it. He made a sort of tile from paint compounds, applying the result to canvas for a mosaic effect. On the Greek island of Crete, where he spent many summers, he began making the sculptures that will be the focus of the Baltimore exhibition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Whitten sometimes responded to the events of the day with artwork.

Why he went on asking me to interpret the songs that I had inspired I don\u2019t know \u2014 but perhaps he knew that I\u2019d be faithful at least to that.\n\nThe idea of taking the songs \u2014 which are so rooted in different styles, from pop to chanson to y\u00e9-y\u00e9 to reggae \u2014 and making them orchestral sounds counterintuitive. But I understand classical music was important to him. How so?\n\nA lot of the songs he wrote, not only for me but for others, were from classical music. So \u201cJane B.\u201d was Chopin.\n\nWhenever he wanted to give us something really beautiful, he sometimes wrote it on classical music \u2014 perhaps out of a sort of modesty, of always being so admiring of classical work that somehow he wanted to give us the best. From his pianist days \u2014 he was a pianist at a bar in Le Touquet [a seaside town in northern France], and his father was a classical musician \u2014 it was from his upbringing that he knew so much about classical music. Brahms was \u201cBaby Alone in Babylone.\u201d\n\nDid he listen to much classical music?\n\nHe did when his mother died. He had bouts of wanting to be sad, and then he would put on classical music. Glenn Gould he always had under his elbow. And he had, on his little table, a picture of Chopin, and Chopin\u2019s hand.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs it harder or simpler to sing songs that were written for you, that must bring up so many memories?\n\nWhen he first gave them to me, they were personal \u2014 and then I was not necessarily the best receiver. I sometimes thought that he had a hidden message. And, actually, when I listen to the words now, they\u2019re even more beautiful than I understood then. Many sad things have happened now, like Kate [one of her daughters, who died in 2013].

Was that strange?\n\nNo, no \u2014 I didn\u2019t want anybody else to sing it! Serge rang me up years after that and he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got some bad news for you.\u201d And I said: \u201cWhat?

When the Fed began in October to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it purchased as part of its post-crisis stimulus campaign, it announced a multiyear timetable that it said would remain unchanged barring emergencies.\n\nThe Fed has made clear that the January meeting will be a place holder, not least because of the transition in leadership, and markets have taken the message.

Like the proverbial frog in the stovetop pot, investors found it easy to ignore the slow and steady increases.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the Fed, wary of surprising markets, has once again fallen into a pattern of carefully signaling each rate hike \u2014 and markets, once again, are largely unconcerned.

A coalition of labor and community groups, the Fed Up campaign, pressed Ms. Yellen throughout her term to increase the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign. Republicans and conservative economists fretted that the Fed was doing too much.\n\nChris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, said that the persistence of low interest rates had been painful for banks and other financial firms, many of which also resented Ms. Yellen\u2019s focus on strengthening financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye, good luck from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s don\u2019t let the door hit you on the backside on your way out.\u201d\n\nEleanor Herlands, a 92-year-old retiree in Stamford, Conn., said that she and other savers had suffered during the long years of low interest rates.\n\n\u201cThey pushed people to buy stocks, people that knew nothing about the stock market,\u201d said Mrs. Herlands, who opted instead to keep her money in savings accounts. \u201cI made my own choices, but I never dreamed that it would go on this long.

Not today. For three nights in January, the pianist Ray Angry and the vibraphonist Warren Wolf took over the Blue Note, inviting a sundry crew of collaborators to participate in what they called the \u201cJazz-ageddon\u201d series, and the result was a multihued patchwork.\n\nMr. Angry and Mr. Wolf come from opposite ends of the same general spectrum. Mr. Angry has been a first-call pianist for pop acts like John Legend and Joss Stone, but his big influences are jazz and gospel. Mr. Wolf is a vibraphonist who\u2019s most often heard in acoustic combos, playing straight-ahead jazz and its offshoots. On Jan. 22, they were joined by seven other musicians, including the saxophonists Tia Fuller and James Carter, the bassist Ben Williams and the drummer Marcus Gilmore.\n\nThe music included \u201cThe Community Theme Song,\u201d a samba-inflected tune by the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon with a gently lingering melody; David Bowie\u2019s \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d; and a surprise cameo from Black Thought of the Roots, who rapped a casually prodigious freestyle over the beat from Nas\u2019s \u201cOne Love,\u201d played by Mr. Wolf, Mr. Williams and Mr. Gilmore.\n\nThere was just one moment when the musicians fell into a crisp, midtempo swing feel, and it was on a song you wouldn\u2019t expect: \u201cMy First Mine,\u201d an early-90s garage-rock scorcher from the indie-rock band Pavement.\n\nWarren Wolf returns to New York March 6-10, playing a run at Birdland with the Cyrus Chestnut Quartet.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

After her friend, the Indonesian shadow puppeteer Sri Joko Raharjo, died in a car accident with his wife and infant child, only his 4-year-old daughter survived. With her in mind, Ms. Shyu set about culling folkloric tales from traditions across East and Southeast Asia, and created her own syncretic saga for the present day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe work is more than conceptual inquiry or personal discovery. At the Jazz Gallery, Ms. Shyu turned the stage into a space of imaginative ritual; she framed storytelling and mythmaking as contemporary phenomena \u2014 even necessities. She opened the performance by leading the room in a stretching exercise, then explained the story of the crash in a somber but welcoming tone. Standing by the piano, she explained how the collision had occurred, almost acting as if the instrument were the vehicle.\n\nMany minutes later, after a song of cold, raging grief \u2014 Ms. Shyu singing in a blustery howl, clawing at the strings of the Japanese biwa \u2014 she wandered back toward the piano. Eventually it became clear that she was simply retrieving an instrument perched along the wall, but for a moment my breath stopped. The piano still seemed to represent the scene of the crash, and it felt as if she were re-entering a space of peril. That magic remained throughout the set: A simple jazz club stage became a territory of belief, narrative and wonder.\n\nJen Shyu\u2019s \u201cSong of Silver Geese\u201d was released in November on Pi Recordings.

Leading a standard sax-piano-bass-drums quartet, Mr. Richardson played eight original tunes, each one tumbling out with a sense of bold disassembly. Their sections were hard to define; the band swelled and crested without settling into closely knit patterns. Often, polyrhythms were implied, and then the band quickly started to play outside and around them. The group sometimes shambled into a free-flowing rubato right in the middle of a fast tune, but it maintained conviction, and avoided melodrama.\n\nBut there was a kind of rich cohesion here, even though you only really felt it in retrospect. Partly that\u2019s because of the confidence and strength brought by Mr. Richardson\u2019s band mates: John Escreet on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Kenny Grohowski on drums. They rendered each individual note with stark, upstanding force, holding firm amid the swarm.\n\nAnd as a saxophone soloist, Mr. Richardson went in every direction but the one you expected; he played arcing, bluesy, honeydew phrases without submitting to clich\u00e9. He\u2019s fond of soul-inflected grace notes, but he always articulates them thickly and cleanly, rolling into and out of them. In his hands, every warm gesture is a forceful statement.\n\nLogan Richardson\u2019s \u201cShift\u201d was released in 2016 on Blue Note Records.\n\nA Large Ensemble With an Expansive Palette\n\nJOHN HOLLENBECK\u2019S LARGE ENSEMBLE Le Poisson Rouge, Jan. 30\n\nPhoto\n\nWe\u2019re about 70 years into the eerie afterlife of the jazz big band.

With this 19-piece group (20 including its conductor, J.C. Sanford), he pulls from the annals of that big-band afterlife: Gil Evans\u2019s work with Miles Davis in the 1950s; Bob Brookmeyer\u2019s slyly locomotive arrangements of the 1970s and \u201980s; the lush, tangled vibrancy of Guillermo Klein\u2019s music from the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe John Hollenbeck Large Ensemble\u2019s CD release performance began with \u201cElf\u201d \u2014 an extended composition based around \u201cIsfahan,\u201d the deliquescent Billy Strayhorn ballad \u2014 and ended on a bridling, crosshatched rendition of Kraftwerk\u2019s \u201cThe Model.\u201d In between were four Hollenbeck originals, all from the new album, each one doused in citrusy, corrugated harmonies, with currents that built big circles around crescent-shaped melodies. The record\u2019s title track was a highlight, with the vocalist Theo Bleckmann singing lyrics drawn from messages that the trumpeter Laurie Frink had written to Mr. Hollenbeck soon before her death in 2013. The trumpet section played a bobbing, elliptical pattern based upon Ms. Frink\u2019s instructional exercises, and Mr. Bleckmann sang in a gentle, matter-of-fact tone: \u201cI will miss you all, and especially the music.\u201d\n\nJohn Hollenbeck\u2019s Large Ensemble just released \u201cAll Can Work\u201d on New Amsterdam Records.", "title": "January in Live Jazz: 5 Standout Shows", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"]}

But nothing is stopping Mr. Sessions in the meantime from accepting scientific facts.\n\nThe new policy is also blind to the massive cultural shift toward legalization that has been happening at the state level in recent years, after decades of outrageously harsh punishments that have fallen disproportionately on the shoulders of people of color. Eight states have now legalized marijuana for recreational use. California is now the world\u2019s largest legal market for pot.

In 2013, when the payroll dropped to $93 million, Fred Wilpon, a Mets\u2019 owner and their chief executive officer, said the team would spend money when it became competitive again.\n\nThat began midway through the 2015 season, when the Mets traded for several players, including Cespedes, and eventually reached the World Series behind a talented group of young and inexpensive starting pitchers that included Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Steven Matz. But injuries and underperformance led to a disappointing 2017 season with a 70-92 record during which the Mets traded away several veteran players, and the team does not appear to have any desire to dig deeply into its wallet soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather look at what we can do in terms of wins and losses,\u201d Jeff Wilpon said. \u201cBeing top five in payroll, I don\u2019t think that won us a World Series.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings \u201cwill keep her secret.\u201d\n\nThe last chapter, \u201cLegacies,\u201d ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society.

In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.\n\nAnd:\n\nWrit large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.\n\nThe context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nTension at the top of Airbnb\n\nThe home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.\n\nIn one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.\n\nThe context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore from Cory Weinberg of The Information:\n\nMr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.\n\nWhy it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nWas there fraud at KPMG?\n\nThe charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nThe indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?\n\nFraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.\n\nIn the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.\n\nOne way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.\n\nA statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.\n\nIs that a fraud?\n\n\u2014 Peter J.

Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.\n\nBut Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.\n\nHere\u2019s what Mr. Musk told Andrew:\n\n\u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)\n\nTrivia: California law requires that Tesla pay Mr. Musk minimum wage, even though he doesn\u2019t want a salary.

In 2016, a group of computer scientists compared acceptance rates for code written by women and men on the code repository GitHub. It found that developers accepted nearly 72 percent of code written by women when they did not know their gender. When it was revealed that women had written the code, acceptance rates fell to 62 percent.

The family fled Germany in 1939 and settled in New York City.\n\nBut Joseph had club feet and needed corrective surgery. His parents\u2019 marriage was deteriorating, as was his father\u2019s health. His father died of kidney failure on the day of one of Joe\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo when I came home, my mother lied to me and told me that my father had gone to Boston on business,\u201d he told Slate in an interview conducted last summer and published after he died. \u201cI was five and a half.\u201d\n\nAfter his mother remarried, he took his stepfather\u2019s surname.\n\n\u201cI think he was plagued by themes of inadequacy and insecurity, and a search for meaning that began in his childhood,\u201d Jennifer Ferro, the general manager of KCRW, said in a phone interview.\n\nHe attended Hofstra University on Long Island \u2014 he said he cheated on the entrance exam \u2014 and spent two years at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop but did not get a degree.

He also received a kidney transplant and had scoliosis.\n\nHe taught English and Russian literature and philosophy for 10 years at Dalton, a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and then promoted musical acts in Massachusetts.

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "The photo of the Hartwig House is the first photograph Meyerowitz made with an 8-by-10-inch view camera. Certain small stylistic adjustments are expected when subject matter shifts, and for photographers, this is a difference often heralded by a change of camera. With a tripod and much larger negative, the \u201caction\u201d in the picture is now all in the thoughtfulness and calm description, the warm light that suffuses everything, the unfailing verticals of the doors and walls.\n\nSusan Sontag once noted that \u201cseeing tends to accommodate to photographs.\u201d Once the thrill of originality fades, we are often left with the merely picturesque. A landscape by Edward Weston is absorbing; a landscape in the style of Weston less so. Diane Arbus revolutionized portraiture, but her numerous imitators cannot command our interest to the same degree.\n\nThe renovation of photography\u2019s possibilities happens generationally. But within this slow evolution are faster cycles, certain artists who keep it moving so that their individual oeuvres come to constitute minihistories of photography: artists like Paul Strand, Berenice Abbott and Joel Meyerowitz.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. Some communication has happened between the young woman in blue and the photographer. In the swirl of the party, she had, like him, been moving, evidence of which is captured in the photograph: one leg is placed in front of another. But she read the photographer\u2019s eyes, which had pleaded with her to hold her pose, and for the duration of time that the camera\u2019s aperture is open, she does hold still. There\u2019s a second woman, on the left, who also meets the photographer\u2019s glance and is also still, but her look is blurred. The woman in blue, centrally placed, standing in contrapposto next to a tree, direct and crisp in her gaze, becomes the story.\n\nMeyerowitz does something unusual with the view camera here: He uses its slowness, its difficulty with moving subjects, as an asset. He has become interested not only in the descriptive power of the large camera but in the technical limits of what it can do. \u201cCocktail Party, Wellfleet, Massachusetts, 1977\u201d is related to the photograph of the Truro interior both in its format and in the emphasis on verticals. But the light-filled house is suspended in time like an afternoon in which the clocks have stopped, and there\u2019s nothing to prove that it\u2019s not a photo from 1987 or 1997 or yesterday. The party, meanwhile, is quite obviously of that moment, that fraction of a second it took for the image of the young woman and the blur around her to be registered. We may wonder where all those people are now, more than 40 years on.\n\nPhoto\n\n4. \u201cFive More Found, New York City, 2001\u201d brings to mind Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cNight Watch\u201d or one of those complex tableaux by Jacques-Louis David. The setting and its drama \u2014 a drama of vertiginous darkness and theatrical lighting \u2014 emphasize the environment more than the numerous small-scaled people present. The image, made as part of Meyerowitz\u2019s \u201cAftermath: World Trade Center Archive,\u201d which he began working on in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, records a particularly sad moment: The \u201cfive more found\u201d are firefighters, dead in the rubble.\n\nIt is a photograph that, like many others in the project, approaches the sublime. But I find more to admire than to love in it. It is straightforward in form, stately in appearance, awesome in subject but ultimately dutiful in effect. But perhaps this isn\u2019t entirely regrettable. The very last thing you want in a photograph of the ruins of the World Trade Center is some obnoxious individuality.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn reading artists, we ought to focus more on what they intend than on the stylistic gestures that help us identify their works. Meyerowitz is certainly stylish \u2014 there is always a formal clarity in his work \u2014 but he can\u2019t be pinned down to two or three styles. His oeuvre is as varied as any among contemporary photographic masters, but this is not a matter of restlessness. The variety is organically related to whatever he is exploring at any given point. He changes because he must.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. A gray skull sits on a gray table with a gray wall as the backdrop. There is no supporting cast and there are no special lights, just the object itself, set down, more interesting for what it means than for how it looks.\n\nWe can never really see our own faces as they are seen by others. Even mirrors, photographs and videos place us at a certain distance from our own faces. And harder to see is the skull behind the face; an X-ray is at best an approximation. You would have to be dead to really see your own skull, an inescapable paradox.\n\nThis skull was photographed by Meyerowitz in Aix-en-Provence. The photograph is in fact half of a diptych titled \u201cC\u00e9zanne\u2019s Studio (Skull and Void), 2013.\u201d We don\u2019t know the name of the human being whose macabre fate was to become a prop in an artist\u2019s studio. The skull is most likely one of three that C\u00e9zanne painted several times. The attraction of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s studio for Meyerowitz lies in part in the flattening effect of those gray walls. Photographing the individual objects in natural light against that wall, he explores some of the plainness of setting that may have helped C\u00e9zanne intensify his proto-cubist approach to still life.\n\nWhat a tremendous stylistic gulf there is between this skull and the photograph of the New York City camel coats from 1975. Here, simplicity reigns. The complications are pared down and the jokes and puzzles are dropped, as are the grand visions. This is a quiet world, but not the sweet quiet of the Hartwig House, in which human presence is at least implied. The skull and its accompanying void inhabit a more abstract reality, a statement stripped of all superfluity.\n\nJoel Meyerowitz, nearly 80 now, must, from time to time, give thought to mortality. But the vision in his recent pictures (he has also made a series about objects in the studio of the painter Giorgio Morandi) is dispassionate, not tragic. Certain pictures are easy to make but hard to see. A skull, a table, a wall: In this latest of his numerous styles, Meyerowitz moves from what it means to look to what it means to have looked. The skull on one side of the diptych suggests it, and the void on the other leaves no doubt.", "title": "Joel Meyerowitz\u2019s Career Is a Minihistory of Photography", "authors": ["Teju Cole", "On Photography"]}

He had enough conscience to believe that there is moral truth, worth dying for. But he had enough humility to understand that none of us can ever fully know that truth, because it cannot be reduced to a single thing.\n\nHe championed the egalitarian belief that the best society allows maximum space for each member to craft his own life, but he had the civilized belief that there are clear distinctions between honor and dishonor, excellence and laziness.\n\nHis example cures us from the weakness of our age \u2014 the belief that we can achieve democracy on the cheap; the belief that all we have to do to fulfill our democratic duties is be nice, vote occasionally and have opinions. Mill showed that real citizenship is a life-transforming vocation. It involves, at base, cultivating the ability to discern good from evil, developing the intellectual virtues required to separate the rigorous from the sloppy, living an adventurous life so that you are rooting yourself among and serving those who are completely unlike yourself.\n\nThe demands of democracy are clear \u2014 the elevation and transformation of your very self.

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "In 1970, when he was 36, Mr. Tunney ran for the Senate. He was blessed with a weak Republican opponent, the one-term incumbent George Murphy, a former actor and song-and-dance man whose age \u2014 he was in his late 60s \u2014 and health were issues. Mr. Murphy was also hurt by the revelation that while a senator he had been paid $20,000 a year as a public relations consultant for a movie company.\n\nMr. Tunney\u2019s victory margin in 1970 was bigger than that of Ronald Reagan, who was re-elected California governor that year. Soon, Mr. Tunney was being mentioned as a possible running mate of Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, who seemed to have the inside track for the Democratic nomination to run against President Richard M. Nixon in 1972. But Mr. Muskie\u2019s campaign flamed out early in 1972.\n\nThat summer, Robert Redford starred in \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d a film based on Mr. Tunney\u2019s 1970 campaign, and the senator still appeared to have a bright future.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1974, the independent California Poll showed him to be more popular than Mr. Reagan, then in his last year as governor. In 1975, Mr. Tunney led a successful fight in the Senate to cut off funds for covert military operations by pro-American rebels in Angola. Mr. Tunney and like-minded lawmakers feared that involvement in Angola could lead to a Vietnam-like quagmire in Africa.\n\nBut many liberal Democrats were disenchanted with him. They thought he had been too slow to turn against the Vietnam War, which he had supported early on, and they were disappointed by his refusal to embrace a boycott of California grapes by striking farm workers.\n\nLiberals found a champion in Tom Hayden, the former campus radical, who challenged Mr. Tunney in the 1976 Senate Democratic primary. Mr. Hayden raised a lot of money and was a surprisingly effective campaigner, accusing Mr. Tunney of being beholden to big business, though Mr. Tunney had supported antitrust legislation as a senator.\n\nMr. Hayden also sought to turn Mr. Tunney\u2019s friendship with Senator Edward M. Kennedy against him, calling Mr. Tunney \u201ca Chappaquiddick waiting to happen,\u201d a reference to the 1969 incident in which the political aide Mary Jo Kopechne died when the car in which she was riding, driven by Mr. Kennedy, plunged off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hayden later apologized for the remark. But after finishing a strong second in the June primary, Mr. Hayden offered only the most tepid support for Mr. Tunney in the general election. And the Kennedy allusion, fair or not, fanned complaints that Mr. Tunney preferred the companionship of elite Easterners over the company of Californians.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Tunney was a transplanted Californian, having had a privileged childhood in the East. His father, the former heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney, read widely and aspired to social status to go with his ring riches. He achieved it in 1928, when he married Polly Lauder, an heiress to the Carnegie steel fortune.\n\nJohn Varick Tunney was born on June 26, 1934, in New York City. He grew up in Connecticut with his brothers, Jay and Gene, who is deceased, and a sister, Joan, who is also deceased. He studied anthropology at Yale, graduating in 1956. He attended the Hague Academy of International Law, worked on John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1958 Senate campaign in Massachusetts and roomed with Edward Kennedy at the University of Virginia Law School, graduating in 1959.\n\nJohn Tunney later admitted to a certain immaturity and lack of purpose until, around the time he was in law school, he said, \u201cI suddenly became aware of the fact that this world was cold and cruel, and that people were indeed very, very hungry.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe practiced law briefly in New York City, then joined the Air Force as a judge advocate and was stationed near Riverside, Calif. He remained in California after leaving the service.\n\nSix feet three inches tall and fit in his prime, John Tunney was often described as handsome (although his bulging eyes and prominent teeth had saddled him with the nickname \u201cHorse\u201d in prep school). He was a far more imposing physical presence than his 1976 opponent, Dr. Hayakawa, who stood about 5-foot-5 and often sported a tam-o\u2019-shanter.\n\nBut Dr. Hayakawa, a world-renowned semanticist, had a priceless moment in the spotlight from his past. In 1968, when he was president of San Francisco State College, he climbed onto a sound truck used by student protesters and yanked out the wires to the microphones. Long afterward, the image resonated with Californians fed up with campus unrest.\n\nOn Nov. 2, 1976, Dr. Hayakawa received about 3.7 million votes to just under 3.5 million for Mr. Tunney, even though Democrats far outnumbered Republicans in California. Dr. Hayakawa was aided by a strong showing by President Gerald R. Ford, who carried California in his loss to Jimmy Carter. The numbers also suggested that some former supporters of Tom Hayden had voted for Dr. Hayakawa just to spite Mr. Tunney. (Dr. Hayakawa retired after one term.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen you get into public life, you\u2019ve got to be prepared to take your knocks,\u201d Mr. Tunney said after his defeat.\n\nAfter leaving office, he practiced law, served on corporate boards and was active in civic and cultural affairs. He enjoyed skiing, fly-fishing, biking, hiking and travel with his wife, the former Kathinka Osborne, who had been an Olympic skier from Sweden.\n\nIn addition to his brother Jay, he is survived by his wife; their daughter, Tara; his sons, Mark and Edward; a daughter, Arianne, from his first marriage, to Mieke Sprengers, which ended in divorce; a stepson, Cedric Osborne; a stepdaughter, Dariane Hunt; and three grandchildren.\n\nMr. Tunney seemed content to view politics from afar after 1976, although he did appear at a 1980 Los Angeles fund-raiser for his old friend Edward Kennedy in Mr. Kennedy\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid that year. In 2003, Mr. Tunney joined two former Senate Democrats, George S. McGovern and Fred Harris, in opposing the war in Iraq.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Tunney had homes in Sun Valley, Idaho; New York City; and Los Angeles.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Tunney said he had good memories about his days in Washington, and he lamented the later \u201chostile\u201d atmosphere he saw there. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling what\u2019s happening in Congress,\u201d he said, \u201cthat these men and women who are elected to get things done are not even able to get to the point of an up-or-down vote.\u201d", "title": "John V.

Twenty years ago, a federal judge in Manhattan issued a similar opinion, accusing the Law Department of \u201ca cavalier attitude\u201d toward discovery requests and saying that it treated them with the \u201clowest priority.\u201d The judge in that case, John S.

Judge Pollak\u2019s decision strikes that note, saying that the Law Department\u2019s serial excuses and delays had Ms. Martinez\u2019s lawyers \u201cchasing their tail.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of the case, her chief lawyer, Gabriel Harvis, tried to get the city to give him the names of the officers who had questioned her, a process that took seven months and four court orders. Yet even when he got the first two names \u2014 Lt. Jason Weitzman and Sgt. Jason Forgione \u2014 both men claimed that they had nothing to do with Ms. Martinez.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs discovery continued, however, \u201cit became apparent,\u201d Judge Pollak wrote, \u201cthat despite all of their efforts\u201d Ms. Martinez and her lawyers \u201chad not been given the full story.\u201d First, Mr. Harvis learned that the city had not turned over Sergeant Forgione\u2019s entire personnel file, which was missing records about a previous abuse complaint, the decision said. Then he learned that the city had not disclosed detective reports about the heroin deal that led to Ms. Martinez\u2019s arrest. When Mr. Harvis got those reports \u2014 after more delays and orders \u2014 they showed that she was not the dealer. Ms. Martinez, a housekeeper, wasn\u2019t even there.\n\nIt was then, in November, nearly two years after the lawsuit had been filed, that Judge Pollak held a hearing and asked the city\u2019s lawyer, Paul H. Johnson, why it took so long for the reports to be produced. \u201cI do not know,\u201d Mr. Johnson told her. \u201cThe client produced these documents, not me. I wasn\u2019t the one, like, searching for them.\u201d\n\nBut the worst was still to come, Judge Pollak wrote. One month later, the city committed what she called its \u201cmost critical failure\u201d \u2014 one that, as she put it, \u201ccast a completely different light on what may have occurred.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 18, a new city lawyer \u2014 Mr. Johnson was replaced \u2014 suddenly provided Mr. Harvis with more than 1,000 pages from three police investigations of his client\u2019s claims. The inquiries not only cast doubt on the officers\u2019 contention that Ms. Martinez had hurt her hand while punching the wall of her cell, the decision said; they were also never mentioned by anyone, including the 11 officers who had been through depositions.\n\n\u201cNone of them came forward with information about this incident or the investigations for almost two years,\u201d Judge Pollak wrote. \u201cThis suggests either a failure to conduct even the most superficial investigation by counsel or, of deeper concern, that counsel was deliberately not informed due to a cover-up perpetrated by the N.Y.P.D.\u201d", "title": "Judge Blasts City for Delays in Queens Police Abuse Case", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

But it could not detain them for immigration violations while continuing to pursue their criminal prosecutions, she said.\n\nThe first case, decided in November, concerned a Dominican man, Saba Rosario Ventura, who arrived in New York from Santo Domingo on April 7 with a green card that had expired the previous day. When border agents at Kennedy Airport determined that Mr. Ventura had been deported once before for an immigration violation, they took him into custody.\n\nIn August, he was indicted in Brooklyn on immigration charges and released on bail within two weeks with his case still pending.

Although he was granted bail in November and was supposed to be released, he was arrested on an immigration detainer and taken to the Hudson County jail.\n\nIn court papers, Mr. Lett\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Gelernt, said that she spoke in December with the Customs and Border Protection agent who arrested her client and claims the agent told her that detaining immigrants who had already been freed on bail marked a change in policy.\n\n\u201cThe agent verified that, under previous policy, arriving aliens who were charged with federal crimes and released on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act, were routinely released after a brief detention at JFK,\u201d Ms. Gelernt wrote. \u201cThe CBP agent further informed defense counsel that, as a result of a recent executive order, CBP was now instructed to request \u2018bed space\u2019 in an immigration detention facility for arriving aliens charged with federal crimes, but released on bond.\u201d\n\nTeddy Camlen, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection in New York, said the authority to use detainers in bail situations was not new, but was being newly enforced.\n\n\u201cThese are charges that could possibly get people deported and we don\u2019t want them out walking on the street,\u201d Mr. Camlen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of the detainer.\u201d", "title": "Judge Faults U.S. for Holding Immigrant Defendants Freed on Bail", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

Helios helped Russia secure the 2014 Winter Olympics and the coming 2018 World Cup, before its acquisition in 2012 by the Amaury Group, a French media company.\n\nAmerican prosecutors are also specifically interested in Eugene\u2019s successful bid for the track and field event, which the U.S.O.C. actively supported, and Doha\u2019s successful effort to host the 2019 edition of that competition, which occurs every two years.\n\nAbroad, the same competitions have drawn intense scrutiny. France\u2019s national financial prosecutor\u2019s office has been investigating the track and field governing body and its choices of Eugene and Doha. Track and field\u2019s world governing body gave the 2021 event to Eugene without a bidding process.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "Too often, this is the case. The fine for a misdemeanor is typically about $1,000, which can be unmanageable for a low-income person. This comes on top of many other costs. The application fee a defendant must pay to hire a public defender (appointed because a person charged with a crime cannot afford to pay for an attorney) can be as high as $400. Jail booking fees range from $10 to $100. In some states, defendants can be made to pay fees upward of $200 for the juries who hear their cases. After conviction, victim\u2019s panel classes, where some defendants are mandated to hear about victims\u2019 experiences and loss, can cost up to $75. Drug courts can and often do make people pay for their own assessment, treatment and frequent drug testing.\n\nThis system shifts the costs of our criminal justice system to the people processed by the system. Juvenile, traffic, misdemeanor and felony courts all rely on monetary sanctions. Fines, court-user fees, surcharges, assessments, interest, collection and per-payment fees fund everything from local law enforcement departments to county jails. Even some municipal services not connected to law enforcement, like campaign elections, are paid for by fines and fees imposed on citizens convicted of \u2014 or simply accused of \u2014 breaking the law.\n\nThese people are paying for the system of justice from which we all benefit, but they cannot afford to do so. They are often poor, unemployed and of color. In research on monetary sanctions in nine states, my research team and I found that many people have trouble navigating the legal process associated with fines and fees, like finding out how much money they owe and meeting minimum payment requirements. Of the 380 people we interviewed, over half received public assistance and a vast majority had problems paying their legal debt. Many people with court debt suffered added consequences related to their indigence \u2014 like difficulty meeting other financial obligations, and mental and physical ailments. They also had to answer to the court for their nonpayment.\n\nFines for drug offenses, in particular, can have long-term consequences for people who are unable to pay. In many jurisdictions, if a person cannot pay a court-imposed fine, probation is lengthened, warrants are issued and he or she can even be jailed for nonpayment. The burden is piled on, as interest, surcharges and collection fees are added to unpaid court costs.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. While prosecutors do not directly fine defendants, they have discretion when it comes to which fines and fees they recommend to judges. New prosecutors who are serious about making progressive changes should be aware that alternatives to incarceration like diversion programs and classes and treatment come at a cost \u2014 literally.\n\nThey can reform the justice system without adding the financial burden of fees and classes that defendants must pay for. They should instead search for ways to reduce criminal justice budgets by prioritizing preventive measures proved to decrease recidivism and improve public safety such as free drug and alcohol treatment programs, low-cost housing, restorative justice and job training. To start, lower courts should rely on day fines, where monetary sanctions are determined based on a person\u2019s daily wage and the seriousness of the offense. The sanction is proportionate to a person\u2019s ability to pay and the degree of harm inflicted. Jurisdictions could reduce justice-related budgets by restructuring drug-sentencing laws to match public opinion and revise the use of mandatory minimum, long-term and life sentences.", "title": "Opinion | Justice Shouldn\u2019t Come With a $250 Fine", "authors": []}

Originally from Berlin, her family had been evacuated to Grieze, in eastern Germany, during the first years of World War II.\n\nMs. von Aroldingen told an interviewer in 1997 that her father, a scientist, had gone to a meeting in Czechoslovakia toward the end of the war and never returned.\n\nAfter the war, her mother moved with her three daughters to what by then was West Berlin, where Karin studied ballet as a child.\n\nAt 17, she joined the Frankfurt Opera Ballet, where her Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 teacher, Tatjana Gsovsky, choreographed a new version of Kurt Weill\u2019s \u201cSeven Deadly Sins.\u201d (It was originally choreographed by Balanchine in 1933.) She cast Ms. von Aroldingen as the dancing double to Lotte Lenya, who had the major singing role.\n\nMs. Lenya soon wrote a letter to Balanchine recommending Ms. von Aroldingen, who auditioned for him in 1962 in Hamburg, where he was staging an opera. The audition went badly by Ms. Von Aroldingen\u2019s account, but two months later she was invited to join City Ballet\u2019s corps in New York.\n\nShe was promoted to soloist in 1967 and to principal dancer in 1972. By that time she had danced a large variety of roles.\n\nJerome Robbins cast her only once in a premiere, the 1971 \u201cGoldberg Variations,\u201d in which she and Peter Martins performed an eccentric puppetlike duet. But over the years she also appeared in Frederick Ashton\u2019s \u201cIlluminations\u201d and Antony Tudor\u2019s \u201cDim Lustre.\u201d\n\nMs. von Aroldingen gave viewers a new look at familiar roles. In Balanchine\u2019s \u201cProdigal Son,\u201d her Siren was not aloof but a cruel temptress who threatened to devour Mikhail Baryshnikov methodically with every acrobatic embrace.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInitially, for some in the audience, Ms. von Aroldingen was a dancer outside the City Ballet fold. Her broad-shouldered physique and muscular legs \u2014 traditional among European dancers but no longer so at City Ballet \u2014 made her controversial. Yet she retrained her body and her style, taking classes at the School of American Ballet.\n\n\u201cIt took me years to unwind myself, to be good,\u201d she once said.\n\nThat Balanchine had spotted her potential was obvious: He created 18 roles for her. Along the way she married Morton Gewirtz, a real estate broker and architectural consultant. He died in 2011.\n\nIn addition to their daughter, Margo, Ms. von Aroldingen is survived by two grandsons and a sister, Elga Weininger.\n\nAs Balanchine, who was divorced four times, grew older in the 1970s, he began to spend more time with Ms. von Aroldingen and her husband, even becoming Margo\u2019s godfather. Ms. von Aroldingen and her husband had a home on Long Island, in Southampton, and Balanchine acquired a condominium nearby. They celebrated and cooked together for Russian Christmas and Easter.\n\nMany who knew Balanchine said that Ms. von Aroldingen had provided him with a family, and that she had played a major role in caring for him in his final illness, a progressive neurological disorder. He died in a Manhattan hospital.\n\nWhile Balanchine insisted that music was the springboard for his ballets, he often captured a dancer\u2019s personality in unexpected ways. The Karin von Aroldingen who athletically executed a rotating backbend in a tension-filled duet with Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux in the model Balanchine leotard ballet, \u201cStravinsky Violin Concerto,\u201d was also the passionate, elusive feminine ideal in \u201cTchaikovsky Suite No. 3\u201d and the equally elusive aristocrat in \u201cVienna Waltzes.\u201d\n\nThe tenderness audiences sensed in these roles burst into the open in \u201cRobert Schumann\u2019s \u2018Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze,\u2019 \u201d the most emotional of Balanchine\u2019s rare neo-Romantic works. Ms. von Aroldingen was cast as the unnamed woman representing Clara Schumann, who, with warmth and caresses, finally bids her husband a poignant farewell.\n\nBalanchine did not tell her whom she was depicting when he was choreographing the ballet, she said. In keeping with his general approach to dancers, he told her: \u201cI can tell you certain things, but in the end, it\u2019s you who has to do it.

Local sheriffs and senators and governors are calling deaths in the mountains \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and demanding more signs, \u201cbetter\u201d trails and other intrusions.\n\nSo far, the argument for preserving the \u201cwilderness experience\u201d has kept these changes at bay. But if the Forest Service (or national parks) assume greater risk for visitor safety, they will be forced to institute a range of solutions to reduce their liability \u2014 like apps that guide us along virtual routes or keep us on trail as though we were in car lanes, or other \u201csoft\u201d intrusions.\n\nOf course, if American policymakers and citizens conflate urban and wild space \u2014 as the French have already done on Mont Blanc \u2014 we will see more and more lawsuits against the Forest Service, or another agency, for failing to protect individuals when they are in a natural setting.\n\nAround the country, parks are getting sued for wild animal attacks on visitors within their boundaries, for falling trees or for not warning visitors for the most obvious of risks, such as rivers flooding during storms. These cases indicate a population out of touch with natural danger. If this trend continues, the mountains will have undergone as radical a transformation as they did in the 18th century, when they morphed from ominous landscapes of gloom to topographies of heroic conquest.\n\nThe origins of mountain climbing lay in the middle of the 19th century. Before that, they were seen as landscapes of evil otherness, where the tempestuous gods exercised their wrath. The curious ventured not.\n\nAfter the 1850s, climbing became for some a way to \u201covercome the self\u201d or \u201cexperience the sublime.\u201d As townspeople and shepherds found their way to the tops of the Alps, the ability to thwart death and overcome human limitation in mountainous landscapes became valued \u2014 but that value assumed an environment of risk. A hero needs adversity, and the extreme conditions and danger of the mountains provided that. Later, in the middle of the 20th century, the literature of the golden era of big Himalayan climbing lionized first ascensionists because they, like great generals or explorers, navigated risk successfully.\n\nMountains are inherently dangerous. But just as free speech makes a place for disgusting speech, wild places need to make a place for irresponsible activity. It is our life, after all. Right? Not really.

In Leila Slimani\u2019s unnerving cautionary tale, THE PERFECT NANNY (Penguin, paper, $16), subtly translated by Sam Taylor, we know from the outset that it\u2019s a beloved and trusted nanny who murders the two children in her care. That\u2019s pretty radical for a domestic thriller; but what\u2019s more remarkable about this unconventional novel (which was awarded France\u2019s prestigious Prix Goncourt) is the author\u2019s intimate analysis of the special relationship between a mother and a nanny.\n\nMyriam and Paul, the Parisian couple who hire Louise to help care for their son and daughter, are delighted to discover that she\u2019s \u201ca miracle worker\u201d who cleans, reorganizes the household and even cooks delicious meals. \u201cNothing rots, nothing expires\u201d in Louise\u2019s kitchen. At first, they bask in their unexpected comfort, \u201clike spoiled children, like purring cats.\u201d Much too late, Myriam realizes that the new nanny may not be entirely benevolent: \u201cShe is Vishnu, the nurturing divinity, jealous and protective.\u201d But already Louise \u201chas embedded herself so deeply in their lives that it now seems impossible to remove her.\u201d Despite Myriam\u2019s fears, Louise has no intention of replacing her as the woman of the house; rather, in her pathological loneliness, the nanny increasingly fantasizes that she has become a de facto member of the family.\n\nSlimani writes devastatingly perceptive character studies. Dropping their children at day care, the mothers are \u201crushed and sad,\u201d the children \u201clittle tyrants.\u201d She also raises painful questions. Could Myriam be projecting onto her nanny her own forbidden desire to be free of her children and their insatiable needs? (\u201cThey\u2019re eating me alive,\u201d she thinks.) Is there an element of racial prejudice in the Moroccan-born Myriam\u2019s attitude toward her French nanny? Is Louise\u2019s pitiless act the transference of her forbidden feelings about her privileged employer? One thing is clear: Loneliness can drive you crazy, and extreme loneliness can make you homicidal.\n\n\u2666\n\nThe intense thrills of Thomas Perry\u2019s THE BOMB MAKER (Mysterious Press, $26) are almost unbearable. After sweating through a scene in which a member of the Los Angeles Police Department Bomb Squad narrowly escapes a lethal explosion, we\u2019re knocked back by the loss of 14 team technicians \u2014 half the squad \u2014 who are blown to smithereens. \u201cBombs were acts of murder,\u201d Perry writes, but \u201cthey were also jokes on you, riddles the bomber hoped were too tough for you.\u201d", "title": "Keep Watch Over Your Children: Danger Lurks Everywhere", "authors": []}

So, why aren\u2019t we heeding these signs? It might be simple denial.\n\nInattentional blindness is a problem\n\nSome 75 percent of Americans believe their smartphone usage doesn\u2019t impact their ability to pay attention in a group setting, according to the Pew Research Center, and about a third of Americans believe that using phones in social settings actually contributes to the conversation.\n\nBut does it?\n\nEtiquette experts and social scientists are adamantly united: Nope.\n\nThat \u201calways-on\u201d behavior that smartphones contribute to causes us to remove ourselves from our reality, experts said. And aside from the health consequences, if we\u2019re head down, our communication skills and manners are slumped, too. But, ironically, that might not be how most of us see ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe think somehow that this antisocial behavior is not going to affect me,\u201d said Niobe Way, professor of applied psychology at New York University.\n\nMs. Way studies technology\u2019s role in shaping adolescent development. These head-down interactions take us away from the present, no matter what group we\u2019re in, she said. And it\u2019s not just a youth problem. It\u2019s ingrained, learned, copied and repeated, much of it from mimicking adults. When kids see their parents head down, they emulate that action. The result is a loss of nonverbal cues, which can stunt development.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening more and more is we\u2019re not talking to our children,\u201d Ms. Way said. \u201cWe put them in front of the tech when they\u2019re young, and when we\u2019re older, we\u2019re absorbed in our own tech.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve seen it: Think of how some parents deal with screaming toddlers. \u201cHere kid, take this iPhone and go to town,\u201d according to Ms. Way \u2014 not, \u201cLet\u2019s talk this out, what seems to be the problem, son?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe added: \u201cWe think, \u2018Somehow my kids will know what\u2019s a good and bad interaction, they\u2019ll have empathy.\u2019 But when I go upstairs into my son\u2019s room and seven teens are all looking at their phones, none of them saying a word, there\u2019s all sorts of disengagement happening. It\u2019s not Facebook that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s how we\u2019re using Facebook.\u201d\n\nAll ages are affected\n\nA study in 2010 found that adolescents ages 8 to 18 spent more than 7.5 hours a day consuming media. Since then, our digital addictions have continued to, in some ways, define our lives: In 2015, the Pew Research Center reported that 24 percent of teenagers are \u201calmost constantly\u201d online.\n\nAdults aren\u2019t any better: Most adults spend 10 hours a day or more consuming electronic media, according to a Nielsen\u2019s Total Audience Report from last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

One out of four accidents in the United States are caused by texting and talking on the phone while driving.\n\n\u201cMobile devices are the mother of inattentional blindness,\u201d said Henry Alford, the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That: A Modern Guide to Manners.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the state of monomaniacal obliviousness that overcomes you when you\u2019re absorbed in an activity to the exclusion of everything else.\u201d\n\nThe social scientist Sherry Turkle analyzed 30 years of family interactions in her book \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d She found that children now compete with their parents\u2019 devices for attention, resulting in a generation afraid of the spontaneity of a phone call or face-to-face interaction. Eye contact now seems to be optional, Dr. Turkle suggests, and sensory overload can often mean our feelings are constantly anesthetized.\n\nResearchers at the University of Michigan claim empathy levels have plummeted while narcissism is skyrocketing, with emotional development, confidence and health all affected when we tuck our chins in and let our heads hang like human ostriches.\n\nFacebook\u2019s former president, Sean Parker, recently said the platform was designed to be addictive and to \u201cconsume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible,\u201d which he characterized as boosting our self-esteem, ever-present in the dopamine hit of likes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt probably interferes with productivity in weird ways.

How many people are really there with you?\n\n\u201cActual human beings, in the flesh, take precedence,\u201d Ms. Martin chided. \u201cTo ignore people you\u2019re with is rude, whether you ignore them for virtual friends or distant friends by snubbing them.\u201d\n\nIt sounds so obvious it almost borders on stupid. But like Dr. Turkle\u2019s hope of building dialogue, not denigrating the digerati, it\u2019s an obvious dialogue we\u2019re not having enough of.\n\nMr. Alford, who used to write a monthly manners column for The New York Times, described the issue as a \u201cmonomaniacal obliviousness\u201d of being absorbed in an activity to the exclusion of the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cTo treat the person standing in front of you as secondary to your phone, is usually, as the kids say, a micro-aggression,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Silicon Valley pundits go to war when anyone so much as suggests that tech\u2019s merits aren\u2019t uniformly positive.

Etiquette, manners, body language, the way we respond, interact and even look is changing. We\u2019re missing a whole life happening a mere 90 degrees above our smartphones.

Despite the fact that Mr. Ala\u00efa was 82, he had not exactly strategized for the future, and there had never really been any discussions of formal succession.\n\n\u201cHe thought he was eternal,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. But while not focused on the mechanics of the house, he was \u201cvery concerned with legacy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo that end, he and his partner, the painter Christoph von Weyhe, created the Azzedine Ala\u00efa Association in 2007, a nonprofit that will be administered by Ms. Sozzani, Olivier Saillard (the former director of the Palais Galliera, one of Paris\u2019s two fashion museums), and Mr. von Weyhe. That took place at the same time that a majority stake in the company was being sold to Richemont.\n\n\u201cWe were reorganizing his life, and he wanted to protect his work and archives,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. According to Mr. von Weyhe, Mr. Ala\u00efa set aside enough money to endow the association, which is in the process of applying for more formal foundation status.\n\nMr. Ala\u00efa had been saving his own work since the 1980s, and he has been collecting the work of designers he admired for even longer, including pieces from Charles James, Paul Poiret, Vionnet, Chanel, Madame Gr\u00e8s and many others. Neither Ms. Sozzani nor Mr. Saillard could venture a guess as to how many pieces there were, but together they occupied five floors and approximately 14,760 square feet in Mr. Ala\u00efa\u2019s compound on rue de la Verrerie. To create more room there, a portion of the archive is being moved to a building near rue de la R\u00e9publique, which has an additional 9,840 square feet.\n\n\u201cI never saw such archives in my life,\u201d said Mr. Saillard, who is effectively the association\u2019s curator. \u201cHe has the most important private collection devoted to the history of fashion. For 20 years I used to see him at auctions, and we curators were all very jealous because he always bought the masterpiece we wanted, and he always refused to show them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just clothes. Mr. Ala\u00efa collected furniture from designers including Pierre Paulin, Jean Prouv\u00e9, Shiro Kuramata and Marc Newson, as well as books. It is the clothes, however, and the patterns, fabrics, buttons and sketches \u2014 the record of his creative process \u2014 that will form the basis of the continuing life of the house.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

The message is not about looking back but rather, Mr. Saillard said, \u201cthe timelessness of his work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a leather dress there from the 1980s and you could wear it today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Prouv\u00e9: The chair is as great today as it ever was. The dress is as perfect.\u201d\n\nDaniella Vitale, the chief executive of Barneys New York, where Ala\u00efa is among the top 10 brands, said that it remained committed to the brand. Last year, she pointed out, Ala\u00efa created a special collection of pieces from the archives to celebrate his 35 years with the store, pieces that \u201chadn\u2019t been seen for a long time, and they all sold very well.\u201d\n\nThe staff of the house is intact, and in many ways it is functioning much as it did before. Everyone still eats together every day in the kitchen. There is, Mr. von Weyhe said, a \u201cfeeling of solidarity.\u201d Mr. Saillard\u2019s word is \u201cmission.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe difference is where they work. When Mr. Ala\u00efa died, his friends closed the door to his personal studio, as well as his apartment on the floor above, to preserve it exactly as he left it, down to \u201cthe last glass he touched,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said. His designers and assistants migrated across the courtyard to other sample rooms and ateliers.\n\nThe idea, she said, is that at some point they will open both floors to the public, and they will become a museum of sorts. (Mr. Ala\u00efa, who rarely left his studio and was famous for working through the night, slept in a Prouv\u00e9 glass gas station that he had installed in his apartment, and he had a vertical garden in his bathroom.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis staff and colleagues are also creating a bookstore, which will be housed in the former sale shop of the house, with books on Mr. Ala\u00efa, the designers he loved and catalogs from the exhibitions he hosted in his gallery, including shows on the Syrian poet Adonis and the British artist Richard Wentworth.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want money or glory, but he wanted his work and the work of designers he admired to be available to the next generation,\u201d Ms. Sozzani said.\n\nThe main floor of the headquarters will remain a working store. Ms. Goldman said she expects the response to the clothes to be as robust as ever. \u201cWe will definitely continue to buy it, and we will definitely continue to sell it,\u201d she said. None of the brand\u2019s plans for growth are being put off. A store will open in London in late March or April, and a major retrospective at the Design Museum there in May.\n\n\u201cThere are only a few designers who create a strong enough foundation for a brand to pull this off,\u201d Ms. Vitale said.\n\nIf Mr. Ala\u00efa\u2019s partners succeed, their story will not only be the classic one about writing a new chapter, but also perhaps the most effective riposte to the frenetic musical chairs of fashion the industry has seen yet.", "title": "Keeping Ala\u00efa Alive: A Designer Died, but His Brand Did Not", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"]}

If it means quoting Shakespeare or Goethe, do it.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was more partial to the lingo of his native rural South.\n\nMr. Jackson\u2019s \u201cWhoa, Nellie!\u201d punctuating an exciting play was his best-remembered good ol\u2019 boy touch, though he maintained that he didn\u2019t use it all that often.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said he had a mule named Pearl while growing up on a Georgia farm but attributed the expression to his great-grandfather Jefferson Davis Robison, who evidently plowed many a field holding the reins of a mule.\n\n\u201cHe was a farmer and he was a whistler,\u201d Mr. Jackson told The Los Angeles Times in 2013. \u201cHe loved two phrases: \u2018Dad gummit\u2019 and the other was \u2018Whoa Nellie.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Jackson informally christened the University of Michigan\u2019s cavernous stadium at Ann Arbor \u201cthe Big House\u201d; he relished broadcasting the Rose Bowl game, \u201cthe granddaddy of \u2019em all\u201d; and he admired the enormous linemen, who were \u201cthe Big Uglies in the trenches.\u201d\n\nKeith Max Jackson was born on Oct. 18, 1928, in the western Georgia town of Roopville, and he grew up nearby, just outside Carrollton.\n\nHe joined the Marines as a teenager, then attended Washington State University in Pullman, Wash., receiving a degree in broadcast journalism in 1954. He spent 10 years at the ABC affiliate KOMO in Seattle in news, sports and production, became sports director of ABC Radio West, then began broadcasting college football for ABC Sports in 1966.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen ABC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d was introduced by Roone Arledge in 1970, Mr. Jackson was named the play-by-play broadcaster to work alongside Howard Cosell and Don Meredith, but a year later Mr. Arledge replaced him with a glamorous name, the former Giants star Frank Gifford.\n\nMr. Jackson returned to broadcasting college football and teamed with Bill Russell on N.B.A. games.\n\nMr. Jackson was considered well prepared and accurate, but amid the plaudits he was also remembered for a tumultuous moment\u2019s action that he missed.\n\nIt happened at the December 1978 Gator Bowl game between Ohio State and Clemson.\n\nWith about two minutes remaining and Clemson leading, 17-15, a Tigers player, Charlie Bauman, intercepted a pass and went out of bounds in front of the Ohio State bench. Woody Hayes, the Buckeyes\u2019 coach and one of college football\u2019s biggest names, slugged him. An ABC camera showed the blow, but neither Mr. Jackson nor his color commentator, Ara Parseghian, were looking at the monitor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nABC showed a replay, but it was from a different camera angle and did not capture the punch. Mr. Jackson signed off at the game\u2019s end, Clemson having run out the clock, without reporting on the punch, which was seen by millions on television. Ohio State fired Hayes the next day.\n\nMr. Jackson, who lived in Southern California, had planned to retire after the 1998 season, but changed his mind when ABC suggested that he concentrate on Pacific 10 games so he could remain close to home.\n\nHe continued with a largely regional schedule, then retired after broadcasting the 2006 Rose Bowl game.\n\nMr. Jackson is survived by his wife, Turi Ann; his children Melanie Ann, Lindsey and Christopher; and three grandchildren.\n\nMr. Jackson shunned controversy in his college football broadcasts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1999. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing. When ABC spends half a billion dollars on something, I\u2019m not going to rip and tear it apart.\u201d\n\nHe prided himself on being concise and was loath to steal the spotlight from the players.\n\n\u201cThis is not my stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stage belongs to the athletes and coaches who play the game.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe book also skates deep into hockey history: Underlying Montador\u2019s story is Dryden\u2019s comprehensive view of how the game has failed to adapt to its own evolution in pace, equipment and tactics. For Dryden, it all comes down to this: Now is the time for hockey to eliminate hits to the head, and the N.H.L.\u2019s commissioner, Gary Bettman, is the only person who can make that happen. Dryden has called it a test \u2014 for himself, for Bettman, for hockey. And so, in September, Dryden traveled from his home in Toronto to New York to carry that message, along with his book, to Bettman. They met for lunch.\n\nDryden sat down in Toronto in December to talk about \u201cGame Change\u201d and his vision for hockey. The interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow did that meeting with Bettman go?\n\nIt was a good lunch. We\u2019ve known each other for a long time. We\u2019ve worked together. We each know how the other thinks, and does things. I introduced it as a serious book about a serious subject, and the next few months will be a challenge for both of us. But a worthwhile challenge. I just told him about what was in the book. I told him that he was the first person to receive a final copy of the book. He said he would read it.\n\nI came away feeling that he would. And that he would think about it very hard.\n\nWhy was Steve Montador\u2019s story the right one to build your book around?\n\nI wanted to write about somebody who was an Everyman player. I didn\u2019t want somebody who was a superstar, who was unique and not relatable. And I didn\u2019t want somebody who was a fighter and a goon, for the same reason. I wanted somebody who, when people read about Steve, they would see themselves, see their kids. Coaches would see their players. He was somebody a lot like them. And whose experience was a lot like theirs. He was somebody who was not dismissible.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about what you\u2019re trying to say in your title: not just that the game needs to change, but how it has been changing, always, and keeps changing. Is that why you think this is all so eminently doable?\n\nIt\u2019s one change that\u2019s needed: No hits to the head. No excuses.\n\nAt the core of the problem of brain injuries is hits to the head. So you focus your attention there. The increased speed of the game generates more collisions and more forceful collisions. It\u2019s not hard to see how this happens.\n\nYou can think about dealing with it as a revolutionary change, or you can think about it as an incremental and really evolutionary change. Right from the beginning of hockey, we\u2019ve recognized the danger of hits to the head. We created high-sticking penalties. We created the elbowing penalty.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve come to understand better, with the force and the frequency of the collisions now, is that the dangerous instrument is not the stick or the elbow, it\u2019s the body as a whole. So you don\u2019t call a penalty for a stick or an elbow and not call one for a shoulder or a fist. It\u2019s not the cause, it\u2019s the effect. It\u2019s not whether it\u2019s intentional or accidental. The brain doesn\u2019t distinguish. The brain is affected similarly. So you think of it in those terms, and you approach it in those terms. You connect it to the very set of understandings that is already in place, and to the penalties that are already in place. You just extend them to the changed circumstances of the game.\n\nAs you point out, Bettman never played the game. But he is surrounded in the N.H.L. head office by plenty of smart, committed people who did play. Why haven\u2019t they recognized the problems you\u2019re identifying. What\u2019s kept them from urging the changes you\u2019re advocating?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey haven\u2019t played this game. We know what we\u2019ve learned, we know what we\u2019ve heard, and we tend to then apply both, as if everything else were constant. The myth and lore of a game like hockey are very difficult to undo and rewrite. And whether it\u2019s in hockey, sports or climate change \u2014 anything \u2014 we all have a certain set of understandings. We\u2019re comfortable with them. We always believed in them, and believed deeply.\n\nBut it\u2019s a question of going beyond what you know to what there is to see. We\u2019ve stopped seeing what is there. We notice the speed of the game, we notice the frequency and the severity of the head injuries, but we haven\u2019t quite made the connection that then generates the response that\u2019s needed. There\u2019s this gap that is almost always present in terms of decision-making.\n\nTo get somewhere and change circumstances, you have to undo a set of understandings that are already in place. All we need to do is just see, see the game that\u2019s there on the ice. And it\u2019s a game that\u2019s played with far greater skill than was the case in the past. Players are faster. They\u2019re using lighter sticks, which become precision instruments in their hands, so they\u2019re developing a dexterity that in turn pushes their creative minds.\n\nAnd in the game now, the idea is not to go in straight lines: You go to open ice, wherever open ice is, and so the pass is more important than the rush. All of a sudden, you\u2019ve got this incredible freedom, this possibility. The excitement with which people talk about Connor McDavid and Auston Matthews \u2014 that\u2019s how they play. That is the game that has emerged, and it\u2019s the game that\u2019s being developed and understood by 10-year-olds and 12-year-olds everywhere in the world.\n\nYou\u2019ve been traveling with the book, talking about it across Canada. Do you get the sense that parents and coaches and the people who run minor hockey have an appetite for change? Is it coming from the bottom up, too?\n\nYes. But a bottom-up movement is not going to change things as much or as quickly as needs to happen. But what it means to that decision-maker at the top is important: He can feel a kind of confidence that, in fact, a decision that he would make about hits to the head would be understood and accepted. The conditions are present.\n\nYou haven\u2019t heard back from the commissioner yet. Not to doubt or prejudge him, but what if he doesn\u2019t see what you\u2019re seeing as quickly as you would hope? Does the challenge \u2014 and your campaign for change \u2014 simply continue?\n\nSomething that\u2019s been so powerful for me on my book tour has been talking to the hockey guys, the sports guys on the all-sports radio stations: A lot of them are thinking in these directions. This is not a matter of starting at zero and trying to argue or persuade your way to 100; they\u2019re already at 60 or 70. They see the problem. And so do people in the game I\u2019ve been hearing from.\n\nSo all of this just kind of builds. That\u2019s not unimportant. It will be moving forward, a little faster or a little slower. Five years from now, the game will be extremely different. How much in advance of that the change happens is really up to Gary Bettman.", "title": "Ken Dryden Says Change Can\u2019t Wait: End N.H.L.

Selling this sweeping overhaul as a means to lift Kentuckians out of poverty is misleading.\n\nRepublicans count the 1996 federal welfare law, which required recipients to work, a success.

{"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "text": "Financial literacy courses are more widely available but still not a routine part of general education.\n\n\u201cIf these topics are taught at all in primary education, they certainly aren\u2019t addressed consistently or in an evidence-based way,\u201d said Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago who was a co-author of a book on basic financial education. \u201cBut singling out the Medicaid population for classes as a condition for access to insurance suggests that shrinking and stigmatizing the program, not literacy, is the goal.\u201d\n\nNumerous studies document the widespread need for greater health and financial literacy. By one estimate, one-third of adults have health literacy deficits. For example, most people make errors in selecting health plans and don\u2019t know basic features of the plans they choose.\n\nThe last large national survey of U.S. adult literacy (including health literacy) was conducted in 2003. One study found that 60 percent of Medicaid enrollees had only \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201cbelow basic\u201d health literacy, meaning, for example, they could not recognize a medical appointment on a hospital appointment form (below basic) or would have trouble understanding why a specific test was recommended for someone with certain symptoms, even when given a clearly written and accurate explanation (basic).\n\nBut Medicaid enrollees are not the only ones. Nearly the same proportion of Medicare enrollees also had basic or below basic health literacy. Privately insured people scored better. They are typically younger than Medicare enrollees, and they typically have higher education levels and are less likely to have cognitive impairments than those with public coverage. However, only a small minority even of the privately insured had a \u201cproficient\u201d level of health literacy \u2014 meaning, for example, that they could deduce the employee share of health insurance costs from a table that listed that cost as a function of income and family size.\n\nAnother study, based on data collected in 2013, showed adults\u2019 blood test results alongside the normal range (typical of reports many of us receive from our doctors after blood tests). Only about half of the subjects could recognize if the blood glucose level indicated on the test was outside the normal range. Of those with diabetes \u2014 to whom blood glucose measurement and levels should be familiar given the importance to their condition \u2014 only 56 percent could identify out-of-range values.\n\nPoor health literacy is associated with worse health care outcomes and higher health care spending. But causality could run both ways. It is likely that people in greater need of health care are also less likely to have high literacy skills in general. It\u2019s also possible that poor health literacy contributes to worse self-management of health and lifestyle issues that could result in worsening health and increased health care use.", "title": "Kentucky\u2019s New Idea for Medicaid Access: Pass Health Literacy Course", "authors": []}

Here\u2019s what Wall Street analysts are expecting, courtesy of FactSet.\n\n\u2022 Analysts expect companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index to report profits rose 10.5 percent from a year ago, according to FactSet.\n\n\u2022 All 11 sectors are forecast to report earnings growth.\n\n\u2022 The index\u2019s energy companies are expected to show the biggest jump, up 132 percent. That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector\u2019s profits have been rebounding.\n\n\u2022 If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings.\n\n\u2022 Sales are forecast to grow 6.7 percent.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nHow many rate increases next year?\n\nMost Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs\u2019s Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four.\n\nThe market, meanwhile, has priced in only two. The Fed, though, could surprise investors to the upside, writes Christopher Beddor of Breakingviews.\n\n\u201cDecember\u2019s relatively weak jobs and wage growth figures give policymakers a breather. But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises \u2014 along with new tax cuts \u2014 might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Beddor added:\n\n\u201cThe question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month.\u201d\n\nSpotify\u2019s chief content officer is exiting ahead of its I.P.O.\n\nRecode\u2019s Peter Kafka reports that \u201cStefan Blom, Spotify\u2019s chief content officer, announced his departure via an internal memo Friday.\u201d\n\nThe NYT and others reported earlier this week that Spotify had filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of this year.\n\nVia Recode:\n\n\u201cThe timing of Blom\u2019s exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify. \u201cLast year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company\u2019s IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company\u2019s attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction.\u201d\n\nAfternoon speed reads\n\n\u2022 F.B.I. agents have renewed asking questions about the dealings of the Clinton Foundation amid calls from President Trump and top Republicans for the Justice Department to take a fresh look at politically charged accusations of corruption.

(MoneyBeat)\n\nHow soft was the jobs report?\n\nThe headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don\u2019t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low.\n\nOn top of all that, the number may be revised upward in the coming months. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, writes:\n\n\u201cThe details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board.\u201d\n\nBut this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cWe expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn\u2019t happening yet,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThis mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates.\n\nSo what does this mean to the Fed\u2019s rate plan? \u201cAt the margin, this report reduces the odds of a March rate hike, but two more reports are due before the FOMC meeting, by which time these numbers will be ancient history,\u201d wrote Mr. Shepherdson.\n\nFitbit makes its first start-up investment.\n\nFitbit is investing $6 million into Sano, which is developing a patch to track a person\u2019s blood sugar level, reported Christina Farr of CNBC.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales. Via CNBC:\n\n\u201cBuilding blood-sugar tracking into a future device could dramatically increase the market for Fitbit devices since more than 100 million Americans are now living with diabetes or pre-diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fitbit has recently suffered declining sales: It sold 3.6 million devices in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from 5.3 million a year earlier.\n\nKeeping pace with Apple: Last month The New York Times reported that device manufacturers are tapping into new features on the Apple Watch to develop medical accessories. Apple is also looking for its own medical breakthroughs, such as a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, the NYT reported.\n\nCan the markets keep rising?\n\nPhoto\n\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so, telling CNBC:\n\n\u201cExplain to me where this market is rich? It\u2019s not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don\u2019t see the overvaluation. World growth is higher.\u201d\n\nA dissenting voice: The market historian James Stack told Jim Stewart of the NYT: \u201cA correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to look out for: It\u2019s Jobs Friday today. A Reuters survey of economists expects the nonfarm payroll report to show a gain of 190,000 for December.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat constitutes obstruction of justice?\n\nLegal experts are poring over the question, after a report by Mike Schmidt of the NYT that President Trump told the White House\u2019s top lawyer to stop Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nFrom Mr. Schmidt\u2019s story:\n\nLegal experts said that of the two primary issues Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating \u2014 whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying the president to a possible crime of obstruction. But the experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case.\n\nAbout that Michael Wolff book: \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is to go on sale today, ahead of schedule \u2014 and despite legal threats from Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo a steady drip of excerpts \u2014 from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians \u201ctreasonous\u201d to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing \u2014 is about to become a flood.\n\nThe most damaging may be the book\u2019s descriptions of Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and of aides\u2019 private contempt for their boss. Many Washington reads are underway (you start in the index, looking for your name).\n\nThe firestorm has also propelled Mr. Wolff from local media gadfly into national newsmaker.\n\nThe fallout for Mr. Bannon: Rebekah Mercer, the adviser\u2019s longtime benefactor, disavowed him in a rare public statement. And Breitbart\u2019s board members have debated whether to oust him as the media organization\u2019s chairman, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed sources.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout that money-laundering accusation: Tim O\u2019Brien of Bloomberg View says that Mr. Bannon\u2019s allegation is as serious as any claim of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nThe Washington flyaround\n\n\u2022 Mr. Trump may have dismantled his voter fraud commission, but he wasn\u2019t happy about it.

But it has yet to demonstrate that its nuclear warhead could survive the re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and hit such long-range targets.\n\nStill, Mr. Kim on Monday reiterated that his country had mastered a state nuclear deterrent force, which he said would prevent the Trump administration from starting a war on the Korean Peninsula. He said his government would accelerate the production of nuclear warheads and rockets to launch them.\n\nAssessing North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program for the new year, government and private analysts in South Korea have recently said that despite its claim to have achieved its nuclear ambitions, the North is likely to conduct more weapons tests to improve its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities.\n\nBut at the same time, they said North Korea will also seek opportunities to engage in dialogue with South Korea and the United States, hoping to use its nuclear threats as leverage to gain concessions, like the easing of sanctions.\n\nLast year, the United Nations Security Council adopted four sanctions resolutions seeking to deprive North Korea of key sources of hard currency by banning its exports of coal, iron ore and sea products and curtailing the employment of North Korean workers in other countries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While gas prices in the North more than doubled in the past year, analysts said the country could feel more pain this year, depending on how successfully the sanctions are enforced.\n\nSouth Korea has seized two oil tankers, one with a Hong Kong flag and the other registered in Panama, on the suspicion that they were used to smuggle refined petroleum products into North Korea through ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas, trade that is prohibited by United Nations sanctions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s overture on Monday came after a year in which Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump regularly exchanged personal insults and threats of war. Mr. Kim threatened to launch ballistic missiles around Guam, an American territory in the Western Pacific, while Mr. Trump said he would \u201ctotally destroy North Korea.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly anxious over possible military conflict, President Moon has repeatedly urged North Korea to take part in the Winter Olympics, hoping its participation would ease tensions. Last month, Mr. Moon even proposed that his country and the United States postpone their joint military exercises, which were originally expected to start in late February, if North Korea suspended weapons tests in the coming weeks.\n\nMr. Moon hopes to create a lull in the nuclear standoff during the Olympics and use it as momentum to start talks with North Korea. South Korea is scheduled to host the Winter Olympics in February in Pyeongchang, a mountainous county about 60 miles south of the heavily fortified border with the North.\n\nWhen North Korea said it completed its nuclear force after its ICBM test in November, some analysts said the North might now be open to stopping its program there and to start negotiating.\n\nIn any talks with the United States, North Korea is likely to insist on being recognized as a nuclear weapons state, analysts said. With that status, they said, the North would seek arms-reduction talks in hopes of gaining concessions from Washington, such as easing sanctions and reducing the American military presence around the Korean Peninsula. In return, Pyongyang could offer to freeze or give up its ICBMs while retaining the rest of its nuclear capabilities, analysts said.\n\nBut Washington and its allies, South Korea and Japan, say that their goal remains to dismantle the North\u2019s entire nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe isolated North made major strides in 2017 in its nuclear weapons program. On Sept. 3, it detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb in its sixth and most powerful nuclear test.

Over the past year, the North made such fast technological advances that it says it can now strike the East Coast of the United States with a missile. The North has yet to demonstrate a key component of its nuclear threat \u2014 the ability to build a warhead that can withstand the heat and stresses of re-entering the atmosphere \u2014 but there is little dispute that it is getting much closer to such a capability.\n\nThe threat is considered strong enough by the administration that Mr. Trump has hinted at the possibility of a pre-emptive strike as a last resort.\n\nThat type of thinking \u2014 as well as fiery rhetoric from both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim \u2014 has shaken South Korea, which would be expected to be on the front line of a war. The advances have also led the United States to push for tougher sanctions than before, and to close the types of loopholes Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors were more likely to overlook.\n\nDespite the changes in the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities, Mr. Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s statement was similar to last year\u2019s: The North\u2019s nuclear program is unstoppable, and Mr. Trump should simply learn to accept it.\n\nThis time Mr. Kim described plans for \u201cmass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\u201d this year. While it is unclear what \u201cmass producing\u2019\u2019 means in this context, American estimates of Mr. Kim\u2019s arsenal range from 20 to 60 weapons; over the next few years that could easily double or triple, experts say, to an arsenal similar to Britain\u2019s or France\u2019s.\n\nThose same officials, however, dismissed Mr. Kim\u2019s comment that he now has a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk as a rhetorical flourish.

So he decides to \u201cmake things right again,\u201d though he knows a simple apology won\u2019t cut it. The piece ends with a gentle redirection, an act of self-comfort expressed as parental comfort: \u201cSo what I am going to do is to get out a hammer and some of those little staples that one uses to fasten cables to the wall, and put up the lamp that for several months now I\u2019ve been promising to hang from the ceiling of her room.

Sometimes an essay doesn\u2019t proceed very far beyond setting a Scandinavian mood: \u201cThe Funeral Procession\u201d concludes with Knausgaard\u2019s report of watching an ambulance boat float away, carrying a corpse: \u201cAs the boat was swallowed up by all the gray, I thought that that is exactly how death is.\u201d\n\nIn a collection of 60-odd pieces, not every one can be a home run, but too many of these essays anticipate a point of arrival that never comes. \u201cCold\u201d begins to discuss the physics of entropy, but it barely restates the general principle, meanders a bit, then stops before it discovers anything unfamiliar. Twenty more pages would have allowed \u201cThe Nose,\u201d a clinical consideration of the facial feature\u2019s essential qualities, to proceed to a worthier climax.

I frequently suspected, while reading this book, that Knausgaard doesn\u2019t consider the three-page essay even to possess form; just size.

The good vibes from their encouraging start were punctured by a stretch in which the team lost 10 of 13 games, thanks in part to losing Tim Hardaway Jr. for six weeks with a left leg injury. On Sunday, they let a 19-point lead slip away in an overtime loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. Monday, they allowed 39 third-quarter points to the Nets.\n\nThe victory over the Nets provided something of a lift. It was also the beginning of seven-game road trip \u2014 though fans at Barclays were chanting in favor of the visitors by the game\u2019s end \u2014 that could help decide how this season ends for the Knicks. A trip to Memphis Wednesday, followed by five games out West, will prove far trickier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be huge,\u201d Porzingis said of the coming stretch. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show us where we are right now. We\u2019ve been so close in so many games on the road that we\u2019re right there. All we need is to stick together, finish the games better, and I\u2019m sure the wins will come.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Knicks have not posted a winning record since the 2012-13 season, and the Nets\u2019 most recent one came the season after. They are both mired in long, occasionally painful rebuilds. Two stargazing organizations have one legitimate star between them \u2014 Porzingis. The Knicks are hoping that by finally keeping their first-round picks they can find a strong complement for Porzingis one of these years. The Nets have a bleaker outlook; they are bereft of picks after a disastrous 2013 trade with the Celtics and have turned to dealing for depressed assets that they hope to revitalize.\n\nThe Knicks remain pegged in the present, hoping to avoid a second-straight midseason collapse and nab a playoff spot. The Nets are still chasing the future. But after consecutive seasons with the worst and third-worst records in the N.B.A., the Nets are, at least, no longer laughable.\n\nThough 16-28 is still far from enviable, there are signs of progress under General Manager Sean Marks. Spencer Dinwiddie has been a solid presence since he was signed from the N.B.A.\u2019s developmental league last season, averaging more than 13 points and six assists. D\u2019Angelo Russell, the former No. 2 overall pick, could soon return from the arthroscopic left knee surgery he underwent in November. They are just now integrating Jahlil Okafor, drafted one spot behind Russell in the same draft, after acquiring him from Philadelphia last month.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Until around 1980, America seemed on the path toward broadly spread prosperity, with poor regions like the Deep South rapidly catching up with the rest. Since then, however, the gaps have widened again, with incomes in some parts of the nation surging while other parts fall behind.\n\nMoretti argues, rightly in the view of many economists, that this new divergence reflects the growing importance of clusters of highly skilled workers \u2014 many of them immigrants \u2014 often centered on great universities, that create virtuous circles of growth and innovation. And as it happens, the 2016 election largely pitted these rising regions against those left behind, which is why counties carried by Hillary Clinton, who won only a narrow majority of the popular vote, account for a remarkable 64 percent of U.S. G.D.P., almost twice as much as Trump counties.\n\nClearly, we need policies to spread the benefits of growth and innovation more widely.

(Other heads of state, like Xi Jinping of China, have attended.)\n\nOne additional note: Having attended the forum a few times, I\u2019d say that one thing that a visit from Mr. Trump would definitely do is make the traffic in Davos during the event \u2014 which often moves at a glacial pace as V.I.P.\u2019s vehicular escorts crawl through the windy streets \u2014 probably more difficult.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nPutting Jeff Bezos\u2019s wealth into perspective.\n\nShot: \u201cJeff Bezos is now the richest person of all time,\u201d CNN reported.

In 1998, Mr. Chell agreed to a five-year ban from the Alberta Stock Exchange in Canada and paid a $25,000 fine in connection with a violation of the exchange\u2019s rules. A previous company of his ended in ignominy after its chairman was charged with fraud.\n\nAsked about these incidents, Mr. Chell said that he was \u201cyoung, inexperienced and was irresponsible in my actions,\u201d and that he had \u201clearned a lot since 1998 and work hard to conduct myself in a manner that does not reflect that poor judgment.\u201d A Kodak spokesman did not return a request for comment about Mr. Chell and whether it knew about the ban.\n\nMr. Chell has refashioned himself as a blockchain expert in recent years, and KodakCoin is his biggest project so far. He is the chairman of Appcoin Innovations, which was registered as a literary agency \u2014 Redstone Literary Agents \u2014 until last year, when it became a consulting firm that provides \u201ca turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,\u201d according to securities filings.\n\nThe company, which trades over the counter as a penny stock, earned no revenue in 2015 or 2016, according to S.E.C. filings. Appcoin Innovations is slated to receive 20 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a portion of the offering proceeds, a stake that could amount to millions if the offering is successful.\n\n\u201cOnce formally launched,\u201d Mr. Chell wrote to me in an email, \u201cthe company will hopefully provide shareholders a traditional and transparent place to participate in the crypto space with projects that are regulatory compliant.\u201d\n\nNow, about those coins. You might think that a digital currency that is trying to \u201cdemocratize photography and make licensing fair to artists,\u201d in Mr. Clarke\u2019s words, would be easily accessible. But because of regulatory requirements, KodakCoins will be available only to so-called accredited investors in the United States.

{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cA divided Korea was something unprecedented,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the divide lasted in part because of competing visions among Koreans for the country\u2019s future. \u201cFundamentally it was a civil war, fought over issues going back into Korea\u2019s colonial experience,\u201d said Bruce Cumings, a professor of history at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 1948, the American-backed, anti-communist southern administration, based in Seoul, declared itself the Republic of Korea. It was led by Syngman Rhee, who lived in exile in the United States for many years and was installed as the South Korean leader by the Office of Strategic Services, a predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency, Professor Cumings said.\n\nSoon after, the Soviet-backed, communist northern administration, based in Pyongyang, declared itself the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Its leader was Kim Il-sung, who fought alongside communist forces during the Chinese civil war and was the grandfather of North Korea\u2019s current dictator, Kim Jong-un.\n\nEach regime was unstable, rejected the legitimacy of the other and considered itself to be Korea\u2019s sole rightful ruler. Border skirmishes between the two were frequent before the Korean War began.\n\nPhoto\n\nWho were the combatants?\n\nThe war pitted South Korea and the United States, fighting under the auspices of the United Nations, against North Korea and China.\n\nOther nations contributed troops, too, but American forces did most of the fighting. \u201cThe South Korean Army virtually collapsed\u201d at the start of the war, Professor Cumings said.\n\nThe Soviet Union supported North Korea at the beginning of the war, giving it arms, tanks and strategic advice. But China soon emerged as its most important ally, sending soldiers to fight in Korea as a way to keep the conflict away from its border.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Chinese leader, Mao Zedong, also saw China\u2019s participation in the war as a way to thank Korean Communists who fought in the Chinese civil war, Professor Cumings said.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of field contact between American and Chinese forces,\u201d Professor Armstrong said. \u201cIn a sense, this was the first and only war between China and the United States, so far.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHow damaging was it?\n\nThe war devastated Korea. Historians said that between three million and four million people were killed, although firm figures have never been produced, particularly by the North Korean government. As many as 70 percent of the dead may have been civilians.\n\nDestruction was particularly acute in the North, which was subjected to years of American bombing, including with napalm. Roughly 25 percent of its prewar population was killed, Professor Cumings said, and many of the survivors lived underground by the war\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea was flattened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe North Koreans see the American bombing as a Holocaust, and every child is taught about it.\u201d\n\nDamage was also widespread in South Korea, where Seoul changed hands four times. But most combat took place in the northern or central parts of the peninsula around the current Demilitarized Zone, which divides the countries, Professor Cumings said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow did it end?\n\nTechnically, the Korean War did not end.\n\nThe fighting stopped when North Korea, China and the United States reached an armistice in 1953. But South Korea did not agree to the armistice, and no formal peace treaty was ever signed.\n\n\u201cThere is still a technical state of war between the combatants,\u201d Professor Cumings said.\n\nNeither North nor South Korea had achieved its goal: the destruction of the opposing regime and reunification of the divided peninsula.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince 1953 there has been an uneasy coexistence between North and South Korea, which hosts over 20,000 American troops. At one time hundreds of American nuclear weapons were based there.\n\n\u201cIt was from the Korean War onward that we had a permanent, global American military presence that we had never had before,\u201d Professor Armstrong said. Other countries that host American troops include Qatar, Japan, Italy and Germany. \u201cIt was a real turning point for America\u2019s global role.\u201d\n\nIn the decades after the war, South Korea transformed into an economic powerhouse. Professor Cumings said many of its citizens now know little about the conflict and have \u201ca fatalistic orientation\u201d toward the economically isolated North.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea became \u201cthe world\u2019s most amazing garrison state with the fourth largest army in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts generals are still fighting the war,\u201d Professor Cumings said. \u201cFor them it has never ended.\u201d", "title": "Korean War, a \u2018Forgotten\u2019 Conflict That Shaped the Modern World", "authors": ["Liam Stack"]}

It provided at least a dim glimmer of hope that the North Korean nuclear arms crisis can be resolved peacefully.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that requires patience and humility, qualities Mr. Trump generally lacks. The North Koreans have long made clear that they view South Korea as a lackey of their chief adversary, the United States.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "Making a big bet on poetry might seem counterintuitive, but it could prove commercially savvy. Novels in verse have become a surprisingly vibrant and popular literary form with young readers. The best-selling author Ellen Hopkins publishes young adult novels in verse that tackle controversial issues like drug addiction, suicide and teen pregnancy. Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s memoir in free verse, \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming,\u201d won the National Book Award for Young People\u2019s Literature in 2014, and became a best-seller.\n\nMs. Woodson, who is a friend of Mr. Alexander\u2019s, said she expects that he will discover new voices that might have otherwise gone overlooked by the publishing industry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to challenge us as readers,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Giles, a founding member of the organization We Need Diverse Books, said he was immediately intrigued when Mr. Alexander sent him a text message asking if he had any novels in the works. \u201cThe imprint is going to be groundbreaking because Kwame is groundbreaking,\u201d Mr. Giles said. \u201cHe\u2019s like the Willy Wonka of children\u2019s publishing.\u201d\n\nWith his pivot to publishing, Mr. Alexander is joining a small but influential group of children\u2019s book authors who have launched their own imprints and are helping to reshape children\u2019s literature. The prolific best-seller James Patterson created a kids\u2019 book imprint, Jimmy Patterson, with Little, Brown & Company in 2015, and has since released 48 books, and sold more than seven million copies. In 2016, the author and artist Christopher Myers founded his imprint, Make Me a World, with Random House Children\u2019s Books, in part to address the lack of racial and cultural diversity in children\u2019s publishing. Rick Riordan, the author of the Percy Jackson series, recently started an imprint with Disney-Hyperion, Rick Riordan Presents, which features middle grade books that draw on mythology from around the world, including Indian, Korean and Mayan myths and folklore, written by emerging writers from underrepresented cultures.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Alexander sees Versify as a way to leverage his professional connections and marketing savvy to boost the profiles of newer writers.\n\n\u201cI see a lot more publishers being in tune to what\u2019s happening outside their communities, and you have a lot more writers of color having an opportunity to get their voices heard,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an opportunity with this imprint for me to do that on a mass scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGrowing up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and later, Chesapeake, Va., Mr. Alexander was surrounded by books: His father was a college professor, book publisher and Baptist pastor, and his mother worked as a teacher and then a school principal.\n\nMr. Alexander, who lives in Virginia and is married with two daughters, decided in college that he wanted to be a writer, even though he found little encouragement at first. At Virginia Tech, he studied medicine, but then he took a writing class with the poet Nikki Giovanni, and became determined to be a poet. She gave him a C, but he signed up for more of her classes, he said. (She later became a mentor to him, and recently agreed to write a book of poetry for his new imprint).\n\nAfter graduating, he gave poetry readings at universities, coffee shops, churches, community centers and any other place that would have him. He sold copies of his self-published poetry collections for around $10 a piece. He started his own publishing company, the Alexander Publishing Group, and ran the company for 10 years.

The parallels are striking and instructive. Although Sandusky\u2019s victims were boys, he, like Nassar, constructed his professional life so that he had steady access to children and appeared to be an altruist in their midst. He started a foster home, which evolved into a nonprofit group for troubled youth so large and well regarded that it received one of President George H. W. Bush\u2019s \u201cPoints of Light\u201d awards.\n\n\u201cChildren constantly surrounded Sandusky, so much so that they became part of his persona,\u201d Joe Posnanski wrote in his book \u201cPaterno.\u201d That same description applies to Nassar. It also applies to many of the abusive priests who went undetected and unpunished before the Catholic Church finally owned up to its failures and instituted necessary reforms.\n\nNassar had girls stretched out and pliant on his examining table. Sandusky roughhoused, wrestled and showered with boys in the name of sports. Nassar\u2019s victims and their parents were awestruck by his ties to Olympic athletes, his floor passes to elite competitions, the mementos on his office walls. Sandusky\u2019s victims were dazzled by his position smack in the middle of all of those football stars and all of that football glory.\n\nIn an article about Sandusky in The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell observed that he \u201cbuilt a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar, fully integrated grooming operation, outsourcing to child-care professionals the task of locating vulnerable children.\u201d Change \u201cchild-care professionals\u201d to gymnastics coaches and Gladwell could have been analyzing Nassar.\n\nGrooming. Such a chilling word. Such an apt one. Abusers introduce themselves as instructors and allies. They can lift your score. They can improve your grades. They can provide the guidance that you lack or the fun that you\u2019re missing. Bit by bit, they ask for bigger chunks of your time and suggest increasingly private encounters. The pace of the journey varies, but not its arc or its destination.\n\nAnd they concoct justifications for what they\u2019re doing, trying to persuade their victims of its righteousness as they simultaneously persuade themselves. Nassar\u2019s so-called medical treatments exemplified this, as did the actions of many priests. I recall one who told a boy that the touching was part of his confession and his purification. I recall another who told a girl that she\u2019d been assigned the task of helping him, a professed celibate, to better understand human sexuality so that he could minister more effectively to his flock.\n\nMany abusive priests invoked the permission of God. Nassar cited the demands of science.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of adults who treat, teach, coach and counsel children are nothing like these men. To distrust all of them would be a terrible mistake and grievous disservice, both to them and to the kids who stand to benefit mightily from their attention.", "title": "Opinion | Larry Nassar Is a Familiar Monster", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "The case is one of several filed last year by the president\u2019s critics accusing Mr. Trump of violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which prevent a president from accepting government-bestowed benefits either at home or abroad. No court has interpreted what the clauses mean, and no previous president has ever been sued for violating them.\n\nIn his decision last month, Judge Daniels said it was up to Congress, not the courts, to decide whether Mr. Trump had illegally accepted any valuable benefits, such as trademark approvals, from foreign governments. And if Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses had profited because consumers are more interested in patronizing Trump-owned hotels or golf courses in the United States since his election, Judge Daniels said, the president was not to blame.\n\nBut Judge Messitte seemed more sympathetic to claims by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and Maryland that the president had created an unfair playing field for convention centers and other facilities that compete against Trump-owned properties. \u201cThe argument is that as president he is unduly attracting business,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThere is some evidence of that.\u201d\n\nAsked how the hearing went, Brian E. Frosh, Maryland\u2019s attorney general, said, \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\nHe said the Justice Department was trying to say that even though the emoluments clauses were meant to protect Americans from a president who uses the position to enrich himself, no one could sue the president for violating it. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a winning position,\u201d Mr. Frosh said.\n\nThe complaint, filed at the federal court in Greenbelt, says in part that the Trump International Hotel in Washington diverts customers from businesses that the District of Columbia or Maryland license, tax or own, depriving them of revenue. Lawyers for the plaintiffs urged Judge Messitte to allow the case to proceed to discovery and allow them to obtain financial records of Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel.", "title": "Lawsuit on Trump Emoluments Violations Gains Traction in Court", "authors": []}

After finishing second in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, Foolish Pleasure faced Ruffian, an unbeaten filly, in a much-ballyhooed match race on July 6, 1975, at Belmont Park.\n\nHolding the lead after nearly half a mile, Ruffian suddenly shattered both sesamoid bones in her right foreleg and had to be euthanized. Recognizing that horse racing can be a rough, heartbreaking business, Mr. Jolley offered an unsentimental view of Ruffian\u2019s death. After the race, he said, \u201cThis game wasn\u2019t cut out for anybody wearing short pants.\u201d\n\nNearly five years later, another filly, Genuine Risk, brought more glory to Mr. Jolley. But he nearly stood in her way. After her third-place finish in the 1980 Wood Memorial, he vowed that he would not send her to Churchill Downs for the Derby. \u201cI found out what I wanted to learn yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense shipping her a thousand miles to find it out again.\u201d\n\nBut after discussions with her owners, Bertram and Diana Firestone, he reversed his decision: Genuine Risk traveled to Louisville, Ky., where she became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby since Regret in 1915. And, like Foolish Pleasure, Genuine Risk finished second at the Preakness and Belmont.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to win, and she would run so hard after some of her races, she just practically would lay down for three or four days,\u201d Mr. Jolley told The Associated Press in 2008 after Genuine Risk died at age 31.\n\nLeroy Stanton Jolley was born on Jan. 14, 1938, in Hot Springs, a hotbed for horse racing known as the Saratoga of the South. He would follow his father on the racing circuit, where, in Florida, his barn was next to Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, who trained two Triple Crown winners, Gallant Fox in 1930 and Omaha in 1935.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine better tutors than my father and Sunny Jim,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1981.\n\nMr. Jolley left the University of Miami after one year, preferring to be schooled in barns and paddocks.\n\nHe had his first winner in 1958 with Somnus, which his father bred and his mother owned. and, after taking Ridan to the Kentucky Derby and the Travers Stakes (which he lost by a nose to Jaipur), Mr. Jolley took a low-profile detour for nearly a decade, training horses in New York, Illinois and Florida to modest acclaim. He gained greater renown for Foolish Pleasure\u2019s victory at the 1975 Derby, and for his anger about track conditions at Pimlico Race Course after Honest Pleasure (who shared a sire with Foolish Pleasure) finished second at the Preakness Stakes in 1976.\n\nThat year, Mr. Jolley starred in a commercial for Miller Lite beer with Foolish Pleasure and Honest Pleasure. The campaign \u2014 which used sports celebrities to market a beer that \u201ctastes great\u201d and was also \u201cless filling\u201d \u2014 put Mr. Jolley in a barn at Belmont Park with his two horses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man who\u2019s known for his pleasures,\u201d Mr. Jolley said. \u201cThese two I train. And this one I drink. But what I love best is the way it tastes. What a pleasure.! Right, guys?\u201d\n\nAfter their whinnied assent, Mr. Jolley added, \u201cAm I a trainer or am I a trainer?\u201d\n\nIn addition to his son Leroy Jr., Mr. Jolley is survived by another son, Tim; a daughter, Laura Jolley; two grandchildren; and a sister, Rosalyn McCullars. His marriage to the former Myrna Griffiths ended in divorce. He lived in Saratoga, N.Y., and Ocala, Fla.\n\nOver his career, Mr. Jolley saddled 991 winners and won purses of more than $35 million. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where three of his horses (Genuine Risk, Foolish Pleasure and Manila) are also enshrined. He retired for a while but returned in recent years to train horses again.\n\nThey were not the high-quality horses he had trained in the past. \u201cThe people that owned them were trying to find out if they were good enough to compete in New York, and most of them weren\u2019t very good,\u201d LeRoy Jolley Jr. said.\n\nBut it was a world that the elder Mr. Jolley missed.\n\n\u201cI got bored,\u201d he told The Paulick Report, a horse-racing news website, in 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t play golf anymore and I don\u2019t fish, so I went back to doing what I know.\u201d", "title": "LeRoy Jolley, Who Trained Two Derby Winners, Dies at 79", "authors": ["Richard Sandomir"]}

For fear of seeming intrusive, I asked Ms. Speights O\u2019Neill if she would mind arranging for us to meet in a setting that was not as intimate as a physical therapist\u2019s table. Mr. Mika was surprisingly receptive to talking about his suffering.\n\nWhat followed was a remarkable few days, and months, of recovery and restoration that I chronicled in a recent article. I aimed to provide a glimpse at what it looks like to survive a mass shooting \u2014 and what it takes in the months after to reckon with the fact that although you\u2019re still alive, the only life you knew was taken from you.\n\nWhat is often neglected in stories about shooting victims is the period of time months afterward, when loneliness and isolation set in more dramatically, and when friends and acquaintances often wrongly assume that the patient has returned to a kind of normalcy. There are no more surgeries, fewer doctors\u2019 checkups and hours of physical therapy, and not as many well-wishers worried about your condition. It is this period, as Mr. Mika helped me understand, when the ravages of gun violence can be most unnerving.\n\nThe resources that go into saving the life of someone shot by an assault rifle are staggering. I spent a December afternoon in a high-tech ambulance with the paramedic who saved Mr. Mika\u2019s life, Chad Shade, as he showed me the needles and fabrics and liquids he used just to give Mr. Mika a small chance of living. In essence, Mr. Shade was showing me how to perform trauma surgery in a moving car. Many of the tools he uses are common to war medics.\n\nI spent time with Mr. Mika\u2019s trauma surgeon at the hospital, Libby Schroeder, who is still haunted by what she saw that day. The night of the shooting, she went on a run to try to process what she had seen and done, and she found herself late at night at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall, unsure how she ended up there.", "title": "Learning from a Shooting Victim: What Comes After Trauma?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "In a series of studies published in 2012, two psychologists, Ara Norenzayan and Will Gervais, set out to test a simple question: When people think about God, do they feel or act as if they are being monitored? Subjects of varying religiosity were primed to think about God, then asked to complete self-evaluations based on statements like \u201cI am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me\u201d and \u201cNo matter whom I\u2019m talking to, I\u2019m always a good listener.\u201d Results, researchers said, were consistent with what they call the \u201csupernatural-monitoring hypothesis\u201d \u2014 that is, that \u201cthinking of God triggers the same social cognitive processes that are activated by real-time social surveillance.\u201d A sense that you\u2019re being seen \u2014 whether by a fellow human or by a supreme consciousness from which no thought can be withheld \u2014 does seem to change how you see yourself as well as how you behave.\n\nSince 2012, online platforms have moved to the center of hundreds of millions more lives, popularizing their particular brands of social surveillance. Services like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are inextricably tied to the experience of being monitored by others, which, if it doesn\u2019t always produce \u201cprosocial\u201d behavior in the broad psychological sense, seems to have encouraged behaviors useful to the platforms themselves \u2014 activity and growth. These businesses serve many different purposes, but the one thing they have in common is that they have figured out new ways to monetize the powerful twin sensations of seeing and being seen by others.\n\nBut alongside this exhilarating, debilitating, empowering and terrifying human spectacle, these sites have also fostered \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 a new but not entirely unfamiliar feeling, that of being watched from above. There is little about the ruthless, marketlike social-media experience that primes you to think about any sort of god.

He forces us to ask ourselves if purity is even desirable, and whether India\u2019s true genius does not lie in its ability to throw up dazzling hybrids, like Nehru, who seem, in intellect and sophistication, vision and worldliness, to be every bit Mr. Modi\u2019s superior.\n\nMr. Modi has certainly ushered in an age when the \u201cIndian soul\u201d \u2014 like the German and Russian soul before it \u2014 is finding utterance. But what is it saying? Last month, in Rajasthan, a state whose government is run by the B.J.P., we were given yet another sampling of what Mr. Modi\u2019s brand of authenticity looks like: a Hindu man axed to death a Muslim man, then set the body alight, while asking his nephew to film the murder.\n\nThe killer posted the video on Facebook. He wanted to send a message that the \u201cLove Jihad\u201d \u2014 a baseless B.J.P.-promulgated conspiracy theory in which Muslim men lure unsuspecting Hindu women into marriage and conversion \u2014 would not be tolerated. The response of the B.J.P. leadership was, as it usually is after such killings, strategic silence.\n\nRajasthan, in recent months, has become a byword for this kind of religious murder. It also happens to be one of those states where last year Nehru was erased from school textbooks. Otherwise the eighth graders there might have grown up with these words of his, which the historian Ram Guha quoted last month in an essay for The Hindustan Times: \u201cIf any person raises his hand to strike down another on the ground of religion,\u201d Nehru said on Gandhi\u2019s birthday in 1952, \u201cI shall fight him till the last breath of my life, both at the head of government and from outside.\u201d\n\nTime may have trifled with Nehru.

It would create an advisory committee to make recommendations about A.I. \u2014 on topics including the technology\u2019s effect on the American work force and strategies to protect the privacy rights of those it impacts. Then the New York City Council approved a first-of-its-kind bill that once signed into law will create a task force to examine its own use of automated decision systems, with the ultimate goal of making its use of algorithms fairer and more transparent.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, these efforts also overlap with increasing calls to regulate artificial intelligence along with claims by the likes of Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking that it poses a threat to humanity\u2019s literal survival.\n\nBut this push for broad legislation to regulate A.I. is premature.\n\nTo begin with, even experts can\u2019t agree on what, exactly, constitutes artificial intelligence. Take the recent report released by the AI Now Institute, aimed at creating a framework for ethically implementing A.I. While itself focused on A.I., the report also acknowledges that no commonly accepted definition of A.I. exists, which it describes loosely as \u201ca broad assemblage of technologies \u2026 that have traditionally relied on human capacities.\u201d\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d is all too frequently used as a shorthand for software that simply does what humans used to do. But replacing human activity is precisely what new technologies accomplish \u2014 spears replaced clubs, wheels replaced feet, the printing press replaced scribes, and so on. What\u2019s new about A.I. is that this technology isn\u2019t simply replacing human activities, external to our bodies; it\u2019s also replacing human decision-making, inside our minds.", "title": "Opinion | Leave A.I.

You can hear it here.\n\nGermans and Irish came in the 19th century; European Jews and then Cubans followed in the 20th. Since 2015, Elizabeth has settled 646 refugees \u2014 about half from Syria, and 95 from Congo. The city accepts more refugees than anywhere else in New Jersey.\n\nChris Bollwage, the seven-term mayor, traces his own history back 202 years to German immigrants. \u201cThe city of Elizabeth has been a melting pot, but it hasn\u2019t been a melting pot for the last 25 years \u2014 it\u2019s been a melting pot since the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Bollwage said. Its residents are said to come from about 50 countries and speak 37 languages.\n\nMr. Twendele\u2019s journey \u2014 11 years in a refugee camp, then one lucky application for a visa to the United States \u2014 roughly traces the experiences of the three million other refugees admitted into the country since 1975. But that path is now narrowing as President Trump enacts the most severe curtailment of America\u2019s refugee program in a generation.\n\nLast September Mr. Trump set the annual cap for refugee admissions at 45,000, less than half of the amount that President Obama accepted and the lowest by any president since the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\nMr. Twendele was fortunate to get to the U.S. before new refugee restrictions went into place. But he now lives with a greater burden: Lisette Lukoji, a woman he met and married in the refugee camp, is still stuck in southeastern Africa.\n\nAs a teenager, Lisette Lukoji had a daughter, Lorette, with a boyfriend who went to war and never returned. She enrolled in school to become a seamstress, raising Lorette and living at her uncle\u2019s house in Lubumbashi. That\u2019s where they came for her. She was 19.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Lukoji told me her story as we sat side by side on another bench \u2014 this one in the main room of her home at the Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi, a landlocked sliver of a country that borders Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. The walls were made of mud, sticks and plastic served as a roof, and an old sweatshirt was used as the doormat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was around 6 or 7 p.m.,\u201d Ms. Lukoji remembered of the day she was arrested. \u201cI was preparing food in the kitchen. I saw people enter that weren\u2019t wearing uniforms.\u201d\n\nWhether they were militia or military or police, she doesn\u2019t know. She recalls her uncle was aligned with Paul Joseph Mukungubila, a professed Christian prophet and politician who had run against President Kabila in 2006. As part of an operation to round up Mr. Mukungubila\u2019s supporters, Ms. Lukoji said, her entire family was detained and imprisoned in separate cells. Lorette was stripped away from her.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. If alive, she\u2019s 6 years old.\n\nOne night in jail three soldiers came to Ms. Lukoji\u2019s cell. She said they raped her, all three of them. Then they handed her 5,000 Congolese francs, about $3.50, and told her to leave.\n\n\u201cI walked, I don\u2019t know how to explain for how long, but I walked for a long time,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. She had neither shoes nor identification. She ended up in a dusty town bordering Zambia. For days, she lived on the streets, using the little money she had to buy beignets, mixing the leftover sugar with water for sustenance.\n\nA Tanzanian truck driver stopped to help her. He smuggled her into Zambia, where she got on a bus to Malawi, which has hosted refugees for decades despite being one of the poorest nations on the continent. Ms. Lukoji walked into Dzaleka barefoot. It took her two weeks to get a pair of shoes, she said. She had to find someone to take her in, or build her own earthen house. She had to collect her own food.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI realized that life would be very complicated there,\u201d she said. \u201cVery complicated, really.\u201d\n\nDzaleka Refugee Camp was built as a prison camp for about 10,000 people. But for more than 20 years it has been home to the displaced from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere, with a population that now exceeds 32,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it receives less than a third of the $18 million it needs to care for Malawi\u2019s refugees. Charcoal is hard to come by, so children ask strangers for empty water bottles, which can then be burned and used to cook food. Refugees build their own homes, which lack indoor plumbing, and the camp\u2019s one medical clinic mostly serves the neighboring villagers.\n\nYet there\u2019s life in Dzaleka. People gossip, argue and dance. There are churches, schools and hair salons. Refugees may be forbidden by the Malawian government from working, but an underground economy is driven by barter and cash sent from relatives abroad. Ms. Lukoji sells clothes that she makes, and Mr. Twendele tutored refugees in his native French and, later, English. He became fluent while living in the camp because he won admission to a competitive college equivalency program there. Six days a week for three years he took online classes through Regis University in Colorado, earning a near 4.0 G.P.A. and a degree in liberal studies.\n\nSome months after he graduated, Mr. Twendele fell in love. He remembers the day well: He was playing Scrabble, in French, at a friend\u2019s house when he first caught a glimpse of Ms. Lukoji.\n\n\u201cThat girl!\u201d Mr. Twendele thought. \u201cI want to talk to her. I don\u2019t know where to start, how can I talk to her?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThey were both devout Christians from the Luba ethnic group. At first, Ms. Lukoji refused to give Mr. Twendele her phone number. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know him!\u201d she said.\n\nSome refugees get cellphones through charities, relatives in the West or the underground market. When Mr. Twendele finally got her number and called, she hung up on him. Not interested.\n\nBut Mr. Twendele, handsome with a shaved head, was determined.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Even if you refuse, I am the one marrying you, there is no one besides me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lukoji said. \u201cThat even if I hung up I would be the one he marries and the father of my children.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They\u2019d go for walks together, maybe buying sweet drinks and stopping to watch soccer games on the big dirt field near the camp\u2019s entrance.\n\nAnd in May 2015, they married, right there in the camp. Their church helped pay for his suit. She borrowed a dress. There was a big spread of food: beans, rice, sweet potatoes, chicken, fish, salad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was like a dream,\u201d Mr. Twendele said. \u201cShe was very happy that day.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, they both knew they would have to leave the camp, so Mr. Twendele applied to the U.N.H.C.R. to resettle in a new country.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Dec. 19, 2012 \u2014 he remembers the date \u2014 Mr. Twendele had his first interview with a refugee agency representative at the camp. More interviews followed, including two with officials from the Department of Homeland Security. In each, Mr. Twendele told his story of escape and provided biographical information. Refugee officers ran his name against terrorist watch lists. They took his photograph and his fingerprints.\n\nFinally, on Oct. 22, 2016, nearly four years after the first interview, Mr. Twendele received the news he had waited so long to hear: He was headed to the United States.\n\nBut it was in the middle of this process that he had met Ms. Lukoji, and he opted not to change his application midstream to take his marriage into account. He assumed, correctly, that it would delay the process. He also assumed, incorrectly, that she could join him in six months or so.\n\n\u201cI was crying like a baby,\u201d said Mr. Twendele. \u201cShe told me: \u2018Just go. I know that you are my husband, and you love me, and will do your best to help me so I can join you there in the U.S.A.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe next day, Mr. Twendele landed at Kennedy International Airport, thrilled by the flight across the ocean. \u201cYou stay in one place \u2014 you are not moving, but the airplane is going,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that technology.\u201d\n\nThe International Rescue Committee arranged to have Mr. Twendele picked up and taken to an apartment complex in Elizabeth filled with refugees from Africa, the Middle East and South America. He would be sharing a room with two Congolese men in a brick building on the same street where Jared Kushner\u2019s grandparents moved after fleeing the Holocaust.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the day Mr. Twendele moved in, Mr. Trump was campaigning in North Carolina, attacking Hillary Clinton and her stance on immigration. \u201cShe wants, in her words, to have totally open borders, which would destroy America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Trump said. He called refugees \u201cTrojan horses.\u201d Thirteen days later, he was elected president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe job of resettling new Americans falls on designated nonprofit agencies like the International Rescue Committee, which the State Department pays $2,125 per refugee to cover resettlement expenses, like a security deposit for an apartment and a few days of food in the refrigerator, as well as administrative costs.\n\nThe I.R.C. also holds classes to familiarize refugees with the complexities of New Jersey Transit and the welfare system. And it connects refugees with employers, which is exactly how Mr. Twendele got an overnight job at Elizabeth\u2019s True World Foods, a sprawling, bone-cold seafood distributor that abuts the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 13A. He earns $11 an hour alongside immigrants from the Philippines, Liberia, Nigeria and Congo, cutting and packaging fish from all over the world that becomes sushi at high-end restaurants like Nobu in Manhattan. Bundled up in ski pants and three jackets, Mr. Twendele handles fish that he won\u2019t eat \u2014 though he loves seafood, he has yet to try sushi.\n\nBy about 4 a.m., in the middle of his shift, Mr. Twendele was in the break room. He was on his phone, trying to reach his wife on WhatsApp, which allows free international calls. He used his first True World Food paychecks to buy his wife a new phone. They speak multiple times a day, and for hours at a time on the weekends.\n\n\u201cWhen I speak to him, I feel like he is here, even though he is not here,\u201d Ms. Lukoji said from the bench in the refugee camp. She had just spoken with Mr. Twendele and was still smiling. \u201cHe loves me, and he tells me this on the phone. Like today he said, \u2018I love you, I adore you, you are the mother of my children.\u2019\u201d\n\nNearly 50,000 Congolese refugees have resettled in the United States since 2010. More than 2,500 moved to New York, most ending up in Buffalo and Syracuse. Almost all Congolese refugees in New Jersey are in Elizabeth, the second largest refugee group behind Syrians, and through word of mouth an unofficial Congolese community group has sprung up.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast July 1, I joined Mr. Twendele at the group\u2019s Congolese Independence Day party in a Korean church above a Dollar Store in downtown Elizabeth. Mr. Twendele marked his country\u2019s 1960 victory over the Belgian colonial rulers by eating traditional African fufu with new friends who spoke his language. They prayed, danced and drank (Sprite for Mr. Twendele; Heineken for his roommates).\n\nAt the party, Mr. Twendele opened his cellphone. His wife had sent a photo. Over the image, using the English version of his first name, Ms. Lukoji wrote: \u201cI love my husband Andrew forever.\u201d\n\nElizabeth, with its Colombian bakeries and kosher restaurants, is a model for those who believe that the United States should be a haven during what is now considered the worst refugee crisis since World War II \u2014 there are more than 22 million people designated as refugees worldwide, with a notable spike in the last five years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Elizabeth is also home to a privately run immigrant detention center, filled with people accused of overstaying their visas or smuggling themselves over the Mexican border. Elizabeth may be their last stop before deportation.\n\nAnd near the city\u2019s train station sits a garbage can that serves as a reminder of the risk of terrorist attacks by disaffected immigrants. In September 2016, a month before Mr. Twendele arrived, prosecutors say an Afghanistan-born man named Ahmad Khan Rahami stashed six pipe bombs in a garbage can. Mr. Rahami was a naturalized American citizen who lived above his father\u2019s First American Fried Chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. The Elizabeth bombs were found before they went off, but Mr. Rahami is now awaiting sentencing for the other explosives he planted that weekend that actually blew up \u2014 in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 31.\n\nMr. Trump, who was the Republican nominee for president then, blamed the attacks on the United States\u2019 \u201cextremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals and families coming into our country.\u201d And yet since the current vetting system was put into place in 1980, no refugee has committed a deadly terrorist attack on American soil.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s changes to the refugee program have directly affected Ms. Lukoji. His administration suspended the visa program for so-called following-to-join refugees, which was her fastest path to reuniting with her husband. A federal judge has since lifted the suspension, but more stringent security requirements for the visa are expected, which could further delay her application.\n\nMs. Lukoji does have another option. Mr. Twendele has filed an \u201caffidavit of relationship\u201d to certify their marriage and initiate the vetting process, but his application has yet to be reviewed, according to advocates working on the case.\n\nMs. Lukoji longs to leave not just to reunite with her husband; her health depends on it, too. She has blocked fallopian tubes, a painful condition that has left her infertile, according to a gynecologist whom she sees in Lilongwe, Malawi\u2019s capital. Their hopes for children \u2014 Mr. Twendele wants as many as eight \u2014 now rests in the United States, with in vitro fertilization.\n\nHe is 35. She is 26. He calls this \u201cthe beginning of life.\u201d\n\nOne day in his apartment, Mr. Twendele expressed confidence, as he often does, in the future.\n\n\u201cI know that one day I will be with myself, my wife, my family \u2014 comfortable,\u201d he said.\n\nNot long after, his phone buzzed.

Half the budget was slated to be spent on voter mobilization efforts on the ground in targeted districts for months leading up to elections, with the other half going toward advertising, according to people familiar with the plan. While Mr. Bannon publicly bashed the Republican donor class, he spent months quietly courting some of the deepest pockets on the right.\n\nMr. Bannon discussed his plans in grandiose, but vague, terms in a series of meetings with donors, including the Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson; a Chicago Cubs owner, Todd Ricketts; and a Home Depot founder, Bernard Marcus.\n\nWhile Mr. Bannon boasted that he was turning donors against Mr. McConnell, some of the donors who talked to Mr. Bannon say he appeared to lack the organization to effectively raise and spend their money. For instance, they said Mr. Bannon did not have staff follow up to collect donations after meetings \u2014 a common step in political fund-raising.

He rushed the aircraft carrier Enterprise and 25 other warships into the Sea of Japan, within easy range of North Korea, and 360 combat aircraft to bases in and near South Korea.\n\nThe Pentagon prepared plans to hit the North with nuclear weapons if it invaded the South. Under one scheme, eerily code-named Operation Freedom Drop, B-52s would incinerate Communist troops and armor with atomic bombs. Another plan envisioned destruction of the entire North Korean air force \u2014 nearly 500 aircraft \u2014 with round-the-clock airstrikes.\n\nBut Johnson chose not to bloody his saber, and thereby exposed himself to charges of weakness.

It showed a furry creature, about the size of a Pomeranian, charging away from the camera and down a driveway. Midway through the video, the animal stops abruptly, turns slightly and stares back \u2014 if not directly at the camera, near enough that its retinas catch the light and, for a moment, glow. Then it slouches off, away from the camera and into the darkness. Watching it again, I noticed that the driveway looked oddly familiar \u2014 it was my childhood home.\n\nThere were soon more emails with more videos attached. The next had a fox \u2014 or the back half of a fox \u2014 making a rapid exit offscreen. The one after that showed a possum plodding into and through some hedges. By the time my dad moved the cameras into the backyard, he had captured another possum, or maybe the same possum, plus more foxes, a rabbit and a pair of coyotes. He had also solved the case of the mystery critter. It was a raccoon rendered unrecognizable by the loss of its tail.\n\nMy parents live in the foothills of Santa Barbara, and for years they had been talking about wanting to set up some camera traps, just to see what sorts of animals were prowling around the house. But my dad had always thought the cameras were a little too expensive and complicated. Still, they pined. For the past 30 years, my parents\u2019 primary hobby has been exploring and settling their backyard, weeding and gardening it aggressively and making note of all the paw prints and scratch marks they encountered as they did so. When I was growing up, this was where I built forts and caught lizards, dug up anthills and found quite a few skulls, bleached and buried, of long-dead rodents (and once, a pet cat).\n\nThis sort of terrain, between the settled and the unsettled land, is known as the wildland-urban interface, or WUI. Each decade, the interface is carefully mapped by the Forest Service as part of its fire-safety precautions. The last effort was in 2010, and it found that one in three people in the United States lives in the WUI, and that it\u2019s among the fastest-growing residential regions in the country: At the time, it covered 10 percent of the map. The WUI runs through the fringes of suburbs and exurbs, and in the gaps they never quite fill, but it also creeps into our metropolises. California has more people living in the WUI than any other state. In Los Angeles, I can see it from my apartment in two different spots: right in the middle of the city where the Santa Monica Mountains run, and again to the east along the San Gabriels.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout a year ago, an acquaintance recommended that my dad get the Bushnell Trophy Cam HD Essential E2.

Inner peace, divined by salt water.\n\nAfter childhood, I gave little thought to floating until last year, while on a trip to Israel. My 87-year-old Saba Meir \u2014 saba is Hebrew for grandfather \u2014 surprised me with a request to visit the Dead Sea. It was on the opposite side of the country, and he hadn\u2019t floated in its famously salty water for 30 years.\n\nOver our four-hour drive to the Dead Sea, I thought about all that he was losing to age and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Since the last trip, he had deteriorated visibly; I went to Israel only every two years or so, which meant my mental image of his aging felt accelerated, like a time-lapse video. At home in his apartment, he could get through the day without help. But in unfamiliar places, he suddenly appeared frail and confused, and my partner and I fell into chaperone mode. In the visitors\u2019 center bathroom, after an arm-in-arm walk down the corridor, he hesitated at the urinal before asking me for help with his belt buckle. I felt a rush of parental protectiveness when a middle-aged man walked in on us.\n\nIn the hurry to get to the beach before closing, stress signals caromed through my brain, refusing to coalesce into coherent thoughts. Down at the water, some older sunbathers had dragged in the resort\u2019s plastic lawn chairs so they could sit waist-deep, and we followed their lead. Saba, my partner and I waded in, the current tugging on our flip-flops, me holding Saba\u2019s arm, him gripping the chair.

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe last time I went to trivia night at a bar, the friend who invited me set expectations unreasonably high. He announced proudly to our teammates, most of whom I\u2019d never met, that I worked as a fact-checker for a magazine, the implication being that I was a repository of data. As it happened, my performance was subpar \u2014 until we arrived at the clincher, a double-or-nothing bonus round. \u201cWhy did a porn-production studio offer a British woman $1 million to appear in one of their films?\u201d I bolted to attention. I had read about said British woman that very afternoon, while browsing The Daily Mail instead of attending to my fact-checking duties! \u201cShe had two vaginas,\u201d I whispered excitedly. When we won, my friend\u2019s friends \u2014 now, dare I say, my own \u2014 cheered with gusto.\n\nThe truth about being a fact-checker is that you\u2019re not supposed to rely on what you know. That\u2019s usually where the mistakes are made \u2014 in assumptions, in guesses based on faded memories and self-affirming bluster. A good fact-checker is incredibly stringent and willing to look something up, and then look it up again, and then call someone to confirm that they\u2019ve looked it up correctly, and someone else to confirm that they\u2019ve understood it. Being adept at this process is its own skill, and I consider it one of mine. But when it comes to intellectual capital, what I\u2019m most impressed by \u2014 in myself and in other people \u2014 are the random bits of information we manage to retain and retrieve from our own crowded brains, evidence of lives spent reading, watching, listening and discussing. Proof that we\u2019ve been curious, awake and observant, and that we\u2019re richer and more complicated for it.\n\nLife doesn\u2019t present us with many opportunities to put to use the facts that we know for no other reason than that we know them. And so last year, when two of my smartest, most interesting, most encyclopedic friends revealed that they were members of an online trivia league, I wanted in. No, it was not HQ, the live-video, cash-prize trivia app that has taken the internet by storm in the last few months.\n\nPhoto\n\nMy friends\u2019 trivia league, which is now my own, is called Learned League. It predates HQ by about 18 years, and you can tell \u2014 visiting the desktop-only, confusing-to-navigate website on which it lives is a little like time-traveling to Y2K. Text is small and dense; there are no graphics beyond a generic-looking logo and the tiny flags that players are required to use as avatars. More important, there\u2019s basically nothing at stake: There are no prizes of any kind, and when you join (by referral only, for a yearly fee of $30), you\u2019re placed into a group of about 20 random competitors, identified by only their last names and first initials, so you can\u2019t even really play against your friends \u2014 although everyone, across every \u201crundle,\u201d as the groups are called, answers the same six questions each day of each 25-day quarterly season, and anyone is free to look up anyone else\u2019s statistics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe only thing stopping you from cheating is the honor code, but there\u2019s no point in cheating, because the only point of Learned League is to test your own knowledge. And test your knowledge it does: Most of the questions \u2014 written by the league\u2019s trivia-obsessed founder, Shayne Bushfield, who in his capacity as \u201ccommissioner\u201d uses the moniker \u201cThorsten A. Integrity\u201d \u2014 are extremely challenging and often bewilderingly worded. \u201cIdentify the subatomic particle of the baryon family, believed to be composed of two up quarks and one down quark, which has a mass of 1.672x10-24 grams and a positive electric charge of 1.602x10-19 coulombs\u201d or \u201cWhat was the name given to the ecclesiastical court established by the Roman Catholic Church, beginning with Pope Gregory IX in 1231, whose jurisdiction was the prosecution of heresy?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know the answers to either of those questions, and I can\u2019t remember them now. I am very, very bad at Learned League, consistently finishing seasons in the bottom quarter of my rundle. But every so often, I get one right, and the feeling is nothing short of euphoric. One about a short-lived television show that happens to have been created and written by a friend of mine and her husband. One about maple syrup, in which I happen to be something of an expert. One about \u201cThe Decameron,\u201d by Boccaccio, which I was required to read in college and hadn\u2019t thought of since. Sometimes it feels like pure magic: On a day I had idly studied my map-of-the-night-sky shower curtain while brushing my teeth, I was stunned to find that one of Thorsten\u2019s questions was, \u201cBetelgeuse, Rigel and Bellatrix are the Alpha, Beta and Gamma stars of what constellation?\u201d (Answer: Orion.)

And then, years later, trying the thing again, though it wrecks your marriage, and failing again. And eventually making a meticulous study of the thing and figuring out that, by eliminating every extraneous element, you could isolate what makes it work and just do that.

At his peak \u2014 look on YouTube for any set he did between 1976 and 1990 \u2014 he was the funniest entertainer ever. That peak was long in coming; by the time he perfected his act, he was nearly 60. But everything about Dangerfield was weird. While other comedians of that era made their names in television and film, Dangerfield made his with stand-up. It was a stand-up as dated as he was: He stood on stage stock-still in a rumpled black suit and shiny red tie and told a succession of diamond-hard one-liners.\n\nThe one-liners were impeccable, unimprovable. Dangerfield spent years on them; he once told an interviewer that it took him three months to work up six minutes of material for a talk-show appearance. If there\u2019s art about life and art about art, Dangerfield\u2019s comedy was the latter \u2014 he was the supreme formalist. Lacking inborn ability, he studied the moving parts of a joke with an engineer\u2019s rigor. And so Dangerfield, who told audiences that as a child he was so ugly that his mother fed him with a slingshot, became the leading semiotician of postwar American comedy. How someone can watch him with anything short of wonder is beyond me.\n\n\u201cTo be a comedian,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to get onstage and find out if you\u2019re funny.\u201d He wasn\u2019t. During his first career, performing as Jack Roy, he was a singing waiter, used props, tried impressions. Even after his second coming \u2014 using a stage name devised by a club owner as a gag \u2014 and becoming a regular on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d he could be miserable. In a YouTube clip of him performing on \u201cSullivan\u201d in 1969, Dangerfield\u2019s face is the unsettling bluish-pink of raw chicken. The jokes \u2014 about getting directions, his wife\u2019s driving, their apartment \u2014 keep bombing. The setups are too long; the delivery is too slow; the punch lines are so lame that you can hear the scattered laughter of distinct individuals. Even worse, he panders. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s nice to hear you laugh,\u201d he says at one point.

Zionism is understandable as a 19th-century response to millenniums of persecution. But as a project of colonial dispossession, it is neither sustainable nor defensible in the 21st century.

Two of its past presidents were assassinated, and the nation has endured two civil wars that left scores dead.\n\nMr. Weah\u2019s rise to the presidency resonated with the poorest citizens in a country where more than half of the population lives below the poverty line. Mr. Weah himself came from poverty. During his teenage years in the 1980s, he shared a bedroom with 10 other boys in West Point, Monrovia\u2019s largest slum.\n\nSupport for him in West Point is evident in a painting of the former soccer star, bespectacled and solemn looking, that hangs outside a corner shop. \u201cLiberia\u2019s Hope\u201d is written underneath. People have nicknamed him King George.\n\nWest Point has long been a political stronghold for Mr. Weah. With poor infrastructure and sanitation, regular outbursts of mob violence and rural migrants searching for opportunity, it is a microcosm of the challenges throughout the country that await the new president.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Weah rode a wave of disappointment into office, propelled by voters upset that Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s government never managed to tackle endemic poverty or successfully fight corruption.\n\nHis challenges are formidable. He must govern a nation with a broken education system, high levels of unemployment and an economy hit hard by falling rubber and iron ore prices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Weah must also maintain security and stability in a postwar society without the support of peacekeepers. The United Nations mission in Liberia is sending the last of its troops back home.\n\nLike his predecessor, Mr. Weah has vowed to fight corruption. He has pledged to promote free education and health care, while also providing tax breaks for investors.\n\nBut his critics say he is too inexperienced to address the mammoth problems the nation faces. His political experience consists of three years as senator and a limited stint as an ambassador for a reconciliation initiative.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe economy is doing very badly and will be a big challenge for him to turn it around,\u201d said Silas Kpanan\u2019Ayoung Siakor, an environmental activist.\n\nAnd he must operate in the shadow of Mrs. Sirleaf, who despite being criticized for nepotism and failing to address endemic corruption, is often credited with Liberia\u2019s postwar turnaround.\n\n\u201cShe took over at a time when things were so bad and she had so much money flowing in that she was able to show progress very quickly,\u201d Mr. Siakor said.\n\nMr. Weah is not expected to enjoy the same levels of foreign donations, and he has focused on Liberia\u2019s business potential, saying he wants to relax constraints on companies in hopes of creating jobs.\n\nFaith Caranda, 18, who is finishing high school, said she hoped his first priority would be improving access to education.\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends don\u2019t have money to go to school, so they sit down doing nothing,\u201d said Ms. Caranda, who hopes to study medicine. \u201cI know he will bring change in our country.\u201d", "title": "Liberia Swears In George Weah, Its Soccer Star President", "authors": ["Clair Macdougall"]}

Lawmakers have taken to holding legislative items hostage, making material demands when the time comes to pass budgets, allocate money for schools, confirm political appointees or enact laws.\n\nHer leverage limited by the tools of democratic governance, Ms. Sirleaf used \u201ccash violence,\u201d in Liberian slang, or the persuasive powers of the purse, to bring political competitors to her side. She gave or withheld government positions and contracts, and used off-the-book inducements.\n\nSuch structural problems resist easy fixes and the odds rarely favor reformers, but at certain moments \u2014 such as during political transitions \u2014 narrow windows of opportunity open. Mr. Weah is in such a moment, because Liberia, while still fragile, has passed through the period when restoring stability had to be an absolute priority. He can now turn to smaller technical fixes that did not even appear on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s radar.\n\nFor starters, Mr. Weah could set new expectations for greater accountability by promptly issuing an executive order asking all government ministries and agencies to publish their monthly expenditures. It\u2019s a simple step, but it could have an outsized impact on combating government fraud by opening spending to public scrutiny.\n\nMr. Weah should instruct the finance ministry to allocate funds only to government entities with an approved procurement plan. Government contracts for goods and services \u2014 which, officials have told me, can account for up to 50 percent of the total budget \u2014 offer easy opportunities for graft. Just 41 percent of government entities currently have such plans even though those are required by law. Tying funding to compliance would change this practice is no time.\n\nThe new president should also ask the General Auditing Commission to examine the legislature\u2019s 2018 expenditures and legislators\u2019 assets. Remarkably, the National Assembly has never had to account for its spending despite persistent allegations of corruption. Giving legislators a full year\u2019s warning would allow them to correct any problematic behavior; past practices should be ignored, as looking into them would be a political nonstarter. Calling for oversight of this kind would have been too contentious in the past, but the new Speaker of the House \u2014 the third-highest position in the country \u2014 is an ally of Mr. Weah\u2019s and has previously said he would support such a move.\n\nMr. Weah faces a moment of consequence and a rare opportunity to build on Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s successes. She brought Liberia back from the dead.

But she said the lack of clarity had allowed the policy to be hijacked by conservative groups pressing their own ideological agendas.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer requirement,\u201d she said by phone from Vancouver. \u201cBut the wording needs clarification so the issue doesn\u2019t get misunderstood. Unfortunately, it has become a big distraction.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer accused Mr. Trudeau this month of using the requirement to impose his own views on Canadians. Speaking at a meeting hosted by the Mississauga Board of Trade, he said community groups were expressing alarm that they would be unable to employ youths and provide services because of their beliefs. Among the groups affected was the Southern Alberta Bible Camp, which told CBC News, the Canadian broadcaster, that it would lose about $40,000 for six summer counselor positions.\n\nMr. Trudeau, who has sought to balance his own Roman Catholic religious views with his commitment to abortion rights, has called the reaction to the policy a \u201ckerfuffle.\u201d\n\nBoth he and the employment minister, Patty Hajdu, have stressed that the policy was not intended to target religious groups.\n\nSpeaking at a town-hall meeting in Hamilton, Ontario, last week, Mr. Trudeau affirmed that Canadians were entitled to their beliefs. But he added: \u201cWhen those beliefs lead to actions determined to restrict a woman\u2019s right to control her own body, that\u2019s where I, and I think we, draw the line as a country. And that\u2019s where we stand on that.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Canada\u2019s Supreme Court struck down the country\u2019s then restrictive abortion law, which allowed only abortions approved by hospital committees. It said the law was unconstitutional and interfered with a woman\u2019s right to control her own body.", "title": "Linking Youth Funding to Abortion Rights Spawns Backlash in Canada and Beyond", "authors": []}

It\u2019s a fitting tie-in. During one recent season, her tag line during the show\u2019s title sequence was \u201cLife isn\u2019t all diamonds and ros\u00e9. But it should be.\u201d\n\nShe also uses her platform to champion causes important to her, like gay and lesbian equality, AIDS awareness and animal rights (she has seven dogs, two miniature ponies and eight swans). Last year she opened Vanderpump Dogs in Los Angeles, a rescue and shelter tricked out with luxurious trappings like velvet sofas and chandeliers.\n\nMs. Vanderpump ordered tea at the Plaza, but on the show she\u2019s best known for spilling it, aided by her quick wit and way with a bon mot. Upon seeing the hotel had yet to take down its Christmas trees a week into January, for example, she said, \u201cI liken Christmas decorations being up too long to watching a porno after an orgasm. It\u2019s just not the same.\u201d\n\nShe has honed a television persona charismatic enough to demand ample screen time without resorting to confrontational theatrics. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of being cold or removed, but I think that\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t as volatile or I don\u2019t have a knee-jerk reaction,\u201d she said, her hands glistening with jewels and her lips glossy and pink like a glazed French confection.\n\nShe remembers the first time she watched two co-stars verbally spar during filming. \u201cI sat there and thought, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like this in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter we stopped filming, I went to the elevator and thought, Oh God, I don\u2019t think I can do this. I phoned my husband and said, \u2018That was bizarre.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe paused and added: \u201cBut that was eight years ago.\u201d\n\nSince then, she has found herself at the center of plenty of arguments, broadcast for public consumption. And she hasn\u2019t made it out unscathed, either. At times she has been portrayed by her co-stars as outwardly warm but secretly Machiavellian.

The service would provide \u201cthe student loan customer with specific understanding of long-term dollars and cents ramification of making purchases using their student loan funds,\u201d the document states.\n\nThe program is part of the department\u2019s broader plan to modernize the system it uses to oversee 42 million borrowers annually. The card, for instance, would be a feature within the myStudentAid mobile app, which would allow students and their parents to complete federal aid applications from a phone and gain access to information about their loans, among other things, according to the document, which was prepared to solicit bids from banks and financial services providers.\n\nThe card industry has a long history of exploiting students on campus, charging fees at every turn. Higher One, in a particularly egregious example, aggressively marketed debit accounts littered with fees to college students \u2014 and was ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution for deceptive marketing and improper disclosures.\n\nThose kinds of practices led the Obama administration to issue, in 2015, stronger regulations that limited the fees companies could charge, among other protections.\n\nThe solicitation lists several fees that cannot be charged to students, including those for annual membership, activation and account maintenance. It would allow up to three free withdrawals from out-of-network automated teller machines before fees kicked in.\n\nConsumer advocates and some Democratic senators, however, have voiced concerns beyond fees, including how students\u2019 spending patterns and other data would be used \u2014 and whether their spending could be restricted to certain categories.

One prospect was a charming but decrepit \u2014 it lacked running water \u2014 three-family house on Sixth Avenue in Park Slope, an estate sale asking $2.3 million.\n\nThe idea for both families to purchase something together was short-lived; both wanted the top floor and the garden. \u201cWe were going to flip a coin,\u201d Ms. Chou said. \u201cWe saw obstacles brewing.\u201d Nobody wanted to risk their friendship if the deal soured.\n\nMr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou\u2019s friends ended up buying a condominium in Clinton Hill. The Park Slope house \u2014 too expensive to go it alone \u2014 later sold for $2.2 million.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt around the same time, Mr. Haralabides and Ms. Chou saw a small two-family \u2014 just 15 feet wide \u2014 on busy Ninth Street in Park Slope, asking $1.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt faced a 24-hour CVS Pharmacy.

Paper, $15.95.\n\nBorders are porous in Madeleine Thien\u2019s novel \u201cDogs at the Perimeter,\u201d both in the world and in the mind. The narrator is a neurological researcher whose carefully compartmentalized memories of her childhood in Cambodia living under the Khmer Rouge \u2014 the communist guerrillas whose reign of terror in the 1970s left an estimated 1.7 million dead \u2014 start to leak into her present day after a colleague disappears in search of a brother lost, like hers, in her home country. Timelines converge; suddenly nothing separates the woman in a lab in Montreal, sharing with her son the beauty of a neuron \u201clithe as a starburst,\u201d from the 8-year-old girl gazing up at a swarm of airplanes over Phnom Penh as the guerrillas close in.\n\nTo navigate the slippage in her mind, she turns to case studies of brain damage \u2014 a patient who \u201cceases to recognize faces, including her own,\u201d and a sufferer of asomatognosia, unable to detect the physical boundaries of her body while \u201cher thoughts continued, anchored to nothing.\u201d She recalls how, as a child in Phnom Penh, she gave all her dolls the same name: Vesna, after Vesna Vulovic, a Serbian flight attendant who survived a jetliner explosion in 1972, falling 33,000 feet over what was then Czechoslovakia . She even tapes a picture of Vesna \u2014 \u201clike a drop of rain or a very tiny bird, someone whom the gods had overlooked\u201d \u2014 to her wall when she arrives in Canada as a refugee, \u201cashamed that I had lived.\u201d\n\nHer own name, the name her parents gave her, is never revealed. Early on, a Khmer Rouge soldier urges her to \u201cbecome someone else\u201d and calls her Mei, an act of both erasure and protection, freeing her from the crimes of her educated parents. (\u201cFamilies are a disease of the past,\u201d says the Angkar, the Khmer Rouge leadership.) Later, in a foster home in Canada, she is reborn again as Janie. Both names hover over her awkwardly, like aliases. Once, \u201cin the temple schools, a new name had been a rite of passage, a bridge from one shore of life to the next,\u201d she muses. Now, \u201cnames were empty syllables, signifying nothing, lost as easily as a suit of clothes, a brother or a sister, an entire world.\u201d\n\nThe revision of history and the dismantling of the self under communism were central themes in Thien\u2019s 2016 novel of the Cultural Revolution, \u201cDo Not Say We Have Nothing,\u201d which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. \u201cDogs at the Perimeter,\u201d first published in Canada in 2011, reads like a seed of the later novel: contrapuntal and elegiac in tone, with a white heat beneath. Where \u201cDo Not Say We Have Nothing\u201d is symphonic and expansive, \u201cDogs at the Perimeter\u201d turns inward, to the workings of a mind in flight from itself.\n\nSuch are Thien\u2019s gifts that she can write lyrically about horror without stripping it of force. When bombs fall on Phnom Penh, Janie registers her brother\u2019s screaming as \u201ca wide emptiness, a pressure in the air blinding me, and in the darkness I hear a strange, familiar ticking \u2014 insects, the typewriter, a clock counting time.\u201d The hollowed-out bodies of refugees evoke \u201can exhumed cemetery.\u201d A dying friend appears insubstantial, \u201cas if the sea inside her had evaporated.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA curious fact about the Khmer Rouge: Although they condemned anyone who could read or write \u2014 eyeglasses were evidence enough \u2014 they kept thousands of pages of files, and every citizen was required to write a record of his or her life, naming and implicating family and friends. In the end, these memoirs were used as confessions, of crimes real or imagined. (\u201cIf you act correctly, you are the enemy, if you act incorrectly, you are the enemy,\u201d an officer says.) Janie\u2019s little brother, anointed at age 9 as an interrogator, listens as a tortured prisoner admits to being a spy and describes an America he\u2019s never seen, where people \u201clived on airplanes or underground, leaving the surface of the country empty as a sheet.\u201d The lesson still haunts Janie: \u201cthat the story of one\u2019s own life could not be trusted, that it could destroy you and all the people you loved.\u201d\n\nFour decades later, she must find another way to live with the past, to make room for her ghosts. Midway through the novel, she turns to the case of Lev Zasetsky, a Russian soldier who survived a shot to the head during the World War II Battle of Smolensk. Despite losing the ability to process language, he managed to keep a diary that eventually surpassed 3,000 pages. \u201cEach sentence required that he hunt through the disintegrated rooms of his memory, fumble blindly for words, the simplest words, hoarding them like gold dust until he had enough to construct a sentence,\u201d Thien writes. Zasetsky\u2019s doctor saw the diary as a way for his patient to not simply remember his life, but \u201cmake a wholeness of it.\u201d For Janie, the hope is the same.", "title": "Madeleine Thien\u2019s New Novel of Communist Occupation Turns Inward", "authors": ["Ligaya Mishan", "Madeleine Thien"]}

That\u2019s why it makes tennis so fun.\u201d\n\nShe was one game away from bamboozling Kerber, too, but after Hsieh took a 6-4, 5-4 lead, Kerber held serve to 5-5 and got the better of a series of grueling, extended exchanges: howling with release as she crouched low to hit a forehand winner down the line to break Hsieh\u2019s serve in the next game, taking command of the set and the momentum.\n\n\u201cI was running everywhere and she always had the answer,\u201d Kerber said on the court after closing out her ninth straight victory (13 if you count the Hopman Cup team event). \u201cWe will see a lot in 2018 from her, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nAsked about Kerber\u2019s comment, Hsieh moved two fingers across her field of vision, \u00e0 la John Travolta dancing in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cSo I will keep trying. Thank you.\u201d\n\nHsieh, who has won 19 doubles titles on the tour, had not reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the Australian Open in 2008.\n\nShe calls her style \u201cSu-wei style\u201d or \u201cfreestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike today, I go on the court, and if I don\u2019t have a plan, then I do whatever I can,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the ball comes, I decide at the last moment where to hit. So sometimes the girls say, \u2018Oh I don\u2019t know where she hit.\u2019 But sometimes I don\u2019t know where I hit, too.\u201d\n\nGarcia, a 24-year-old from France who propelled herself into the top 10 late last season with a series of attack-minded victories in Asia, winning two tournaments in China and reaching the semifinals of the WTA\u2019s year-end championships in Singapore.\n\nPhoto\n\nA back problem forced her to retire during her first tournament of this year in Brisbane, Australia, but Garcia looked fit and confident heading into Monday\u2019s duel. She opened the match by stepping inside the baseline to return aggressively, breaking Keys\u2019s intimidating serve in the first game.\n\nBut the 17th-seeded Keys bounced back to break Garcia, and then proceeded to play one of her finest matches in a major tournament.\n\nKeys, 22, reached her first major final at the United States Open last September but struggled to handle the moment, making errors in bunches and losing, 6-3, 6-0, to her compatriot and friend Sloane Stephens.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I was just really tired from all the late, emotional matches that I had. And then to have such a great two weeks and then have it end the way that it did, it was really devastating for me. So it definitely took some time to get over.\u201d\n\nStephens has yet to win another match since that victory, and Keys played only one more match in 2017, losing to Varvara Lepchenko in the opening round in Wuhan, China, before deciding to end her season early to focus on getting her postoperative wrist in ideal shape to start 2018.\n\nBut she also used her relatively long off-season to work on her conditioning, and it showed in the form of improved footwork, lateral speed and quickness against Garcia, who repeatedly tried to attack her traditional weaknesses without success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sharpness about her,\u201d said Sam Smith, the former British player, who is a television analyst for Seven Network in Australia. \u201cShe\u2019s getting to the ball a fraction faster, and the setup is more precise. Hence she is making fewer unforced errors.\u201d\n\nKeys still made 21 on Monday, but she also hit 32 winners, including nine aces, and managed to win the majority of the rallies, no matter what the length of the exchange.\n\nShe said she was playing \u201creally smart,\u201d but when asked if this was a new step for her, her answer was polite but clear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said smiling. \u201cI think I played pretty smart to get to the finals of the U.S. Open and win some titles. Hopefully it\u2019s just a little bit more consistently that way.\u201d\n\nKeys has had world-class power from the baseline since her midteens. It comes naturally, and it can be a double-edged sword as her flat strokes often leave her little margin for error.\n\nBut Smith believes that Keys, under the guidance of her coach, Lindsay Davenport, is able to hit with more topspin on the backhand side now, creating more clearance when Keys needs it.\n\n\u201cEach shot used to be an individual event,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut Lindsay Davenport has taught her how to play tennis.\u201d\n\nKeys, identified long ago as a potential champion, has had no shortage of guidance during her career. Her ability to control her nerves as well as her power will be decisive as she chases her first Grand Slam title.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBigger challenges await in the second week here, but she has yet to lose a set in four matches, or be pushed to a tiebreaker.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d said Keys, the last American woman in the singles tournament. \u201cI think I\u2019m playing well and especially in tight moments, handling my emotions well.\u201d\n\nAlso on Monday, Simona Halep cruised past Naomi Osaka, 6-3, 6-2.

And yet Kentucky\u2019s approach to Medicaid draws from a well-worn playbook, one from which both Republicans and Democrats have drawn to trim the social safety net over the years.\n\nKentucky was an eager participant in the last big so-called entitlement reform, visited upon the nation\u2019s poor just over two decades ago. Under that 1996 program directed at welfare benefits, the entitlement to federal assistance was replaced by a hodgepodge of programs managed by the states and financed by a fixed dollop of federal cash. Work requirements became the norm. And people got less help.\n\nThe number of families in poverty in Kentucky has budged little since then, declining to 116,000 from 132,000. But the number of families getting cash assistance has fallen by two-thirds. Today, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program covers only one of five poor families in the state. For a single mother with two children, it provides $262 a month \u2014 a third less than it did two decades ago, adjusted for inflation.\n\nAnd Kentucky is hardly the stingiest state. In 15 states, antipoverty cash benefits reach fewer than 10 percent of the families with children in poverty. In all of them, the change was sold as a way to encourage poor Americans to get off their backsides, get a job and prosper on their own \u2014 free of the clutches of the welfare state. Yet though it pushed many poor families into employment, it failed at mitigating their distress: Rarely do such families\u2019 breadwinners earn enough to move out of poverty.\n\nThe problem with the latest twist in Republicans\u2019 effort to pare the social safety net is that removing the poor\u2019s health insurance may not just make their life more difficult.\n\nIt might kill them.\n\nIt is well known by now that health insurance saves lives. A review of recent research in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that the odds of dying for non-elderly adults are between 3 and 41 percent higher for the uninsured than for the insured.\n\nWork by Katherine Baicker, now at the University of Chicago, with Benjamin Sommers and Arnold Epstein at Harvard found that Medicaid expansions in the past significantly reduced mortality. Their research, they concluded, \u201csuggests that 176 additional adults would need to be covered by Medicaid in order to prevent one death per year.\u201d", "title": "Making Medicaid a Tool for Moral Education May Let Some Die", "authors": []}

The only constant in the group\u2019s constantly changing lineup was the man at the center: Mark E. Smith.\n\nMr. Smith, the Fall\u2019s main songwriter and vocalist, died Wednesday morning at 60. His death was confirmed by Pam Vander, the band\u2019s manager, who said in a statement that the musician had died at his home.\n\nOver the band\u2019s nearly five-decade career, Mr. Smith unspooled caustic rants that could seem inscrutable until certain repeated phrases became mantras. (Think equal parts Lou Reed, \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d and the lovable crank at the corner of the bar.) The music behind him could drone or pound, pull in \u201960s garage, rockabilly or reggae \u2014 whatever Mr. Smith was into, really \u2014 and still sound instantly like the Fall.

A well-chosen 2004 compilation album was titled \u201c50,000 Fall Fans Can\u2019t Be Wrong.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the astringent sound and attitude of the Fall\u2019s early albums, with bottom-scraping bass lines under clattery, unswerving drumbeats and dissonant guitar, became a cornerstone of post-punk, echoing through bands like Sonic Youth, Pavement and Protomartyr. And the Fall found and built a loyal audience that welcomed the music\u2019s corrosive intent while it parsed the spite, mockery, allusions and non sequiturs in Mr. Smith\u2019s lyrics.\n\nOn Twitter, Cedric Bixler-Zavala of the Texas post-punk band At the Drive-In called Mr. Smith \u201cone of the pillars of influence for me as lyricist and troublemaker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThrough the Fall\u2019s studio albums and an avalanche of live recordings, the band\u2019s style changed often, as Mr. Smith, its founder and only constant, hired and often fired more than five dozen musicians.\n\nAt various points in the band\u2019s four-decade career, the Fall might sound like punk, hard rock, psychedelia, funk, blues-rock, jazz-rock, electropop or sheer noise. \u201cIf it\u2019s me and your granny on bongos, it\u2019s the Fall,\u201d Mr. Smith once declared. The BBC disc jockey John Peel, an early and steadfast supporter, said of the Fall that \u201cthey are always different, they are always the same.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Mr. Smith maintained his role as a brain-twisting wordsmith, a contentious bandleader and a perpetual irritant. In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, he boasted: \u201cPeople still cross the road from me; I\u2019ve still got that. I can clear a pub when I want to. It\u2019s a talent.\u201d\n\nMark Edward Smith was born in Salford, near Manchester, on March 5, 1957, and grew up in nearby Prestwich. After dropping out of school at 16, he was working as a shipping clerk and studying literature at night school when he saw the Sex Pistols in a sparsely attended show at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. He soon started his own band with friends. The Fall was named after an Albert Camus novel.\n\n\u201cWhen I formed the group,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote in his 2008 autobiography, \u201cRenegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E. Smith,\u201d \u201cit was because of sounds; of wanting to make something; combining primitive music with intelligent lyrics.\u201d\n\nThe Fall released its first EP, \u201cBingo-Master\u2019s Break-Out!,\u201d in 1978, and its debut album, \u201cLive at the Witch Trials,\u201d in 1979. Manchester was a center of post-punk innovation at the turn of the 1980s, with bands like Joy Division, the Durutti Column and the Smiths. But the Fall \u2014 although less popular and more abrasive \u2014 would outlast them all.\n\nThe Fall\u2019s closest approach to the rock mainstream, with songs featuring clear-cut beats, riffs and choruses, came in the 1980s, when the band\u2019s guitarists (and Mr. Smith\u2019s songwriting collaborators) were Craig Scanlon, who was in the Fall from 1979 to 1995, and Brix Smith, who was Mr. Smith\u2019s wife from 1983 to 1989, her initial tenure with the band, and rejoined for two 1990s albums.\n\nHer departure was followed by decades of fluctuations in the band\u2019s music, by turns obnoxious and illuminating. Mr. Smith also recorded outside the Fall with Gorillaz and Elastica, and he made an album in 2007 with the German electronic duo Mouse on Mars under the group name Von S\u00fcdenfed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Fall toured constantly through its four decades, playing sets that could be spellbinding or desultory. A notorious 1998 performance at Brownie\u2019s in the East Village included fistfights among the musicians.\n\nFor the Fall\u2019s final half-dozen albums, the lineup remained largely stable. From 2002 to 2016 the band included Elena Poulou, whom Mr. Smith married in 2001, on keyboards. They divorced in 2016.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Vander, Mr. Smith is survived by his mother, Irene, and three sisters, Caroline, Barbara and Susanne.\n\nMr. Smith garnered multiple reputations: as a drinker and a brawler, as a contrarian and an insult-slinger (particularly against politicians, institutions and other musicians), and as an artist and an experimenter. In concert, he disdained looking back or playing longtime fan favorites. The Fall\u2019s live sets usually drew only on the band\u2019s most recent recordings and even newer songs.\n\nIn his autobiography, Mr. Smith put it bluntly: \u201cThe Fall are about the present, and that\u2019s it.\u201d", "title": "Mark E.

It\u2019s a lot of wheeling and dealing, a lot of freelancers and subcontractors \u2014 it\u2019s really mostly people trying to make money. There\u2019s no strategy. Will they be able to show that the government funding was for hacking the Democratic National Committee? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think that Donald Trump is capable of holding a thought for more than three seconds, so how can we possibly imagine that he actually had some sort of sustained relationship that had an articulated strategy behind it?\n\nSo much has been made of Trump\u2019s affinity and respect for Putin. What do you think Putin thinks of Trump? I think that he feels disappointed. Putin really assumed that once Trump \u2014 who had such clear admiration for him \u2014 was elected, it would be convenient for Trump to change the relationship with Russia profoundly and instantly. On a larger scale, I think that it\u2019s very difficult for Putin to deal with an unpredictable interlocutor, because he has always been the madman on the international stage. Weirdly, I think it would have been easier for Putin to deal with Hillary Clinton, who would have been tough but very consistent.\n\nIn your essay \u201cAutocracy: Rules for Survival,\u201d your third rule was that institutions will not save you. What do you make of United States institutions in the last year? A lot of what we think of as democratic institutions are informal ones, like the White House press briefing. There is no law that guarantees press access to the White House. Communication was lessening during the Obama years. There was every reason to suspect that Trump was going to create an adversarial relationship and that people were going to be faced with the impossible dilemma between sort-of-complicity and access.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a strong pushback to that: It feels like a big news story drops every weekend. The question is how sustained and effective this pushback can be over the course of four or eight years. Institutions function in relationship to one another, so when you have an institution that is being destroyed, the system begins to tear. A great example of that is the travel ban \u2014 the reason the judiciary was able to act so quickly was that civil society, which is also an institution, had sprung into action. The whole democracy depends on its existence. We\u2019re seeing civil society fatigue with the different iterations of the travel ban, which is basically the exact same travel ban all over again, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m really worried about.

And even if we did, we lack a clear constitutional standard for what severity of impairment would render him unfit to serve. History has shown us that former presidents have suffered conditions hampering their mental function while still in office, including Ronald Reagan, Calvin Coolidge and Woodrow Wilson. Consider the case of Reagan: He was eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, but if he was beginning to show symptoms in his second term, as some believe he was, that did not preclude him from finishing his term.\n\nThe experiences of those presidents provide convincing evidence that, even if there weren\u2019t a tsunami of speculation about Mr. Trump\u2019s mental condition now, Congress should consider adopting policies to standardize, and to expand as needed, the scope of presidential medical exams to include neuropsychiatric assessments.\n\nAs I have written, disorders such as psychosis, dementia, depression and addiction commonly occur in people in the age range of presidents \u2014 and any of those, when severe enough, could damage a president\u2019s ability to discharge his or her duties. The 25th Amendment provides a process for transferring power from presidents deemed incompetent. However, we still lack a defined process for applying the 25th Amendment to a president who will not voluntarily submit to an examination to evaluate mental competence. We also lack clear criteria for what behavior warrants an intervention and transfer of power to the vice president.\n\nThe 25th Amendment has been invoked only a handful of times since its ratification in 1967. But except during the Watergate scandal, these incidents mainly involved giving vice presidents the power of the presidency while the president was undergoing medical procedures that included general anesthesia.\n\nThere is another problem with the current debate over Mr. Trump\u2019s mental condition: It assumes his behavior isn\u2019t voluntary, and that his shocking or \u201cunpresidential\u201d conduct is a symptom of mental illness. This kind of thinking contributes to the stigmatization of mental illness. It\u2019s entirely possible that he simply has certain personal qualities we don\u2019t find ideal in a leader, like being a narcissistic bully who lacks basic civility and common courtesies.

Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., and Pat Foye, the agency\u2019s president \u2014 claiming they were caught off-guard by the first call, organized their own conference call and were on the line playing defense.\n\nIt is \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cfalse,\u201d Mr. Lhota said for the city to claim the governor\u2019s plans were unilateral. The city, Mr. Lhota pointed out, has final veto power over the transit portion of the M.T.A.\u2019s capital plan. \u201cThey have the ultimate leverage,\u201d he said, \u201cthe ability to say no.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday in the Bronx, Mr. de Blasio weighed in on the latest skirmish. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make the point that we don\u2019t like the direction the M.T.A. is taking, and we\u2019re going to be speaking up about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe countdown clocks and the Wi-Fi and painting, having lights on bridges \u2014 all that stuff doesn\u2019t matter compared to your subway actually arriving where it\u2019s supposed to arrive on time.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office declined to comment on the interactions between the two men.\n\nThe bad blood between the governor and the mayor has included disputes over prekindergarten financing to a renegade deer apprehended in a Harlem building complex. But their protracted battle over the subway seems to have eclipsed all the others, even as riders complain that they have yet to see the kind of improvements Mr. Cuomo promised after he declared state of emergency on the subway last year.\n\nAnd the schism over the station overhauls is but a piece of the mayor\u2019s differing vision on the subway. The governor\u2019s proposal to allow special tax districts on developments near the subway as a way to help pay for the system is too broad in scope, according to the mayor\u2019s aides, and was done without consulting the city. During an appearance on a morning talk show on Wednesday, the mayor touted his plan to tax the richest New Yorkers, a so-called \u201cMillionaires Tax,\u201d to fund the subway, as more fair that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s notion to pay for it through congestion pricing, charging drivers a fee to enter Manhattan\u2019s business districts.\n\nOn Wednesday, the full M.T.A. board met at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and both camps came prepared. Late the night before, Mr. Lhota sent out an open letter. \u201cThe city claims no financial responsibility for the subway system that it owns and polices and is the lifeblood of the city\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s answer is simple \u2014 and he should just say it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to fund the subways and help riders. So be it.\u201d\n\nMs. Trottenberg came to the board meeting equipped with a handout: a list of subway stations the city said needed improvements compared with the governor\u2019s 33 selected stations \u2014 only three overlapped. (Her demand for an explanation about how the governor chose the stations slated for improvement were partially answered by Mr. Lhota, who said the stations were selected in part on the ease with which the improvements could be made to figure out best practices.)", "title": "Mayor Forces Delay of Cuomo\u2019s Plan to Renovate 33 Subway Stations", "authors": []}

The actress Ruby Rose commented that he was \u201clooking like a young Channing Tatum.\u201d The rapper Lil Wayne wrote, \u201cWow.\u201d \u201cPeople didn\u2019t start listening to my music until after my transition, which is funny because I had to really practice to regain my singing voice because my vocal cords had changed so drastically,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\n\nLatest Project In 2015, he started a clothing swap program in Michigan for transitioning men and women called T Is for Trans. But like most New Yorkers with small closets, he had to close up shop when he moved to the city.

Others, like the Duffins, have stumbled on theirs as they wander.\n\nAs anyone who regularly looks at a social media feed knows by now, millions more need never leave home or cross a border to find that uniquely familiar face on some obscure etching. They just upload a selfie and let technology do the sleuthing.\n\nThe app was available in 2015, but its arts matching feature was introduced in mid-December. Its popularity has quickly surged, and Instagram, Twitter and YouTube users have widely shared photos of both their art twins and those of celebrities, from William Shatner to Taylor Swift. Google estimates more than 20 million selfies have been uploaded using the new feature.\n\nDr. Duffin said he was amused by his moment with the unknown soldier, described by the museum as probably a more mythological than human figure. But the resemblance had an impact on his life after he posted the photograph on Twitter, where it was widely shared without identifying him by name.\n\n\u201cA month later, all of a sudden, it started to get a lot of play in the press,\u201d Dr. Duffin, a professor of music at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said in an interview. \u201cI would get email messages from people I had not heard from in years who knew immediately it was me.\u201d\n\nWith people seeking selfies that make a connection going back in time, museums are using the opportunity to engage with visitors.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeslie C. Denk, the director of external affairs for the Norton Simon Museum, said the museum had noticed some visitors posting photographs of themselves posing like works of art, particularly alongside sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cArt has the power to transport us through time, and so I think it\u2019s a joy to recognize ourselves, a friend or even a pet, in an artwork from centuries ago,\u201d she said.\n\nArt-twinning happens so often in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston that it hosts a fan favorite every week on Instagram. The most popular piece to pose with is \u201cLittle Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer,\u201d a sculpture by Edgar Degas.\n\n\u201cIn our galleries, visitors frequently seek out their museum doppelg\u00e4nger or attempt to mimic works of art \u2014 usually as they search for the perfect Instagram shot,\u201d said Katie Getchell, the deputy director and chief brand officer at the Boston museum.\n\nAt the Brooklyn Museum, selfies with artworks are also popular. \u201cThe success of Google\u2019s project comes as no surprise to me, or probably to anyone else who works in a museum,\u201d said Brooke Baldeschwiler, the museum\u2019s senior manager of digital communications. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple. People love to see themselves in art.\u201d\n\nIf human beings are obsessed with selfies, then the Google Arts and Culture app is the addiction\u2019s enabler for the art world. It does have its critics. Some people just find facial recognition software creepy, and the app is not available in Texas and Illinois, which have some of the country\u2019s strictest laws about the collection of biometric data, including selfies. The app also has mixed results, particularly when it comes to race, gender and age.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother got Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential portrait,\u201d said Patrick Lenihan, a spokesman for Google.\n\nA photo posted by (@joshgad) on Jan 17, 2017 at 7:30am PST\n\nFar from the virtual realm, Greco-Roman antiquities, Egyptian funerary portraits and the contemporary people who resemble them are being brought together in an exhibit in Canada called \u201cMy 2,000-Year-Old Double.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e de la Civilisation in Quebec City has narrowed down thousands of selfies to a few dozen people who resemble the artworks, arranging for them to be photographed in Montreal by Fran\u00e7ois Brunelle, whose previous projects include documenting people who look alike but are not twins.\n\nWesley Rowell, 57, who works in New York City, was one of them.\n\nHe will appear alongside his art twin, a sculpture of an unidentified man from the third century B.C.\n\n\u201cTo think about the lives, the generations, between him and me in New York City, is kind of bizarre,\u201d Mr. Rowell said. \u201cI keep going back to that human need, to feel like I am connected to everything that was before me.\u201d\n\nAmanda Bullis, 29, an actor who lives in Jersey City, was chosen for her similarity to a face carved onto a vessel, dating between 300 and 201 B.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Bullis sat for hours for hair and makeup. \u201cIn that moment I was able to embody her,\u201d she said, adding that it made her think about her ancestry. \u201cI just found it interesting that I am part of a larger humanity that has been evolving and changing, but largely the same, over thousands of years.\u201d\n\nDr. Duffin, the Ohio professor, said he did not think much more about his art twin after he posed with the painting in California.

{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the device.\n\nThe Highlights\n\nThe signature feature of the Mate 10 Pro is the processor, which has a dedicated part of its silicon specifically designed for artificial intelligence.\n\nThis allows the phone to crunch algorithms and do things like automatically recognize an object so that the camera can be adjusted to focus quickly and let in the right amount of light. Huawei also says A.I. allows the phone to maximize its performance: Periodically, it will automatically do maintenance, like clearing out old system files that might otherwise slow down the phone.\n\nThe camera is notable as well. Huawei teamed up with Leica, a popular camera maker, to develop the phone\u2019s dual-lens setup. Like phones from Apple and Samsung, the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s camera can create a so-called bokeh effect, where the two cameras work together to show the picture\u2019s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background.\n\nLike other modern smartphones, the Mate 10 Pro is water and dust resistant. But it also has an extra-large battery that Huawei says will last longer than that in many other phones. That\u2019s partly because of its A.I. processor, which examines how the battery is being used and changes resource allocation to prolong its life.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Mate 10 Pro also ships with a screen protector applied to its display, and inside the box there is a plastic protective case. These are thoughtful additions. The case absorbs the impact of drops, and the screen protector helps prevent scratches, which weaken the structural integrity of a display.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nIn my tests, the two best features of the Mate 10 Pro were the camera and battery. The least impressive was the display.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut let\u2019s start with the good stuff. In side-by-side comparisons with an iPhone X and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8+, the Mate 10 Pro came in second to Apple\u2019s offering in photo quality. All took nice photos, but the colors in the Galaxy S8+\u2019s pictures looked oversaturated, and while the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s photos appeared rich and clear, the shadow details looked better on the iPhone X.\n\nAs for the bokeh effect, also known as portrait mode, the Mate 10 Pro excelled at separating the subject from the background compared with the Galaxy S8+, but I still preferred the iPhone X because it did a better job at lighting up a person\u2019s face.\n\nThere was one area where the Mate 10 Pro was the clear winner: the battery. In my tests browsing the web over a cellular connection, Huawei\u2019s phone had roughly two hours more juice than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone X.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

Over all, text appeared crisper and websites more vibrant on the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy screens than they did on the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s display.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Mate 10 Pro is an impressive smartphone, but you probably aren\u2019t going to buy it even if you get your hands on it. The lower-resolution display is a major negative, as is the lack of carrier support.\n\nHuawei said that to get technical support for the Mate 10 Pro, you can call its hotline, and for repairs, you can ship your device to a center in Texas. That\u2019s still not ideal compared with the ease of strolling into an Apple store or your carrier\u2019s nearest location.\n\nPrivacy and trust are also important. In 2012, the House Intelligence Committee concluded that Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company, were a national security threat because of their attempts to extract sensitive data from American companies. And in 2016, security researchers discovered preinstalled software on some Huawei and ZTE phones that included a back door that sent all of a device\u2019s text messages to China every 72 hours. That feature was not intended for American phones, according to the company that made the software. But American lawmakers have been wary of Huawei.\n\nMost important, you will have to decide whether you trust Huawei. The onus is on you to carefully read Huawei\u2019s privacy policy and determine if you feel confident using this phone. In a statement, Huawei said that privacy and security were top priorities and that it complied with stringent privacy frameworks and regulations.\n\nAt CES, Huawei\u2019s Mr. Yu described how the company had previously overcome trust hurdles \u2014 including at home in China, where Huawei\u2019s smartphones were initially distrusted by Chinese carriers because the company was a newcomer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won the trust of the Chinese carriers, we won the trust of the developing market and we also won the global carriers, all the European and Japanese carriers.

In recent years, the Rundfunkchor has become something of a house choir for the Berlin Philharmonic, and won acclaim for its prominent role alongside that orchestra in Peter Sellars\u2019s well-traveled staging of Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d from 2010.\n\nSince 2015, the group has been steered by the 39-year-old Dutchman Gijs Leenaars, who previously led the Netherlands Radio Choir. \u201cClassical music is always under threat in Holland,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to drastic cuts to the country\u2019s cultural budget since 2011. \u201cIn this town,\u201d he continued, speaking of Berlin, \u201cculture has such a different position from what it means in my country. Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t notice it.\u201d\n\nThe Rundfunkchor regularly works with the city\u2019s orchestras but also develops its own projects, like an immersive version of Brahms\u2019s \u201cA German Requiem\u201d that came to New York for Lincoln Center\u2019s White Light Festival in 2016. In October, the ensemble opened the season with another striking production: A collaboration with the director and designer Robert Wilson, \u201cLuther: Dancing With the Gods\u201d explored the 500th anniversary of the Reformation with music by Bach, Knut Nystedt and Steve Reich backgrounding dramatic scenes.\n\n\u201cKirill who?\u201d some asked in the summer of 2015, when the Berlin Philharmonic selected a new chief conductor to succeed Simon Rattle. The Russian maestro Kirill Petrenko is held in high esteem throughout Europe, but he is far less known (and seen) outside of it. New York audiences will have the rare opportunity to experience his work in late March during a guest performance of the Bavarian State Opera, which he has led since 2013. On the program of his Carnegie Hall debut is \u201cDer Rosenkavalier\u201d by Strauss \u2014 for whom, along with Wagner, the conductor is especially revered.\n\nFor the 45-year-old Mr. Petrenko, who arrives in Berlin in the summer of 2019, the new job is something of a homecoming: Between 2002 and 2007, he was the general music director at the Komische Oper. But in part because of his reputation as an opera conductor, the philharmonic\u2019s decision caught many by surprise. Last March, he made his first appearance with the orchestra since his appointment in a program that included a smoldering performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sixth Symphony.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis orchestra has a burning ardor, which must sometimes be held in check in order to let it out at the right moment,\u201d the soft-spoken Mr. Petrenko told the cellist Olaf Maninger in a conversation taped for the orchestra\u2019s Digital Concert Hall platform. \u201cIf you know what potential this orchestra has, then as a conductor you want to acknowledge it,\u201d he added with a smile.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all these new leaders, Vladimir Jurowski, 45, the newly minted chief conductor of the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin (RSB), probably has the busiest international schedule: Since 2007, this fiery Russian has led the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He has another directorship in Moscow, conducts all over Europe and is the only conductor on this list to have significant experience with American orchestras.\n\nNor is he a stranger to Berlin. After studying at the Hanns Eisler conservatory there, he was a conductor at the Komische Oper from 1997 to 2001. And like Mr. Petrenko, Mr. Jurowski is an opera specialist. He spent a dozen years leading Glyndebourne (Mr. Ticciati is his successor) and won praise for performances of Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Frau ohne Schatten\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera in 2013 and Berg\u2019s \u201cWozzeck\u201d at last summer\u2019s Salzburg Festival.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So far his first season at the RBS \u2014 the oldest of Berlin\u2019s radio orchestras, founded in 1923 \u2014 included a thunderous performance of Mahler\u2019s \u201cResurrection\u201d Symphony (featuring the Rundfunkchor), as well as that composer\u2019s rarely heard orchestrations of Beethoven\u2019s Third and Fifth Symphonies. Mr. Juwoski \u201ccountered megalomania with a depth and tonal vastness that make many recordings look pale,\u201d the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote.\n\nAnyone following classical music in Berlin is aware of the flowering of the Komische Oper, the most rebellious and unconventional of the city\u2019s three opera houses, under its artistic director, Barrie Kosky. Next season the company welcomes Ainars Rubikis, a 39-year-old Latvian, as its general music director, a post once occupied by Kurt Masur (and by Mr. Petrenko).\n\nAfter winning conducting competitions in Bamberg, Germany, in 2010, and Salzburg, Austria, in 2011, Mr. Rubikis was the music director of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater in Russia from 2012 to 2014. This summer, he will make an early debut as the Komische\u2019s director with Mr. Kosky\u2019s production of Shostakovich\u2019s \u201cThe Nose.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNor is he Mr. Kosky\u2019s only youthful find. The house\u2019s new Kapellmeister (or, roughly, house conductor) Jordan de Souza, 29, opened the season with a gripping performance of Debussy\u2019s \u201cPell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande.\u201d\n\nMatthias Schulz, 40, the incoming general manager, or intendant, of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, is the only native German among Berlin\u2019s crop of young musical leaders. From 2012 to 2016, he led the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, and he is expected to draw on his background in both music (he is a classically trained pianist) and finance (he studied economics in his native Munich) as the manager of Berlin\u2019s oldest opera company. Unlike past intendants, however, Mr. Schulz will not stage operas for the company, which has just moved back to its historic home following a seven-year renovation.\n\nAccording to Mr. Barenboim, the music director since 1992, the Staatsoper is now making an effort to attract individual and corporate sponsorship in a country lacking a strong tradition of private philanthropy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in Europe, in Paris, here and in Chicago. I know both systems,\u201d Mr. Barenboim said. \u201cIn Chicago, it\u2019s zero public money, and in Berlin it\u2019s practically zero private money. And neither system can work in the world in the 21st century. It needs a mixture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Barenboim called Mr. Schulz\u2019s appointment, which was suggested by the outgoing general manager, J\u00fcrgen Flimm, a \u201cvery smooth transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very open-minded,\u201d Mr. Barenboim added. \u201cWe will continue to do new operas, to commission new pieces. We are attempting to start every season with something unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to show that artistic passion does not exclude economic sense,\u201d Mr. Schulz said.

Especially because she has proved, over the last few months, perfectly cognizant of the way dress can be used as an implicit form of messaging, wearing red Dior for her trip to France for Bastille Day, and Dolce & Gabbana to the G-7 in Sicily.\n\nAnd especially given the almost elated reception that greeted her decision to wear a bright pink pussy bow blouse for an appearance during the campaign after her husband\u2019s previous public sexual shaming, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which he made vulgar remarks about women. If she has paid any attention at all to public reaction (or if her team has), she cannot be ignorant of the fact that when she seems to use clothing as a subversive tool to suggest what she presumably cannot say, it provokes a groundswell of support.\n\nThough it was unclear at the time whether Mrs. Trump really understood the implications of that blouse choice, wearing a white suit to the State of the Union indicates that, indeed, she did. That when it comes to what she wears and what she means by it, she chooses her moments. Sometimes, such as at the Easter egg roll, it\u2019s just about a pretty dress. But other times, as this time, her fashion is accessorized with a pointed subtext.\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s dangled as a tease to those who would like to think it could mean more.\n\nBut taken together with the wardrobe choices of the Democrats and the Republicans, the first lady\u2019s white suit was the final piece of what appeared to be an unprecedentedly politicized use of dress during a State of the Union. Indeed, Ivanka Trump, in understated plaid Oscar de la Renta, was one of the rare people in the room who didn\u2019t seem to be using her clothes to communicate anything other than taking a back seat. The audience was theoretically supposed to be silent \u2014 the president was talking \u2014 but their clothes spoke for them.

In 2016, she again appeared on camera to dismiss an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording from 2005 \u2014 in which Mr. Trump bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals \u2014 as \u201cboy talk.\u201d Mrs. Trump has also defended her husband against claims brought by multiple women that he sexually assaulted them.\n\n\u201cI believe my husband, I believe my husband \u2014 it was all organized from the opposition,\u201d Mrs. Trump told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nAfter the story about Ms. Daniels, there was no such pushback from the East Wing, and little in the way of public statements.

On Friday, onlookers at the resort were directed by the Secret Service to move their vehicles to ensure a wide berth for Mrs. Trump, who needed a secure path from her residence to the spa.\n\nAttendees at a safari-themed fund-raiser held at the resort on Friday had hoped for an impromptu visit by the first lady, but were told Mrs. Trump had left just before the event began.

The charismatic Charlotte van Bervessel\u00e8s set the tone with a sharply drawn Achilles in \u201cIliade\u201d; Helen and Andromache, two female archetypes in Greek mythology, are played by men.\n\nAlong the way, Ms. Bayle toys with the audience\u2019s expectations, and she does so in a straightforward manner, without playing the gender swaps for laughs. Nor do they compromise her adaptation of the text, which juggles between modernized dialogue and precise translations of Homer\u2019s lyrical verse. In lieu of props, red paint signals the blood being shed, and glitter the characters\u2019 armor. The spare sets proved limiting for some of Ulysses\u2019 fantastical encounters, but \u201cIliade\u201d and \u201cOdyss\u00e9e\u201d are winning examples of forward-looking storytelling.\n\nWhile Ms. Stavisky\u2019s \u201cTableau d\u2019une execution,\u201d a staging of Howard Barker\u2019s 1984 play \u201cScenes from an Execution,\u201d is more conventional in its form, its heroine Galactia, an uncompromising, freethinking painter in Renaissance Venice, remains a startling creation. She responds to a public commission with a savage painting that offends Venice\u2019s ruler, the Doge \u2014 until local officials find a way to harness its power to their advantage.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is a subtle tale of power relations, and Ms. Stavisky, the director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins in Lyon, channeled it into an elegant production, performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Rond-Point here in Paris. Franck Th\u00e9venon\u2019s painterly lighting enhanced the semirealistic sets. Yards of red fabric draped across the stage stood for Galactia\u2019s elusive masterpiece, a wise choice that left the cast free to fill the space.\n\nThe role of Galactia was originally written for Glenda Jackson, and requires a rare mix of fearlessness and maturity. In Paris, Christiane Cohendy, an award-winning actress whose career stretches five decades, was brilliantly oblivious to other people\u2019s expectations throughout, with a mordant edge. Galactia is punished for her transgression, but only temporarily: The twists and turns paint a compellingly nuanced picture of a conservative society, and Ms. Cohendy\u2019s portrayal is attuned to the audacity and cost of a woman\u2019s artistic ambitions in it.\n\nFemale directors do not necessarily bring feel-good feminism to the stage, however, and other plays explored more unsettling territory. \u201cLa Maladie de la mort,\u201d Marguerite Duras\u2019s 1982 novella, is especially intriguing material in the hands of Ms. Mitchell, an outspoken feminist who once called Shakespeare\u2019s gender politics \u201cexecrable.\u201d Ms. Duras, one of the most distinctive voices in 20th-century French fiction, operated on the essentialist premise that men and women are fundamentally unalike, and some of her works have rapidly acquired a dated feel in that regard.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cLa Maladie de la mort\u201d (\u201cThe Malady of Death\u201d) shows the sort of relationship that fascinates Ms. Duras: A man pays a woman to spend nights with him in order to learn \u201chow to love.\u201d Along the way, there is talk of submission and violent penetration, and we are told that her body \u201ccalls for strangling, for rape.\u201d If you\u2019re inclined to follow Ms. Duras\u2019s reasoning, the woman\u2019s passive assent is a form of mercy: The man is marked by the \u201cmalady of death,\u201d and therefore doomed.\n\nMs. Duras left instructions at the end of the novella for a potential theater adaptation, but Ms. Mitchell doesn\u2019t follow them in her new production at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord (part of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville\u2019s season). While the strong stamp she puts on the texts she works with hasn\u2019t always been popular in her native Britain, she is right at home in France, where director-dominated theater is the norm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Mitchell\u2019s is a shrewd reading of \u201cLa Maladie de la mort,\u201d billed here as a \u201clive cinema performance.\u201d In the lead roles, Laetitia Dosch and Nick Fletcher move around the sets \u2014 a hotel room, and the corridor outside it \u2014 with a crew of cameramen and technicians, while a narrator fills in the blanks. The film, occasionally interspersed with prerecorded footage, is shown on a screen above the stage.\n\nThe overall effect is to radically remove anything erotic from Ms. Duras\u2019s text. The sex scenes are obviously faked for the cameras; close-ups linger on Ms. Dosch\u2019s expressive face as she reacts to the man\u2019s demands with a mixture of disgust and practicality. She clearly plays along for the money \u2014 her life outside the hotel room is hinted at repeatedly, and a son introduced by Ms. Mitchell near the end. In that sense, Ms. Duras\u2019s ambiguous heroine gains depth and agency, and the production rejuvenates \u201cLa Maladie de la mort\u201d in the process.\n\nMs. Duras famously grew up in French Indochina, but aside from her, few French artists have grappled with the legacy of France\u2019s colonial rule over this region of Vietnam. Enter Ms. Guiela Nguyen, who wrote and directed \u201cSaigon,\u201d currently installed at the Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Europe, where she is an associate artist.\n\nThis poignant saga follows interconnected characters from Vietnam in 1956, as the last French troops prepare to depart, to Paris in 1996. Performed in a mix of French and Vietnamese, it makes plain the intimate pain wrought by colonial arrogance, culture clashes and exile.\n\nAs Marie-Antoinette, the cook who runs the Saigon and Paris restaurants in which the story unfolds, the diminutive Anh-Tran Nghia gives an especially mighty performance. \u201cThat\u2019s how stories are told in Vietnam \u2014 with a lot of tears,\u201d Ms. Guiela Nguyen concludes wistfully. More of these hidden stories remain to be unearthed, and women may well take the lead.", "title": "Men Dominate French Theater, but Talented Women Abound", "authors": ["Laura Cappelle"]}

This time, the barrier was not breached. Other times, Mr. Walton has had to patch holes in the wire, stabilize a post or untangle an offending kangaroo.\n\nThe idea of the dingo fence is simple: to keep feral dogs and dingoes on one side of the wire and vulnerable sheep farms on the other.

Her father was a formidable figure, and her mother was even more terrifyingly important in her life. Absent, but the absence was important. Katharine Graham was someone who was a product of her time. It was the whole culture that undermined all women, especially women that should\u2019ve had the most agency of all \u2014 highly educated wealthy women who had every opportunity to step into important places in life but they sat back. The more I read about her, the more I thought, \u201cWho do you think you are trying to be \u2014 Katharine Graham?\u201d She was so thoughtful, deep-principled and wily in that way that women had to be when they were only the second tier of a society.\n\nHANKS There was that moment where the men stayed and talked about policy and current events, and the women went in the other room.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that still happened in the early \u201970s.\n\nSTREEP You have to remember that I was in graduate school when I was first allowed to get a credit card without a male family member signing for me.\n\nThe film is a model for men and women working together respectfully, which, who would have thunk it, is what we need, that good example.\n\nSTREEP Yeah, but just think if I had been the managing editor of The Washington Post and you had been my publisher.

The last three years have been the hottest since record-keeping began in the 19th century, and there\u2019s little room in Trump\u2019s plan for energy sources that treat the planet kindly.

Florida has already applied for a waiver from such drilling. More supply could lower prices, in turn discouraging investments in renewables such as solar and wind.

The goal is not to get people moving again in cars, but to do everything possible to get them moving without cars.\n\nNew York must increase the size and quantity of bike lanes to make it easier for people to get around. Dockless bike-share programs are crucial for this. Charging for driving is not enough, and New York needs to eliminate all free on-street parking as a further way to get cars off the road. Charging drop-off fees for ride-sharing services is critical to get people out of cars.\n\nAnd, of course, New York needs a revitalized public transit system, with particular focus on improving the aging and neglected subways.

It\u2019s now become a showcase of sorts for the restrained, provenance-infused modernism that Brechbuehler, 39, and Highsmith, 35, have espoused since founding their interior, building and lighting firm with fellow Rhode Island School of Design alum Ryan Mahoney almost a decade ago. In recent years, Workstead has been turning its attention increasingly southward \u2014 in 2016, they finished the transformation of a midcentury-era Charleston government building into the majestic Dewberry Hotel, complete with a Rubenesque brass cocktail bar and cypress-clad spa.\n\nThe firm\u2019s nearby Workstead House, as it\u2019s now known, doubles as a pied-\u00e0-terre for its owner and an events space for the couple who designed it, whose own second home is also in town. \u201cWe immediately fell in love with the grandness of the space,\u201d Brechbuehler says of the five-bedroom manor, which was built as a private residence in 1853, later served as a warehouse for Civil War contraband and then belonged to George A. Trenholm, a 19th-century politician who was reported to be the author Margaret Mitchell\u2019s muse for Rhett Butler in \u201cGone With The Wind.\u201d\n\nWhat daunted other buyers \u2014 namely that all 5,600 square feet of the site, which comes with its own carriage house, needed to be totally reworked \u2014 Brechbuehler and Highsmith relished. After installing new plumbing and wiring throughout, they forensically restored the original doors, windows, stairwell and heart-pine flooring with the help of local craftspeople. Once the interior architecture was complete, they painted most of the rooms a honeyed-stone hue (Farrow & Ball\u2019s Savage Ground) and began filling the space with brass lighting, cabinetry and furniture of their own design, sparely adding antiques and art objects found on their travels (the elegant 19th-century oil painting by Franklin Tuttle in the parlor is the result of a particularly fruitful trip to Savannah). \u201cWe detest the idea of the \u2018instant house,\u2019\u201d Highsmith says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the ritual involved in giving a space real personality, which takes time.\u201d And with the carriage house still to complete, they\u2019re in no rush \u2014 if anything, it\u2019s a chance to trade the bleakness of another Brooklyn winter for some much-needed Southern heat.", "title": "Modernizing a Southern Home Without Losing Its Charm", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Modi is following a similar path in India, as he looks to nurture growth in his sprawling economy and to create jobs.\n\nLast month, India\u2019s government imposed stiff tariffs on imports of cellphones, video cameras and televisions. The move put heavy pressure on Apple, which ships most of the iPhones it sells in India from China, to do more manufacturing in India.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s government is also considering a recommendation by India\u2019s Directorate General of Safeguards, Customs and Central Excise that the country impose 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels. Such a move would appear to conflict with Mr. Modi\u2019s call here for international action on climate change. Introducing such stiff tariffs could well encourage the production of more solar panels in India, but it could also make solar power far more expensive for Indian consumers and, in turn, hurt the fight against climate change.\n\nAt 70 percent, the tariffs that India is considering on imported solar panels would be more than double those that the Trump administration said on Monday it would impose on such panels. Mr. Modi did not indicate in his speech what his government might decide on the issue.\n\nThe Trump administration faces a dilemma of its own over whether to follow India\u2019s lead in placing tariffs on consumer electronics. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers are considering whether to limit imports of such goods from China amid a broader dispute over whether Chinese companies are systematically violating American intellectual property.\n\nMark Wu, a former trade negotiator for the United States who is now an assistant professor of trade law at Harvard University and who attended Mr. Modi\u2019s speech, said India faced a challenge in terms of imports: attracting foreign manufacturers without appearing to violate international trade norms.\n\n\u201cWhile the prime minister articulated all the right messages on globalization at Davos, his government remains firmly committed to a strategy of leveraging its market size to drive industrial policies to spur greater high-tech manufacturing in India,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThis is bound to cause greater trade frictions ahead.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Pollution in India, which is at least a decade behind China in raising its citizens\u2019 standard of living, continues to increase.\n\nA ranking of countries on pollution and ecosystem protection released here on Tuesday showed India falling to 177 out of 180, down from 156 two years ago. By comparison, China was No. 120 on the list, which was compiled by Yale\u2019s Center for Environmental Law and Policy.\n\n\u201cThey are driving economic growth, but not paying attention to what I would call the parallel challenge of sustainable development: avoiding environmental degradation,\u201d Daniel Esty, the center\u2019s director, said of India.\n\nAs in the United States, industrial policies in India meant to foster domestic manufacturing can collide with a push by environmentalists and clean-energy electric utilities for solar panels, even imported ones, to be deployed as widely and as cheaply as possible. Among the other people attending Mr. Modi\u2019s speech was Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive of ReNew Power Ventures, a company based on the outskirts of New Delhi that builds clean energy projects.\n\nMr. Sinha said he admired Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts to make it easier for foreign and domestic companies alike to do business in India. But he said he also worried that if the recommendation for 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels were adopted, solar energy could become unaffordable for many Indians.\n\n\u201cThe person buying the power would like the cost of the power to be as low as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nDevendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, the vast Indian state that includes Mumbai and big manufacturing cities like Pune, also attended Mr. Modi\u2019s speech. He said that he saw growing interest among companies from outside India to manufacture in the country. Foxconn, the giant Taiwanese manufacturer that produces the bulk of Apple\u2019s consumer electronics, is in negotiations with Maharashtra officials to set up a large factory there.\n\nMaharashtra has offered Foxconn land at a major Mumbai port as a way of addressing the company\u2019s concerns about transportation links, Mr. Fadnavis said. But he also offered a strong defense of India\u2019s tariffs on imports, saying that the country\u2019s large number of poor farmers made it important to proceed carefully.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe want to open the door,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we want to protect our domestic concerns, like food security and the farmers.\u201d", "title": "Modi, in Davos, Praises Globalization Without Noting India\u2019s Trade Barriers", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"]}

And it seems about time for Dimitrov to take those words to heart in a major tournament.\n\nFor all his evident ability and athleticism, he has yet to reach a Grand Slam singles final. For all the miles he has traveled and high-profile mentors he has consulted in his journey to excellence that began in his native Bulgaria, he has not yet had the psychic payoff he seeks in an era dominated by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n\nBut momentum is building. Dimitrov won his most prestigious title at the end of last season: the ATP Tour World Finals in London. And though he struggled in the early rounds of this tournament with his one-handed backhand and second serve, hitting 29 double faults in his first three matches, he was much more precise and resolute against the prodigiously unpredictable Kyrgios.\n\n\u201cThat match was incredibly intense, and I think the best man won,\u201d said Patrick Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, as he stood in a corridor in Rod Laver Arena in the aftermath.\n\nMouratoglou once advised Dimitrov when he trained as a teenager at Mouratoglou\u2019s French academy. Mouratoglou, ever the talent scout, spotted Dimitrov at the prestigious junior tournament, Les Petits As, in Tarbes, France.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe is more solid here now,\u201d Mouratoglou said, tapping his temple. \u201cMuch more stable.\n\n\u201cHe works a lot, is quite consistent in his habits and has created a very solid base for himself. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same thing on the other side of the net. In the important moments, that plays a role.\u201d\n\nMouratoglou was referring to Kyrgios, a 22-year-old Australian who continues to resist hiring a full-time coach after working intermittently with the former French star Sebastien Grosjean last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I wouldn\u2019t have been able to personally concentrate.\u201d\n\nYou saw Kyrgios doing a whole lot more than that on Sunday: bantering with his box, complaining loudly about having a racket with the wrong string tension, turning routine shots into more difficult ones and difficult shots into routine ones.\n\nBut Kyrgios, who beat Dimitrov on his way to the Brisbane title a few weeks ago, looked much more settled than he did last January. In winning three matches at the Australian Open, he has already won more Grand Slam singles matches in 2018 than he won in all of 2017.\n\n\u201cI lost tonight to one of the best players in the world, went down swinging,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cObviously I feel a lot better this time around. Last year I really didn\u2019t know what I was going to do after the Australian Open. I feel like I have more of a vision and a goal for this year. I think I\u2019m in a good head space.\u201d\n\nIf so, that bodes ill for the opposition, even if Kyrgios wished no ill on the friend who had to dig so deep to beat him in the fourth round.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think he lacks a bit of belief,\u201d Kyrgios said of Dimitrov. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s got the game, and he\u2019s proved to everyone that he can win one of these Slams. So I just told him to believe in himself and hopefully he can go all the way.\u201d\n\nTo advance, Dimitrov will need to defeat Kyle Edmund, the unseeded British surprise, in the quarterfinals and then either Nadal or Marin Cilic in the semifinals. Dimitrov lost to Nadal in a classic semifinal here last year that lasted nearly five hours. He could face Federer or Djokovic in the final.\n\nThat sounds like quite a challenge, but if Dimitrov can shore up his serve and replicate the blend of offense and defense he showed on Sunday night, he has a chance.\n\nWell after midnight, I asked him what he learned about himself in the match.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fair question,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned that I can, you know, switch to another gear when I really need it.\u201d", "title": "Momentum Builds Toward Grigor Dimitrov\u2019s Grand Slam Breakthrough", "authors": ["Christopher Clarey", "On Tennis"]}

In 2018, bankers say they expect another big year of investment, targeted more at sectors considered important to future economic growth like high technology and renewable energy.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for an expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, the multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security and that rejected the MoneyGram-Ant Financial plan.\n\nIn 2016, American concerns over China\u2019s interest in microchips scotched some Chinese purchases, and last year Mr. Trump blocked the purchase of Lattice Semiconductors by a group with links to China.\n\nThe deal\u2019s demise also illustrates rising concerns in both the United States and China over sensitive personal data. In buying a large-scale money-transfer company like MoneyGram, Ant Financial would have had access to a large number of records of financial flows within the United States. That fact, combined with close ties to China\u2019s government, could have created security problems. For example, the flow of funds could point to possible espionage targets in the United States military who face financial difficulties.", "title": "MoneyGram and Ant Financial Call Off Merger, Citing Regulatory Concerns", "authors": []}

When it overwhelms me, which is less often than it did when I was an undergraduate, I have to force myself to step back and make an accurate assessment of how important the task is and consider it thoughtfully rather than emotionally \u2014 like, how good does it have to be?\u201d\n\nWhen she finds herself procrastinating until a deadline, she repeats a maxim favored by a high school teacher: Do the best that you can in the time that you have.\n\nMs. Miller said that when she\u2019s stressed and anxious she turns to her close friends for comfort and support, and also to her mother, whose perfectionism, like her own, is mostly self-prescribed. Mother and daughter share a kind of presentational perfectionism, especially about public speaking. Ms. Miller said that her mother \u201cgets over it the same way she tells me to: Prepare thoroughly and it will carry you through.\u201d\n\nIf you are a parent concerned about perfectionist tendencies in your child, the questions posed by the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, used in the study, may be informative. Among its 44 items, scaled from 1 (disagree) to 7 (agree), are statements like these: When I am working on something, I can\u2019t relax unless it\u2019s perfect; The people around me expect me to succeed at everything I do; The better I do, the better I am expected to do. The scale is not a clinical instrument, but the questions might be a good starting point for discussion.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how much social media is affecting your child\u2019s self-image; many feel enormous pressure to be perfect off line, too. And it\u2019s difficult to know what, if anything, parents can do about it, beyond offering empathy, reassurance and emotional support.\n\nIf they\u2019ve been here before, remind them that perfect wasn\u2019t the goal; good enough was, and it did the trick. (\u201cRemember the way you felt before your SATs, and how well you did?\u201d) Make sure it\u2019s their perfectionism you\u2019re worried about, not yours. And stay in touch without hovering. If they seem really anxious for more than a week, suggest they seek counseling, or contact the school to ask whether the department of student life might sponsor a program about perfectionism.\n\nAnd meanwhile, send care packages.

He drew for his student newspaper while in elementary school, began selling cartoons to magazines at 14 and became the chief editorial designer for Hallmark greeting cards at 18. He continued his sketching while in the Army in Italy, working in intelligence and later commanding a camp holding German prisoners of war.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Missouri in 1948, edited fan and humor magazines for Dell Publishing and sold cartoons of his own to leading magazines before a Saturday Evening Post editor named John Bailey urged him to create a cartoon series revolving around his fraternity brothers from college. Mr. Walker later gave the character deriving from Spider the surname Bailey to honor the editor who inspired his college-themed cartoons.\n\nMr. Walker modeled the character after a high school and college buddy who was tall and thin and often got into trouble innocently. The overweight, snaggletoothed Sarge was based on a sergeant Mr. Walker once encountered. The cast at Camp Swampy also included Sarge\u2019s uniformed canine sidekick Otto and General Halftrack\u2019s sexy secretary Miss Buxley.\n\nMr. Walker had long been urged to include a black character, but felt he would draw complaints if he made the figure an oddball like the others at Camp Swampy. He decided to create an officer with an Afro who liked wild clothing, introducing Lt. Jack Flap in the early 1970s.\n\n\u201cThere was an initial fuss from people who either thought I was propagandizing or ridiculing blacks,\u201d Mr. Walker remembered. \u201cStars and Stripes banned me again and Senator Proxmire had to convince them to reinstate me,\u201d he continued, referring to William Proxmire of Wisconsin.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe later added an Asian-American character, Corporal Yo, and a high-tech warrant officer, Chip Gizmo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always changes,\u201d Greg Walker told CBS News in 2015. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a cellphone now, and computers and all that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Walker received the National Cartoonists Society\u2019s award for outstanding cartoonist of the year for 1953. He was invited to the Pentagon in 2000 to receive the Secretary of the Army\u2019s highest award to a civilian, the Distinguished Civilian Service citation. A life-size statue of Beetle Bailey, cast in bronze, stands outside the alumni center at the University of Missouri.\n\nMr. Walker worked with his associates Jerry Dumas, Bob Gustafson and Bud Jones as well as several of his children in creating gag ideas. In addition to \u201cBeetle Bailey\u201d he created \u201cHi and Lois,\u201d with Dik Browne, based on Mr. Walker\u2019s family members\u2019 lives; \u201cBoner\u2019s Ark,\u201d featuring quirky animals and their search for dry land; and \u201cSam\u2019s Strip,\u201d about a comic strip character running his own comic strip. He founded \u201cSam\u2019s Strip\u201d with Mr. Dumas, who later took over and renamed it \u201cSam and Silo.\u201d\n\nWorking from a home and studio in Stamford that once belonged to Gutzon Borglum, the Mount Rushmore sculptor, Mr. Walker was also a comic strip historian and preservationist. In 1974, he opened the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Greenwich, Conn. Its extensive collection of drawings and books, including creations of Walt Disney, Charles Schulz, Walt Kelly and Rube Goldberg, was later housed in Rye Brook, N.Y., and in Boca Raton, Fla., and is now at Ohio State University in Columbus as part of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum.\n\nBesides his sons Brian and Greg, survivors include his second wife, Catherine Carty; two stepchildren, Priscilla Prentice and Whitney Prentice; and his children Polly, Margie, Neal and Roger from his marriage to his first wife, the former Jean Suffill, which ended in divorce.\n\n\u201cBeetle Bailey\u201d used the Army as its setting, but its popularity derived from everyday life and the universal battles against authority figures and mindless bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cIt deals primarily with working, playing, eating and sleeping,\u201d Mr. Dumas, who began working with Mr. Walker in the 1950s, told The New York Times in 2000. \u201cThat means it can be understood and related to by people all over the world.\u201d\n\nWhen the Defense Department congratulated Mr. Walker on his 80th birthday, he said: \u201cHuman frailty is what humor is all about.

In high school, the \u201csaving\u201d topic should include how much a student would need to save to buy a car, and explore how inflation affects the purchasing power of savings.\n\nShouldn\u2019t children learn about money at home?\n\nIdeally, Mr. Pelletier said, children would begin learning about financial concepts from their parents, but that\u2019s not necessarily happening. A T. Rowe Price survey last year found that more than two-thirds of parents were reluctant to discuss money topics with their children.\n\nParents may be hesitant because they have made poor decisions themselves in the past, Ms. Levine said. Still, she said, parents should try to talk about spending and budgeting \u2014 starting, perhaps, by explaining why the family made a certain budget decision.

It can hardly be coincidental that \u2014 wearing his trademark stovepipe hat \u2014 the nation\u2019s destined savior, Abraham Lincoln (Henry Fonda, given a prosthetic nose), arrives in the rowdy western town of Springfield, Ill., like Jesus, riding on a mule.\n\nThe movie, which has a script by Lamar Trotti (a Southerner who would win an Oscar for writing another presidential biopic, \u201cWilson\u201d), opens after a few bars of \u201cRally \u2019Round the Flag\u201d in 1832 in bucolic New Salem, Ill. There the future president is introduced as a gentle force of nature, rehearsing a political speech for a group of giggling kids, studying his law books beneath a tree and shyly courting Ann Rutledge (Pauline Moore, later to play opposite Roy Rogers in Republic Pictures B-westerns). Ann\u2019s death, handled with masterly tact, is the catalyst that sends Lincoln to practice law in Springfield.\n\nBoth salty and sentimental, \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln\u201d establishes its subject as a folk hero. Fonda, a 20th Century Fox contract player known mainly for portraying juveniles, evidently hesitated to take the role. His diffidence blends well with his shambling characterization and Ford\u2019s unhurried tempo. Not unlike the political humorist Will Rogers, who appeared in three films for Ford, Fonda\u2019s homespun Lincoln uses reason and humor \u2014 as well as knowledge of Scripture \u2014 to make his case. (The climactic trial is loosely based on the Duff Armstrong case in which Lincoln, then a defense attorney, made strategic use of an almanac to discredit a witness.) He also persuades by asserting his physical strength and even employs sleight of hand, cheating to win a Fourth of July tug of war.\n\nAs modest as it seems, \u201cYoung Mr. Lincoln\u201d was generally overlooked when it was released during a year that also brought \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cWuthering Heights,\u201d \u201cNinotchka,\u201d \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington\u201d and Ford\u2019s own \u201cStagecoach,\u201d as well as the outbreak of war in Europe.

That is true not only of Norwegians but also of penniless refugees from impoverished, war-torn countries, such as my father \u2014 a Polish-Armenian fleeing Eastern Europe, whose first purchase in the U.S. was a Sunday New York Times to teach himself English.\n\nTrump once showed a willingness to be big-hearted to immigrants who break the rules: He married Melania, a Slovenian who came to the U.S. on a visitor visa and then earned money as a model before she was authorized to work, according to an investigation by The Associated Press.\n\nIf only Trump could show a similar compassion to unauthorized immigrants who don\u2019t look like Melania. In particular, his decision to send Salvadorans back, in the face of murderous gang violence in that country, and his rejection of a bipartisan deal to protect DACA \u201cDreamers,\u201d simply seem cruel.\n\nSo what can we do?\n\nObviously, we need to stand up to racist xenophobia even when it emanates from the White House \u2014 particularly when it emanates from the White House \u2014 and in addition, if Americans are looking for a constructive way to respond, here\u2019s a suggestion: Donate to an immigrant rights organization like the National Immigration Law Center, or to an aid group that works with people whom our president just insulted.\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand and admired the work of two American aid organizations that save lives in Haiti from tuberculosis, cervical cancer and more. They are Partners in Health and Innovating Health International. Both are working heroically on the front lines to save the lives of ordinary Haitians, particularly women.\n\nIt seems to me that a fine, practical response to racism is to help save a life.\n\n\u2022\n\nI\u2019m delighted to announce that the winner of my 2018 win-a-trip contest, to take a university student with me on a reporting trip, is Tyler Pager, a graduate of Northwestern University now studying at Oxford.

But foreign appliance manufacturers like Samsung and LG have already built or are building factories for washing machines in the United States. So any advantage Whirlpool might enjoy could fade away as a new Samsung factory in South Carolina and an LG factory under construction in Tennessee begin churning out machines, creating more competition.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed the tariffs in response to complaints by domestic manufacturers \u2014 Suniva and SolarWorld in the solar case and Whirlpool in the washing machine case \u2014 that competition from a surge of imports had hurt their businesses. The tariffs on solar products last four years starting at 30 percent, falling to 15 percent in the fourth year. Each year, the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported into the country will be exempt from the tariffs. The washing machine tariffs last three years and start at 20 percent on the first 1.2 million units and 50 percent for the rest, declining to 16 percent and 40 percent in the third year.\n\nThe tariffs, though, could have a domino effect. The Trump administration imposed them under a federal trade law that allows the president to protect, or \u201csafeguard,\u201d domestic industries hurt by imports. Other countries will very likely challenge these tariffs at the World Trade Organization and seek to impose retaliatory tariffs against American exports.\n\nMr. Trump is hardly the first president to use tariffs to help domestic industries. Barack Obama and George W. Bush took similar actions to help the tire and steel businesses respectively. But those presidents also tried to strike trade agreements with other countries, with varying degrees of success.\n\nMr. Trump seems uninterested in the painstaking diplomacy and negotiation such agreements require. Just look at his threats in recent months to withdraw the United States from the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement should Canada and Mexico not quickly agree to changes his administration is demanding.\n\nThe White House needs to put forward a coherent and convincing trade policy if Mr. Trump wants to do right by his working-class supporters.

At the same time, Mr. Zinke proposes to roll back safety regulations for offshore drilling rigs put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout, an extraordinary act of corporate misconduct that not only fouled the Gulf of Mexico but also eventually cost BP a tidy $61 billion in cleanup costs, federal penalties and reparations to individuals and businesses.\n\nIs there not something wrong with that picture? Much has been made of the damage Mr. Zinke\u2019s orders will do to Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy, already under attack throughout the Trump administration.

As if in allusion to that fact, her show this week was held in a warehouse adjoining the Prada Foundation, on the southern outskirts of the city. The warehouse may or may not be the actual depot for designer\u2019s world-class collection of contemporary art. And while it is certainly conceivable that the stacks of crates stenciled with \u201cThis Side Up\u201d arrows and the Prada name rendered backward contained untold millions worth of contemporary art, they might just as easily have been empty.\n\nKeeping people guessing is one of Ms. Prada\u2019s fallback strategies. Particularly in a conservative city and in an industry that prizes continuity over innovation, it is useful to have a voice as contrarian as hers. While many designers in Milan are busy chasing the romanticized Neo-Edwardian hothouse vision that has made Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci such a staggering success, Ms. Prada chose instead to revisit her own chastely industrial back pages with a show that recast her 1980s pocone nylon bags as clothes: vests, jackets, long coats, trousers, shorts, all in voluminous upholstery proportions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCertain of the items were created in collaboration with architects or designers like Herzog & de Meuron; her longtime collaborator Rem Koolhaas; Konstantin Grcic, and the French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec. (Mostly they produced bags \u2014 a \u201cfrontpack\u201d from Mr. Koolhaas \u2014 that suggested the wisdom of holding on to one\u2019s day job.) These eventually gave way to logo sports and work wear reminiscent of the things that the brand produced during the period when Ms. Prada\u2019s husband, Patrizio Bertelli, sponsored a boat, the Luna Rossa, that came close to winning the America\u2019s Cup.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was a sedate show, a decidedly commercial one. And yet even within framework of her own design conventions (afterward Ms. Prada said, as though reading from a Monty Python script, that she \u201ccould not get enough\u201d of black nylon), the designer had some wild cards to play. These took the form of fabulously contrasting block prints reminiscent of both Ed Roth, the Southern California hot-rod Picasso known as \u201cBig Daddy,\u201d and John Baldessari, the artist whose intellectual deadpan seems most closely aligned with Ms. Prada\u2019s own.", "title": "Ms. Fendi and Ms. Prada and All Their Baggage", "authors": ["Guy Trebay"]}

Last year, extreme weather that scientists say is partly attributed to climate change caused more than $306 billion in damage, a record that surpassed even the $215 billion cost of natural disasters in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina battered New Orleans, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAnd that figure was compiled before the heavy rains struck California this week. Fires have been a scourge of California \u2014 dozens of people were killed in wildfires in Northern California in the fall \u2014 but rains bring their own perils, especially in places where the earth has been scorched by fire, leaving it susceptible to floods and dangerous mudslides.\n\nHundreds of emergency workers, many of whom had weeks earlier battled the massive fire that denuded hillsides and made the dirt so unstable, searched on Tuesday for survivors with the help of Coast Guard helicopters and heavy equipment to clear blocked roads. And flooding and mudslides closed a stretch of Highway 101, a crucial artery along the coast south from Santa Barbara, as well as portions of the 110 freeway.\n\nPhoto\n\nLate Tuesday, officials said they expected Highway 101 to be closed for at least until Thursday.\n\nAs the mud rushed into lower-lying neighborhoods in Montecito, a wealthy hillside community where many celebrities have homes, the power went out and gas lines were severed, said Thomas Tighe, a resident. Officials said Tuesday night that it could be several days before gas service would be restored. They also said power failures were affecting more than 6,000 homes and businesses in the area, adding that many parts of Montecito were without drinkable water.\n\nSometime after 2 a.m. Mr. Tighe heard a loud rumbling, which he took to be boulders crashing down the hills. In the dark of the night, he could make out his cars floating away. Wearing a wet suit and booties, he used an ax to break down the fences around his house, which had been holding back the mud.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story California Today The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

Over the weekend, as forecasts began calling for rain, the authorities began warning of possibly dangerous floods and mudslides in the area that had been consumed by wildfires in what was known as the Thomas Fire, which burned over 280,000 acres last month spanning Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, and became California\u2019s largest wildfire on record.\n\nAs rescuers searched for survivors on Tuesday afternoon, the weather forecast, at least, offered a respite.

Godt, who coordinates the landslide hazards program at the United States Geological Survey, said the area of the Thomas Fire was prone to debris flows for two reasons: the terrain and the nature of the fire.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s some really rugged topography,\u201d Dr. Godt said, with steep slopes and elevation differences.\n\nThe fire, in a mostly chaparral landscape, also burned exceptionally hot, Dr. Godt said.

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "Music therapy, a board certified health profession that has about 7,500 practitioners nationwide, is becoming more prevalent in nursing homes and hospices because of sessions like those shared between Ms. Kelly and Mrs. Herzog, which helped Mrs. Herzog feel like she was being heard. And within that, there is a developing subspecialty in Ms. Kelly\u2019s expertise: end-of-life music therapy.\n\nAbout 15 percent of music therapists now work in geriatric settings, and about 10 percent with terminally ill patients, according to a 2017 employment survey by the American Music Therapy Association, which asked about 1,500 music therapists.\n\nRussell Hilliard, the founder of the Center for Music Therapy in End of Life Care in Finksburg, Md., has published research showing that in the hospice environment, music therapists were often the only professionals consistently treating emotional, spiritual, cognitive, social and physical needs of patients.\n\nWhen he started in the field in 1993, he was perhaps the first full-time music therapist in an American hospice, he said. As a sign of the field\u2019s growth, he is now an executive at Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care, which employs about 80 music therapists nationwide.\n\nWhile it has not been proven to extend life, multiple studies have shown music therapy can improve quality of life, inspire feelings of peace, spirituality and hope, and reduce pain. More studies are continuing, as music therapists seek to make their profession as central in end-of-life care as social workers and chaplains. Currently, most insurance companies and government-funded health programs do not cover music therapy directly.\n\nEnd-of-life music therapy also includes work being done by people like Kristen O\u2019Grady, a music therapist who works with terminally ill children and their families at the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center in Yonkers. She helps parents sing to their children, records the children\u2019s sounds, and helps parents write and record lullabies.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about end-of-life work, we are talking about loss,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Grady said. \u201cBut music is an inherently creative process. So we are directly opposing this feeling of loss with a feeling of creation. We are having creative, new experiences even in the last moments of someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the Hebrew Home, which has 735 residents, Ms. Kelly is the sole creative arts therapist who specializes in end-of-life care in a team of 12 art, drama, movement and music therapists. She is most often called in when patients are judged to have six months or less to live to help them frame their lives and provide support. About one-third of her 10 to 15 current patients, she said, are regularly able to write songs with her, a process in which Ms. Kelly sets their thoughts to melodies she improvises. Others listen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a session with Grace Sullivan, who is 102 and has profound hearing loss, Ms. Kelly asked if she wanted to hear music. \u201cSomething sweet and low,\u201d she said in a raspy voice. Ms. Kelly sang \u201cQue Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be),\u201d as performed in 1956 by Doris Day.\n\nShe and other music therapists working in end-of-life care often play music from when their clients were young, to help transport them back to a time when they were able-bodied. Mrs. Sullivan, who was in a wheelchair, responded to \u201cQue Sera, Sera\u201d by sighing in rhythm to the music. Ms. Kelly started sighing too, to reflect back to her feelings and deepen them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jeffrey Schecter, 44, whose mother, Joyce, died at the Hebrew Home in October, recalled a visit near the end of her life when Ms. Kelly was playing a Jewish folk song, which Ms. Schecter loved. She had been fairly unresponsive that day, because of advanced dementia.\n\nThen Ms. Kelly started to sing \u201cHava Nagila,\u201d \u201cand my mom starts joining in, and this strength was coming from somewhere, and she was belting, \u2018Hava Nagila.\u2019 I just stood back and actually filmed some of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like she couldn\u2019t help but do anything but join in. It just brought me to tears, because I hadn\u2019t seen that kind of energy for a while.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s a memory he cherishes.\n\n\u201cI remember leaving that day, thinking if that\u2019s one of the last times I see my mom, you can\u2019t beat that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe invited Ms. Kelly to play at his mother\u2019s funeral, and she sang \u201cHava Nagila\u201d at the cemetery.\n\nWhen another resident, Jose Reyes, died in 2016 at age 100, Ms. Kelly gave his daughter a CD of the song he had written, \u201cAll We Have Is Today.\u201d His daughter, Alida, read the lyrics at the funeral.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe remember our yesterdays/All we have is today/We don\u2019t know if we have a tomorrow/All we have is today,\u201d the chorus goes.\n\nMs. Kelly, a trained flutist, said she became a music therapist in 2013 after the death of her own father reminded her of the fragility of life. Enrolled in the graduate program for music therapy at Molloy College, she said she clearly remembered the moment when she decided to go into end-of-life work.\n\nAs part of her training, she visited an infirmary on the island of Jamaica with 20 people to a room. One woman was so frail her bones were visible beneath her skin, Ms. Kelly said. But when Ms. Kelly strummed a guitar at her bedside, the woman sat up in bed, lifted her arms and began to move rhythmically.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought to myself, this is it, this is the work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was as though the light was off for her, and then playing music turned the light back on for her.

He asked me if I was trying to tell him I was bisexual. I said that I only wanted to be with him, and he said he felt the same way. He was so at ease during our conversation that I believed him, but I\u2019m terrified that he\u2019s unable to tell me the truth because he\u2019s buried it. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll go farther and cheat on me. I\u2019m afraid he wants to be with men (though I know that looking at a site such as this doesn\u2019t make him gay or even bisexual).

In the United States, for instance, the I-94W form (issued by the Department of Homeland Security) asks visitors if they have criminal records, if they were involved in espionage or if they helped Nazi Germany. If the answer to any of these questions is positive, that person may be refused entry. The same principles guided Israel\u2019s decision.\n\nLet me be absolutely clear: Israel is a thriving democracy and we welcome people who disagree with our policies. If you oppose the settlements and want to debate the future of Judea and Samaria, otherwise known as the West Bank, I welcome you to come and learn firsthand about the reality on the ground.\n\nBut the B.D.S. movement does not oppose specific Israeli policies or its current government. The goal is to wipe Israel off the map. Its website refers to a struggle happening \u201cfor nearly 70 years.\u201d This timeline sends us back to 1948 and Israel\u2019s inception, not to policy debates about borders stemming from the Six Day War in 1967. The conclusion is easy: The movement is not about the future of Judea and Samaria. It is about Tel Aviv and Haifa, and its leadership wants nothing short of our destruction.\n\nThe movement\u2019s leaders don\u2019t hide their goals, and some of their organizations even collaborate with convicted terrorists in their attempts to destroy Israel. Jewish Voice for Peace is one example. Last April, it featured Rasmea Odeh as a speaker at its national meeting. Ms. Odeh murdered innocent Israelis in 1969. She is a convicted terrorist found guilty of immigration fraud by an American court after concealing her role in two bombings in Israel. Yet the executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace said that the group was \u201chonored to hear from her.\u201d\n\nWhile B.D.S. activists try to hide behind the mask of \u201chuman rights,\u201d more and more people understand the truth: The movement is anti-Israel and anti-peace. Several American states have passed anti-B.D.S. laws and resolutions. Cities in Spain, Germany and other European countries have also acted against the movement. These places refuse to accept bids for contracts from companies supporting the movement, and some stopped doing business with European banks involved in the campaign. They understand that opposing B.D.S. means standing up for peace.\n\nIsrael\u2019s decision to expose those out to hurt us sends a clear message: Those who seek our destruction are not welcome in our home.

But the notion that art belongs to a zone of human experience somehow distinct from other human experiences is both conceptually incoherent and intellectually crippling. Art belongs to life, and anyone \u2014 critic, creator or fan \u2014 who has devoted his or her life to art knows as much.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Allen\u2019s art in particular is saturated with his personality, his preoccupations, his biography and his tastes. One of the most powerful illusions encouraged by popular art is that its creators are people the rest of us know. This is not only because tales of their childhoods and news of their marriages and divorces feed our prurient appetites, or because we can peek into their lives on Instagram and Twitter. It\u2019s also because they carry intimate baggage into their work and invite us to sort through the contents.\n\nWhether you celebrate its authenticity or hate the TMI-ness of it all, this is unquestionably an age of self-display. And one of its founding fathers, without a doubt, is Woody Allen, the neurotic Narcissus of the Me Generation, the bridge between midcentury psychoanalysis and digital-era selfie culture.", "title": "My Woody Allen Problem", "authors": []}

Toronto Raptors (29-12)\n\nThe Raptors generated little excitement entering the season, but that\u2019s largely because few envisioned the transformation in DeMar DeRozan\u2019s game, which features more 3-pointers and a greater commitment to the pass, or the formation of a younger, better bench, which has helped fuel a 58-win pace. Although no one is picking the Raptors to win the Eastern Conference just yet, this certainly looks like the best team in Toronto\u2019s history.\n\n4. Houston Rockets (30-11)\n\nA spate of recent injuries has stunted James Harden\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award campaign and, of greater consequence, made it a bit harder to justify a top-five spot for the Rockets even after their gaudy 25-4 start. But the additions of the defensive aces Luc Mbah a Moute and P. J. Tucker, in support of the All-Star newcomer Chris Paul, make Houston perhaps the most dangerous threat to Golden State in either conference \u2014 provided everyone gets healthy.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Cleveland Cavaliers (26-16)\n\nThe Cavaliers are an abysmal 29th in defensive efficiency. They have played the N.B.A.\u2019s second-easiest schedule thus far. And only recently has the key figure acquired in the Kyrie Irving trade, Isaiah Thomas, come back from injury. Yet such is the leaguewide respect for LeBron James, in his 15th season, that Cleveland remains a huge favorite to reach a fourth successive N.B.A. finals \u2014 even when so much statistical evidence suggests we shouldn\u2019t treat the creaky Cavs as such a shoo-in.\n\n6. Minnesota Timberwolves (28-16)\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the longest playoff drought in N.B.A. history, now spanning 13 seasons, is officially over. Jimmy Butler\u2019s M.V.P.-worthy impact at both ends has been so instant and dramatic that the Wolves, who didn\u2019t even reach the postseason in Kevin Garnett\u2019s last three seasons in Minnesota, are on a 52-win pace \u2014 despite the inevitable news media fixation on how much Coach Tom Thibodeau relies on his starters.\n\n7. Oklahoma City Thunder (23-20)\n\nIt took longer than the Thunder hoped, but Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony are figuring it out, looking more and more like a group built for the postseason. Despite a worrisome 8-12 start, Oklahoma City is up to fourth in the league in defensive efficiency and 12th in offensive efficiency. Only two teams at present \u2014 Golden State and Toronto \u2014 rank in the top 10 of both categories, which is typically a trusty measure of elite status.\n\n8. San Antonio Spurs (29-15)\n\nA partial tear in Kawhi Leonard\u2019s left shoulder \u2014 not long after a lingering quadriceps ailment cost him the season\u2019s first 27 games \u2014 sounds ominous and caused this uncharacteristic plummet to the back of the top 10. But you know the rules by now: Never write off or assume anything with the Gregg Popovich-coached Spurs. Especially when Manu Ginobili remains a crunchtime wizard at age 40 and when the long-quiet Leonard is the star of a new (and fun) \u201cI was hacked\u201d Foot Locker commercial.\n\n9. Washington Wizards (25-18)\n\nThe Committee came into the season firmly believing that the inevitable focus on Cleveland and Boston would benefit the Wizards as much as the Raptors. Things haven\u2019t worked out as planned; Washington\u2019s 13-10 mark against sub-.500 teams is the second-worst among the East\u2019s top eight. The reality, though, is that a top-four seeding remains up for grabs and John Wall (only 39th in player efficiency rating) has another gear to rediscover in the second half.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n10. Milwaukee Bucks (22-19)\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that the Bucks, after acquiring Eric Bledsoe from Phoenix to pair Bledsoe\u2019s athleticism with the frontcourt sensation Giannis Antetokounmpo, are trying to pull off a trade for DeAndre Jordan to address a need for more rim protection. But Jabari Parker will soon be back from injury, which almost guarantees a needed boost to Milwaukee\u2019s meek second unit.\n\n11. Miami Heat (24-17)\n\nOld-school thinkers will tell you that the Heat\u2019s 9-2 record in games decided by 3 or fewer points is tied to Erik Spoelstra\u2019s coaching acumen. New-schoolers attribute the outcome of close games to randomness as much as anything. On whichever side you fall, Miami is once again among the most fascinating teams in the league, having surged to seven games over .500 despite a negative per-game point differential (-1.0).\n\n12. Denver Nuggets (22-21)\n\nSigning Paul Millsap was a triumph for a franchise not known for its off-season splashes. But the Nuggets\u2019 passable 13-14 record since losing Millsap to a wrist injury is also a coup of sorts, given that they\u2019re hanging in the West playoff hunt even with Nikola Jokic going through a rough patch as opposed to taking the widely anticipated next step. Millsap\u2019s absence has also created an opportunity for Trey Lyles, whose promise as a versatile modern forward suggests Denver actually did get something out of the Donovan Mitchell trade on draft night.\n\n13. Portland Trail Blazers (22-20)\n\nThe West features only four teams on a 50-win pace entering the second half, which gives the Blazers a real shot to finish as high as fifth despite the fact that, as constructed, they appear to have a limited ceiling. Portland continues to lack a dependable third scoring option in support of Damian Lillard and C. J. McCollum and still has holes in the frontcourt after the initial success Jusuf Nurkic found when he joined the Blazers.\n\n14. Indiana Pacers (22-20)\n\nNo. 8 in the East? No. 8 in offensive efficiency? A record of 22-15 when Victor Oladipo is in uniform? If you claim to have predicted any of that \u2026 stop fibbing. The Pacers enter the season\u2019s second half as the undisputed No. 1 team in the Biggest Surprise of the Season rankings, hushing Indiana\u2019s many critics of the Paul George trade, which brought back the former Indiana University star Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis and no future draft picks.\n\n15. Detroit Pistons (22-19)\n\nThe Pistons are openly pursuing roster upgrades via trade, preferring to focus on the promise they see in their highs to date \u2014 wins over the West\u2019s top teams (Golden State, Houston and Minnesota twice) \u2014 as opposed to their various lows (Reggie Jackson\u2019s ankle injury, an 0-7 start to the month of December and a recent 3-10 funk on the road). Which isn\u2019t surprising when the coach (Stan Van Gundy) runs the front office, too.\n\n16. New Orleans Pelicans (21-20)\n\nThe big men Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins have proven their compatibility. Consistency, though, remains an issue for New Orleans, which has stumbled every time it seems poised to go on a run that could lift it out of the lower reaches of the West\u2019s playoff chase. Of course, if the Pelicans stay where they are, we could see Golden State versus New Orleans in the first round of the playoffs, which would be a fascinating contrast in styles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n17. Philadelphia 76ers (19-20)\n\nThe Committee can think of no better ambassador to have dispatched to London for the league\u2019s annual regular-season game there than Joel Embiid \u2014 Philadelphia\u2019s one-man party. The Sixers are still young and inconsistent, and might pay for their 1-5 record in games decided by 3 or fewer points when it comes to making the playoffs, but few tandems in circulation are as must-see as Embiid and his sidekick Ben Simmons, who ranks as the current rookie of the year favorite.\n\n18. Los Angeles Clippers (21-21)\n\nThe Clippers have had too many injuries in the wake of Chris Paul\u2019s departure to come down hard on Coach Doc Rivers for the team\u2019s struggles to stay in the West\u2019s top eight. But the club\u2019s deep-pocketed owner, Steve Ballmer, wants to win so badly that Rivers\u2019s future remains a subject of great curiosity \u2014 in addition to DeAndre Jordan\u2019s and that of the veteran guard Lou Williams amid Williams\u2019 unexpectedly potent season.\n\nPhoto\n\n19. Knicks (19-23)\n\nThe Knicks took considerable grief for signing Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract, but how much did they miss the injured Hardaway over the past 20 games? Answer: Kristaps Porzingis\u2019s recent admission about being \u201cso tired\u201d should tell you all you need to know. Enes Kanter and Michael Beasley have been pleasant surprises, but we\u2019re about to find out whether a Knicks star can freely admit fatigue to the New York tabloids and survive.\n\n20. Chicago Bulls (16-27)\n\nNikola Mirotic went from practice-floor fight casualty to prized trade commodity. Kris Dunn is looking increasingly worthy of the No. 5 pick in the draft. And Zach LaVine is back on the floor well ahead of schedule. But the most promising development in Chicago, after a 3-20 start, just might be Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s claim that the rookie big man Lauri Markkanen is \u201cgoing to be great for a long time\u201d and has \u201cthe same upside as\u201d Porzingis.\n\n21. Utah Jazz (17-25)\n\nThe good: The rookie guard Donovan Mitchell, last June\u2019s 13th overall pick, has shown real steal-of-the-draft potential in trying to fill the void created by Gordon Hayward\u2019s departure. The bad: A lack of consistent scoring apart from Mitchell and multiple injuries to the team\u2019s defensive anchor, Rudy Gobert, have led to a 4-18 mark on the road. Is a trade for Chicago\u2019s Mirotic enough to put Utah back on a playoff path? Debatable.\n\n22. Nets (16-27)\n\nThe Nets elicit virtually the same reaction from every coach or executive the Committee encounters: \u201cThey play so annoyingly hard.\u201d Brooklyn has developed Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie nicely, acquired the former No. 3 overall pick Jahlil Okafor in an opportunistic trade and appears determined to drain as much value as it can out of its first-round pick \u2014 which, remember, now belongs to Cleveland as part of the Kyrie Irving trade.\n\n23. Dallas Mavericks (15-29)\n\nAs excited as the Mavericks are about the rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr., they need another top draft pick in June (and some long-awaited success in free agency in July) to return to the usual standards of playoff contention they\u2019ve known throughout Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s career. Nowitzki still has his moments as a shooter (and screener) in Year 20, and the plucky J. J. Barea has been more efficient than ever at age 33, but Smith has to get a lot more serious about defense to become the impact player Dallas envisions.\n\nPhoto\n\n24. Los Angeles Lakers (15-27)\n\nPulling LaVar Ball aside and privately threatening to trade his son if he keeps squawking is unlikely to have much impact when everyone knows the list of teams willing to trade for Lonzo Ball and inherit the circus surrounding him is nonexistent. While Kyle Kuzma has looked like a draft steal to rival Donovan Mitchell, and Brandon Ingram quietly continues to make real strides, it\u2019s hard to notice anything else in Lakerland when the daily Ball soap opera is so suffocating. (To his credit, though, Lonzo Ball has been a steadying force through the latest controversy and a subsequent four-game winning streak.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n25. Charlotte Hornets (16-25)\n\nThe Michael Jordan-owned Hornets are going nowhere. Yet we advise you to track them at least through the Feb. 8 trade deadline because Charlotte will probably be forced to consider dealing Kemba Walker. If Walker stays, Jordan risks losing his best player without compensation in the summer of 2019 \u2014 or, perhaps worse, paying big bucks to hang on to him instead of starting an overdue tear-down of a pricey but mediocre roster.\n\n26. Phoenix Suns (16-27)\n\nAlthough the standings remain unpleasant reading, Jay Triano does appear to have made a difference in terms of accountability and structure since taking over as coach for Earl Watson four games into the season. But the Suns\u2019 future hinges on Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender either improving to a level closer to Devin Booker\u2019s or becoming attractive enough for the Suns to package in a trade for an established star.\n\n27. Memphis Grizzlies (13-28)\n\nHarsh as it sounds, Memphis is going to have a hard time getting anyone beyond city limits to tune in when 1) Mike Conley is out injured and 2) management continues to treat Marc Gasol as untouchable while the trade deadline nears. As emotional as it would be for the locals to see Gasol follow his fellow grit-and-grind founding fathers Zach Randolph and Tony Allen out of town, where is this team going if it keeps the Spaniard?\n\n28. Sacramento Kings (13-28)\n\nVivek Ranadive, the Kings\u2019 owner, yearns to host playoff games in his new Golden 1 Center, but that\u2019s well out of reach for the moment. This season has to be about development for the Kings\u2019 recent marquee draft picks, most notably Buddy Hield, Skal Labissiere and the rookie De\u2019Aaron Fox. The big question for the second half is how long before Coach Dave Joerger goes all-in with the kids ahead of Zach Randolph, George Hill and Vince Carter.\n\n29. Atlanta Hawks (11-31)\n\nPerhaps no team in the league is more focused on the future than the Hawks, who (unlike Orlando) planned to be this bad and have entrusted their new general manager, Travis Schlenk, with reshaping the roster completely after a run of 10 seasons in the playoffs \u2014 but only one trip to the conference finals in that span. Don\u2019t be surprised if Atlanta remains in overhaul mode next season as well.\n\n30. Orlando Magic (12-31)\n\nIt might go down as one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time: How did this Magic team start 8-4? Orlando has since gone a ghastly 4-27, which will most likely lead to a fire sale at next month\u2019s trade deadline. Rival executives expect Jeff Weltman, Orlando\u2019s new team president, to aggressively hunt for new homes for the likes of Evan Fournier, Elfrid Payton and Mario Hezonja, given that Nikola Vucevic\u2019s broken finger is likely to preclude dealing the center.", "title": "N.B.A. Power Rankings: Warriors on Top at Midseason", "authors": ["Marc Stein", "On Pro Basketball"]}

Keenum is a low-risk, moderate-reward style of quarterback, the team relies on its receivers to take care of the bulk of the work after the catch rather than before it, and they punish teams with a defense that is strong on each level.\n\nPhoto\n\nEverson Griffen and Linval Joseph wreak havoc on the defensive line, but the crown jewel of Minnesota\u2019s defense is its secondary, where Xavier Rhodes and Andrew Sendejo are top-notch but Harrison Smith is a nearly singular talent.

Let\u2019s go execute the offense,\u2019\u201d Pederson said.\n\nFor Foles, that most likely means focusing on film from the 2013 season, when he burst onto the scene as an ideal fit with Coach Chip Kelly\u2019s offense in Philadelphia. In 10 starts that year, Foles went 8-2, leading the N.F.L. with 10.54 adjusted yards per attempt. He threw 27 touchdowns against just two interceptions, earning a Pro Bowl appearance and making people quickly forget Michael Vick, who had been ineffective earlier that season before a hamstring injury sent him to the bench.\n\nFoles followed up his strong 2013 regular season with a decent showing in the playoffs \u2014 he threw for 195 yards and two touchdowns in a wild-card round loss to the New Orleans Saints \u2014 and he was 6-2 as a starter in 2014 before a broken collarbone ended his season.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A few weeks of practice with the first-team offense could help shake off some rust, and he could emerge as a player capable of leading them in the playoffs. Or, even if he continues to struggle, Philadelphia could ride a great performance by its defense and its rushing attack and win in spite of him.\n\nIt is not that a healthy amount of skepticism is unwarranted based on Foles\u2019s play thus far, but some Eagles, including starting right tackle Lane Johnson, consider their underdog status to be a huge motivational advantage.\n\n\u201cI think everybody perceives us as being the weakest and that is fine,\u201d Johnson told reporters this week. \u201cI think that is good.

But it\u2019s not about electric cars or renewable energy, it\u2019s a battle over affordable housing.\n\nHere\u2019s the back story: San Francisco\u2019s state senator, Scott Wiener, introduced a bill this month that would abolish a variety of local zoning restrictions around transit hubs in cities like San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego. It would essentially make it much easier to build thousands of new midrise housing units near bus stops and train stations.\n\nTo call this bill contentious would be an understatement. Cities and towns have long been protective of their ability to control local development through zoning codes. Opponents of Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill have warned that allowing unregulated development could destroy the character of their neighborhoods or displace vulnerable communities. \u201cI would have a neighborhood with little 1920s, \u201930s and \u201940s single-family homes look like Dubai 10 years later,\u201d Paul Koretz, a Los Angeles city councilman, told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nMr. Wiener has disputed those concerns and argues that California\u2019s high housing costs call for bold action.

Are the social and sexual upheavals that gave rise to the #MeToo movement something you could have seen coming?\n\nI think I am probably part of that wave, rather than having known it was coming. Some of the news has sort of caught up to the book in this very strange way. Both have been part of a growing anger over the past decade, which, to me, related to the increasing visibility of certain kinds of misogyny.\n\nWhen I was a teenager in the 1990s, it was a common thing among young women to say that feminism\u2019s battles are won. Now I think it\u2019s very horrifically obvious that that is not the case. I think the internet is a big part of that awareness. You can look at men\u2019s forums, where men talk about how much they hate women, want to rape them, overpower them. You can read their rants. I was probably responding to the same thing that #MeToo is responding to. A lot of things have become visible now, things that we need to address.\n\nYour tale overall is an invitation to explore the darker, more corrosive side of power, the rise of female dictators and thrill killers asserting their authority in an increasingly lawless universe. But there is no hint of that in earlier chapters, in which you portray the reversal of gender roles in a positive, even enviable, light.\n\nI hoped at least at the outset it would be good for women to feel or imagine what it would be like to be in a position of control. It\u2019s always nice to have a little peek and see how society would look from the other side.\n\nBut finally, you have to ask, are women better than men? They\u2019re not. People are people. You don\u2019t have to think that all men are horrible to know there are some men who abuse their strength. Why wouldn\u2019t the same hold true for women? There is a small minority of sadists in the world who muck it up for the rest of us.\n\nSome of your female characters are menaced, raped, forced into sexual slavery. Did you write to avenge them?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I would exactly say avenge. The book was a thought experiment. I was writing it in 2014 and 2015, and I really didn\u2019t know at the start what the end would be.

It is, How do you avoid being a Nazi?\n\nSo potentially we all are oppressors?\n\nDo you think that you are so exceptional that if you had been born a German in the 1930s, you would have understood immediately that Lebensraum was a lie? That you would have tried to assassinate Hitler?

Tunde starts out as very confident, and the world slowly teaches him the reasons that perhaps he should not have been that confident. His story is the story about how a man in a world run by women learns how women have felt in a world run by men, living among wandering sadists, people who turn violent just because they can. Tunde is a writer, like me. He is also the nicest character in the book (laughs deprecatingly).\n\nYour portrayal of the Moldovan dictator Tatiana Moskalev is strikingly familiar.

I was also thinking of Berlusconi, or a slightly ridiculous, hyper-macho dictator who really enjoys showing off his sexuality. All these slightly oily characters were somewhere in my mind.\n\nAn unsavory minor character called Weinstein makes a brief appearance. Was that pure chance?\n\nYes, people have reminded me that I wrote about Weinstein; he\u2019s the odious, treacherous guy who betrays Roxy\u2019s father. In hindsight, it was kind of eerie that I gave him that name. Am I psychic? Well, maybe.\n\nMargaret Atwood, who I was lucky enough to have as a mentor while I was writing this book, has this psychic quality to her (laughs slyly). Maybe she taught me her slightly witchy ways.\n\nWhat is the source of your own power?\n\nMy parents, God bless them, have given me an amazing education. And the support of other women has been absolutely vital to me.\n\nI rely on the women\u2019s movement over the past 150 years more than on any utility that may be in my home. I tell myself I can do better with the women\u2019s movement and without running water, than with running water and electricity and no women\u2019s movement.\n\nThere is this thing in the book where young women who have the power can wake it up in older women.

It also ruled out the best-known incumbent, Geraldine Hoff Doyle, a Michigan woman whose innocent assertion that she was Rosie was long accepted.\n\nOn Mrs. Doyle\u2019s death in 2010, her claim was promulgated further through obituaries, including one in The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Kimble, an associate professor of communication and the arts at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, reported his findings in \u201cRosie\u2019s Secret Identity,\u201d a 2016 article in the journal Rhetoric & Public Affairs.\n\nThe article brought journalists to Mrs. Fraley\u2019s door at long last.\n\n\u201cThe women of this country these days need some icons,\u201d Mrs. Fraley said in the People magazine interview. \u201cIf they think I\u2019m one, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nThe confusion over Rosie\u2019s identity stems partly from the fact that the name Rosie the Riveter has been applied to more than one cultural artifact.\n\nThe first was a wartime song of that name, by Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb. It told of a munitions worker who \u201ckeeps a sharp lookout for sabotage / Sitting up there on the fuselage.\u201d Recorded by the bandleader Kay Kyser and others, it became a hit.\n\nThe \u201cRosie\u201d behind that song is well known: Rosalind P. Walter, a Long Island woman who was a riveter on Corsair fighter planes and is now a philanthropist, most notably a benefactor of public television.\n\nAnother Rosie sprang from Norman Rockwell, whose Saturday Evening Post cover of May 29, 1943, depicts a muscular woman in overalls (the name Rosie can be seen on her lunchbox), with a rivet gun on her lap and \u201cMein Kampf\u201d crushed gleefully underfoot.\n\nRockwell\u2019s model is known to have been a Vermont woman, Mary Doyle Keefe, who died in 2015.\n\nBut in between those two Rosies lay the object of contention: a wartime industrial poster displayed briefly in Westinghouse Electric Corporation plants in 1943.\n\nRendered in bold graphics and bright primary colors by the Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller, it depicts a young woman, clad in a work shirt and polka-dot bandanna. Flexing her arm, she declares, \u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(In 2017, The New Yorker published an updated Rosie, by Abigail Gray Swartz, on its cover of Feb. 6. It depicted a brown-skinned woman, sporting a pink knitted cap like those worn in recent women\u2019s marches, striking a similar pose.)\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s poster was never meant for public display. It was intended only to deter absenteeism and strikes among Westinghouse employees in wartime.\n\nFor decades his poster remained all but forgotten. Then, in the early 1980s, a copy came to light \u2014 most likely from the National Archives in Washington. It quickly became a feminist symbol, and the name Rosie the Riveter was applied retrospectively to the woman it portrayed.\n\nThis newly anointed Rosie soon came to be considered the platonic form. It became ubiquitous on T-shirts, coffee mugs, posters and other memorabilia.\n\nThe image piqued the attention of women who had done wartime work. Several identified themselves as having been its inspiration.\n\nThe most plausible claim seemed to be that of Geraldine Doyle, who in 1942 worked briefly as a metal presser in a Michigan plant. Her claim centered in particular on a 1942 newspaper photograph.\n\nDistributed by the Acme photo agency, the photograph showed a young woman, her hair in a polka-dot bandanna, at an industrial lathe. It was published widely in the spring and summer of 1942, though rarely with a caption identifying the woman or the factory.\n\nIn 1984, Mrs. Doyle saw a reprint of that photo in Modern Maturity magazine. She thought it resembled her younger self.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTen years later, she came across the Miller poster, featured on the March 1994 cover of Smithsonian magazine. That image, she thought, resembled the woman at the lathe \u2014 and therefore resembled her.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, the news media was identifying Mrs. Doyle as the inspiration for Mr. Miller\u2019s Rosie. There the matter would very likely have rested, had it not been for Dr. Kimble\u2019s curiosity.\n\nIt was not Mrs. Doyle\u2019s claim per se that he found suspect: As he emphasized in the Times interview, she had made it in good faith.\n\nWhat nettled him was the news media\u2019s unquestioning reiteration of that claim. He embarked on a six-year odyssey to identify the woman at the lathe, and to determine whether that image had influenced Mr. Miller\u2019s poster.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the end, his detective work disclosed that the lathe worker was Naomi Parker Fraley.\n\nThe third of eight children of Joseph Parker, a mining engineer, and the former Esther Leis, a homemaker, Naomi Fern Parker was born in Tulsa, Okla., on Aug. 26, 1921. The family moved wherever Mr. Parker\u2019s work took him, living in New York, Missouri, Texas, Washington, Utah and California, where they settled in Alameda, near San Francisco.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 20-year-old Naomi and her 18-year-old sister, Ada, went to work at the Naval Air Station in Alameda.

There, prominently displayed, was a photo of the woman at the lathe \u2014 captioned as Geraldine Doyle.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Ms. Fraley told The Oakland Tribune in 2016. \u201cI knew it was actually me in the photo.\u201d\n\nShe wrote to the National Park Service, which administers the site. In reply, she received a letter asking for her help in determining \u201cthe true identity of the woman in the photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs one might imagine,\u201d Dr. Kimble wrote in 2016, Mrs. Fraley \u201cwas none too pleased to find that her identity was under dispute.\u201d\n\nAs he searched for the woman at the lathe, Dr. Kimble scoured the internet, books, old newspapers and photo archives for a captioned copy of the image.\n\nAt last he found a copy from a vintage-photo dealer. It carried the photographer\u2019s original caption, with the date \u2014 March 24, 1942 \u2014 and the location, Alameda.\n\nBest of all was this line:\n\n\u201cPretty Naomi Parker looks like she might catch her nose in the turret lathe she is operating.\u201d\n\nDr. Kimble located Mrs. Fraley and her sister, Ada Wyn Parker Loy, then living together in Cottonwood, Calif.

But there is, he said, suggestive circumstantial evidence.\n\n\u201cThe timing is pretty good,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe poster appears in Westinghouse factories in February 1943. Presumably they\u2019re created weeks, possibly months, ahead of time. So I imagine Miller\u2019s working on it in the summer and fall of 1942.\u201d\n\nAs Dr. Kimble also learned, the lathe photo was published in The Pittsburgh Press, in Mr. Miller\u2019s hometown, on July 5, 1942. \u201cSo Miller very easily could have seen it,\u201d he said.\n\nThen there is the telltale polka-dot head scarf, and Mrs. Fraley\u2019s resemblance to the Rosie of the poster. \u201cWe can rule her in as a good candidate for having inspired the poster,\u201d Dr. Kimble said.\n\nMrs. Fraley\u2019s first marriage, to Joseph Blankenship, ended in divorce; her second, to John Muhlig, ended with his death in 1971. Her third husband, Charles Fraley, whom she married in 1979, died in 1998.\n\nHer survivors include a son, Joseph Blankenship; four stepsons, Ernest, Daniel, John and Michael Fraley; two stepdaughters, Patricia Hood and Ann Fraley; two sisters, Mrs. Loy and Althea Hill; three grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and many step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her daughter-in-law, Marnie Blankenship.\n\nIf Dr. Kimble exercised all due scholarly caution in identifying Mrs. Fraley as the inspiration for \u201cWe Can Do It!,\u201d her views on the subject were unequivocal.\n\nInterviewing Mrs. Fraley in 2016, The World-Herald asked her how it felt to be known publicly as Rosie the Riveter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cVictory!\u201d she cried. \u201cVictory!

He is also credited as being the first to perform any jump requiring three revolutions.\n\nYet Button\u2019s wariness about the quad might resonate with sports fans in general. He noted that skaters still receive points even if they fall on a quad jump, leading to more attempts and infecting some competitions with inelegant spills on the ice.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a pole vault jumper and you knock the pole off its supports, do you get points for it?\u201d Button said.\n\nIn fairness, Chen has worked diligently to improve his artistry and skating skills, as well. He understands that the quad alone will not bring him a gold medal. And Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the reigning Olympic champion, performs with deftness, creativity and emotion that may be unmatched by any previous skater.

Good luck figuring out who won and who lost.\n\nHow is success measured in protests and counterprotests? Is it mere heightened awareness, or do we need to point to concrete change? Is the goal to create division or cohesion, disruption or appeasement?\n\n(Let\u2019s step back: Do you even remember what the protests are \u2014 or were supposed to be \u2014 about? Answer: racial inequality and police brutality, according to Kaepernick, who sat, and later knelt, for pregame national anthems in 2016, and whose last game came on New Year\u2019s Day a year ago.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe 2017 season really began in the spring, as Kaepernick, 29, with a sterling reputation as a teammate and with a Super Bowl on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, waited to be signed.

(It will be remembered by some as the season\u2019s high point. The Browns went 0-16.)\n\nIt all felt only vaguely related to Kaepernick\u2019s unceremonious protests of 2016, which had required three games before anyone noticed.

Some marched to the N.F.L. offices or to the gates of stadiums in shows of solidarity.\n\nConversely, some burned their season tickets or team jerseys and vowed never to watch the N.F.L. again.

They responded primarily with meetings, including with protesting players. There were offers to spend more money on charitable causes, but people could not agree on that, either.

(The transfers were halted after $81 million had passed through the Swift system, the international clearinghouse for transactions, after someone at the New York Fed discovered a spelling error \u2014 the word \u201cfandation\u201d for \u201cfoundation\u201d \u2014 and stopped the heist. )\n\nAs James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it recently, \u201cNorth Korea is both cautious and cunning in its use of force, including cyberattack.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe North has been successful only against poorly protected targets, of which there are many, suggesting that there is a relatively low ceiling for its cyberattack capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the explosion of state-sponsored, sophisticated cyberattacks over the past seven or eight years has been fueled, in large part, by the expansion of poorly protected targets. Yes, banks and major utilities have, for the large part, tightened their defenses, and tens of billions of dollars have been made by companies promising all kinds of cyber protections, from the most basic programs loaded on your laptop to sophisticated systems designed to anticipate future action, or watch for variations in the normal behavior of users.\n\nBut none of that has prevented cyberspace from becoming what President Barack Obama termed the \u201cWild, Wild West,\u201d a territory of anarchy, where adversaries take free shots at one another. In the past five years, these attacks have become the cheapest way for nations to undercut one another in the name of bigger strategic goals.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the world has been unable to decide what constitutes fair game, and what should be off limits. For years officials talked about their fear of a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a devastating strike against the power grid that would turn out the lights from Boston to Washington, or London to Rome. That has not happened, save for limited strikes in Ukraine, widely attributed to Russian hackers, that seemed intended to send a message that they could attack critical infrastructure at any time. Countries have sensed what would happen if they went too far.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, cyberattacks have taken a far more subtle turn. The Russian-led attacks on the 2016 American election \u2014 and similar efforts in France and Germany last year \u2014 are prime examples. While United Nations experts had been struggling to come up with \u201cnorms of behavior\u201d in cyberspace, a consensus about what was off-limits \u2014 like attacks on power grids or safety systems, for example \u2014 few were thinking about the use of the technology to influence elections.\n\nIn fact, the election systems in the United States \u2014 the foundation of American democracy \u2014 were never on the list of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d until Mr. Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, added them in the last days of the administration. By then it was too late.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The evidence that has poured out of the United States after more than a year of congressional investigations has left no doubt that Russian hackers \u2014 working largely on behalf of two of Moscow\u2019s spy services, the SVR and the GRU \u2014 did far more than use cyber tools to break into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of key players in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe sophisticated use of \u201cbots\u201d to target key demographic groups with Twitter messages, Facebook ads and just ordinary-looking social media exchanges made it clear that we have entered a new world, in which states marry some of the oldest propaganda techniques with the newest ways to disseminate a divisive message.\n\nYet thinking about how to regulate that kind of activity is tying the West in knots. President Emmanuel Macron in France is proposing that government authorities be able to take down \u201cfake news\u201d during elections, declaring in his New Year\u2019s speech that \u201cif we want to protect liberal democracies, we must be strong and have clear rules.\u201d\n\nYet those rules clearly could not survive in the United States, where First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from stepping in and declaring what is fake and what is not.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s own declarations about what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 including articles about the Russian election activity \u2014 underscore the dangers of putting that power into government hands.\n\nThere are other complications. After the election hacks in the United States, many called for \u201creal identities\u201d on the internet, so the world would know exactly who is tweeting or posting. Sensible as it may sound, it would also be a boon to the Russians, the Chinese and any authoritarian government looking to crack down on dissent. In short, the best way to solve the problem of election meddling and anonymous attacks would be a dictator\u2019s dream.\n\nThere have been a few successes in setting norms of behavior, particularly when it comes to banning child pornography or cracking down on intellectual property theft. But those are the easiest issues on which to agree.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States, for example, would never support rules that banned espionage. And what about rules prohibiting the placement of \u201cimplants\u201d in foreign computer networks, so that in the future they could monitor activity or plant malware to bring a network down?\n\nAmerican and European officials raise the alarm whenever they find such implants in their electrical grids. But they also quietly place them in hundreds of thousands of foreign networks. That is how Presidents Bush and Obama got inside Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment site at Natanz, with the Stuxnet code.\n\nIt is a power that the United States and its allies, have no intention of giving up.", "title": "Nations Seek the Elusive Cure for Cyberattacks", "authors": ["David E.

It requires 80 votes out of 120 in the Knesset, a forbidding supermajority.\n\nThat part of the bill was enacted, prompting howls from the left and a broadside from the Palestinian Authority, whose top spokesman said Tuesday that it amounted to \u201cdeclaring war on the Palestinian people and their political and religious identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe measure on redrawing the Jerusalem city map, by contrast, would have affected only a few areas, like Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp, that have been largely abandoned by the city because of concerns for the safety of its employees outside the security barrier. This has turned them into teeming boomtowns of illegal construction, where estimates say the population has soared to between 70,000 to 150,000 people.\n\nHagai Agmon-Snir, director of the nonpartisan Jerusalem Intercultural Center, said the possibility of excising those areas from the city had set off alarm bells across the political spectrum. \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus among all Jerusalem activists, right and left, that this is not a good idea, because it\u2019s not stable,\u201d Mr. Agmon-Snir said.\n\nCreating a new local governing body would take years, and in the meantime, the Jerusalem municipality \u201cwill not invest a cent there,\u201d he said.

Caricatures abound, but the socioeconomically lucky don\u2019t often offer themselves up for study. That all changed with Rachel Sherman\u2019s UNEASY STREET. Nominally a sociologist, Sherman has written what is really a psychological study, and I\u2019ve found myself returning to it frequently to remind myself of uncomfortable questions that lurk just below the surface of the lives of people who have much more than average. For instance, every consumer choice is its own expression of values. So what do our biggest ones say about what we stand for? How do impressionable children view them? And why are so many of us so eager to embrace social class labels with the word \u2018middle\u2019 in them when we\u2019re nowhere near the median? The voyeurism here is minimal; the judgment nearly nonexistent.

By the time you reach that point in the book, she has talked candidly about pregnancy loss, personal friendships with several presidents, her husband\u2019s suicide \u2014 and the way she made history in a job she was never really expected to have.

In Nabokov\u2019s classic biography of the Russian novelist, newly reissued, he begins with Gogol\u2019s death and works back to his birth.

By 2016, that had fallen to less than $76 billion \u2014 down $27 billion from the peak.\n\nJPMorgan takes hit tied to Steinhoff\u2019s woes.\n\nTucked into JPMorgan's earnings this morning was a $143 million mark-to-market loss the bank disclosed on a \u201cmargin loan to a single client.\u201d\n\nThat client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports.\n\nEarly last month the giant South African retailer, which owns American mattress maker Sleepy\u2019s, said it had discovered accounting irregularities. Its shares tumbled 78 percent on the news.\n\nHow does this effect J.P. Morgan? The bank was not among the initial group of lenders on the margin loan \u201cto an entity controlled by Steinhoff\u2019s then chairman Christo Wiese to purchase additional shares in the company in the fall of 2016.\u201d But, as the WSJ reports, \u201closses from the margin loan were expected to have been spread among a wider group of banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe borrowing entity pledged 628 million Steinhoff shares as collateral on the loan, according to a company statement at the time. After the share price collapse, however, that collateral has little value relative to the debt.\u201d\n\nU.S. Supreme Court will hear a challenge to S.E.C.\u2019s in-house judges.\n\nHow often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong?\n\nThat odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary.\n\nThis obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below].\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.\u2019s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case.\n\nDefendants argued the judges are not mere employees but \u201cofficers\u201d so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status.\n\nThe S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are \u201cofficers\u201d under the Constitution.\n\nThe key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out.\n\n-- Peter J.

Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. \u201cI really cannot overstate the size of this effect.\u201d\n\nThe key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot. Traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin, and said after that it would be too late to help.\n\nThe study showed that the time window could be expanded to 16 hours. However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim. The researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored. Only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment, known as thrombectomy, which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel.", "title": "New Findings Could Save Lives of More Stroke Patients", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "Yet in the past, politicians have sometimes shied away from carbon pricing for fear that it would raise electricity or gasoline prices for voters who rely heavily on fossil fuels and have few alternatives. When Mr. Christie withdrew New Jersey from R.G.G.I. in 2012, he said the program \u201cdoes nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses, with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment.\u201d\n\nIn the Northeast, at least, those fears have not been borne out so far. In part because of a glut of cheap natural gas from fracking, as well as the recent boom in wind and solar power, utilities in the R.G.G.I. program have found it relatively easy to retire their dirtiest coal plants and cut pollution at minimal cost. Emissions from electricity in R.G.G.I. states have fallen 40 percent since 2009 \u2014 faster than in the rest of the country \u2014 while electricity prices have declined 3.9 percent. (Regulators recently tightened the program\u2019s cap to aim for an additional 30 percent cut in power-plant emissions by 2030.)\n\nSome policymakers are also seeking to minimize any backlash from carbon pricing by taking the revenue raised and investing it directly into efficiency measures that can lower household electricity bills or fossil-fuel alternatives, like electric vehicles. Jesse Jenkins, an energy researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, notes that these investments may end up having a greater impact than the carbon prices themselves, since \u201creal-world carbon prices routinely fall well below what economists typically have in mind.\u201d\n\nMr. Inslee has opted for that strategy in pushing a carbon tax in Washington after a similar proposal failed at the ballot in 2016. The tax, he said in his State of the State speech, \u201cwill allow us to reinvest in all the things that drive down emissions. We can build more solar panels. We can put more electric cars on the road. We can help more Washingtonians purchase energy-saving insulation for their homes and businesses.\u201d\n\nAs long as interest in carbon pricing remains confined to a handful of Democratic-led states, it will have only a partial effect on overall emissions in the United States. Taken together, the states that either have or are considering carbon pricing accounted for roughly 21 percent of America\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions in 2015.\n\nStill, Robert Stavins, an energy economist at Harvard University, notes that state-level momentum on carbon pricing could send a message that the United States has not abandoned efforts to address global warming, even as the Trump administration disavows the Paris climate agreement.", "title": "New Jersey Embraces an Idea It Once Rejected: Make Utilities Pay to Emit Carbon", "authors": []}

But Leonia, a 1.5-square-mile borough near the George Washington Bridge, may be ground zero for the phenomenon.\n\nWith three exits from the New Jersey Turnpike, Leonia offers tantalizing shortcuts through the community, whose suburban streets of Tudors and split-level homes make the borough feel a world away from one of the busiest bridges in the country and one of the biggest cities in the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very unique situation,\u201d Chief Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect storm of traffic.\u201d\n\nResidents have complained that they sometimes cannot pull out of their driveways because their road has bumper-to-bumper traffic.

As such, she incorporates transcripts and scene descriptions into her book, even giving it the same title her mother was using for the film. Borrowing the title works as a homage; not to mention that \u201cThe Art of Misdiagnosis\u201d is a terrific title. But the shifts between first-person narration, film transcripts and letters addressed to her mother cause the book to buckle somewhat under the weight of its own confusions. Brandeis may have finally disrupted her mother\u2019s story line, but that\u2019s a separate matter from finding her own.\n\nIf the death at the center of Brandeis\u2019s memoir stirred up more emotional detritus than she could possibly sort through in one book, Thomas Mira y Lopez may have faced the opposite problem. Framed around his father\u2019s death following a massive seizure in 2006, THE BOOK OF RESTING PLACES: A Personal History of Where We Lay the Dead (Counterpoint, $26) is both a grief memoir and a travelogue through the afterlife \u2014 at least as it\u2019s experienced by those left behind. In a series of 10 linked essays, Mira y Lopez treks across various landscapes \u2014 some real, some psychological \u2014 with an eye toward discovering what connects particular places to particular rituals or relics surrounding the dead.\n\nAt a construction site that once was Tucson\u2019s National Cemetery, the author observes, astutely, that a cemetery serves a \u201ccivic function\u201d but is more than just functional, in that \u201cit disposes of the dead, yet also provides them a home. It\u2019s built of the dead, but also for the living.\u201d In Rome, where he was studying at the time his father had the seizure, Mira y Lopez visits the Catacombs of Priscilla and wonders why he does not immediately return home. \u201cThe tour guides told us about the walls,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe soft volcanic tufa the Romans initially believed bees nested within. \u2026 I thought of the rehab ahead, of how my father\u2019s body and mind would be permanently changed.\u201d Later in the book, another kind of death comes in the form of a friend, or at least a friendly acquaintance, whom the author must distance himself from when he discovers the man to be a raging bigot.\n\nMira y Lopez, who holds an M.F.A. in creative nonfiction from the University of Arizona, is a gifted writer. His ear for language and his ability to take ownership of ideas by finding the poetry in them rather than falling into didacticism \u2014 \u201cA ghost is a manifestation of guilt,\u201d he writes, \u201ca forgiveness demanded, a memory contested\u201d \u2014 is the kind of thing that cannot be taught. Nonetheless, \u201cThe Book of Resting Places\u201d feels a lot like an M.F.A. thesis project stretched too thin in order to become a book. His father\u2019s death having amounted to a rather narrow premise, there is a sense here of the author combing through every experience he\u2019s had in recent years in search of thematically relevant material.\n\nNot that the impulse to look outward rather than inward isn\u2019t laudable. It\u2019s refreshing to encounter a young writer who\u2019s chosen to do some fieldwork rather than indulging a deep dive into his own limited personal history. But Mira y Lopez has the kind of talent that can be as much a burden as a blessing. Though it will probably be embraced by graduate school creative writing types, many of whom struggle daily with imposing deep meaning on what is exasperatingly mundane, \u201cThe Book of Resting Places\u201d occupies that awkward literary sphere of books that seem on the surface to be more interesting than they actually are.\n\nI actually sort of mean that as a compliment. Sure, Mira y Lopez relies too much on rigged-up profundities and allusions to Greek myth, but the dirty secret of completing a book is sometimes you have to shift your goal from writing a masterpiece to merely pulling things off. To that end, I have to begrudgingly hand it to the poet Beth Ann Fennelly, whose book of micro-memoirs is nothing if not a lesson in sticking to your aesthetic guns. HEATING & COOLING: 52 Micro-Memoirs (Norton, $22.95) contains essays that are sometimes as short as 10 words \u2014 \u201cSwapped the rosary on my bedpost for Mardi Gras beads\u201d (that\u2019s the whole thing) \u2014 but add up to a surprisingly maximalist portrait of a life.\n\nFennelly writes about the tedium of conversations on airplanes, the unshakeability of a Catholic upbringing, the fact that she has an enormous bladder and can go for hours without urinating. In the title essay, Fennelly calls an air-conditioning repairman and, told that her ceiling must come down, wrestles with the \u201cnumerous subjects of which I\u2019m ignorant.\u201d It\u2019s meant to be a reckoning with her perception of herself as a feminist but, as she does again and again in this tiny book, she\u2019s really just owning up to the fruitlessness of trying to find meaning in every moment. And if the book feels familiar in places (\u201cMommy Wants a Glass of Chardonnay\u201d is both a title and trope here), it\u2019s also a testament to the power of not unpacking at all but instead living out of a very small suitcase.", "title": "New Memoirs Try to Get the Balance Right", "authors": ["Meghan Daum"]}

Daley-Ward, who is also an actor, was born in England to a Jamaican mother and Nigerian father.\n\nSome of the earliest known human writing was, basically, counting. On clay tablets, with little styluses, ancient Sumerian merchants tallied lists of goods: barley, cattle, wheat, wine. Imagine the power of it. One minute you\u2019re living in a world of uncontainable profusion. Men and beasts jostle in the dirty markets; ships bob and crash at the dock; the storehouses overflow with infinities of goods. All around that swarms a further scampering abundance \u2014 kids, cats, rats, ants, the drops of water that make up the river, the atoms that make up the drops.\n\nThe next minute you\u2019re holding that profusion in your hand, as solidly as you would hold a rock or an apple: an inventory of the world. The abundance has been brought under control. That reduction is profound.

Her brother is in the hospital, and no one will tell her why or for how long.\n\nAnd so she counts. She counts the number of times the pastor refers to hell in his sermon, the white socks and black shoes in church, how many months her brother has been away, the number of roses on the wallpaper of her new room. She counts the number of times she can fit the word \u201clonely\u201d onto a single sheet of A4 paper. She counts the number of times her mother swears on a phone call to Jamaica.

In the middle of the scrum, arms yanked in opposite directions, stood Jerry Springer. Well, a guy playing Jerry Springer at least.\n\nGod and the Devil are presumably doing battle elsewhere in the world, too, and this Jerry was the Broadway actor Terrence Mann, in the thick of rehearsing a scene from \u201cJerry Springer \u2014 The Opera.\u201d The show, a London sensation in 2003 that toured Europe and has been mounted by a handful of regional American theaters, has not had an honest-to-goodness run in New York until now.

{"date": "2018-01-07 00:00:00", "text": "Consider the following: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway, completed at the end of 2016, cost $2.5 billion per mile; and the extension of the No. 7 line to Hudson Yards, finished the year before, cost $1.5 billion per mile. By contrast, Paris, a dense and historic city with strong labor unions, is building a line extension similar to the Second Avenue project for just $450 million a mile, which is roughly comparable to the average cost for subway projects around the world. Several transit experts have pointed out these cost discrepancies in recent years.\n\nThe M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, acknowledged to The Times that excessive costs have \u201cbeen a problem,\u201d but he says New York has unique challenges, like aging utilities and high density, that contribute to high costs. That is not credible, since Paris and London are older than New York and have done a much better job improving and expanding their transit systems in recent years.\n\nStill, Mr. Lhota, whom Gov. Andrew Cuomo appointed last year, says the M.T.A. is working to bring down costs. To be successful, he will need help from Mr. Cuomo, who has been friendly with the labor unions whose members operate cranes and dig tunnels, and with the contractors doing the work. The unions and the construction companies are big campaign contributors and have a strong financial incentive to preserve the status quo.\n\nMr. Cuomo, in turn, will have to stir the Legislature, which has, regrettably, taken little interest in overseeing and improving the M.T.A. Besides annual hearings about the M.T.A.\u2019s budget, the State Assembly and the Senate conducted just two oversight hearings on the M.T.A. between 2015 and last year, according to Reinvent Albany, a public interest group. Last year, as the subways were plagued by delays and derailments, the Assembly held just one oversight hearing, about the impact of the track work Amtrak was doing at Penn Station. The Senate did not bother with even that. By contrast, the New York City Council, which has little sway over the M.T.A., has held nine oversight hearings in the past three years.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the Legislature has no power. It held important hearings in 2016 about water contamination in Hoosick Falls and elsewhere. Those hearings helped shine a light on how a toxic chemical got into groundwater, and state officials were pressed to explain why they did not respond more quickly.", "title": "Opinion | New York Leaders Are Failing Its Subway Riders", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "Anti-football legislation, even at the state level, faces an uphill battle. Despite the decline in youth football participation over the past decade, the sport remains the most popular in the country by many measures. More than a million boys play high school football nationally each year \u2014 more than baseball and basketball combined \u2014 and football is often the only sport that produces a profit for major college athletic programs.\n\nThe N.F.L. also remains immensely influential, despite a recent decline in television ratings and mounting worries about the long-term health of players subjected to years of head hits. It is the largest sports league in the country, with $14 billion in revenue, and its games draw more viewers than nearly everything else on broadcast television.\n\nThe reintroduction of the New York bill comes as research increasingly shows a correlation between long-term brain disease and the age at which children begin playing tackle football. Last week, a study published in the journal, Brain, showed evidence of the degenerative brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., in teenage athletes who sustained head impact injuries.\n\nDoctors note that head hits absorbed by young players are more damaging because their brains are not fully developed, and are less capable of fully repairing themselves. Younger players also have weaker neck muscles, and therefore are less capable of bracing for impact and supporting the weight of a football helmet.\n\n\u201cSome of my colleagues quibble that the science has not determined which age is the right age, but they don\u2019t seem to realize that health experts set age minimums for all sorts of activities like drinking, smoking and driving, and the science is never purely black and white,\u201d said Dr. Robert Cantu, the co-founder and medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, who has studied head trauma in children for years.", "title": "New York Legislator Renews Effort to Bar Tackle Football for Children", "authors": []}

He accused Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Police Department of showing \"reckless disregard\u201d for those concerns and for state law.\n\nThe issue of what the public is permitted to see runs through the national debate over body cameras, as police departments, officers\u2019 unions, lawmakers and watchdog organizations wrestle over what makes for the best policy.\n\nThe 50-a statute was intended to protect officers from exploitation and abuse. The city\u2019s interpretation has expanded under Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat elected on promises of police reform, and the state\u2019s highest court has affirmed the broader interpretation.\n\nThe Police Department has cited the 50-a statute as the reason for refusing to turn over body camera video to journalists who have requested it under the state Freedom of Information Law. But in statements confirming that the city was reviewing the lawsuit, officials stood by the decision to release some videos to the public.\n\n\u201cThe mayor and the police commissioner have spoken to the need for increasing transparency into the way our city is policed,\u201d Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said. \u201cThe release of body camera footage, when possible, is an important extension of that commitment.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nRobert J. Freeman, the executive director of the state Committee on Open Government, who has called for the 50-a statute to be amended or repealed, said the lawsuit was an attempt by the union to further shield police officers from public accountability.\n\n\u201cYou have this myth that the disclosure of information relating to the performance of the duties of a public employee in some way relates to that person\u2019s personal privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so. Not so. The record that indicates my salary is about me, but it\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s about me as a public employee.\u201d\n\nThe police union, like others in Boston and Seattle, has resisted body cameras for its officers. Officials considered taking legal action against the city during contract negotiations last year until the city agreed to give a raise for officers who would be required to wear them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile the police union would rather not see the videos released at all, prosecutors prefer that decision to be made after they have completed investigations and decided if criminal charges are warranted. And police-reform advocates have pushed for a standardized process that would allow more videos to be made public.\n\nDarius Charney, the lead lawyer in a 2008 lawsuit that challenged the Police Department\u2019s stop-and-frisk tactics and led to a court-ordered body camera pilot, said the videos should be considered official reports, no different from what officers file each time they conduct a stop, arrest or other enforcement action.\n\nRichard M. Aborn, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, a criminal justice policy nonprofit, said that whether the statute applies to body camera video may depend on whether the Police Department plans to use it to evaluate officers\u2019 performances or make disciplinary decisions.\n\n\u201cWhat is crystal clear is the right of the public to see these videos and hear reports from the government about what happened in these shootings is paramount, and the courts have got to find a way to expeditiously resolve any dispute and allow the dissemination of this information,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to me, this is about speed.\u201d\n\nGetting video released quickly, or explaining why it is being withheld, is crucial to quelling public skepticism, he said.", "title": "New York Police Union Sues to Stop Release of Body Camera Videos", "authors": ["Ashley Southall"]}

Part of the intention behind the enormous and sped-up purchase of shiny new cars is the seemingly straightforward premise that newer cars will break down less. But, in fact, both older and newer cars have been breaking down more often, according to a recent state comptroller report, which is reflected in a sharp drop in what is known as \u201cmean distance between failures,\u201d a metric the M.T.A. uses to measure performance.\n\nAs a result, one of the most striking changes will be invisible to commuters: R211 cars will be equipped with monitoring computers that will relay information in real-time about its performance \u2014 a health check of sorts \u2014 so that an ailing train can be diagnosed even before it has been hauled back to the repair shop.\n\nTo further tackle the issue, the contract stipulates that the Kawasaki cars adhere to specific reliability requirements, as a warranty. The level of performance that the cars\u2019 critical systems \u2014 such as doors and brakes, some of the largest contributors to delays \u2014 are required to demonstrate, based in part in how many miles they travel before breaking down, is more than double that of past contracts, according to the agency. If they fail to meet those levels, Kawasaki itself must shoulder the cost of any repairs, instead of the authority.\n\nThe Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, praised the introduction of gangway cars, which have been slow to catch on in America. Toronto in 2011 became the first North American city to adopt them and now more than 80 such trains run on one of its lines. In New York City, the open gangway train are expected to fit 1,785 people, 55 more than an equivalent regular train.", "title": "New York Set to Acquire the Next Generation of Subway Cars", "authors": []}

Leverage over local affairs was codified in a 1929 case, Adler v.

The same people the governor talked about the federal government throwing missiles at: our residents,\u201d said Senator John A. DeFrancisco, a Republican from near Syracuse who is the deputy Senate majority leader, while voting for a bill to decouple the state\u2019s tax code from the federal one. Senator John J. Flanagan, the Republican majority leader from Long Island, has said the bill is a better way to protect New Yorkers than the proposed payroll tax swap.\n\nAssemblywoman Amy Paulin, a Democrat from Westchester County who has introduced similar legislation in her chamber, said continued conformity would create a \u201cwindfall off the backs of taxpayers, inappropriately.\u201d\n\nThe move to extricate the state and the federal tax codes has generated unusual consensus among the notoriously divided State Legislature. The Senate bill passed the chamber unanimously. But it has also again laid bare the evergreen political fissions in Albany.\n\nWhile Democratic senators took the floor to cast the bill as yet another rebuttal to an unfair tax plan from conservatives in Washington, Republicans suggested that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had deliberately neglected to propose any decoupling in his budget address, as a stealthy way of raising revenue.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aides have flatly rejected that accusation. In a statement, Mr. Cuomo said he was continuing to discover new ways the federal tax bill would hurt New Yorkers, and that he would propose legislation to address the effect of the coupled tax system.\n\nOther states with coupled tax codes have moved to disentangle as well. Idaho, Michigan and Nebraska have all begun to separate their tax codes from the federal one in some way, Mr. Hicks said.\n\nBut tax experts said the variation among individual states\u2019 tax codes, and their individual financial situations, makes it impossible to predict if all states will follow suit. Some states that see increased revenue may choose to keep the extra funds, to plug other fiscal holes, said Kirk Stark, a taxation law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Centuries of subjugation made Guaran\u00ed a second-class language in the minds of many Paraguayans.\n\nPhoto\n\nSpanish is the dominant language in government ministries, the courts, the news media, literature, schools and professions.\n\n\u201cThere is a stigma, a prejudice, associated with Guaran\u00ed,\u201d said Ladislaa Alcaraz, the government\u2019s Minister for Language Policy. \u201cIt is associated with poverty, rurality, ignorance, with people who are illiterate.\u201d\n\nAn effort to make public education bilingual, however, has met resistance from a surprising group: Parents who were raised speaking Guaran\u00ed.\n\nMany still hold negative stereotypes of their language, and have pushed back against their children being taught in Guaran\u00ed, with its high-pitched, nasal and guttural sounds. They say that an emphasis on Spanish, or a foreign language, would make their children more competitive in the job market.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cParents say: \u2018At home we speak Guaran\u00ed, so in the school they attend, I want them to learn Spanish,\u2019 \u201d said Nancy Ben\u00edtez, a curriculum official at the Ministry of Education. \u201cThey say: \u2018Let other people\u2019s kids learn it. But not mine.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe government is hoping to change people\u2019s perspective on the language by encouraging its use in official circles.\n\nThe Ministry of Language Policy, established in 2011, has been tasked with normalizing and promoting the use of Guaran\u00ed across the government, including in the Legislature and the courts. Judicial officials are being taught Guaran\u00ed, and Paraguayans now have the right to a trial in either Spanish or Guaran\u00ed.\n\nThe ministry in 2017 set up units in every government department \u2014 where less than 1 percent of written communication with the public is carried out in the language \u2014 to train civil servants in Guaran\u00ed.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human rights issue,\u201d Ms. Alcaraz said. \u201cPeople who use Guaran\u00ed deserve to be tended to in Guaran\u00ed.\u201d\n\nThe effort to elevate the standing of Guaran\u00ed got a lift in 2014, when the Parliament of Mercosur, the regional trading bloc, adopted it as an official working language.\n\nAll this is the slowly unfurling result of a decision to make Paraguay officially bilingual in its post-dictatorship Constitution, which gave Guaran\u00ed and Spanish legal parity. The intent was to give a historically marginalized segment of the population access to basic government services, the justice system and medical care.\n\nSpeaking only Guaran\u00ed \u201cis a significant factor driving inequality,\u201d said R. Andrew Nickson, an expert in Paraguayan development policy at the University of Birmingham in Britain. When it comes to having a voice on various issues, monolingual Guaran\u00ed speakers, or those who speak only a little Spanish, \u201cfear they will be made fun of, so prefer to keep their heads down and mouths shut,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe majority of those who speak little or no Spanish live in the countryside. One-third of Paraguayans tend to use only Guaran\u00ed at home. But this figure doubles to nearly two-thirds if urban areas are excluded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe push to improve the language\u2019s image and expand its presence is having a noticeable effect.\n\nToday, a growing number of babies and businesses are being given Guaran\u00ed names. Guaran\u00ed text can be seen on billboards and signs in Asunci\u00f3n, the capital. Its music is no longer just confined to the folk genre; artists are increasingly recording metal, rock and rap songs in Guaran\u00ed.\n\nOnline content in Guaran\u00ed is also steadily expanding. Vikipet\u00e2, the Guaran\u00ed version of Wikipedia, gets 220,000 monthly visitors.\n\n\u201cWe are breaking out of the enclosure,\u201d said Susy Delgado, who won the 2017 national literature prize for her work in the language. \u201cNot as rapidly as we would like, but we are breaking out.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut efforts to bring Guaran\u00ed on an equal footing with Spanish are \u201cswimming against the tide,\u201d said Shaw N. Gynan, a linguist at Western Washington University, who has done extensive research on Guaran\u00ed.\n\n\u201cIt is in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nothing to do with state policy.\u201d\n\nIncreasing urbanization, caused by large-scale farming that has pushed people from the countryside, is shrinking the monolingual Guaran\u00ed base.\n\nOn top of this, the bilingual education program is underfunded and has failed to reach many areas of rural Paraguay, where Guaran\u00ed speakers are still schooled in Spanish, leading many to drop out.\n\nPart of the problem is that the Guaran\u00ed taught in schools is a formal, and somewhat anachronistic, version compared to the colloquial version spoken on the street.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere is something artificial in the Guaran\u00ed kids learn in school; it isn\u2019t the Guaran\u00ed used on the street,\u201d Ms. Benitez said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the language a referee uses in a football match. It isn\u2019t the Guaran\u00ed that you\u2019re going to speak with a salesman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is no standardized written form of Guaran\u00ed, and there is a fierce debate about what the official version should look like.\n\nThe Guaran\u00ed Language Academy, established in 2012, is split between those who favor a purer version of the language, replacing words adopted from Spanish with old Guaran\u00ed words, and those who believe it should be the heavily Spanish-influenced version, known as Yopar\u00e1, that is spoken on the street.\n\nFor at least one group of Paraguayans, knowledge of the language has become a key factor in their performance: politicians.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the recent past, not speaking Paraguay\u2019s native language was no barrier to those seeking to gain or stay in power. When he was dictator, Stroessner never made a single address in Guaran\u00ed (although his wife spoke the language and he rewarded rural Guaran\u00ed-speakers with land for their loyalty to his regime).\n\nBut now, voters are encouraged to check if candidates speak the language, and those who do not face mockery on social media. The most recent politician to feel the repercussions was Santiago Pe\u00f1a, a close ally of President Horacio Cartes.\n\nIn a result that surprised many, Mr. Pe\u00f1a failed to secure his party\u2019s nomination to contest the presidential elections in 2018, losing last month in the primary of the ruling Colorado party to Mario Abdo.

He added that the drawing shows that van Gogh\u2019s work evolved during his crucial years in the French capital from a formal style that he learned at the art academy in Antwerp just before arriving in Paris, and became increasingly experimental.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of stylistic missing link between his Belgium and Paris time,\u201d said Fred Leeman, an independent van Gogh expert and curator of exhibitions by the artist, who is a consultant to the Van Vlissingen Foundation, which currently owns the drawing.\n\nThe last time a new van Gogh drawing was discovered was in 2012. A year later, a new van Gogh painting, \u201cSunset at Montmajour\u201d (1888), was also found. But these findings are relatively rare. Since the publication of the complete catalog of van Gogh\u2019s works in 1970, another nine drawings and seven paintings have been added, Mr. Meedendorp said.\n\nWhen it came to the Van Gogh Museum for research in 2012, the drawing was owned by an American private collector whose Dutch relatives had purchased the work from a gallery in the Netherlands in 1917, Mr. Meedendorp explained. But the museum did not publicize the finding at the time, at the request of the previous owner.\n\nAside from Mr. Leeman, no other experts outside the museum have yet seen the drawing.\n\nResearch by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the world\u2019s leading expertise center on the artist, found that \u201cThe Hill of Montmartre with Stone Quarry\u201d came into the hands of van Gogh\u2019s sister-in-law, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, a meticulous keeper of van Gogh\u2019s materials, who numbered it \u201c123\u201d in her inventory.", "title": "Newly Discovered van Gogh Drawing Is a \u2018Stylistic Missing Link\u2019", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "Which fiction and nonfiction writers \u2014 playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 inspired you most early in your career? And which writers working today do you most admire?\n\nI\u2019d have to begin with A. J. P. Taylor, who was the first historian I ever read and who inspired me to believe a) that historical writing should never be dull, but should bristle with irony and paradox, and b) that historical knowledge is a prerequisite for worthwhile commentary on contemporary matters. Another major influence at the early stage was Norman Stone. But it wasn\u2019t just historians who inspired me as I was starting out. As a sixth-former (high school senior), I lapped up Tom Stoppard\u2019s plays, painted a mural inspired by the poetry of Thom Gunn and read compulsively the reviews of punk bands in the New Musical Express. At Oxford, I came under the influence of The Spectator, then edited by Charles Moore, one of the most gifted English journalists of his generation and now Margaret Thatcher\u2019s biographer. But my favorite writer at that time was Flann O\u2019Brien, the great Irish humorist. I have always liked his description of himself as \u201ca spoilt Proust.\u201d No one writing in English today is remotely as funny as O\u2019Brien. Only the French can still produce real men of letters. Chapeau, therefore, to Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy and Michel Houellebecq.\n\nWhich historians and biographers do you most admire?\n\nAmongst those currently writing, Simon Schama stands out as the Dickens of modern historiography: bewilderingly erudite and prolific, passionate in his enthusiasms and armed with the complete contents of the thesaurus. We agree to disagree about politics. I have also hugely admired Anne Applebaum for her trilogy on the Gulag, the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe (\u201cIron Curtain\u201d) and, most recently, the Ukrainian famine (\u201cRed Famine\u201d). Walter Isaacson has established himself as the great American biographer of our time. \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u201d is his best book, I think. Whereas the earlier books were pure journalism, he is now showing academic scholars how to write accessibly about subtle and even recondite subject matter. I read quite a number of biographies while researching \u201cThe Square and the Tower.\u201d My favorite was probably Michael Ignatieff\u2019s on Isaiah Berlin, which led me into the vast, delightful rabbit warren of Berlin\u2019s correspondence.\n\nAnd which novelists do you especially enjoy reading?\n\nEveryone has at least one vice. Mine is reading (and re-reading) 19th-century novels. It\u2019s hard to pick just a couple of favorites but I unreservedly adore Wilkie Collins (e.g., \u201cThe Moonstone\u201d) and Theodor Fontane (\u201cDer Stechlin\u201d).\n\nWhich genres do you avoid?\n\nHistorical fiction, especially of recent vintage. The brain simply cannot compartmentalize. I noticed while writing \u201cThe Pity of War\u201d that I was subconsciously drawing on Pat Barker\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost Road\u201d novels as if they were the real thing. Since then I\u2019ve abstained completely. In any case, I would much rather read an authentic contemporary diary than a work of historical fiction. A good example is the diary of Ivan Maisky, the long-serving Soviet ambassador in London. Gabriel Gorodetsky\u2019s edition \u2014 abridged and unabridged \u2014 is a work for the ages.\n\nHow do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?\n\nI\u2019ve tried electronic but I can\u2019t read on a screen for pleasure. It has to be the paper-and-ink book, preferably a robust paperback. From an early age, I\u2019ve liked to have five books on the go at a time \u2014 that was the maximum number one could borrow from the Ayr Public Library. As for when I read, always at night. In the morning, there are too many distractions.", "title": "Niall Ferguson: By the Book", "authors": []}

The couple emphasized culture, and several of their children became respected artists, notably the folk singer Violeta Parra, who committed suicide in 1967.\n\nMr. Parra published his first book, \u201cSinger Without a Name,\u201d a year before he graduated from the University of Chile in 1938, with degrees in mathematics and physics.

For a time he was a darling of leftists in the United States \u2014 though not in Chile, as he related in 1971, when he attended a birthday party for Bobby Seale, the Black Panther leader.\n\nIntroduced by Jerry Rubin, the radical activist, as \u201cChile\u2019s best poet,\u201d Mr. Parra, then 57, said he was viewed with suspicion by many Communists in Chile because of an episode in Washington in 1970.\n\n\u201cI and some other foreign poets read at the Library of Congress,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAfterward, we were taken to a reception at the White House and, before I knew it, I was shaking hands with Mrs. Nixon.

It is still very embarrassing.\u201d\n\nReviewing Mr. Parra\u2019s \u201cEmergency Poems\u201d in 1972, the scholar Alexander Coleman wrote that Mr. Parra and the other anti-poets \u201cdread the very idea of Poetry and its attendant metaphors, inflated diction, romantic yearning, obscurity and empty nobility.\u201d", "title": "Nicanor Parra, Chilean Voice in an \u2018Anti-Poet\u2019 Movement, Dies at 103", "authors": []}

Her mother also read the politically laced science fiction of Octavia Butler, years before Afrofuturism became an established idea.\n\nLiving in Syracuse in the 1970s, her mother helped start the Black Folk Art Gallery, now called the Community Folk Art Center, and became close with a coterie of artists. But when Ms. Mitchell\u2019s father pursued a job in the Los Angeles area, the family had to move. Attending a nearly all-white school in Anaheim, Ms. Mitchell experienced racist bullying far more bitter than what she\u2019d seen in upstate New York.\n\n\u201c \u2018Roots\u2019 came on TV, which is supposed to educate people, but the result was boys chasing me around with ropes and trying to whip me and calling me Kizzy,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe feels the area\u2019s racial hostility contributed to her mother\u2019s suicide, when Ms. Mitchell was 16.

But I always felt welcome and comfortable on that show. And one of the hallmarks of that show is that everyone is given all the space and time and latitude to be themselves.\u201d\n\nSoon after being added to \u201cMorning Joe\u201d as a regular panelist, Ms. Wallace added another TV job to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, joining \u201cThe View\u201d in 2014 to replace the combative Elisabeth Hasselbeck as the resident Republican. It was not a success.\n\nMs. Wallace said that ABC executives let her go for \u201cnot being Republican enough\u201d and that she learned of her dismissal from her fellow sacked colleague, Rosie Perez, who read about it in Variety. (The producers of the show reportedly offered her the chance to return as an occasional contributor, but she declined.)\n\nThough Ms. Wallace had worked with ABC News on special events, she made sure that her \u201cView\u201d contract let her keep a place as a contributor to \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d After her dismissal, NBC and MSNBC offered her a job, and within a month she was filing the first of her reports for \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the course of the 2016 campaign, executives, including her now-executive producer Patrick Burkey, raised her on-air profile.

Christie acknowledged that he hoped to be picked as Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, a spot that ultimately went to Mike Pence. \u201cI\u2019m a competitive person, so I\u2019m not going to say it won\u2019t bother me if I\u2019m not selected,\u201d Mr. Christie told Ms. Wallace. \u201cOf course it bothers you a little bit, because if you\u2019re a competitive person like I am and you\u2019re used to winning like I am, again, you don\u2019t like coming in second.

Her public breaking point came after Mr. Trump\u2019s strident and often angry acceptance speech for the Republican nomination in Cleveland.

What she wanted most, she told him, was a show revolving around \u201ca round-table conversation and always having a boisterous conversation with very, very little script.\u201d\n\nThat comes across in the freewheeling nature of \u201cDeadline,\u201d aired live every weekday from 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Ms. Wallace will raise her voice in reaction to clips, and doesn\u2019t withhold her indignation.

She laughs easily and strikes a tone between sarcasm and outrage over the actions of the institution she once served. Her guests joke with one another. In a recent episode, Mr. Schmidt, her former colleague and now a frequent guest, compared the journey of the Trump delegation to Davos to the two-part \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d episode in which the family decamps to Hawaii.\n\nMs. Wallace says her on-camera personality is one that anyone who knew her before \u201cDeadline: White House\u201d would instantly recognize.\n\n\u201cI am the same on TV as a guest as I am as a host, as I was a White House communications director, as I was Jeb Bush\u2019s spokesperson,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t speak any differently.

Each has to be approved by a school\u2019s governing board, whose trustees are typically appointed by the governor. Ensuring affordable, quality education is an essential part of trustees\u2019 responsibility, but unfortunately often not part of their practice.\n\nTrustees of public universities are stewards of a public trust that rests nobly on the notion that an enlightened citizenry is vital to a democratic society. They have a fiduciary duty to represent the citizens and taxpayers who support public institutions of higher education, as well as the students who attend them. But even though the best interests of students and taxpayers revolve around college access, affordability and graduation outcomes, too often presidents and boards are more focused on the rankings, reputation and popularity of the institution itself.\n\nIn my career as the president of two state universities and a consultant to nearly 50 higher-education institutions, I\u2019ve observed dozens of college presidents skillfully co-opt their governing boards into approving costly projects that make schools look more attractive. (Of course, every college president has to increase costs sometimes. But the goal is to make sure it is necessary, while keeping expenses as low as possible for students.)\n\nTrustees, who typically meet four to eight times each year, are entertained as if they are visiting heads of state, flattered for their service and financial contributions to the institution. College presidents sweeten requests for new buildings and research centers, as well as additional student affairs programming, with cleverly branded words like \u201cpromise\u201d and \u201cexcellence.\u201d What board would want to withhold promise and excellence from its beloved student body?\n\nCollege presidents also tranquilize trustees into agreement with impossibly large volumes of reading material. Trustees get binders full of documentation about institutional successes that are padded with expensive plans for increasing growth and reputation.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "Black also shows how certain dynamics recurred again and again across the decades. He notices that from the early days of Zionist immigration, Jews relied on Palestinian labor to help build the state that Palestinians opposed. In 1889, he notes, Zichron Yaakov, an early agricultural settlement comprising 200 Jews, employed 1,200 Arab laborers. Almost a century later, after Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six Day War, an Israeli sociologist noted that \u201cat night the campus\u201d of Tel Aviv University \u201cis like a big dormitory for Palestinian workers.\u201d In the 1990s, after Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government responded to Palestinian terrorism by restricting movement from the occupied territories into Israel proper, a Palestinian complained that \u201cmost of the people in our village want to be connected to Israel [and to] have the opportunity to work in Israel.\u201d Zionism\u2019s need for Palestinian labor, and the willingness of many Palestinians to provide it, fits comfortably into neither the Zionist nor Palestinian nationalist narrative. But Black weaves it into his.\n\nImage\n\nAnd Black notices that from the beginning, Zionists tried to bypass the Palestinians by dealing with other Arab leaders, who were less hostile to Jewish ambitions. In 1919, Emir Faisal, who wanted Zionist support for his bid to lead the newly independent Syria, signed an agreement with Chaim Weizmann endorsing further Jewish immigration to Palestine. After its takeover of the West Bank, Israel promoted pro-Jordanian Palestinian politicians, whom it considered more conciliatory than the newly created Palestine Liberation Organization. In the late 1990s, Ehud Barak infuriated Yasir Arafat by prioritizing negotiations over the Golan Heights with the Syrian dictator Hafez Assad. These days, Netanyahu often implies that an Israeli rapprochement with the Sunni gulf states \u2014 built around their common hostility to Iran \u2014 would force Palestinians to curb their nationalist demands. Such wishful thinking, Black shows, has a long history.\n\nHe savors moments when the ideological mask lifts, and Jews and Palestinians see each other not merely as threats, but also as human beings. He tells the story of the future prime minister Golda Meir, during Israel\u2019s war of independence, touring neighborhoods of Haifa from which Arabs had recently fled and being reminded of abandoned Jewish towns in Europe. Upon reaching a desolate apartment block, she encountered an elderly Palestinian woman, who began sobbing. Meir broke into tears too. Still, Israel did not permit Haifa\u2019s Arab refugees to return.\n\nSimilarly, Black recounts an astonishing 1956 eulogy by Moshe Dayan, then the chief of staff for the Israel Defense Forces, for a young kibbutz member murdered by Palestinian fighters near Gaza. \u201cLet us not blame the murderers today,\u201d Dayan said. \u201cWhy should we complain about their burning hatred for us? For eight years\u201d \u2014 since Israel\u2019s war of independence \u2014 \u201cthey have been sitting in the refugee camps in Gaza, watching us transforming the lands and the villages where they and their fathers dwelt, into our property.\u201d Dayan was not suggesting that Israel give those lands back. To the contrary, he told the bereaved kibbutzniks that \u201cwe have no choice but to fight.\u201d But in contrast to many current Israeli and American Jewish leaders who claim that only cultural pathology explains Palestinian hostility to Zionism, Black shows that some former Israeli leaders understood \u2014 and even empathized with \u2014 the Palestinian opposition that they nonetheless sought to quash.\n\nBlack does not romanticize Palestinian nationalism. Again and again, he shows how Palestinian leaders harmed their own cause. He tweaks them for boycotting the legislative council elections that Britain \u2014 then Palestine\u2019s mandatory power \u2014 held in 1923, while the Zionists participated. He condemns the Mufti of Jerusalem for rejecting a 1939 British White Paper that went a significant way toward meeting Palestinian demands. And he reports that in the mid-1990s, when Arafat ran the newly created Palestinian Authority, a ton of cement in Gaza cost $74. Of that, $17 went to the P.A. and another $17 went to Arafat\u2019s personal account \u2014 at a bank in Tel Aviv.", "title": "No Light at the End of This Tunnel", "authors": []}

What do you make of the moment we seem to be in now, with so many women coming forth and accusing so many highly visible men of sexual harassment and abuse?\n\nP.R. I am, as you indicate, no stranger as a novelist to the erotic furies. Men enveloped by sexual temptation is one of the aspects of men\u2019s lives that I\u2019ve written about in some of my books. Men responsive to the insistent call of sexual pleasure, beset by shameful desires and the undauntedness of obsessive lusts, beguiled even by the lure of the taboo \u2014 over the decades, I have imagined a small coterie of unsettled men possessed by just such inflammatory forces they must negotiate and contend with. I\u2019ve tried to be uncompromising in depicting these men each as he is, each as he behaves, aroused, stimulated, hungry in the grip of carnal fervor and facing the array of psychological and ethical quandaries the exigencies of desire present. I haven\u2019t shunned the hard facts in these fictions of why and how and when tumescent men do what they do, even when these have not been in harmony with the portrayal that a masculine public-relations campaign \u2014 if there were such a thing \u2014 might prefer. I\u2019ve stepped not just inside the male head but into the reality of those urges whose obstinate pressure by its persistence can menace one\u2019s rationality, urges sometimes so intense they may even be experienced as a form of lunacy. Consequently, none of the more extreme conduct I have been reading about in the newspapers lately has astonished me.\n\nC.M. Before you were retired, you were famous for putting in long, long days.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nP.R. I read \u2014 strangely or not so strangely, very little fiction. I spent my whole working life reading fiction, teaching fiction, studying fiction and writing fiction. I thought of little else until about seven years ago. Since then I\u2019ve spent a good part of each day reading history, mainly American history but also modern European history. Reading has taken the place of writing, and constitutes the major part, the stimulus, of my thinking life.\n\nC.M. What have you been reading lately?\n\nP.R. I seem to have veered off course lately and read a heterogeneous collection of books. I\u2019ve read three books by Ta-Nehisi Coates, the most telling from a literary point of view, \u201cThe Beautiful Struggle,\u201d his memoir of the boyhood challenge from his father. From reading Coates I learned about Nell Irvin Painter\u2019s provocatively titled compendium \u201cThe History of White People.\u201d Painter sent me back to American history, to Edmund Morgan\u2019s \u201cAmerican Slavery, American Freedom,\u201d a big scholarly history of what Morgan calls \u201cthe marriage of slavery and freedom\u201d as it existed in early Virginia. Reading Morgan led me circuitously to reading the essays of Teju Cole, though not before my making a major swerve by reading Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s \u201cThe Swerve,\u201d about the circumstances of the 15th-century discovery of the manuscript of Lucretius\u2019 subversive \u201cOn the Nature of Things.\u201d This led to my tackling some of Lucretius\u2019 long poem, written sometime in the first century B.C.E., in a prose translation by Martin Ferguson Smith. From there I went on to read Greenblatt\u2019s book about \u201chow Shakespeare became Shakespeare,\u201d \u201cWill in the World.\u201d How in the midst of all this I came to read and enjoy Bruce Springsteen\u2019s autobiography, \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d I can\u2019t explain other than to say that part of the pleasure of now having so much time at my disposal to read whatever comes my way invites unpremeditated surprises.\n\nPre-publication copies of books arrive regularly in the mail, and that\u2019s how I discovered Steven Zipperstein\u2019s \u201cPogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History.\u201d Zipperstein pinpoints the moment at the start of the 20th century when the Jewish predicament in Europe turned deadly in a way that foretold the end of everything. \u201cPogrom\u201d led me to find a recent book of interpretive history, Yuri Slezkine\u2019s \u201cThe Jewish Century,\u201d which argues that \u201cthe Modern Age is the Jewish Age, and the 20th century, in particular, is the Jewish Century.\u201d I read Isaiah Berlin\u2019s \u201cPersonal Impressions,\u201d his essay-portraits of the cast of influential 20th-century figures he\u2019d known or observed. There is a cameo of Virginia Woolf in all her terrifying genius and there are especially gripping pages about the initial evening meeting in badly bombarded Leningrad in 1945 with the magnificent Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, when she was in her 50s, isolated, lonely, despised and persecuted by the Soviet regime. Berlin writes, \u201cLeningrad after the war was for her nothing but a vast cemetery, the graveyard of her friends. \u2026 The account of the unrelieved tragedy of her life went far beyond anything which anyone had ever described to me in spoken words.\u201d They spoke until 3 or 4 in the morning. The scene is as moving as anything in Tolstoy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust in the past week, I read books by two friends, Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s wise little biography of James Joyce and an engagingly eccentric autobiography, \u201cConfessions of an Old Jewish Painter,\u201d by one of my dearest dead friends, the great American artist R.

And there are entreaties to educate the president about the truth of Haiti as if he simply suffers from ignorance.\n\nBut the president is not alone in thinking so poorly of the developing world. He didn\u2019t reveal any new racism. He, once again, revealed racism that has been there all along.

Instead of trying to get past this moment, we should sit with it, wrap ourselves in the sorrow, distress and humiliation of it. We need to sit with the discomfort of the president of the United States referring to several countries as \u201cshitholes\u201d during a meeting, a meeting that continued after his comments.

In an earlier round of negotiations, the North agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to play in the South during the Olympics.\n\nThe prospect of fostering inter-Korean reconciliation through sports and other channels has strong appeal in South Korea, so much so that successive governments have tried to negotiate sending a unified team to the Olympics.\n\nSuch efforts have sometimes led to breakthroughs. In 2000, the year of the first inter-Korean summit meeting, the countries\u2019 delegations marched together at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics.

Past negotiations faltered over such details as whether a joint team would have an equal number of players from each country, who would choose the coaches and where the athletes would train.\n\nSouth Korean athletes, who have far more resources and Olympic experience than their counterparts from the North, have balked in the past at the idea of sacrificing their hard-earned prospects for the sake of parity with North Korea in a united team. South Korean news outlets have reported that the South asked the International Olympic Committee to allow a unified hockey team to have an expanded roster, so that none of the South Korean players would have to bow out of the Games.\n\nSouth Korea first sought to use sports to ease military tensions with the North back in the 1960s, proposing joint teams for international athletic events. But sports diplomacy has never led to a lasting political thaw on the Korean Peninsula, which has remained technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War was halted with a truce.\n\nThe two Koreas negotiated sharing some of the 1988 Seoul Olympics after South Korea won the right to play host to the Games. But the talks collapsed and the North bombed a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 in an attempt to disrupt the games in the South.\n\nInter-Korean sports and other exchanges increased between 1998 and 2008, when the leaders of the South were pushing their so-called Sunshine Policy of seeking reconciliation and easing political tensions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that period of d\u00e9tente, which gained momentum with the historic inter-Korean summit in 2000, unraveled as conservatives took power in the South in 2008.

In 1959, William Peden reviewed \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d Roth\u2019s first book and the one that would establish the young writer from Newark. Read an excerpt below:\n\nSome years ago, in the vanguard of the Southern literary renascence, Ellen Glasgow commented that what the South needed was \u201cblood and irony.\u201d The same might be said of some recent writers who have concerned themselves with depicting the role of the Jew in American society, which is the subject of Philip Roth\u2019s collection of short stories and a novella. An English instructor at the University of Chicago, 26-year-old Mr. Roth has published fiction in Harper\u2019s, The Paris Review, The New Yorker and other periodicals. \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d a Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship Award, is his first book, and an impressive one. There is blood here and vigor, love and hate, irony and compassion.\n\nMr. Roth\u2019s novella is a somewhat incongruous mingling of conventional boy-meets-girl material and portrait-of-the-intellectual-as-a-young-man, narrated with an occasional fondness for clinical detail reminiscent of Edmund Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Princess With the Golden Hair.\u201d Young Neil Klugman meets beautiful, wealthy Brenda Patimkin, a Radcliffe undergraduate. Neil pursues Brenda with the determination of a well-trained bird dog, and soon catches her. After a summer love affair, he rejects Brenda and the nouveau-riche Patimkins with the smug self-righteousness of Joyce\u2019s Stephen Dedalus.\n\nSuch a summary, however, does justice neither to the author nor to his people; out of such hackneyed materials Mr. Roth has written a perceptive, often witty and frequently moving piece of fiction. He is a good story-teller, a shrewd appraiser of character and a keen recorder of an indecisive generation.\n\nMost of Mr. Roth\u2019s protagonists are, like Neil Klugman, adrift in a limbo between past and present. The author seems to know his people inside and out, whether he writes of a boy arguing the Virgin Birth with an exasperated rabbi, (\u201cThe Conversion of the Jews\u201d), or, in \u201cEli, the Fanatic,\u201d of a young Jewish lawyer trying to explain suburban mores to the leader of a rabbinical orphanage, or, in \u201cEpstein,\u201d of the ludicrous yet pitiable aftermath of an aging man\u2019s search for love. These stories, though concerned with universal, archetypal experiences, are somewhat transmuted into that which is at once strange and familiar. \u201cI\u2019m a Jew,\u201d one character says. \u201cI am different. Better, maybe not. But different.\u201d", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

Mr. Pound, however, is not responsible for the lack of humor which seems to attend upon the mere mention of his name, with his admirers taking the form of abject ecstasy beneath his feet \u2014 after all, forgivable, as being constructive, tending, that is, toward that high appreciation of his work which is its just due; with his non-admirers taking the form of a foaming anger, blindly destructive and robbing the non-admirer himself of the benefit he might otherwise enjoy in open-mindedly approaching a writer whose work has so much rare pleasure to give us, vitalized as it is with beauty and romance \u2014 particularly with the romance of an enviable learning.

In 1942, following a period of intense change and turmoil, Allan Nevins reviewed Henry Hazlitt\u2019s \u201cA New Constitution Now,\u201d which argued for a radical reconstruction of the nation. Read an excerpt below.\n\nThe American Republic plainly confronts a new era. The nation which emerges from the stormy events of our time \u2014 the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War \u2014 will have undergone a drastic alteration. In many respects its economy, its social outlook and its political preconceptions will be completely transformed. To meet these changes in our ideas, activities and institutions the structure of our government will necessarily have to be modified. But should this modification be slow and moderate or rapid and profound? To this question, which we must all face, Mr. Hazlitt gives a bold and emphatic answer. He advocates a far-reaching reconstruction of our governmental system, and he calls for a new method of constitutional revision which will bring such reconstruction within easy reach. The boldness and thoroughness of Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s prescription are refreshing qualities.\n\nFor with Mr. Hazlitt the question is not whether we would gain by the change; the question is whether we can safely defer making it. Like the older writers, he thinks that the Presidential or balance-of-power system, with its rigidity, its frequent stalling, its elevation of second-rate men to power and its long interludes in which no real policymaking is attempted, was tolerable so long as the United States was half-empty, prosperous and well protected by broad oceans. But these happy conditions no longer exist. The nation is crowded, it is beset by fierce industrial and social problems, and its isolation has disappeared forever. It may be remembered that Bryce, in the eloquent closing pages of his \u201cAmerican Commonwealth,\u201d predicted that the United States would yet pass into the \u201cshadow belt,\u201d that, like the fog belt of the Grand Banks, had closed upon older ships of state. We are now in that shadow zone, dark, chilling and perilous. The nation will have to make its way henceforth amid omnipresent difficulties and recurrent crises; it needs, so Mr. Hazlitt intimates, an efficient coordination, a power of instant mobilization, which only the parliamentary system can consistently furnish.\n\nIn short, Mr. Hazlitt bids us drift no longer under the spell of our old Constitution worship but remodel our government with unflinching courage.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

Early in his career, before he changed his diet and underwent sinus surgery, he was the one who frequently wilted in the heat.\n\nDjokovic acknowledged the school of thought that tennis players train to be able to sustain these kinds of conditions and should be rewarded. Jim Courier, when he won the 1993 Australian Open over Stefan Edberg on a torrid afternoon before there was an official heat policy, said he actually threatened not to play if officials closed the roof.\n\n\u201cI was never a big fan of playing in the heat, but I knew that it was advantageous for me versus some opponents,\u201d Courier said on Thursday. \u201cIt was a matter of hating it less than my opponent.\u201d\n\nBut Courier likes that the tournament referee has an official policy to work with now along with some latitude if common sense becomes a better guide. Djokovic made it clear that there was a limit to what players should be asked to suffer \u2014 a balance between needing to be fit and avoiding health risks.\n\nWas that limit reached on Thursday?\n\n\u201cIt was right at the limit,\u201d he said before alluding to the business decisions made to guarantee that the show goes on. \u201cOur sport has become an industry, like most of the other global sports.

Close the roofs and the stars on the show courts get to play under cover while hoi polloi have to wait or play in the heat when play is again authorized.\n\nBut there should be no debate that Djokovic\u2019s victory on Thursday was a tribute to his fitness in his first tournament after an extended injury break. It also was a tribute to his will, which was in question for the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017.

There were others, but Ga\u00ebl, with his abilities and having just won Doha, it was a real test, and Novak passed it after starting poorly, very poorly, to be honest.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to remember a shakier start for Djokovic, who double-faulted on the first two points and twice more in his second service game, spraying backhands and forehands into all the wrong places as he fell behind, 0-3.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I just have to accept it, embrace it.\u201d\n\nIt was soon back to 3-3, however, and though Monfils, taking uncharacteristic risks to shorten the points and the suffering, managed to win the set, he was soon just trying to manage. He pleaded to have more than 25 seconds between points and poured water over his head without bothering to drink it.\n\nAt least there were no hallucinations of the sort the Canadian player Frank Dancevic experienced in the extreme heat wave at the 2014 Australian Open. He had visions of Snoopy shortly before fainting midmatch in the first round and then going on to defeat.\n\n\u201cUntil somebody dies, they\u2019re going to keep playing matches in this heat,\u201d Dancevic said then.\n\nThe heat policy here was designed with considerable medical input, and as much as Melbourne Park felt like a Finnish sauna on Thursday, there were no retirements in any singles match.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt can certainly get hotter, and it may on Friday with temperatures forecast to rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\n\u201cGood luck for the guys,\u201d Monfils said. \u201cHonestly, good luck for the guys.\u201d\n\nThe men have been talking about much more than the weather here this year. With his return to the circuit, Djokovic, the president of the ATP Player Council, has also been initiating discussions on prize money hikes and the merits of unionization.\n\nFederer, a former president of the council, played a pivotal role in persuading the Grand Slam tournaments to raise prize money in the early 2010s. He was in attendance at the mandatory players meeting last Friday in Melbourne where Djokovic broached some of these topics.\n\nFederer was asked very late on Thursday night whether he believed the Grand Slams were devoting a sufficient percentage of their revenue to prize money.\n\nHe looked a touch world-weary as he answered.\n\n\u201cThey could definitely pay more, no doubt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that. We\u2019re not partners. We\u2019re just players. It\u2019s always hard to rally. We had a good agreement, in my opinion. That made the Grand Slams happy, the players pretty happy. Seems like that has run its course.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe moment that happens, there\u2019s not the same increases anymore, so players have to rally, get back together again, put in the effort. The Grand Slams know that. They will only react when we do so. We\u2019re ready to do it. It\u2019s going to be the same process over and over again. It\u2019s a bit boring, to be honest, always having to ask for stuff. If you look at the revenue, the sharing process, it\u2019s not quite where it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n\nHe also said he was encouraged that the players were communicating with one another again. \u201cWhen the players don\u2019t talk, nothing gets done,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was a day for cold water at Melbourne Park, but if ATP or Grand Slam officials had hoped that Federer, the elder statesman, would throw plenty of it on Djokovic\u2019s activism, they were disappointed.\n\nBoring does not quite seem the best word to describe the situation.

It is all just a bad back away from turning into nostalgia.\n\nFederer knows this, and he drank it all in as he returned to Rod Laver Arena, where he experienced one of the biggest buzzes of his long career last year by defeating his friendly archrival Rafael Nadal in a five-set thriller of a final.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big emotions to be back out there,\u201d Federer said. \u201cWhen I returned for the first time to train, you remember where the ball more or less bounced and what side of the court you were on.

Britain\u2019s Daily Mail reported that Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, had asked non-players to leave the meeting room at the Sofitel hotel in order for the players to deliberate in private.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken things out of the context,\u201d Djokovic said on Tuesday at a news conference packed with reporters. \u201cI saw that you\u2019ve portrayed me as someone who is very greedy, asks for more money and wants to boycott. But I respect your, you know, freedom and decisions to do that. But not much of what you have wrote is true.\u201d\n\nDjokovic said there was no discussion on his part of a future Australian Open boycott and no push to unionize, just an exchange of ideas.\n\n\u201cIt was subjects that we never get a chance to talk about in such a large group,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all it was.

He has changed shoe models and manufacturers, too, explaining that he was searching for the ideal fit for his playing style, which includes plenty of sliding on hard courts.\n\n\u201cThat was a big step for me, and I needed to be 100 percent sure before actually doing it,\u201d he told Serbian reporters of the shoe decision. \u201cI knew this break that I\u2019ve had is ideal for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most importantly he has abbreviated his service motion in an attempt to relieve pressure on his right elbow. He no longer drops his racket head nearly as low in the take-back.\n\nIt worked well on Tuesday, and his average first-serve speed of 116 miles per hour was similar to his numbers here in 2016. But what was potentially disquieting was that he lost velocity on his serve on Tuesday as the match progressed. In 2016, according to data provided by Tennis Australia\u2019s Game Insight Group, his average speed remained much more stable or even increased in his final six matches.\n\nMachar Reid, innovation catalyst at Tennis Australia who did his doctoral thesis on the serve, said that there was also some evidence to suggest that an abbreviated service motion might create more load on the shoulder.\n\nBut Djokovic, at least on Tuesday, sounded encouraged. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the second serve; first serve was kind of up and down,\u201d he said. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019m quite pleased. I know that it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for me to kind of work my way in and get used to the specific changes that I\u2019ve made in my service motion. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it was still good. I\u2019m looking forward to work on it more.\u201d\n\nNext under-pressure opportunity: Thursday in the heat against Monfils, who is 0-14 against Djokovic. Despite winning the title in Doha, Qatar, to start the year, Monfils is deeply resistant to the theory that Djokovic\u2019s layoff presents the best opportunity to finally get on the board.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not playing as well as when I\u2019m in form,\u201d Monfils said. \u201cAnd already when I am in form, I have trouble beating him, so imagine the situation now. We keep talking about him, him, him. We\u2019ve got to stop. The guy is a champion.

But there is something unique about positive or negative touch. Emotional touch alters the heart and soul in ways that are mostly unconscious. It can take a lifetime of analysis to get even a glimpse of understanding.\n\nFor this reason, cultures all around the world have treated emotional touching as something apart. The Greeks labeled the drive to touch with the word \u201ceros,\u201d and they meant something vaster and deeper than just sexual pleasure. \u201cAnimals have sex and human beings have eros, and no accurate science is possible without making this distinction,\u201d Allan Bloom observed.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions also treat sex as something sacred and beautiful when enveloped in loving and covenantal protections, and as something disordered and potentially peace-destroying when not.\n\nOver the past 100 years or so, advanced thinkers across the West have worked to take the shame out of sex, surely a good thing. But they\u2019ve also disenchanted it. As Elizabeth Bruenig wrote in The Washington Post this week, \u201cOne of the principal outcomes of the sexual revolution was to establish that sex is just like any other social interaction \u2014 nothing taboo or sacred about it.\u201d Sex is seen as a shallow physical and social thing, not a heart and soul altering thing.\n\nOne unintended effect of this disenchantment is that it becomes easy to underestimate the risks inherent in any encounter. The woman who talked in an online article about her date with Aziz Ansari is being criticized because what happened to her was not like what happened to the victims of Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K.

But just as the surge in oil and gas production in shale fields during the Barack Obama administration had little to do with Washington, the current rise is the result of private companies responding to global markets.\n\nShale fields can be developed relatively quickly and at modest costs relative to the giant projects, whether on land or offshore, that were once favored by big oil companies. That makes it easier to turn investment spigots on or off to adjust to market fluctuations. Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are putting increasing amounts of capital in shale fields, particularly in West Texas and New Mexico.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe results go far beyond the economic, offering Washington strategic weapons once unthinkable. The United States and its allies now have a supply cushion at a time when political turmoil in Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria is threatening to interrupt flows to markets.\n\nOnly a few years ago, such threats \u2014 along with a recent pipeline failure in the North Sea and storms in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 would have sent the price of crude soaring. Instead, the rise has been muted, and gasoline at the pump remains below $2.60 a gallon across most of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new energy power also relieves pressure on Washington to act militarily if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia break out into war. And it gives Washington the leeway to apply sanctions on other producers \u2014 as it has in Russia, and may in Iran or Venezuela \u2014 with far less risk to the global economy.\n\nIt is a striking contrast to the 1970s, when Arab oil boycotts forced motorists to line up for blocks to fill their tanks and the economy went into a tailspin. Even more recently, during the presidency of George W. Bush, domestic oil output was declining so rapidly that the country set a course to replace oil with biofuels like ethanol.\n\nMany environmentalists argue that by increasing oil and gas supplies and lowering prices for consumers, shale drilling is extending the life of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment and the development of cleaner energy.\n\nThe shale drilling revolution has remade the global energy market, with imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plunging by 20 percent from late 2016 to late 2017. At the same time, exports rose by hundreds of thousands of barrels a day.\n\nNothing like the current situation was foreseen in late 2014, when rising domestic production began weighing on global oil prices.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead of throttling back to support prices as the cartel had done so often, it left the market alone and even increased production for a time.\n\nPrices fell below $40 a barrel, as the Saudis and their allies hoped to drive American operations out of business by making shale drilling uneconomical. American exploration quickly dropped, but the price squeeze made companies more innovative in the use of drilling technologies, robotics and sensors to maximize output and reduce costs.\n\nWhile scores of smaller companies went out of business, the survivors lengthened horizontal wells to yield more oil, and used clever hedging and drilling strategies to maximize profits even when prices slumped.\n\nThe response surprised the global oil community. OPEC, Russia and allied producing countries changed course and began cutting back again in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOPEC missed the point,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Ortiz, a former OPEC secretary general and former Ecuadorean energy minister. \u201cThey thought they could recover the U.S. market by bringing the prices down.

Their biggest obstacle is the United States.\n\nTechnological advances unlocking oil from tight rocks like shale has led to a drilling frenzy enabling a doubling of output in a decade, transforming unlikely places like North Dakota and New Mexico into world class petroleum hubs. Pipelines are being built across Texas to serve ports where oil can be pumped onto tankers headed for China, India and other markets.\n\nDomestic production last year averaged 9.3 million barrels a day, and the Energy Department projects that the figure will climb to 10.3 million barrels a day this year, surpassing the record set in 1970. In the meantime, since a 40-year export ban was lifted in 2015, exports of American oil have risen to roughly two million barrels a day \u2014 more than many OPEC members.\n\nThe department projects an additional increase in domestic production of 500,000 barrels a day in 2019.\n\nConcerns over climate change as well as the growing popularity of electric cars and the eventual aging of the best shale fields will probably curb production and demand over the next few decades. But in the short term, the boom has changed the landscape.\n\nThe Energy Department projects that the recent surge will hold the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, to $60 a barrel in 2018 and $61 a barrel in 2019 \u2014 a modest increase from $54 last year. (The Brent price rose above $70 a barrel this month, but few analysts see a return to $100-a-barrel oil.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe emerging order in the energy realm is a stable balance of power. Saudi Arabia, which essentially runs OPEC, has put a floor under the oil price \u2014 probably around $50 a barrel \u2014 with its limits on output and exports over the last four years. But now the United States, by the sheer force of its production, the supremacy of its technology, and an unmatched pipeline, refinery and storage structure, has put a ceiling to the price.\n\nExperts note that when oil climbs to $60 a barrel and higher, as it has lately, a drilling rush commences \u2014 the national rig count has climbed by over a third in the last year \u2014 promising to refill domestic and even global energy inventories.

Both countries are major suppliers of crude \u2014 Iraq produces 4.5 million barrels of oil, and Venezuela adds around 1.8 million barrels \u2014 and any disruptions there could have a significant impact on global markets.\n\nThere are also factors mitigating a relentless rise in prices, though.\n\nFor one, the higher prices would most likely lead to increased investment and exploration for oil and, eventually, more production. This is especially true of smaller producers in the United States, whose output is already growing.\n\nThere is skepticism over whether drillers in Texas and elsewhere can increase output fast enough to create another glut. \u201cThere is a natural limit to what shale can do,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a market research firm. \u201cTrees don\u2019t grow to the sky.\u201d\n\nBut these so-called swing producers have been crucial to previous price declines.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, in an Oil Market Report published in December, noted that new supplies coming onto the market, particularly from the United States, might still exceed growth in demand in the first half of the year.\n\nOn the whole, the oil industry appears to be well down the road of having adjusted to the steep price falls that began in 2014 and saw oil dipping to the $30-a-barrel range.\n\nAmong the shifts: OPEC has taken a more active role in managing global energy markets, with Russia \u2014 which is not a member \u2014 unofficially replacing weakened or uncooperative cartel members like Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.\n\nOil companies have also reshaped themselves, sharply increasing efficiency and reducing costs to a point where they are profitable at current levels, or even lower ones.

Across the population, support has dropped to 57.8 percent from 69.3 percent just four years ago.\n\n\u201cEspecially men in their 20s, about half of them, consider North Korea an outright enemy,\u201d said Kim Ji-yoon, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul who has been tracking attitudes toward reunification. \u201cTo young South Koreans, North Korea is someone they don\u2019t want anything to do with.\u201d\n\nPolling experts say that South Korean men in their 20s often get more hawkish after they finish their mandatory military service.\n\nThe skepticism was apparent this month, when the two Koreas set aside their disputes over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs and agreed to field a joint team in the Winter Games in the town of Pyeongchang, and to march together in the opening ceremony on Feb. 9.\n\nIn the past, such gestures triggered waves of pro-unification sentiment, as in 2000, when North and South Korean athletes marched together at the Games in Sydney, Australia. (They competed separately.) The administration of President Moon Jae-in, a progressive who has long supported inter-Korean unity, hoped this latest rapprochement would create similarly warm feelings.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead, a survey found that more than 72 percent of South Korean adults overall \u2014 and more than 82 percent of those in their 20s and 30s \u2014 were not enthusiastic about the hockey team. More than 54,000 people signed a petition opposing it, and many expressed anger that some South Korean players would cede their positions to North Koreans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am taken aback,\u201d said Kim Sung-hwan, a former South Korean foreign minister. \u201cYoung people seem to think of North Korea as strangers who barge into their party bringing with them nothing but empty spoons.\u201d\n\nSuch pushback would have been expected from conservatives, who have long been suspicious of efforts to engage the North. But younger South Koreans tend to be politically progressive and supportive of Mr. Moon on other issues.\n\nAnalysts said that years of increasingly provocative nuclear and missile tests have darkened South Korean perceptions of the North and its young leader, Mr. Kim. Actions like Mr. Kim\u2019s executions of his own uncle and his half brother have also made the regime look brutal and grotesque.\n\n\u201cWe know that this sudden shift in mood could be confusing for people, especially given how unsettled they were over the North\u2019s missile tests up until just a month ago,\u201d said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Mr. Moon. \u201cBut the Pyeongchang Olympics can go beyond South-North reconciliation and provide clues to easing tensions and building peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say a key turning point in attitudes toward the North came in 2010, when a South Korean naval ship was sunk by an apparent North Korean torpedo attack, killing 46 sailors, and North Korea launched a rocket barrage on a South Korean island that killed four people, including two civilians. These were formative events for young South Koreans, these analysts say.\n\nPhoto\n\nKey members of Mr. Moon\u2019s presidential office and governing party are progressives in their 50s, who went to college in the 1980s. Then, campuses were rife with anti-American activism, partly driven by resentment over the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II. Students defied the authorities by sending a \u201cunification envoy\u201d to the World Festival of Youth and Students, alternative games that North Korea held in Pyongyang in 1989 to counter the previous year\u2019s Summer Olympics in Seoul.\n\nProgressives in that era believed in a peaceful process of reunification, built on the expansion of economic and social exchanges. Today, many of that generation see the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a desperate attempt to protect itself from the United States and the South, with which it is still technically at war.\n\nReunification is also a personal matter for Mr. Moon, 65, who was born in a refugee camp after his parents fled their native North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They tend to call for the South liberating the North from the Kim family\u2019s rule, by force if necessary.\n\nThe horrors of the Korean War, which killed millions, bound older South Koreans together. Many still grow teary-eyed on those occasions when the rival governments allow select groups of aging citizens to meet relatives from the other side after decades of separation.\n\nPhoto\n\nYounger South Koreans don\u2019t share the pain caused by the peninsula\u2019s divide, or the inclination to see North Koreans as long-lost brethren. Last year\u2019s survey by the unification institute found that while more than 47 percent of respondents in their 60s and older said the two Koreas must reunify \u201cbecause they belong to the same nation,\u201d less than 21 percent of respondents in their 20s said so.\n\nOf course, warier views of the North are not limited to the young. Many South Korean conservatives, young and old, embrace the view that the North is building nuclear-tipped intercontinental missiles to drive a wedge between it and the United States, its longtime protector.\n\nThey fear that if Mr. Kim thinks the threat of a nuclear strike on the mainland United States will keep the Americans from intervening, he may try to take over the South, the dream that his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the North\u2019s founding leader, failed to achieve during the Korean War.\n\nOn Thursday, North Korean state media called on \u201call Koreans at home and abroad\u201d to support moves toward reunification and eliminate obstacles created by \u201coutside forces,\u201d a reference to the United States.\n\nMany South Koreans are relieved that North Korea is joining the Olympics, because it is less likely to conduct a major weapons test while its own athletes are competing in Pyeongchang. But they remain deeply skeptical about Mr. Kim\u2019s sudden peace offensive.\n\nIn a town near the Olympic venues, Kang Hee-du, 54, a restaurant worker, wondered how the Koreas could possibly reunify when they have drifted so far apart, economically and ideologically. \u201cIt would be nothing but chaotic,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Choi Sang-hwan, 73, a retired auto-component maker, lamented the new attitude.\n\n\u201cOur generation knows how tragic war can be; it can take everything away,\u201d said Mr. Choi, who is also an Olympic volunteer. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to let our future generations live peacefully in a unified Korea.\u201d", "title": "Olympic Dreams of a United Korea?

It will be the first time the two countries have combined for an Olympics, and the first unified team of any kind since their athletes played together in a table tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991.\n\nThe Olympic agreement could bolster President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who has been pushing for dialogue with the North. \u201cThis will be a great opportunity to thaw the frozen relations,\u201d he said during a visit to the training camp for South Korean athletes.\n\n\u201cIf we unify our team with the North\u2019s, it won\u2019t necessarily improve our team\u2019s strength very much,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cIt will even require extra efforts to build up teamwork with the North Korean players. But if the two Koreas unify their teams and play a great match together, that itself will be long remembered as a historic moment.\u201d\n\nFew expected that the breakthrough in sports diplomacy would lead to a broader relaxation of the decades-old standoff over the North\u2019s nuclear weapon programs.

Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would be open to talks with Mr. Kim himself, though he questioned the value of such a meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d sit down, but I\u2018m not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nHe warned that while North Korea was not yet capable of delivering a ballistic missile to the United States, \u201cthey\u2019re close \u2014 and they get closer every day.\u201d In the interview, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically critical of Russia, saying it had weakened the global sanctions against North Korea, even as China was doing more.\n\n\u201cWhat China is helping us with, Russia is denting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nAnalysts said the agreement would be enormously popular in South Korea. Strong ethic nationalism compels people in both Koreas to cheer for each other\u2019s athletes when they compete against non-Korean teams, especially Japan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at one of these moments where there is this emotional, if not irrational, exuberance at the prospect of North Korean athletes coming south,\u201d said Jonathan D. Pollack, a Korea expert at the Brookings Institution, who is visiting Seoul this week.\n\nA previous such moment came in 1991, when a unified and underdog Korean team won the gold medal in the women\u2019s team competition over China in the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan. The unified women\u2019s ice hockey team will face Japan on Feb. 14 in Pyeongchang.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe problem, Mr. Pollack said, is that North Korea \u201chas put down clear markers about what it wants in return. If the expectation is that North Korea is going to get economic goodies by acting nice, they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nFor the United States, the fear has been that North Korea\u2019s gestures will drive a wedge between it and its ally, South Korea. So far, the two allies have stayed in sync, said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBut it will be harder and harder to insure that South Korea and the U.S. stay closely aligned,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a fundamental tension between a progressive government in Seoul and a hawkish government in Washington.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon proposed in June that the two Koreas form a unified team for the Olympics, but the suggestion was not taken seriously until Mr. Kim used his New Year\u2019s Day speech to propose dialogue with the South and to discuss his country\u2019s participation in the Games.\n\nThat led to a series of talks in the border village of Panmunjom. In an earlier round of negotiations, the North agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to play during the Olympics. On Wednesday, South Korean officials said the North\u2019s delegation would include at least 550 people. The plan is for the North\u2019s athletes to enter the South over a land border on Feb. 1.\n\nSo far, the only North Korean athletes to qualify for the Games are a pairs figure skating team. North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from South Korea and the International Olympic Committee to join the Games.

It is thus greatly encouraging that New Jersey, under its new governor, Phil Murphy, a Democrat, will join \u2014 more precisely, rejoin \u2014 the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium of nine Eastern and New England states that has achieved substantial emissions reductions from large power plants since its start in 2009.\n\nMr. Murphy chose Highlands, a borough on the Atlantic shore hit hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, to announce that he would sign an executive order renewing New Jersey\u2019s participation in the consortium. His predecessor, Chris Christie, a Republican, pulled the state out of the agreement in 2011, claiming he was trying to protect New Jersey ratepayers. A more plausible explanation lay in his nascent presidential aspirations. Climate change had become an unpopular subject among Republicans, and big donors like the Koch brothers were threatening to pull the plug on any candidate who favored regulation of greenhouse gases.\n\nRGGI (pronounced \u201cReggie\u201d) has, in fact, a Republican pedigree, dating back to 2003, when Gov. George Pataki of New York invited other Northeast governors to join a regional effort to reduce carbon emissions. What followed was a regionwide system that sets a declining cap on emissions from large power plants \u2014 about 170 in total \u2014 and requires individual power producers to buy permits from state governments to pollute. As the cap declines, the price of the permits rises, giving utilities an incentive to find cheaper ways to reduce emissions.\n\nAccording to various studies, power plant emissions have declined 40 percent since 2009, while the sale of the permits has raised $2.7 billion that\u2019s been invested in efficiency measures and renewable energy. Some of these reductions would have occurred anyway as plants shifted from coal to cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas, and the reductions are a small fraction of the total greenhouse gases generated in the nine-state region. Even so, it\u2019s a well-designed program that will only get stronger; last August, the nine states agreed to reduce emissions a further 30 percent by 2030.

That\u2019s because the reforms leading the department to cut back on stop-and-frisks are accompanied by such low numbers on violent crime.\n\nPolice reformers have long argued that ending stop-and-frisk would help communities, not harm them.

It is urgent that social scientists, police departments and advocates measure the social costs, because burdensome and disparate policing happens all around the country.\n\nWe should start by listening to targets of these policies.

{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "The circumstances, in Wenger\u2019s eyes, are not exactly parallel. Arsenal is expected to receive midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan in exchange, as well as a fee of $35 million or so; it is not \u201cone-way traffic,\u201d as Wenger has put it.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s relationship with Arsenal, too, is different from van Persie\u2019s. S\u00e1nchez, a Chilean, arrived fully formed; the bond is not quite as strong as it was with van Persie, a Dutchman who was signed as a prodigy and blossomed into a star. \u201cWe made a long work with him,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhen you get them there, to that level, and then they leave \u2014 of course that is the most painful.\u201d\n\nThere are sufficient similarities, however, that Wenger could hardly ignore them. Both van Persie and S\u00e1nchez had been allowed to enter the final years of their contracts, diminishing Arsenal\u2019s bargaining power and enabling United to sign them for relatively small fees, if not insignificant wages. Both will have departed the Emirates for Old Trafford in search of trophies, of greater glory. And both will have done so having rejected, in some way, the chance to sign for Manchester City.\n\nLike all transfers, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s move to Manchester United is about money. At 29, he will become the highest-paid player in the Premier League, earning somewhere in the region of $555,000 a week, an amount Wenger acknowledged Arsenal simply could not match.\n\nIt is also, like most transfers, about ambition. S\u00e1nchez has grown increasingly \u2014 and increasingly visibly \u2014 frustrated by Arsenal\u2019s inability to deliver tangible success, beyond broadly biennial victories in the F.A. Cup. Time is no longer on his side. He is not content to scrap around with Liverpool and Tottenham, hoping for a place in the Champions League.\n\nWhat marks this move out as different is that it is also \u2014 more than most transfers \u2014 about hierarchy, about establishing a place in the pecking order, about power.\n\nBy stripping Arsenal of its best player, again, United proves that it possesses a clout that one of its traditional peers does not; it demonstrates that it sits above Arsenal in the food chain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore important, at a time when United seems unable to beat Manchester City on the field \u2014 Pep Guardiola\u2019s team leads Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s by 12 points \u2014 securing a victory off it offers a little boost to the ego, a little balm for wounded pride.\n\nUnited, on the surface, has snatched one of the best players in the Premier League from under City\u2019s nose; it has been able to overcome S\u00e1nchez\u2019s desire to work, once more, with Guardiola, his coach for a year at Barcelona; it has been able financially to outmuscle a team backed, as Wenger hinted, by a state. It has seized a \u201cfantastic opportunity,\u201d as Mourinho described it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Van Persie did, indeed, reject City in favor of United, the team he had supported as a child in Holland. The same cannot be said of S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThis time, it was City who decided not to press ahead with the deal. It had been prepared to pay $83 million for S\u00e1nchez last summer, plus his salary demands, but balked at the idea of spending $34 million now.\n\nIf that seems curious, consider the circumstances: City was not decisively the best team in England, and perhaps Europe, in the summer. Raheem Sterling had not scored 18 goals in 33 games. Put simply, S\u00e1nchez was worth more to City six months ago than he is now. City missed out on van Persie because of its weakness and United\u2019s strength. If anything, the converse is true of S\u00e1nchez.\n\nIn 2012, United\u2019s paying $34 million for a 29-year-old in the final year of his contract was considered the height of decadence. Ferguson pressed for it, for once, because he did not care about resale value, or the club\u2019s policy of bringing in younger players. He wanted someone who would make an immediate impact, deliver instant success. He wanted to go out at the top. It was a short-term solution to a short-term problem.\n\nS\u00e1nchez is a short-term solution, too, but the nature of the problem United faces has changed. City is no longer a rising force; it is the league\u2019s dominant team. No champion has retained its crown in the Premier League since 2009, but so far ahead of its rivals is City currently that it is difficult to see how it will be overhauled in the space of a single season. Adding S\u00e1nchez is both a show of force and a sign of, if not desperation, then certainly urgency.\n\nIt is impossible to avoid the suspicion that catching and overtaking City will take more than that.\n\nMourinho\u2019s opportunism \u2014 edging his way into a deal that City seemed to have tied up \u2014 is to be praised, but it is telling that both United and Arsenal, likely to replace S\u00e1nchez by signing both Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, now out of favor at Borussia Dortmund, will end the January transfer window having invested in hugely expensive players available only by chance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt does not suggest there is much long-term planning in place at either club, any overarching vision (though Arsenal\u2019s recent front office appointments, including a director of football operations, Raul Sanllehi, and a new chief scout, Sven Mislintat, suggest one may be forthcoming in London).\n\nThe same can be said of Chelsea, currently scouring England for any forward of reasonable height, and reportedly considering an offer for Peter Crouch, 36. These clubs can all afford to indulge such whims, such is the money swilling around the Premier League. Some or all of these deals may prove noteworthy successes.\n\nBut it is hard to imagine they will be enough to claw back Manchester City; certainly not this season, possibly not for some time. It is all very well winning battles, but only if you have some plan in place to finish the war.", "title": "On S\u00e1nchez, City Passes and United Strikes", "authors": ["Rory Smith", "On Soccer"]}

And if you\u2019re a little foolhardy and a lot lucky, you might find yourself on top of a volcano during a serious eruption, which, when you think about the volatile and violent grandeur of such an event, will leave you feeling grateful that the whims of nature let you live to see another day.\n\nLast spring\u2019s eruption of Mount Etna, which routed a party of BBC journalists and tourists with bombs of red-hot lava (their panicked flight recorded on film and dutifully fire-hosed on the internet), reminded me of an earlier expedition \u2014 similarly exhilarating, but with better luck.\n\nIn the summer of 1977, Mount Etna entered a mild phase of eruption. I was living in Rome at the time. I had made a promise to myself during an earlier visit to Sicily that if Etna ever erupted while I was still in Italy, I would drop everything, jump on the next plane to Catania, and get as close to the eruption as I could. I was 26 years old and although I had no clue that I would eventually embark on a career in science writing, I rushed headlong into this adventure with an athlete\u2019s conviction of physical invincibility and a twentysomething\u2019s faith in improvisation. The following day, after an early morning flight, I found myself in Catania, staring up into a Mediterranean sky, Homeric in the brilliance of its blue \u2014 except for that little patch of sky near the top of the 10,808-foot volcano, marked by a smudge of gray.\n\nLike most of the things I did in those days, I didn\u2019t have a plan. I took a bus from the airport to the city (its local architecture, fashioned from dark blocks of Etna\u2019s extruded lava stone, can only be described as brooding), dumped my things in a cheap pensione, and caught the first bus to the Rifugio Sapienza. This refuge, at about 6,000 feet on the lower slopes of the volcano, s erves as a lodge during \u2014 believe it \u2014 ski season, when Etna\u2019s summit typically wears a crown of snow. As I walked across the parking lot, contemplating the suddenly dubious idea of setting off on a hike up the volcano in a pair of threadbare Adidas sneakers, I happened upon a group of journalists from the Italian television network RAI.

This has been driven in no small part by various politicians and technology platforms pursuing their short-term interests over the greater good.

I believe that our rapidly growing number of readers and subscribers is a testament to how people increasingly crave news they can trust. I also believe we still have more to do to help people understand why they should trust our journalism and to provide greater transparency into our reporting.\n\nIn the past, our approach was to let our work speak for itself. Our assumption was that people intuitively understood all the hard work that goes into a New York Times article. But we\u2019ve learned we need to do more to explain how our reporting works. For example, many readers don\u2019t know that a dateline from a foreign city means our reporters are physically in that place, on the ground seeing and hearing firsthand everything they\u2019re reporting. They don\u2019t know that Adam Liptak\u2019s Supreme Court reporting is made stronger by his experience as a lawyer, or that Sheri Fink\u2019s background as a physician informs her investigations into medical misconduct. And they don\u2019t know that for every person we quote in a story, sometimes dozens more have been interviewed.\n\nOn the flip side, I look at articles like Ellen Barry\u2019s heartbreaking tale of a woman murdered in India, C.

The militants rained missiles on the town almost daily, killing 24 people in the area in early 2016.\n\nBut the P.K.K. has been a long-term source of strife, too. Mr. Erdogan spent much of his early years in power trying to negotiate a peace deal with the P.K.K., but since talks broke down in 2015, he has overseen a crackdown on Kurdish militants and political activists.\n\nThe group returned to violence and has been blamed for 12 suicide bombings in the last two and a half years.\n\nPhoto\n\nGiven the strife, there is widespread support across the country for the military operation against Kurdish militants in the Syrian enclave of Afrin.\n\nThe Turkish news media, which is almost overwhelmingly pro-government, has been energetic in its coverage in a longstanding tradition of militaristic nationalism.\n\nOpposition, meanwhile, has been stifled.

Opinion polls showed 70 percent support for an operation that Turkey mounted in 2016 to clear the area of Islamic State, despite Turkish casualties.\n\nPhoto\n\nMetin Gurcan, a security analyst and a columnist for El-Monitor, said he estimated that there was the same level of support for the Afrin operation.\n\n\u201cNow this operation is happening and it is one heart, one hand,\u201d said Mr. Ozer, one of the shopkeepers.\n\nEven the main opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, has voiced its support for the operation.\n\nThe Republican party had always advocated a negotiated settlement with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, rather than backing the Syrian opposition as Mr. Erdogan has done.\n\n\u201cWe are a political party that is against war,\u201d said Mehmet Akif Perker, a local representative of the party. Yet, he added, \u201cin a moment when nationalist pride is really strong, being against it will get a much stronger reaction from the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years Turkey has suffered a lot from the P.K.K.,\u201d Mr. Perker said. \u201cWe are afraid that if we negotiate with them, they will pursue terror again.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe party also considered that it was in Turkey\u2019s economic interest to prevent the creation of an independent Kurdish region to its south that could allow oil routes to bypass Turkey, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe shopkeepers hoped the military operation would allow many of the Syrian refugees to return home. Many Syrian Arabs say they were forced out of their homes by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which has been fighting to dislodge the Islamic State from the region.\n\nKilis, a town with a population of fewer than 100,000, has swelled to 130,000 with the influx of refugees, and although the Syrians have been widely accepted, there is local resentment, especially over economic resources.\n\nTurkey has spent billions on the refugees, noted Mr. Emir, the barber, whose shop was empty. \u201cIf the government had given that money to the Turkish population there would not be any poor people left,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMany shops around the mosque were shuttered Thursday. That morning the shopkeepers attended the funeral of one of the victims of the rocket attack, a 65-year-old tailor, Muzafer Aydemir. The other victim, Tarik Tabbak, was a 22-year-old Syrian refugee.\n\nThe mosque\u2019s imam and muezzin were at the funeral, too, their heads swathed in bandages after being wounded in the attack.\n\nMr. Emir had been cutting the hair of a client on Wednesday evening when the rocket struck. He heard a strange sound of grating metal and ran from his glass-fronted shop, his customer bounding after him.\n\n\u201cMy client told me I saved his life,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cand I did not charge him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all going to die one day,\u201d he added, \u201cbut because we might die at any moment, people treat each other more positively.\u201d", "title": "On Turkey\u2019s Border With Syria, Many Are Eager for War", "authors": ["Carlotta Gall"]}

Simon & Schuster. (2013)\n\nIn this biography, Goodwin examines Theodore Roosevelt through his relationship with the press, arguing that his \u201ccomplex and sometimes contentious partnerships\u201d with investigative journalists helped him speak directly to the public to push his political agenda and expose corruption like \u201cthe human and economic costs of unchecked industrial growth.\u201d He \u201ctested his ideas on reporters,\u201d frequently exchanged correspondence with his favorites and invited them to luncheons that could last until midnight. His policy was sometimes even informed by reporting: After reading Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1906 \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d which exposed the deplorable conditions of the meatpacking industry in Chicago, Roosevelt quickly moved to pass meat inspection legislation.

Roosevelt\u2019s press secretary, a man who fundamentally altered the way the presidency interacts with the press. Stephen T. Early discouraged Roosevelt from calling media sources directly, having him instead deliver a single message in news conferences held twice a week. Early expanded the mediums through which the president communicated to include radio and newsreels.

In addition to showing how Bernstein and Woodward investigated the scandal, the book also reveals the inner workings of a newsroom, including the role editors play in determining the stories that are printed and the risks publications take in printing and reporting stories. Bernstein and Woodward describe their high stakes reporting through anecdotes like a 3 a.m. meeting on an editor\u2019s lawn (they were afraid of being bugged) or clandestine encounters with Deep Throat, Woodward\u2019s deeply connected anonymous source, that are \u201csuperbly and suspensefully described.\u201d", "title": "On the Presidency\u2019s Fraught Relationship With the Press", "authors": ["Concepci\u00f3n De Le\u00f3n"]}

I spoke to the Yates County sheriff, who showed me dozens of photographs of mangled buggies and dead horses.\n\nEddie Zimmerman, 58, an Old Order Mennonite, said buggy drivers want fast horses accustomed to distractions alongside and therefore buy former harness racing horses at auction.

Inside was blue carpeting and a snazzy interior console with deluxe woodwork.\n\nWhen I told him that several authorities spoke of teenage Amish and Mennonites drinking and driving buggies, he said that Amish and Mennonite people allowed teenagers to experience a freewheeling period known as rumspringa, but that rumors of its being an alcohol-soaked experience were exaggerated.\n\nSome Mennonite buggy owners do race each other, on rural roads while returning from church or the market, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, he said, breezing along in the buggy, \u201cSafer than being in a car.\u201d", "title": "On the Road With the Amish", "authors": ["Corey Kilgannon"]}

This time, though, they kept telling us to come right over. They wanted to dish.\n\nIt was Maria who got the most tantalizing early tip. But it was a confusing one. She went to see a senior Lebanese official who, instead of talking about Mr. Hariri, began a tale about the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his recent trip to the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

And so a young gymnast named Chelsea Zerfas, now 15, spoke of anguished probing, under the guise of treatment, face down on an exam room table when she was 13, feeling helpless to challenge a doctor at that age.\n\nThe occasion of the hearing, to help a judge decide Dr. Nassar\u2019s prospective sentence on state charges of nearly a dozen sexual assaults, appeared almost beside the point. He had been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on a child pornography conviction, and the judge in this state court hearing has said that Dr. Nassar, 54, who has pleaded guilty to several sexual-assault charges, can expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nBut before then, she allowed so-called victim impact statements from the 140 girls and women whom prosecutors accuse Dr. Nassar of abusing, leading to days of wrenching testimony here that has evolved into not only a nationally televised reckoning of his crimes but an indictment of a sport that his victims say did little to protect them.\n\nAt the same time, the hearing has dovetailed with the continued expansion of the #MeToo movement that seeks to hold predatory men to account \u2014 in this case, in excruciating detail.\n\n\u201cCome hell or high water, we will find a way to take every last one of you down that could have stopped this monster,\u201d said Amy Labadie, a former gymnast who testified Friday morning. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see into the future and not think this will affect me forever.\u201d\n\nSome of the victims described how the team doctor\u2019s actions spawned suicidal thoughts and ruptured their families, how they hoped he would rot in prison, and how they desperately wanted the blame and repercussions to extend far beyond him \u2014 to the people and the organizations that turned a blind eye.\n\n\u201cImagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,\u201d Ms. Raisman said Friday. \u201cWell, you know what, Larry? I have both power and voice, and I am only just beginning to use them. All these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault, and his sentencing hearing, which began Tuesday, is now expected to continue next week, as the number of women who have wanted to speak in court has grown, from 88 to 105 to 120, at last count \u2014 emboldened by what has happened here this week. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she had cleared her docket.\n\n\u201cYou are all superheroes,\u201d the judge said Friday morning after one of the victims, choking back tears, read her statement.\n\nDr. Nassar entered the courtroom at 9:04 a.m. He wore a dark blue prison uniform. After he reached the witness box, where he has sat with a hangdog expression since the hearing began, he appeared to recognize that Ms. Raisman and Ms. Wieber were seated together in the front row. Dr. Nassar looked down and slowly shook his head.\n\nMs. Wieber, 22, was the first person to testify on Friday \u2014 but the 69th to have her statement heard since the proceedings began. Ms. Wieber said Dr. Nassar began treating her when she was 8. Like many of those who came before her, Ms. Wieber said that Dr. Nassar had manipulated her by bringing her food and coffee at pressure-cooker training camps where such luxuries were prohibited.\n\n\u201cNobody was protecting us from being taken advantage of,\u201d Ms. Wieber said. \u201cNobody was ever concerned whether or not we were being sexually abused.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

What do you think we can do to help?\u2019 Why have I and others here, probably, not heard anything from the leadership at the U.S.O.C.? Why has the United States Olympic Committee been silent? Why isn\u2019t the U.S.O.C. here right now?\u201d\n\nMark Jones, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said in a statement that it first became aware of the possibility that a physician with the gymnastics federation had been abusing athletes in 2015.\n\n\u201cAt that time, U.S.A. Gymnastics indicated that they were in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement agencies,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cWe are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that Nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Jones said, the Olympic committee will continue to press for \u201cmeaningful change\u201d in the gymnastics federation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe federation announced on Thursday that it would cut ties with Karolyi Ranch, a renowned training facility that was one of the places where Dr. Nassar molested the gymnasts.\n\n\u201cThe development camp taking place through Sunday is the last U.S.A. Gymnastics activity at the Ranch,\u201d the federation said in a statement on Friday. \u201cNext week\u2019s training camp for the U.S. women\u2019s national team is canceled and the Acro World Team Trials scheduled for the first week in February has been relocated.\u201d\n\nKara Johnson, now a high school student, spoke about how she was taken to Dr. Nassar for back and hip treatment when she was a 13-year-old runner. Dr. Nassar, she said, placed her on a table on her stomach and then molested her. She described how he left the room, returned with a lubricant and repeated the abuse. He then smacked her on her \u201cbare butt,\u201d called her \u201csweetie\u201d and told her that if she ever had her period when she came to see him, to be sure to let him know, she said.\n\n\u201cHow was I supposed to know at the age of 13 what was medically acceptable and what the boundaries were?\u201d she said.\n\nHer sister Madeline was also abused. Now 15, she told the court that as a 12-year-old gymnast, she was sent to Dr. Nassar for back treatment and underwent the same abuse. \u201cAt only 12 years old, I had no idea that it was inappropriate, illegal and wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Thursday, McKayla Maroney, 22, another Olympic gymnast, said she had \u201cscars\u201d that might never heal after being abused by Dr. Nassar, starting when she was 13 or 14.\n\n\u201cDr. Nassar was not a doctor,\u201d she said in a statement read for her by a prosecutor. \u201cHe in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe impact of the trial, and Dr. Nassar\u2019s history of assault, is spreading well beyond the courtroom. Michigan State University, which employed Dr. Nassar, was also facing increasing pressure after revelations that 14 people, including the president, Lou Anna K. Simon, had been warned about his conduct.\n\nMs. Raisman added that she had not been planning to speak in court \u2014 \u201cI was scared and nervous,\u201d she said \u2014 but decided to add her name to the list once she began listening to the impact statements that were delivered earlier this week.\n\n\u201cMy dream,\u201d she said, \u201cis that one day everyone will know what the words \u2018me, too\u2019 signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like Larry so that they will never, ever, ever have to say the words, \u2018me, too.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe room filled with applause as Ms. Raisman thanked the judge and backed away from the microphone.

But you also have people who\u2019ve lived the American dream. There isn\u2019t really any rhyme or reason to it.\u201d\n\nIn New York, for example, investigators are still trying to figure out what caused Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old native of Uzbekistan, to allegedly climb into a rental truck on Halloween and drive it down a bike path on the West Side of Manhattan, killing eight people. After the attack, Mr. Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by Islamic State videos and those who knew him said that his dreams of success in the United States had not worked out as he had hoped. But the specific steps that led to the episode remain a mystery.\n\nMuch the same is true for Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi immigrant who is accused of strapping a pipe bomb to his chest last month and blowing it up in a Times Square subway tunnel. Though Mr. Ullah, 27, has told investigators he was radicalized online and set his bomb off to protest American airstrikes in the Middle East, the narrative of his journey is incomplete at best.\n\nWhat makes the case of Mr. Saidakhmetov remarkable is the meticulous description he has given of his own radicalization. While it is only one man\u2019s story, the 53-page memo offers a rare glimpse into a terror suspect\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cUsually with things like this, you get a letter or two from a mother or father, but this is a step-by-step rundown of everything that happened,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a novel.\u201d\n\nAccording to the memo, Mr. Saidakhmetov was born along the old Silk Road in the \u201cbackwater city\u201d of Turkestan, Kazakhstan. His father, Arbor Yuylanov, was an alcoholic who beat and raped his mother, Saeira Gulyamova, the memo said. When Mr. Saidakhmetov was 4, his mother fled the marriage and took him to Chernyak, her hometown farming village on the edge of the Kazakh steppe. After that, he rarely saw his father, usually, the memo says, roaming drunk on Turkestan\u2019s streets.\n\nThough Chernyak had a mosque, religion played a limited role in Mr. Saidakhmetov\u2019s childhood. His family identified as Muslim, but did not attend the traditional Friday prayers. His life became even more secular when, after months in Chernyak, his mother moved him to Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. There, she worked long hours as a journalist and left him in their apartment. Alone most nights until 9, the memo said, Mr. Saidakhmetov learned to light a stove when he was 7 and often ate solitary dinners, waiting for his mother.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe family might have stayed in Tashkent. But Ms. Gulyamova\u2019s journalism work eventually ran her afoul of the Uzbek government. She moved to Brooklyn in 2010, settling in the neighborhood of Brighton Beach and taking a job cleaning houses. Mr. Saidakhmetov remained behind in the care of an aunt. But within about a year, he joined his mother in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was 16 at the time, living in an unfamiliar country where he barely spoke the language and had no friends or family beyond his mother. He enrolled at James Madison High School, but for his first six months, the memo said, did not understand a word that was said.\n\nIn his second year at Madison, prosecutors say, Mr. Saidakhmetov attacked a safety officer and was expelled. A few months later, he transferred to Abraham Lincoln High School, but did not last long there either. \u201cThe New York City public schools didn\u2019t have the resources or energy to help him,\u201d said his lawyer, Adam Perlmutter. \u201cSo he dropped out.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sheik Bukhari encouraged young men to find meaning in their lives through the practice of Islam \u2014 and gradually, the memo said, Mr. Saidakhmetov did.\n\nBut while his new religiosity gave him direction, it also led to conflicts with his mother. He began to criticize her for leaving her head uncovered and for not attending mosque, as he had started doing. Once, the memo said, Mr. Saidakhmetov threw out some of his mother\u2019s beauty products fearing they were made with pork, which Islam forbids. After a particularly heated fight, Ms. Gulyamova moved from their home, leaving her son to live alone again.\n\n\u201cIt repeated the pattern of abandonment at the worst time possible,\u201d the memo said.\n\nMr. Saidakhmetov \u2014 18 at the time \u2014 asked a fellow Uzbek man he had met at the mosque, Abdurasul Juraboev, to move in. At 24, Mr. Juraboev was older and more devout than his new friend and quickly cast a spell on him, the memo said. Though Mr. Juraboev was also struggling in New York \u2014 he worked in a gyro shop \u2014 he seemed so versed in Islamic law that Mr. Saidakhmetov began to call him \u201csheikh.\u201d\n\nAs the men grew closer, momentous events were occurring in the Middle East. In 2014, the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed the formation of a new caliphate. At home in a new apartment in Midwood, Brooklyn, Mr. Saidakhmetov devoured news of the Islamic State, fueling what the memo called his \u201cnewfound sense of belonging.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of being a lonely kid lost in Brooklyn with limited English proficiency,\u201d it said, \u201che was part of a worldwide online community \u2014 the Ummah \u2014 supporting an Islamic religious movement.\u201d\n\nAs part of that support, prosecutors said, Mr. Saidakhmetov started posting pro-ISIS comments on Hilofatnews, an Uzbek-language jihadist website. In one of them, in August 2014, he talked about a mass execution of Iraqi soldiers by ISIS militants. \u201cI was very happy after reading this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy eyes joyful so much victory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Juraboev was also posting comments on the website and one of them attracted the attention of the government. In it, he expressed an interest in killing President Obama.\n\nFour weeks later, court papers say, federal agents placed an informant in the men\u2019s mosque and the timing was precipitous. Mr. Saidakhmetov and Mr. Juraboev had already discussed getting a third roommate. \u201cNow, out of nowhere, someone had shown up at their mosque, who shared their deep religious beliefs,\u201d the memo said, \u201cand who, coincidentally, was looking for a place to live.\u201d\n\nThe case, by that point, was all but over. Within five months, Mr. Saidakhmetov had bought a round-trip ticket from New York to Istanbul. He told the informant that once he reached Turkey, he and Mr. Juraboev planned to enter Syria and fight with the Islamic State.\n\nHe had moved from believer, to planner, to doer, the memo said. \u201cAll of the pieces were perfectly fit in place.\u201d", "title": "One Brooklyn Man\u2019s Lonely Journey to Jihad", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

I filled it out right there.\u201d\n\nLike a growing number of Americans over age 60, she already had a standard advance directive, designating a decision-maker (her husband) to direct her medical care if she became incapacitated.\n\nNot all experts are convinced another directive is needed. But as Dr. Gaster and his co-authors recently argued in the journal JAMA, the usual forms don\u2019t provide much help with dementia.\n\n\u201cThe standard advance directives tend to focus on things like a \u2018permanent coma\u2019 or a \u2018persistent vegetative state,\u2019\u201d Dr. Gaster said. \u201cMost of the time, they apply to a person with less than six months to live.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a terminal disease, dementia often intensifies slowly, over many years. The point at which dementia patients can no longer direct their own care isn\u2019t predictable or obvious.\n\nMoreover, patients\u2019 goals and preferences might well change over time. In the early stage, life may remain enjoyable and rewarding despite memory problems or difficulties with daily tasks.\n\n\u201cThey have potentially many years in which they wouldn\u2019t want a directive that says \u2018do not resuscitate,\u2019\u201d Dr. Gaster said. But if severe dementia leaves them bedridden, unresponsive and dependent, they might feel differently \u2014 yet no longer be able to say so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhereas a persistent vegetative state occurs rarely, Dr. Gaster tells his patients, dementia strikes far more commonly.\n\nHow commonly? That\u2019s not a simple question to answer.\n\nResearchers often cite the long-term Framingham study, which in 1997 estimated the lifetime risk at age 65 as 10.9 percent for men and 12 percent for women.\n\nBut the participants in that study were overwhelmingly white. Among the populations facing higher dementia rates are African-Americans, Dr. Murali Doraiswamy, a neuroscientist at Duke University, pointed out.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast year, the journal Demography published a more representative model, estimating that for the cohort born in 1940, the lifetime risk at age 70 was 30.8 percent for men and 37.4 percent for women.\n\nDr. Gaster tells patients that \u201csomewhere between 20 and 30 percent of us will at some point develop dementia.\u201d Over the past year, as patients turn 65 and qualify for Medicare \u2014 which covers a visit to discuss advance care planning \u2014 he has offered them his dementia-specific directive, intended to supplement their other directives.\n\nFor each stage of dementia, the patient can choose among four options. \u201cFull efforts to prolong my life\u201d and \u201ccomfort-oriented care only, focused on relieving suffering\u201d represent two ends of the spectrum.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The experience can lead to delirium and other setbacks.\n\nSo far, 50 to 60 patients have filled out the form. A few have declined his offer to discuss dementia; others \u201cnod and thank me and take it home and never mail it back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut most appreciate the overture, Dr. Gaster said, especially if family members have experienced dementia. \u201cIt\u2019s something they think and worry about, and they welcome the idea because they do have clear wishes.\u201d In that case, he adds the completed form to their medical records.\n\nWe could debate whether a separate dementia form, on top of the general advance directive everyone should have, makes sense. Already, nurses and doctors lament that paperwork often winds up forgotten in a drawer, a safe deposit box or a lawyer\u2019s office, unavailable in a crisis.\n\nIf patients haven\u2019t updated the directive in years, their designated proxies may have moved or died. Proxies may never have learned their loved ones\u2019 preferences in the first place. Will adding another directive clarify this process?\n\nOther leaders in the campaign to persuade Americans to document their end-of-life wishes had questions, too.\n\nEllen Goodman, founder of The Conversation Project (whose dementia-related kit similarly presents choices at different stages), pointed out that the new form represents a patient-doctor agreement.\n\n\u201cWe need to have families involved,\u201d she said. \u201cNo checklist on earth is going to cover everything you encounter. Most important is the conversation with the decision-maker. That person has to understand what you value and what\u2019s important to you.\u201d\n\nDr. Rebecca Sudore, a geriatrician and palliative care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed. Her effort \u2014 Prepare for Your Care, an online guide \u2014 encourages users to incorporate their reasons for various decisions. \u201cAt the bedside, the \u2018why\u2019 is very important,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth The Conversation Project and Prepare for Your Care provide links to the advance directive/durable power-of-attorney forms legal in each state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat\u2019s not in dispute: It\u2019s crucial to talk to family, friends and doctors about the quality of life we find acceptable and unacceptable, which interventions we agree to or don\u2019t \u2014 and then to document those decisions and circulate the document to designated decision-makers and everyone else who might be involved.\n\nAnd yes, we should incorporate decisions about dementia into that process, whether in a separate form or not.\n\nWhen Ann Vandervelde completed her dementia-specific directive, \u201cI felt great relief,\u201d she said.

In fact, that has sometimes been the stated goal.\n\nBut now a counterattack is underway.\n\nNot only are civil-rights advocates fighting the various attempts to restrict voting, they\u2019re also pushing for new laws to expand it. One of those efforts took a step forward this week.\n\nOrganizers in Florida announced that they had gathered enough signatures to put an initiative on the ballot this November that would restore voting rights to nearly 1.5 million convicted felons. Today, felon disenfranchisement denies the right to vote to one in five black Floridians \u2014 and 10 percent of the state\u2019s total voting population.", "title": "Opinion | One Person, One Vote", "authors": []}
