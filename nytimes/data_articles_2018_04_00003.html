But it stopped short of endorsing the idea of a treaty, which is likely to involve extensive negotiations and would require the recognition of North Korea by the United States.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s attitude is open and supportive to any peaceful means to resolve the Korean Peninsula issue through consultations,\u201d Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said when asked at a news briefing in Beijing about supporting a possible treaty.\n\nChina has promoted the idea of a peace treaty from time to time over the past two decades, to little avail. This time, analysts said on Wednesday, Beijing\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea is likely to be tempered by rising tensions with the Trump administration over trade and Taiwan. Chinese officials are livid over Washington\u2019s move this week to prevent American suppliers from selling parts to the Chinese tech giant ZTE, they said.\n\n\u201cIf the two countries cannot settle the trade issues, that will have a significant impact on China\u2019s attitude toward helping the United States on North Korea,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at the Beijing-based Renmin University. \u201cThe ongoing situation with trade is complicating and undermining cooperation.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Cheng said, China\u2019s relations with North Korea have rapidly warmed in the wake of Kim Jong-un\u2019s surprise visit to Beijing last month.

Despite its name, the zone is the world\u2019s most heavily armed border. Although the armistice allows only rifles and pistols within the area, both sides have deployed much heavier weapons and operate guard posts inside the zone.\n\nIn the past, the North\u2019s conditions for its denuclearization have included the withdrawal of the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a demand that Washington and Seoul have adamantly rejected. But Mr. Kim has recently indicated that he could be more flexible about the American military presence in the South if his country no longer felt threatened by it, according to officials and analysts in Seoul.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe think that North Korea is more realistic about the security environment on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Mr. Chung said on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Kim\u2019s decision not to object to recent joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. The North has typically used such drills as a pretext to conduct weapons tests and reject dialogue.\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Kim\u2019s late father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, told the visiting South Korean president Kim Dae-jung that he could support the American military presence as a peacekeeping force in the region, according to South Korean officials who attended their meeting.\n\n\u201cI am quite sure that if relations between North Korea and the United States improve, the North will not demand the withdrawal of American troops in signing the peace treaty,\u201d Lee Jong-seok, a former South Korean unification minister, said during a forum on Wednesday.\n\n\u2018There Could Be a Partial Withdrawal\u2019\n\nFormally ending the war would not necessarily mean that Mr. Kim would demand that all American troops be removed, said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThere could be a partial withdrawal,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, all this maneuvering is going on while the United States and South Korea are conducting joint military exercises.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, Mr. Kim seems likely to demand at least a major reduction in troops, said Hugh White, a senior military strategist who worked at the Australian Department of Defense and is now a professor at Australian National University. One outcome, he said, could be a substantial troop withdrawal in exchange for Mr. Kim\u2019s scrapping his intercontinental ballistic missile program.\n\nSuch an agreement could appeal to Mr. Trump with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d perspective, Mr. White said. From that point of view, \u201cit could make sense to withdraw from Korea if in return Kim Jong-un scrapped the ICBM program and thus ceased to threaten the continental United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThat, Mr. White noted, would transform the American military presence in Asia. \u201cIt would be a big win for China,\u201d he said.", "title": "Treaty to Formally End Korean War Is Being Discussed, South Confirms", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun", "Jane Perlez"]}

(There is a small group of researchers who believe viruses may even have come here from outer space, an idea known as panspermia.)\n\nWhatever the case, viruses are the most abundant entities on the planet by far. While Dr. Suttle\u2019s team found hundreds of millions of viruses in a square meter, they counted tens of millions of bacteria in the same space.\n\nMostly thought of as infectious agents, viruses are much more than that. It\u2019s hard to overstate the central role that viruses play in the world: They\u2019re essential to everything from our immune system to our gut microbiome, to the ecosystems on land and sea, to climate regulation and the evolution of all species. Viruses contain a vast diverse array of unknown genes \u2014 and spread them to other species.\n\nLast year, three experts called for a new initiative to better understand viral ecology, especially as the planet changes. \u201cViruses modulate the function and evolution of all living things,\u201d wrote Matthew B. Sullivan of Ohio State, Joshua Weitz of Georgia Tech, and Steven W. Wilhelm of the University of Tennessee. \u201cBut to what extent remains a mystery.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDo viruses even fit the definition of something alive? While they are top predators of the microbial world, they lack the ability to reproduce and so must take over the cell of a host \u2014 called an infection \u2014 and use its machinery to replicate. The virus injects its own DNA into the host; sometimes those new genes are useful to the host and become part of its genome.\n\nResearchers recently identified an ancient virus that inserted its DNA into the genomes of four-limbed animals that were human ancestors. That snippet of genetic code, called ARC, is part of the nervous system of modern humans and plays a role in human consciousness \u2014 nerve communication, memory formation and higher-order thinking. Between 40 percent and 80 percent of the human genome may be linked to ancient viral invasions.\n\nViruses and their prey are also big players in the world\u2019s ecosystems. Much research now is aimed at factoring their processes into our understanding of how the planet works.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you could weigh all the living material in the oceans, 95 percent of it is stuff is you can\u2019t see, and they are responsible for supplying half the oxygen on the planet,\u201d Dr. Suttle said.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, he has filtered viruses out of seawater but left their prey, bacteria. When that happens, plankton in the water stop growing. That\u2019s because when preying viruses infect and take out one species of microbe \u2014 they are very specific predators \u2014 they liberate nutrients in them, such as nitrogen, that feed other species of bacteria. In the same way, an elk killed by a wolf becomes food for ravens, coyotes and other species. As plankton grow, they take in carbon dioxide and create oxygen.\n\nOne study estimated that viruses in the ocean cause a trillion trillion infections every second, destroying some 20 percent of all bacterial cells in the sea daily.\n\nViruses help keep ecosystems in balance by changing the composition of microbial communities. As toxic algae blooms spread in the ocean, for example, they are brought to heel by a virus that attacks the algae and causes it to explode and die, ending the outbreak in as little as a day.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhile some viruses and other organisms have evolved together and have achieved a kind of balance, an invasive virus can cause rapid, widespread changes and even lead to extinction.\n\nWest Nile virus has changed the composition of bird communities in much of the United States, killing crows and favoring ravens, some researchers say. Multiple extinctions of birds in Hawaii are predicted as the mosquito-borne avipoxvirus spreads into mountain forests where it was once too cold for mosquitoes to live.\n\nWhen species disappear, the changes can ripple through an ecosystem. A textbook example is a viral disease called rinderpest.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Italian army brought a few cattle into North Africa, and in 1887 the virus took off across the continent, killing a broad range of cloven-hoofed animals from Eritrea to South Africa \u2014 in some cases wiping out 95 percent of the herds.\n\n\u201cIt infected antelope, it infected wildebeest and other large grazers across the whole ecosystem,\u201d said Peter Daszak, the president of Ecohealth Alliance, which is working on a global project to catalog viruses likely to pass from animals to humans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe impact was not just on the animals. But because they are primary grazers and they died off in huge numbers, vegetation was impacted, and it allowed trees to grow where they would have been grazed away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe large acacia trees on the plains of Africa are all the same age and were seedlings when rinderpest first came in and the wildlife died,\u201d Dr. Daszak said. In other places, far less grazing created a hospitable habitat for the tsetse fly, which carries the parasites that cause sleeping sickness.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of ecological changes can last for centuries or even millennia,\u201d Dr. Daszak said.\n\nCombined with drought, large numbers of people died from starvation as rinderpest spread. An explorer in 1891 estimated two-thirds of the Masai people, who depended on cattle, were killed.\n\n\u201cAlmost instantaneously, rinderpest swept away the wealth of tropical Africa,\u201d wrote John Reader in his book \u201cAfrica: A Biography of a Continent.\u201d\n\nWith intensive vaccinations, rinderpest was completely wiped out, not only in Africa but globally in 2011.\n\nThe beneficial effects of viruses are much less known, especially among plants. \u201cThere are huge questions in wild systems about what viruses are doing there,\u201d said Marilyn Roossinck, who studies viral ecology in plants at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cWe have never found deleterious effects from a virus in the wild.\u201d\n\nA grass found in the high-temperature soils of Yellowstone\u2019s geothermal areas, for example, needs a fungus to grow in the extreme environment. In turn, the fungus needs a virus.\n\nTiny spots of virus on the plant that yields quinoa is also important for the plant\u2019s survival. \u201cLittle spots of virus confer drought tolerance but don\u2019t cause disease,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changes the whole plant physiology.\u201d\n\n\u201cViruses aren\u2019t our enemies,\u201d Dr. Suttle said. \u201cCertain nasty viruses can make you sick, but it\u2019s important to recognize that viruses and other microbes out there are absolutely integral for the ecosystem.\u201d", "title": "Trillions Upon Trillions of Viruses Fall From the Sky Each Day", "authors": ["Jim Robbins"]}

Lawmakers in both parties feared that the president would suspend sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama as he pursued warmer relations with Moscow as promised during his campaign and first year in office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration opposed that legislation but quietly acceded to it after it passed with a veto-proof majority. Within that law was a measure requiring the administration to create a list of Russian oligarchs. Lobbying around the creation of the list became intense as Russia\u2019s wealthiest citizens feared punishing sanctions to come.\n\nThat is exactly what happened on Friday.\n\nThe sanctions list will only hasten the slide of Washington-Moscow relations. This week, 60 American diplomats left Russia as part of a tit-for-tat series of expulsions that followed last month\u2019s nerve-gas poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter.\n\nMr. Skripal\u2019s poisoning on British soil prompted more than 20 countries to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers, the largest such coordinated action ever. British officials believe that Mr. Skripal\u2019s poisoning, which occurred after an assassin smeared a nerve agent on the door handle of his home, was such a risky operation that it was unlikely to have been undertaken without approval from the Kremlin.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in the poisoning.\n\nBut the attack is seen as part of a pattern of increasingly aggressive moves by Mr. Putin, including the seizure of Crimea; military interventions in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria; tacit support for President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s chemical attacks on his own populace in Syria; a direct attack by Russian mercenaries on American troops in Syria; and the hacking of elections in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s responses to Mr. Putin\u2019s needling have been uneven. Although Congress gave the State Department $120 million in 2016 to counter Russian hacking efforts, the department has so far spent none of it. And Mr. Trump said this week that he wanted American forces to leave Syria soon, an exit that would benefit Iran, Russia and one of its allies, Mr. Assad.\n\nBut the administration has also imposed considerable economic penalties on Russia, with Friday\u2019s action the latest in a string of similar moves.\n\nNATO allies are now thinking anew about more coordinated responses to track and impose sanctions on Mr. Putin\u2019s cronies.

Top aides in the Trump White House have frequently called officials at the State Department and the Pentagon to try to hurry things along.\n\nBut the deals can pose an array of challenges, involving not only national security issues, such as the transfer of sensitive technologies, but also economic ones. India, the world\u2019s largest weapons buyer, often requires defense firms to build weapons in India in partnership with Indian firms, the kind of requirements that the Trump administration finds objectionable in China with regard to cars and other products.\n\nThe biggest change announced on Thursday involves the sale of larger armed drones like the Predator and the Reaper, which have been the workhorses of the fight against insurgents in Afghanistan and the tribal regions of Pakistan. President Barack Obama embraced the weapons but was also so troubled by such remote warfare tools that he placed unusual restrictions on their sale.\n\nThose restrictions have allowed drone makers in Israel, China and Turkey to capture a large part of a market that American manufacturers had pioneered, something the Trump administration wants to reverse.\n\nThe new drone export policy \u201cwill level the playing field by enabling U.S. firms to increase their direct sales to authorized allies and partners,\u201d Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy, said in a news briefing on Thursday. He added, \u201cThis will keep our defense industrial base in the vanguard of emerging defense technologies while creating thousands of additional jobs with good wages and generating substantial export revenues.\u201d\n\nMr. Navarro noted that at last year\u2019s Paris Air Show, Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group of China showed off its Wing Loong II, a medium-altitude long-endurance drone that he described as a knockoff of General Atomics\u2019 Reaper. He said the market for such aircraft was expected to be $50 billion annually within a decade.\n\nUnder the old policy, only Britain, France and Italy were approved to purchase armed drones, according to Dan Gettinger, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That could potentially justify sales of \u201csmart\u201d bombs, which are easier to direct to specific targets.\n\nBut experts said that the changes are not likely to have much effect on sales.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s political posturing,\u201d said Rachel Stohl, managing director of the Stimson Center, a think tank focusing on foreign policy. \u201cWe already sell to almost everybody in the world.

I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nHuman rights advocates denounced the changes as loosening rules they viewed as already too permissive.

And in 2011, President Barack Obama went ahead with a trip to Brazil while American forces were striking Libya. But White House officials argued that Mr. Trump felt strongly about remaining on United States soil as the situation in Syria unfolded.\n\nThe decision appeared to have taken even some senior White House officials by surprise. Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was unaware of the president\u2019s new plans when he told a conservative radio host on Tuesday morning that he would be traveling with Mr. Trump to Latin America this week. He said Mr. Trump would be able to \u201ccompartmentalize.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of reasons for Mr. Trump to dread the trip to South America, which promised to include considerable behind-the-scenes friction and little of the flattering pomp and ceremony that he relishes \u2014 and to which he was treated during visits last year to Saudi Arabia and China.\n\nThe president\u2019s approval rating in Latin America is extraordinarily low, and leaders there have been insulted by his anti-immigrant talk and alarmed by his threats to use military force in Venezuela. The White House had already scaled back Mr. Trump\u2019s trip, trimming what was initially intended as a five-day visit to one that involved fewer than three days on the ground.\n\nMr. Trump had planned to use that brief time to seek consensus on how to handle the crisis in Venezuela and press his case for better trade deals with Latin American nations. The president\u2019s advisers had played down expectations for major advances during the trip, including saying it was unlikely to produce any breakthroughs on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThey had left open the question of whether Mr. Trump would meet with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, with whom he has had a stormy relationship. The two have clashed on the phone over Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and the latest such altercation led them to cancel a tentatively planned visit by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to the White House in March.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has taken umbrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last week to send National Guard troops to patrol the southern border.", "title": "Trump Cancels Trip to Latin America, Citing Crisis in Syria", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "But the president\u2019s speech gave no indication that he will in fact respect his decision last year to remain faithful to the 1973 law. Worse yet, in his follow-up, the defense secretary, James Mattis, advanced a much more aggressive position, asserting that \u201cthe president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force overseas to defend important U.S. national interests.\u201d\n\nThis is precisely the view notoriously advanced by John Yoo during the early years of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. If Mr. Trump fails to notify Congress, as required by the 1973 statute, he will be repudiating his own precedent and embracing an extreme position that even Mr. Bush rejected during the second term of his administration. To be sure, Mr. Yoo made his sweeping claims to defend the commander in chief\u2019s authority to torture terrorists, while Mr. Mattis is making Yoo-like arguments to support the noble cause of suppressing chemical warfare. But once Mr. Mattis\u2019 sweeping assertion of presidential power is accepted, it will be used as a precedent by Mr. Trump to ignore the War Powers Resolution whenever he, and he alone, is persuaded that \u201cimportant national interests\u201d justify future military adventures.\n\nDefenders of presidential war-making back up their position by claiming that Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibility to serve as the ultimate arbiter over war and peace. But this is false. In passing its omnibus appropriations bill only last month, Congress was careful to provide that \u201cnone of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to Syria in contravention of the War Powers Resolution, including for the introduction of United States armed or military forces into hostilities in Syria.\u201d\n\nCongress even more recently responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s military escalation in the Middle East by reinvigorating its authority under the War Powers Resolution. Its reassertion of war-making power was provoked by Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral military support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Earlier this month, a bipartisan senatorial coalition invoked a special provision of the War Powers Resolution to force a floor vote condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s action. While this motion was returned to the Foreign Relations Committee by a margin of 55 to 44, it was only after the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, promised to consider legislation this week that could limit the president\u2019s war-making authority against Islamic militants.\n\nMr. Corker should rapidly follow through on his commitment if Mr. Trump fails to provide Congress the required notice under the War Powers Resolution. If Mr. Corker hesitates, members of the Senate and the House should fill the gap, and follow the example recently set in the Yemen case. This not only allows them to invoke a special provision of the resolution to force a timely vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s Syrian campaign; it also prevents any efforts to filibuster or delay their initiative, since the War Powers Resolution requires a final vote \u201cwithin three calendar days\u201d after members have forced their motion onto the floor of each house.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Can\u2019t Make War Whenever He Likes", "authors": []}

Putin of Russia, including congratulating him on a re-election widely denounced as a sham and even suggesting a White House meeting.

For weeks, the White House had played down that option, in part because aides did not like the optics of Mr. Trump traveling to Mr. Kim\u2019s doorstep. Instead, they have discussed sites as far-flung as Singapore, Vietnam, Mongolia and even a Navy warship anchored in the Pacific.\n\nBut all that was before the vivid images last Friday of Mr. Kim greeting Mr. Moon at the line of demarcation between North and South, and then sitting down with him in the Peace House.\n\nSouth Korea built the three-story, gray-stone edifice in the border village of Panmunjom to hold meetings with officials from the North. For years, American officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have stopped there during their visits to the Demilitarized Zone.

Just asking!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for the meeting with Mr. Kim has drawn expressions of concern from former officials in both Republican and Democratic administrations. They fear that North Korea will exploit the president\u2019s hunger for a win to lure the United States into a protracted negotiation that will leave it with at least some of its nuclear weapons but vitiate the sanctions regime that Mr. Trump helped build.\n\nSouth Korea, they note, has already established a commission to study economic projects that it could pursue with the North \u2014 an early indicator of how the sanctions could crumble over time.\n\nOthers, however, dismiss those fears as naysaying from officials who failed in their own efforts to deal with North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 hating him for almost starting a war and hating him for having a summit,\u201d said Joel S. Wit, an expert on North Korea at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who was involved in diplomacy during the Clinton administration that led to a nuclear agreement in 1994.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly dangers, given his style, in a summit,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I prefer that to the possibility we were facing last year of armed conflict since it at least gives us the possibility of a peaceful future.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the bid for a statesman\u2019s mantle also appeals to his political base.

But he has shown far more openness than previous presidents to the concept of a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War. North Korea has long pushed for such a treaty, and the current South Korean government favors it as well.\n\nSigning even a preliminary peace document in the Demilitarized Zone, people who know Mr. Trump said, would give him an unforgettable moment in a place saturated with history. Some experts said that this theater, rather than the grinding business of nuclear disarmament, is what appeals to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about this summit like a former N.S.C. staffer,\u201d said Michael J.

By pardoning Mr. Libby, Mr. Trump sends a message to those who might incriminate him in crimes related to conspiring with Russians to tamper with the election: The message is that he will rectify any sadness that protecting a president might cause.\n\nThe thing is, Mr. Trump is unlikely to be able to use his pardon power to get out of his legal jam.

His academic work includes research papers on exchange rates, inflation and optimal monetary policy.\n\nHis nomination won quick applause from Fed watchers and some economists, who cast him as a serious thinker unlikely to radically pull the central bank away from its gradual approach to raising interest rates as the economy continues to heal from the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cRich Clarida is an outstanding monetary economist whose knowledge of monetary policy and international finance will add greatly to the Fed in this most interesting time,\u201d said R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia\u2019s business school and a former chairman of the second President Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIn addition, Rich\u2019s knowledge of and experience in financial markets will make him a valuable colleague for Chairman Powell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTim Duy, a University of Oregon economist and the writer of the Fed Watch blog, said in an email that Mr. Clarida was \u201ca solid pick \u2014 a respected academic economist plus market experience via Pimco plus government experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think every position needs to be filled by a trained macroeconomist, but given the nature of the job, I think there needs to be a heavy dominance of trained macroeconomists,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cI think he fits within the current consensus as well so, like the elevation of Williams, represents largely a maintenance of the status quo, at least for now.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

You\u2019re not going to find him saying things that are particularly ideological. He\u2019s just a strong policy guy.\u201d\n\nThe post to which Mr. Clarida was nominated had been vacant since Stanley Fischer, an appointee of President Barack Obama, stepped down in October.\n\nOne thing his nomination will not do is bring diversity to the Fed\u2019s leadership team, which is all-male and all-white \u2014 a complaint liberal groups made about the New York Fed\u2019s selection of Mr. Williams. But the reaction to Mr. Clarida\u2019s selection among Fed critics was reserved.\n\n\u201cLike all nominees, Clarida should be vetted thoroughly for his commitment to the full-employment mandate and to regulating banks to avoid another financial crash,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, the director of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of labor and other liberal groups that have pushed the Fed to keep interest rates low to aid job creation.\n\nMs. Bowman, 46, would increase gender diversity on a board that includes only one other woman, Lael Brainard, along with Mr. Powell and Randal K.

Wilson IV, was a former diplomat who wrote an op-ed article in The New York Times in 2003 implying that Mr. Cheney ignored evidence that argued against the conclusion that Iraq was actively seeking to build nuclear weapons.\n\nTo undercut Mr. Wilson\u2019s criticism, administration officials told reporters that he had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Niger because his wife worked for the C.I.A., not at the behest of Mr. Cheney. But federal law bars the disclosure of the identities of C.I.A. officials in certain circumstances and the leak prompted a special prosecutor investigation.\n\nCharged with lying to investigators about his interactions with journalists, Mr. Libby insisted he simply remembered events differently. But his version of events clashed with the testimony of eight other people, including fellow administration officials, and a jury convicted him. Mr. Bush decided that the prison sentence was \u201cexcessive,\u201d but he said he would not substitute his judgment for that of the jury when it came to the question of Mr. Libby\u2019s guilt.\n\nMr. Libby\u2019s advocates argued that Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, went too far because he had already discovered that the first administration official to disclose Ms. Wilson\u2019s identity to a journalist was Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state in Mr. Bush\u2019s first term, who was not charged. They also argued that Ms. Wilson was not undercover at the time and her employment was well known. Ms. Wilson has denied that she recommended her husband for the mission to Niger and said her career as a C.I.A. official was \u201cover in an instant\u201d once her identity was leaked.\n\nThe case tested the limits of journalistic independence. Judith Miller, then a reporter for The Times, went to prison for 85 days rather than disclose that Mr. Libby had discussed Ms. Wilson with her. She was freed after Mr. Libby released her from any promise of confidentiality.\n\nThe issue became a major point of contention between Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in the last days of the administration in late 2008 and early 2009. Mr. Cheney repeatedly pressed Mr. Bush to go beyond his commutation and issue a full pardon, bringing it up so often that the president grew irritated by the matter.\n\nMr. Bush assigned White House lawyers to examine the case, but they advised him the jury had ample reason to convict Mr. Libby and the president rebuffed Mr. Cheney\u2019s request. Mr. Bush told aides that he suspected that Mr. Libby had thought he was protecting Mr. Cheney, the real target of the investigation.", "title": "Trump Plans to Pardon Scooter Libby for Perjury in C.I.A.

Also present at the meeting were Jeff Sessions, the attorney general; Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security; Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Trump first began raising new dangers posed by immigration in a series of confusing tweets and public statements that started Sunday and continued on Monday. That prompted White House officials to organize a conference call on Monday afternoon to outline a detailed legislative push they said the president was starting for the new immigration restrictions. Deploying the National Guard was not mentioned during the call.\n\nThe announcements on Monday and Tuesday appeared to be more about political messaging than practical action. Stung by a backlash from his conservative supporters over his embrace of a trillion-dollar-plus spending measure that did not fund his promised border wall, and lacking a legislative initiative to champion with the approach of midterm congressional elections this fall, Mr. Trump has reverted to the aggressive anti-immigration messaging that powered his presidential campaign and has defined his first year in office.\n\nImmigration advocates denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement as a political ploy.\n\n\u201cHe cannot get funding for his wall, so instead he irresponsibly misuses our military to save face,\u201d Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York.\n\nOthers said Mr. Trump\u2019s sudden declaration was merely an instance of a now-familiar pattern wherein the president reacts angrily to something he sees in the news \u2014 in this case, reports of a large group of migrants from Honduras traveling through Mexico with hopes of reaching the United States \u2014 and seeks to use it as a cudgel against his political opponents.\n\n\u201cSome of it is just the guy at the end of the bar yelling his opinions \u2014 his gut reaction is to say we\u2019ve got to send the military,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates slashing immigration levels. \u201cBut there may also be an element here of political messaging \u2014 and a desire to create problems in November for Democratic candidates who have refused to embrace his policies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhatever Mr. Trump\u2019s motivation, the president floated the idea after days of public stewing about the potential for the group of Honduran migrants to pour into the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have very bad laws for our border, and we are going to be doing some things \u2014 I\u2019ve been speaking with General Mattis \u2014 we\u2019re going to be doing things militarily,\u201d Mr. Trump said Tuesday morning, seated beside the defense secretary at the meeting with Baltic presidents. \u201cUntil we can have a wall and proper security, we\u2019re going to be guarding our border with the military.

After he warned Russia what it would be up against in Syria, Mr. Trump lamented that relations between the two countries were worse than during the Cold War, a decades-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union when both were armed for, and prepared for, nuclear war.\n\nRussia has blamed the suspected chemical attacks on the Syrian opposition forces. On Wednesday, Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said that if the American missiles were so smart then they should hit \u201cterrorists\u201d and not government targets. She also suggested in a posting on Facebook that the missile attack might destroy evidence of the use of chemical weapons.\n\nMr. Trump has been critical of Russia and its president, Vladimir V.

It said about 70 people had died while taking shelter in basements and 43 of them had signs of being exposed to \u201chighly toxic chemicals.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments about poor relations with Russia echoed what the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said recently in response to the wave of diplomatic expulsions of Russians from the United States and other countries, according to a Reuters report. The expulsions were a coordinated response to the poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter. Since then, analysts have said the Balkans could become a battleground for a new Cold War.\n\nThe tough talk on Russia, when it comes to Syria, is a strikingly different tone for Mr. Trump, who has long pushed for improved relations with the Kremlin. Recently, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Putin for his re-election and even invited him to the White House.\n\nLater on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump clarified his assessment of the poor relations with Russia in another tweet, blaming the decline in Washington-Moscow ties on the ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nRussia has been a dominant theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s entire presidency, particularly with the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nThe president repeated his frustrations about the ongoing inquiry, which he said was led by Democrats or others who worked for former President Barack Obama.\n\nEarlier this week, the F.B.I. raided the offices and hotel room of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael D. Cohen, enraging the president, who called it an \u201cattack on our country in a true sense.\u201d Mr. Trump, however, has not used similarly strong language about Russia\u2019s election activities which started as early as 2014.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, was largely intended as a tool to prod China into making the type of economic changes that the United States and others have long wanted. Many economists say the best way to combat a rising China and pressure it to open its market is through multilateral trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which create favorable trading terms for participants.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to set a framework that eventually China would have to accommodate,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T.\n\nFarmers would stand to benefit from new access to markets, especially Japan, if Mr. Trump rejoins the pact. For instance, ranchers in Australia can currently send beef to Japan more cheaply than ranchers in the United States.\n\nMichael Miller, the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates and a farmer in Washington, said rejoining the deal would allow his industry to compete on a level playing field with competitors in Australia and Canada, which both remained in the accord.\n\nBut rejoining it could be a complex task. The remaining countries, like Japan, moved ahead without the United States, and spent months renegotiating a pact before finally agreeing to a sweeping multinational deal this year. Mr. Trump, who has demanded that any such deal benefit the United States, is unlikely to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership without further concessions for what he has criticized as a terrible agreement. That could complicate talks, since Japan maintains that it has already given all the concessions it could, said William A. Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nYoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, on Friday cautioned against any efforts to change the agreement to accommodate Mr. Trump, calling it a \u201cwell-balanced pact\u201d that addressed the needs of the 11 nations that signed the deal.\n\nIt is also unclear how serious Mr. Trump is about rejoining.

Mr. Cohen served for more than a decade as a trusted fixer and, during the campaign, helped tamp down brewing scandals about women who claimed to have carried on affairs with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and their teams were still scrambling on Friday to assess the damage from the raid early Monday morning. They remained unsure what had been taken, an uncertainty that has heightened the unease around Mr. Trump.\n\nAlthough his lawyers had projected confidence in their dealings with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, they were caught flat-footed by the New York raids. The lawyers fear that Mr. Cohen will not be forthcoming with them about what was in his files, leaving them girding for the unknown.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, through their lawyers, argued in federal court on Friday that many of the seized records were protected by attorney-client privilege. They asked for an order temporarily prohibiting prosecutors from reading the documents until the matter could be litigated. Mr. Cohen argued that he or an independent lawyer should be allowed to review the documents first.\n\n\u201cThose searches have been executed, and the evidence is locked down,\u201d Joanna C. Hendon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said in court. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to delay.

Mr. Cohen frequently taped conversations with adversaries and opposing lawyers, according to the two people briefed.\n\nThe raids on Mr. Cohen surprised and angered the president, who has been frustrated with the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, the Kremlin\u2019s possible coordination with Trump associates and whether the president has tried to obstruct those inquiries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Get the latest on the special counsel investigation \u2014 and other major news \u2014 delivered to your email inbox.

On Friday, Mr. Trump\u2019s spirits were frayed in the morning as his lawyer battled in the Manhattan courtroom. But he grew cheerier as the day went on, an adviser said, buoyed by a report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that was damning about a former F.B.I. official, Andrew G. McCabe, who he believed had tried to undermine him.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers have called the raids of his offices and hotel room an overreach of the law. Prosecutors said on Friday that they had used a search warrant, rather than a subpoena, because they had evidence that Mr. Cohen\u2019s files might be permanently deleted \u2014 by whom, the documents did not say. Many details in the documents were redacted, but prosecutors said they had found evidence of fraud and a \u201clack of truthfulness\u201d on his part.\n\nMr. Cohen wants his lawyers to be able to review the files and withhold privileged material before prosecutors can see them. As an alternative, he asked that an independent lawyer be allowed to review the files first. A judge scheduled a follow-up hearing for Monday and ordered Mr. Cohen to attend. The judge, Kimba M. Wood, was upset that he was not in court Friday.\n\nFederal agents seized documents that dated back years, some of which are related to payments to two women who have said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.

American Media Inc., which owns The Enquirer, paid Ms. McDougal $150,000. The company\u2019s chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\nAgents also demanded information related to Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress.

Mike Pence sat stone-faced on one side of him, John Bolton without much expression on the other.

Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations.

Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.\n\nOver that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well.

Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.\n\nThe timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.\n\nIn January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.\n\nWhen Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.\n\nNow Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.\n\n____________________________\n\nPhoto\n\nWhy Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum\n\nAs Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company.

Among the issues Mr. Trump cited was a dispute Mr. Mueller had with Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington-area golf course years earlier. Mr. Trump told Mr. McGahn to tell Rod J.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOver the next couple of days, Mr. Trump pestered Mr. McGahn about the firing, but Mr. McGahn would not tell Mr. Rosenstein. The badgering by the president got so bad that Mr. McGahn wrote a resignation letter and was prepared to quit. It was only after Mr. McGahn made it known to senior White House officials that he was going to resign that Mr. Trump backed down.\n\nThe articles that provoked Mr. Trump\u2019s anger in December \u2014 which were published by Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters \u2014 said one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s subpoenas had targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s and his family\u2019s banking records at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who have studied Mr. Trump\u2019s bank accounts, did not believe the articles were accurate because Mr. Trump did not have his money there.\n\nThe lawyers were also able to learn that federal prosecutors in a different inquiry had issued a subpoena for entities connected to the family business of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The news outlets later clarified the articles, saying that the subpoena to Deutsche Bank pertained to people affiliated with Mr. Trump, who was satisfied with the explanation and dropped his push to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nAcutely conscious of the threat Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation poses, Mr. Trump has openly discussed ways to shut it down. Each time, he has been convinced by his lawyers and advisers that taking the step would only exacerbate his problems. In some cases, they have explained to Mr. Trump how anything that causes him to lose support from congressional Republicans could further imperil his presidency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s statements to his advisers have been significant enough to attract attention from Mr. Mueller himself. Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have interviewed current and former White House officials and have requested documents to understand whether these efforts show evidence the president is trying to obstruct the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s frustrations have tended to flare up in response to developments in the news, especially accounts of appearances of witnesses, whom Mr. Trump feels were unfairly and aggressively approached by investigators. They include his former communications director, Hope Hicks, and his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.\n\nThe venting has usually been dismissed by his advisers, many of whom insist they have come to see the statements less as direct orders than as simply how the president talks, and that he often does not follow up on his outbursts.\n\nOne former adviser said that people had become conditioned to wait until Mr. Trump had raised an issue at least three times before acting on it.

In that strike, the United States military dropped 59 Tomahawk missiles on the Al Shayrat airfield, where the chemical weapons attack had originated.\n\nMr. Trump may be considering such a strike even as he has expressed his desire in recent days to pull American troops out of Syria, where they are seeking to eliminate the last vestiges of the Islamic State. White House officials said Mr. Trump would have a meeting and dinner on Monday at the White House with senior military leaders.\n\nNikki R.

A White House official said he could provide no guidance beyond what the president had said on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut some Republicans urged Mr. Trump to act, saying his talk of pulling United States troops out of Syria had telegraphed to Mr. Assad that he would pay no price for brutalizing his own people.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump last week signaled to the world that the United States would prematurely withdraw from Syria,\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, adding that Mr. Assad had been \u201cemboldened by American inaction\u201d to launch the attack in Douma.\n\n\u201cThe president responded decisively when Assad used chemical weapons last year,\u201d Mr. McCain went on. \u201cHe should do so again, and demonstrate that Assad will pay a price for his war crimes.\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Mr. Trump should make good on what the president appeared to be threatening.\n\nIf the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t follow through and live up to that tweet, he\u2019s going to look weak in the eyes of Russia and Iran,\u201d Mr. Graham said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThis is a defining moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to follow through with that tweet,\u201d he added. \u201cShow a resolve that Obama never did to get this right.\u201d\n\nIn his tweets, Mr. Trump also criticized former President Barack Obama for failing to take military action against Mr. Assad\u2019s government when it used chemical weapons in 2013. Mr. Obama had threatened that any use of unconventional weapons would cross a \u201cred line\u201d for the United States.\n\nAt the time, though, Mr. Trump argued fiercely against American intervention in Syria.

Indeed, building walls and stemming the tide of such change seems to be at the heart of Trump\u2019s appeals to a remembered national past, and in this case, of his childhood.\n\nSampson cited the\n\nstrong link research has found between perceptions of disorder and the presence of immigrants and minorities \u2014 independent of actual disorder and crime \u2014 provides another clue, one that applies to neighborhoods and arguably up to the level of societies.\n\nJennifer Richeson, a psychologist at Yale, emailed me about her perception that \u201cshifting demographics of one\u2019s town can certainly engender more negative intergroup attitudes and perception.\u201d\n\nIn a forthcoming paper summarizing research on the effect of growing diversity on white attitudes, \u201cThe Pitfalls and Promise of Increasing Racial Diversity,\u201d Richeson, Maureen A.

His administration is in many respects an attempt to restore the Queens of his early childhood.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, a friend of the president\u2019s who served 10 days as the White House communications director, grasped Trump\u2019s outer borough appeal to many voters.

According to its most recent annual report, Ex-Im authorized just $3.4 billion of mostly short-term export credit in 2017. That is down from the $20 billion that it authorized in 2014, the last year that the bank was fully operational. The report points out that China provided $34 billion in medium- and long-term financing for its exports in 2016, underscoring the competitive disadvantage that the United States faces.\n\nThe bank\u2019s crippling has been costly for both companies and their workers, including Boeing, which Mr. Trump has hailed as an emblem of American innovation. In the last two years, two deals involving the sale of its commercial satellites have been canceled and one was significantly delayed given the lack of a quorum at Ex-Im. The stalling of these deals alone has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cRestoring the Export-Import Bank to full strength is the single best thing Washington can do right now to build on the economic momentum of tax reform, shrink our trade deficits and level the playing field so American workers can win,\u201d said Tim Keating, Boeing\u2019s executive vice president for government operations.\n\nIn 2015, General Electric said that it would stop manufacturing certain gas engines in Waukesha, Wis., and that it would instead build a $265 million plant in Canada, which was offering financial support through its version of Ex-Im, known as Export Development Canada.

Unlike the Islamic State in various parts of the Middle East, the Taliban in Afghanistan or the Shabab in Somalia, the Syrian government has extensive air defense and missile systems capable of shooting down foreign planes.\n\nSending bombers and fighter jets, with American or French pilots, to strike Syrian airfields or other facilities is considered risky because it could deepen the conflict if a pilot was shot down. That is why the Pentagon is looking at the same sort of retaliation used last year when two Navy destroyers unleashed a fusillade of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Al Shayrat airfield that was believed to have been used to launch chemical attacks.\n\nBut less than 24 hours after that strike, Syrian warplanes were again taking off from the damaged airfield, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. Beyond Al Shayrat base, Syria still had numerous others from which it could launch flights. While Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers argued last year that the strike affected Mr. Assad\u2019s calculations, in the end its limited nature ultimately did not thwart the Syrian government\u2019s ability to launch chemical attacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tension between the desire to do something bigger than last time and the president\u2019s clear desire not to stay engaged in sustained operations,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le A.

That\u2019s just not fair.\u201d\n\nStill, those in the rapper\u2019s orbit expressed concern for his well-being because Mr. West\u2019s online interaction with the president came as he acknowledged that he had fired his manager, Scooter Braun, and his lawyers, writing on Twitter: \u201cI no longer have a manager. I can\u2019t be managed.\u201d\n\nMr. West had been working since 2016 with Mr. Braun, the powerful music industry figure behind Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande. Though he is no longer on Mr. West\u2019s team, Mr. West kept the door open for him to return: \u201cI\u2019d like Scooter Braun to be a part of this new platform we\u2019re creating,\u201d the rapper tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \u201cScooter is a genius.\u201d\n\nMr. Braun declined to comment.\n\nLast month, Mr. West parted ways with another member of his management team, Izvor Zivkovic, with whom he had worked since 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s \u2018client,\u2019\u201d Mr. West said Wednesday on Twitter, explaining that he had given his associates the option to work only with him full time or be let go. Responding to reports that called his behavior erratic, Mr. West added, \u201cPlease never use the word erratic to describe a person who is economically and psychologically empowered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHoward E. King, a lawyer who has represented Mr. West in business and litigation over the past two years, said, \u201cHe notified us over the weekend that he appreciated everything we had done for him and he was taking all of his legal work in-house.\u201d Mr. King added that his firm would continue to assist Mr. West \u201cin any way that he wanted us to help.\u201d\n\nMr. West\u2019s recent flurry of activity followed more than a year of public silence since an episode in November 2016, when he was hospitalized. Just prior, while on a tour that would soon be canceled, the rapper had begun expressing an affinity for Mr. Trump, and when he resurfaced the next month, it was to meet with the new president-elect.\n\nUpon his return this month to Twitter, Mr. West announced that he planned to release two albums in June, in addition to at least three more upcoming releases he was producing for other artists.\n\nAs the public was reeling from his tweets about the president, Mr. West was practicing free association on other topics, including a request to meet with Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, and his desire to see a \u201ctour with Nikki Minaj and Cardi B,\u201d misspelling the first rapper\u2019s name.\n\nThe president, however, lingered on Mr. West\u2019s praise.\n\n\u201cMAGA!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, proudly retweeting Mr. West\u2019s photograph of the signed hat.", "title": "Trump and Kanye West Share Praise-Filled Tweets.

But the cancellation came as Mr. Trump was also consumed by personal and political drama, and it was the first time a United States president had avoided the summit meeting, which occurs every three years, in its 24-year history.\n\nMr. Pence has increasingly stepped in overseas for a president who appears not to relish international travel. This was his third foreign trip and his sixth country so far this year \u2014 after multicountry swings through the Middle East and Asia \u2014 while the president has made a sole trip outside the United States in 2018, to Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\u201cIt would not be surprising to see Pence taking a larger international role in advocating Trump administration foreign policies on the international stage,\u201d John R. Bolton, now Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, wrote in an op-ed in January. Mr. Bolton said Mr. Pence had proved \u201cadept at navigating the complexities of Middle Eastern politics,\u201d and provided a \u201creassuring contrast\u201d to partisan bickering at home.\n\nIn Lima, armed with a thick binder of briefing materials, Mr. Pence delivered meticulously scripted statements printed on cards that he toted around the summit meeting site and read from faithfully, hitting on his main theme of preserving the region as a \u201chemisphere of freedom,\u201d a phrase he repeated at least three times in his closing remarks. The vice president hailed the military action in Syria and denounced the crisis in Venezuela that has led to a humanitarian catastrophe there, calling upon the assembled nations to support tough measures against the governments of both countries.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s disciplined delivery of the American message after the Syria strikes stood in contrast to the presidential tweet, which recalled an earlier president\u2019s premature declaration of victory in Iraq and prompted a spate of bitter criticism.\n\nWhat the president had meant by his tweet, Mr. Pence explained to reporters traveling with him on Saturday, was that the mission that Mr. Trump had given American forces, \u201cto go in and destroy key elements of the chemical weapons infrastructure in Syria, was completely and professionally and swiftly accomplished.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, the vice president said, he steered clear of talking about funding for the border wall that Mr. Trump has long demanded Mexico pay for. Mr. Pence chalked up the disagreement \u2014 which recently torpedoed plans for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 to two presidents with \u201cstrong personalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have two people with strong personalities, they occasionally have strong differences,\u201d Mr. Pence told reporters. \u201cWe talked through those differences, some of which we set aside for a later date.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, Mr. Pence accentuated the positive: namely, progress in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he said had a chance of being successfully completed within weeks.\n\nAs Mr. Pence taxied for takeoff on Air Force Two on Friday for the trip to Lima, the president appeared to be focused elsewhere. He tapped out a tweet branding James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whose forthcoming memoir paints him as a liar and Mafia-style bully, \u201can untruthful slime ball.\u201d Privately, Mr. Trump continued to seethe over the F.B.I. raid days earlier on his personal lawyer in a wide-ranging corruption investigation that he views as a grave threat.\n\nAt the summit meeting in Peru, Mr. Pence spoke in loftier terms, trying to reassure the other leaders that Mr. Trump meant no slight in failing to show up for their gathering. Mr. Trump, he told President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that he could not make the trip \u2014 which was to have included a stop in Bogot\u00e1 to meet with Mr. Santos \u2014 but, he added, \u201cI can assure you that the relationship with our country has never been stronger.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s attendance at the summit meeting was not without its sharper moments. In his closing speech, the vice president denounced the Cuban government as a \u201cdespotic regime\u201d that had impoverished its people and abused human rights, prompting the country\u2019s foreign minister, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, who sat listening several chairs away, to demand the chance for a rebuttal. As Mr. Rodr\u00edguez was recognized and began to speak, Mr. Pence abruptly stood and strode out of the summit hall.\n\nBut the vice president labored in a way his boss does not to avoid creating controversies. Mr. Pence called elections scheduled for next month in Venezuela a \u201csham\u201d that would not fool the world, but when a reporter asked whether the United States would refuse to recognize the outcome, he deferred to John J. Sullivan, the acting secretary of state, who was traveling with him, to state the official policy, so as not to risk diverging even slightly from it.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s presence as a stand-in for Mr. Trump may have undercut the United States\u2019 goals at the summit meeting, taking some of the sting out of the fact that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela had been disinvited and raising questions about the United States\u2019 commitment to the region.\n\nBut the vice president also defused some of the tension that would have attended an encounter between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Latin American nations who have been insulted and angered by his talk on immigration and other topics, said Richard E. Feinberg, a senior fellow in the Latin America Initiative at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cA lot of leaders probably were preparing two sets of remarks: one if Trump behaves himself, to focus on the issues, and one for if he misbehaves and says something offensive,\u201d Mr. Feinberg said. \u201cWith Trump not being here, they can discard the second set.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "The problem is that, once again, Mr. Trump has an impulse \u2014 in this case, he even has the right one \u2014 but no strategy, an emotion but little insight into reality on the ground. His call to withdraw troops immediately is at odds with warnings from American commanders who believe that it could lead to a resurgence by ISIS, like the rebound of militants in Iraq after Mr. Obama brought troops home from there. This is a familiar pattern for Mr. Trump: He skips past the hard work of commander in chief, seeking a quick political gain while foisting responsibility for difficult military decisions onto the generals. Fortunately, in this case, the generals have persuaded him to sidestep a quick withdrawal in favor of a more studied approach.\n\nThere are roughly 2,000 American troops fighting ISIS in Syria today. In January, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared they could expect to remain there indefinitely. Mr. Tillerson also said that the military mission would be \u201cconditions-based,\u201d meaning without either an end date or benchmarks for success. General Votel had a similar message on Tuesday, describing the military\u2019s future role as stabilizing and consolidating gains while \u201caddressing long-term issues of reconstruction,\u201d including training local forces to keep ISIS from regaining a foothold.\n\nDespite his isolationist tendencies, the president seemed to support that approach. Since taking office, he has tripled troop levels in Syria, just as he has also sent more troops to Afghanistan. In fact, Mr. Trump even faulted Mr. Obama for setting a timetable for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, saying it gave the Taliban the upper hand. Now he has effectively done the same thing by announcing that \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d for the troops to leave Syria.\n\nMr. Trump is irritated that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have not contributed enough resources to the Syria campaign. Fine; as president, he should be able to do something about that, particularly given the close relationship he claims to have with the Saudi royal family. What\u2019s his plan?\n\nThe president just doesn\u2019t seem to get that any American withdrawal requires careful thought to ensure we don\u2019t surrender the gains we\u2019ve made, endanger troops on the ground or alienate our allies. What will happen, for instance, to Syrian Kurds who have been crucial American partners in fighting ISIS and now are under attack by Turkey, which considers the Kurds to be terrorists? Or to Israel, which is increasingly concerned about the foothold that Iran, an Assad ally that Mr. Trump has decried as a major regional threat, has gained in Syria?\n\nBesides Iran, another notable American adversary is likely to benefit from the president\u2019s apparent desire to retreat from the Middle East: Russia. Already, Mr. Trump is letting Russia take the lead in Syria, ceding to Vladimir Putin the crucial diplomatic work of forging a political agreement between Mr. Assad and the Syrian rebels. Mr. Putin, an Assad ally, met Iranian and Turkish leaders in Istanbul on Wednesday to plan Syria\u2019s future.

Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s move is not rooted in the reality of immigration in recent years. The number of people apprehended at the border plummeted from more than 1.6 million in 2000 to 310,000 last year, the lowest level since 1971. The main causes are slowed population growth, improved economic opportunities in Mexico and stronger American border security, the result of investment in thousands of guards, physical barriers and technology.\n\nLike so many of the president\u2019s decisions, the one to put troops on the border seems impulsive, spiteful and politically motivated. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security chief, and other aides reportedly briefed Mr. Trump on the idea last week. Even so, after his unexpected announcement on Tuesday, the White House struggled to explain his intentions, including how many and which troops would be deployed. Officials have since said that he was referring to National Guard troops, not active-duty troops. There was no consultation with the Mexican president, whose ambassador to the United States called the decision unwelcome.\n\nMr. Trump is feeling heat from supporters who believed his pledge to build a wall paid for by Mexico. Not only has Mexico refused to fund this folly, Congress also thwarted him by approving only $1.6 billion for the project in a recent omnibus spending bill, rather than the $25 billion Mr. Trump sought. Despite opposing the wall, Democratic leaders offered to fund it if Mr. Trump backed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA-eligible immigrants. He refused.\n\nOne impediment to using troops on the border could be American law. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act bars the use of the armed forces for civilian law enforcement tasks unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. Since the 1980s, however, the Defense Department, including the National Guard, has provided indirect support to border-related anti-drug and counterterrorism efforts.\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama sent 1,200 National Guard troops to the border to support operations against illicit networks trafficking in people, drugs, illegal weapons and money until stronger border protections and more guards were put in place. In 2006, President George W. Bush responded to requests from the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas in deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to help with engineering, aviation, entry identification and other support. The Pentagon has often been reluctant to engage in such activities, which detract from its core war-fighting mission.

Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s avowed cluelessness implies that Mr. Cohen induced Ms. Daniels to sign the agreement through fraud \u2014 a lie about Mr. Trump\u2019s performance of reciprocal obligations. Both of these circumstances invalidate the hush agreement\u2019s very formation under basic contract law principles.\n\nIn a motion filed on Sunday in federal court in California, Mr. Avenatti seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s asserted ignorance to bolster the argument that the agreement was never formed: \u201cIf Mr. Trump was completely unaware of Mr. Cohen\u2019s actions, the question naturally arises as to how it would be possible for a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 to have occurred between parties where one of the parties does not even know about the existence of the agreement.\u201d The motion goes on to request brief depositions of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen followed by an expedited jury trial.\n\nInconveniently for the president, Ms. Daniels\u2019s position turns on questions of fact. Did Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen ever discuss Ms. Daniels? Was Mr. Trump aware of the obligations he had ostensibly undertaken? Why did Mr. Trump not sign on the signature line? Was he 100 percent ignorant about the agreement? And there are a similar series of crucial factual questions for Mr. Cohen, such as where the $130,000 payment came from.\n\nThe standard course for resolving these sorts of factual disputes is to first permit the parties to take discovery. Mr. Avenatti has asked the court for a two-hour deposition of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen. Normally a request to depose the president would seem like a nuisance move, quickly rebuffed. Here, though, it is hard to see how the court resolves the factual issue without hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s version of events.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s One-Night Stand Turns Into a Legal Nightmare", "authors": []}

Some House Republicans pushed for a budget resolution that would have allowed them to pursue \u2014 on a party-line basis \u2014 significant cuts to the social safety net. Disagreements among House Republicans led them to scale back the initial plan, and eventually they abandoned it altogether for a tax-cuts-focused approach advocated by their Senate colleagues.\n\nThis year, it appears Republicans will forgo their chance at using the fast-track reconciliation process to make cuts to welfare and other entitlement programs before the midterms, despite calls from some party members to take up such a proposal. Doing so would require getting both an initial budget blueprint and a substantive bill through a Senate where Republicans hold just 51 seats; the prospects of success would likely be slim. The filibuster isn\u2019t making that task hard; a narrow Senate majority and the pressures of an election year are.\n\nIntraparty divisions aside, suppose the Senate were to eliminate the filibuster. Key differences in the electoral environments faced by legislators in the two chambers mean the Senate would not simply turn into the House. Senators serve longer terms and represent larger, often more diverse populations than House members, meaning their electoral incentives on a given piece of legislation are distinctive.\n\nTake, for example, the debate over the state and local tax deduction in Republicans\u2019 tax bill. Reaching a compromise on the exact nature of a change to that piece of the tax code was key to getting the bill through the House. Republicans from states like New York and New Jersey who represent concentrated blocs of constituents who benefit from the deduction \u2014 all of whom would have to run for re-election less than a year after the bill\u2019s passage \u2014 forced the issue high on Congress\u2019s agenda. In the Senate, on the other hand, the topic, though not absent from the debate entirely, was not given as much attention. Unlike the demands on some of their House colleagues, there are simply fewer Republican senators \u2014 especially from blue states \u2014 whose statewide re-election efforts depend on support from voters for whom that issue was salient.\n\nEven on areas where vote totals suggest that a Democratic filibuster has killed a Republican policy priority in this Congress, it is difficult to know if members would have behaved exactly the same way if the threshold for passage was lower.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Problem Isn\u2019t the Filibuster.

His preoccupation with the ongoing Russia investigation adds to the unpredictability, spurring Mr. Trump to fume aloud in ways that divide the G.O.P. and raising the prospect of legal confrontations amid the campaign. And despite projecting confidence, he polls nearly all those who enter the Oval Office about how they view the climate of the midterms.\n\nAccording to advisers, the president plans to hold a fund-raiser a week in the months to come and hopes to schedule regular rallies with candidates starting this summer.

At the White House dinner, Mr. McConnell raised one such policy and expressed hope that Mr. Trump could resolve the matter of his proposed tariffs, which have instilled deep worry among farm-state Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf we can get trade resolved that would be exceptionally important,\u201d Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said when asked in an interview how the president could help in the midterms.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers have begun pleading with the president to be disciplined and hold up the growing economy and sweeping tax overhaul they passed in December.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always defied political convention, but this is a political convention I think that we should adhere to,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, \u201cwhich is to focus on that which is important to people, which is their wallet.\u201d\n\nWhen House Speaker Paul D.

Ms. Anderson noted that his job approval was markedly weaker than past presidents, including President Barack Obama in the months before Democrats lost 63 House seats in the 2010 elections.\n\nMr. Trump, for his part, has complained to associates about having been deployed to campaign for relatively weak Republicans like Roy S. Moore, who lost last year\u2019s Senate race in Alabama, and Rick Saccone, who lost the special House election in Pennsylvania last month.\n\nHe has taken the losses personally, particularly in Alabama, because the vacancy there was a result of his decision to make Jeff Sessions attorney general, an appointment he has since regretted. Mr. Trump has subsequently blamed others in the party for thrusting him into episodes of humiliating defeat.\n\nThe scars from those races have made Mr. Trump reluctant to weigh in on the race that Senate Republicans most want his imprint on right now: the contest to replace Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who resigned this month.\n\nThe president met this month with Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican appointee there and the favorite of the party establishment. Reflecting his fixation on personal loyalty, Mr. Trump quizzed Ms. Hyde-Smith on whether she had supported another candidate for president in 2016 before endorsing him.

Kelly, the White House chief of staff and a retired Marine general, has scant political acumen.

This bias toward action is one of the biggest problems in American foreign policy. It produces poorly thought-out interventions and, sometimes, disastrous long-term consequences, effects likely to be magnified in the era of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe concept of a bias for action originated in the business world, but psychological studies have shown a broad human tendency toward action over inaction.

Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nThe lack of swift action after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, however, could add to the perception of a White House not in sync. It comes after a week in which the president at first pushed for a rapid withdrawal of American troops from Syria \u2014 only to later acquiesce grudgingly to his generals, who argued that the troops should remain in the country for a few more months to train local forces and stabilize Syrian towns liberated from the Islamic State.\n\nThe president seemed similarly confused last week when he blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the Syrian government\u2019s suspected gas attack in the Damascus suburb.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cthe Syrian disaster would have ended long ago!

Mr. Obama shelved a missile strike against Syria for that, earning widespread criticism from those who said it emboldened both Mr. Assad and the Russians.\n\nIf Mr. Trump\u2019s words on Syria have been tougher than his actions, it is the reverse with China.

They just want to be cruel.\n\nGlenn Thrush of The New York Times reported, \u201cMr. Trump, aides said, refers to nearly every program that provides benefits to poor people as welfare, a term he regards as derogatory.\u201d And I guess you can see where that comes from. After all, he\u2019s a self-made man who can\u2019t attribute any of his own success to, say, inherited wealth. Oh, wait.\n\nSeriously, a lot of people both in this administration and in Congress simply feel no empathy for the poor. Some of that lack of empathy surely reflects racial animus. But while the war on the poor will disproportionately hurt minority groups, it will also hurt a lot of low-income whites \u2014 in fact, it will surely end up hurting a lot of people who voted for Trump.

Surely they must stipulate that relevant experience isn\u2019t a plus, but that a flexible notion of ethics is. They must demand references who can recount specific instances of demonstrated incompetence. How else to explain the sheer number of poorly prepared or careless or sticky-fingered officials crammed into this careening clown-car of an administration?\n\nConsider the Trump appointees who have been in the news lately.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician who on Thursday backed out of his nomination to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care to more than nine million vets and is the largest federal department after the Pentagon, and whose nomination was just withdrawn by the White House.\n\nMore than 20 people who have worked with Dr. Jackson told senators either that he was drunk on the job, handed out sleeping pills, and even opioids, like Skittles, or screamed at his staff. The latest allegation is that he reportedly got drunk and wrecked a government car.\n\nMaybe, maybe, you could have overlooked all that if he had impressive qualifications to run one of the country\u2019s largest and most important health systems \u2014 like management experience. But as best as anyone can tell, Mr. Trump picked Dr. Jackson because he is in the military, looks like a grown-up Doogie Howser and gave the president a glowing bill of health, including saying that the president has great genes and could have lived to 200 if he had had a better diet.\n\nUntil Thursday morning, the White House pressed ahead with Dr. Jackson even as several senior Republican senators did everything they could to signal that it should cut bait.\n\nNo one should have expected the lack of qualifications to matter to Mr. Trump. That wasn\u2019t an obstacle to his decision to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a portfolio that includes negotiating peace in the Middle East, reforming the criminal justice system and making the government more tech-savvy. Mr. Trump also considered appointing his personal pilot to head the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAs for the lobbyist-loving wing of the Trump administration, one of its leading members \u2014 Mick Mulvaney, who heads the Office of Management and Budget and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 was extolling the practice of pay-to-play public service the other day. At a speech before the American Bankers Association on Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney said that as a congressman he would only meet with lobbyists who gave money to his campaign. He also encouraged bankers \u2014 many of whom have given generously to him \u2014 to let their needs be known to lawmakers.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s \u2018Best People\u2019 Are the Worst", "authors": []}

Their lawyer said the apartment near the East River was something of a salon where artists and musicians \u2014 including, in the 1960s, Chagall himself and composer Aaron Copland \u2014 would meet.\n\nThe artworks, which were valued at $750,000 at the time of the theft, would be worth millions in today\u2019s art market.\n\nThe painting was discovered in part because an aging criminal, a terminally ill man who is 72 and who had been involved with Bulgarian organized crime, wanted to make a clean breast of things before he dies, according to Marc Hess of the F.B.I.\u2019s Art Crime Team, the special agent who is investigating the case. The painting had been hidden in the criminal\u2019s attic.\n\n\u201cOne of the things he did say to me is that he was partially motivated by his imminent demise,\u201d Mr. Hess said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe talked about meeting his maker and trying to clear his conscience and make things right before he dies.\u201d\n\nThe complaint sketches the outlines of a tale worthy of a noir novel. It also deepens the mystery of the carefully executed heist, shrouding the identities of two of the players, in part because the Art Crime Team, based in Washington, D.C., is still investigating the theft and trying to find more of the stolen art, according to Mr. Hess, his supervisor and the prosecutor handling the case.\n\nThe document reveals that one of the thieves \u2014 who has a degree in fine arts and is identified only as Person 1 \u2014 had worked in the Hellers\u2019 apartment building. Several people with knowledge of the case said he was the superintendent or the assistant superintendent. A few years after the theft he had been arrested and convicted on federal charges that he committed similar crimes: stealing artworks from other apartment buildings where he worked, according to the document.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the owner said he could not display the painting for sale without paperwork showing ownership or provenance, or a certificate from the Chagall committee, which controls the artist\u2019s estate.\n\nAt that time, the gallery owner recognized the artwork as the same painting that had been brought to him in 1989 by an unidentified man, who also had no provenance or proof of ownership, and with whom the gallery owner also declined to do business.\n\nThen, in January of last year, the 72-year-old man returned to the same gallery and again tried to sell the painting to the gallery owner, and the owner again refused, according to the complaint.\n\nBut this time, the gallery owner suggested that the man with the painting contact law enforcement. He did so, calling the F.B.I., and later that month, he turned the painting over to agents.\n\nThe complaint and the attorney for the Hellers\u2019 estate, Alan Scott, say that the estate intends to sell the painting at auction if it is returned. The estate has agreed to repay the insurance company for the settlement and any related expenses, and donate the remainder of the proceeds to the residuary beneficiaries identified in the Hellers\u2019 will: the MacDowell Colony, an artists\u2019 colony that will receive 80 percent; and Columbia University and NYU Langone Medical Center, which will each receive 10 percent.\n\nMr. Heller, who was in the jewelry business and imported pearls, detailed the provenance of the Chagall in a 1990 oral history prepared by Lincoln Center. He said that he had inherited the painting from his father, Samuel Heller, who had purchased it directly from Chagall in Paris for $50 in 1913.", "title": "Twisted Tale of Stolen Chagall Nears Ending", "authors": ["William K.

Yes, it was a party, but the party could be more of a masked ball, menacing and sinister. Yes, you could afford to live here, but that was because the city was broke, and dangerous, and crime-ridden, and profoundly unjust. And for every joyful night, for every drunken frenzy, there was also the plague, first significantly reported in The New York Times on July 3, 1981, but left unnamed for a year after its appearance. By the end of 1983, it had gobbled 857 lives in New York alone. The people AIDS claimed were, initially, largely gay men, and to look back on the inhumanity and indifference with which this community was treated is to reveal a particularly shameful part of this country\u2019s recent history.\n\nImage A self-portrait by Peter Hujar, 1983.

In 1981, there was a president who had embraced the religious far right (and who refused to even utter the word \u201cAIDS\u201d until 1985). There was a widening chasm between the very rich and the very poor. To be an artist was to be in opposition to the state, and art is always at its most thrilling when it is in disagreement with something, when the people who are making it feel that they are creating work not merely as an intellectual exercise, but in defense of the right to expression itself. This sense of urgency is also what made those years so enduringly vivid, and it is what makes them so relevant now, with so many peoples \u2014 women, Muslims, the transgender community, to name a few \u2014 who are fighting to be recognized as full citizens.\n\nThe New York City of 2018 is and isn\u2019t the one of nearly four decades ago. But as much as we may bemoan its transformations \u2014 the galleries replaced by boutiques, the lofts occupied by billionaires \u2014 the promise of New York continues to draw hopefuls, year after year. Cities change. They must. We may mourn what they were, or what they become. But in our city, we can find solace in the fact that many of the people who inspired us to come here in the first place are, in fact, still here, still making art. They are survivors: of a plague, of a government, of a decade. We also honor the ones no longer with us, the people whose deaths deprived of us of not just their company, but also of the hundreds, the thousands, of potential masterpieces they might have produced. We share the city with all of them. Our New York was, and still is, theirs as well.\n\nImage Peter Hujar, \"Contact Sheet Frame: Stephen Koch 5/11/83,\" 1983.

The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\n\nIn the longer run, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.\n\nThe Winter\u2019s Tale\n\nExpectations about the first-quarter figure had fluctuated as pieces of the puzzle emerged. Imports fell and exports rose more than expected, narrowing the merchandise trade deficit for the first time in six months. Orders of durable goods remained sluggish, but revived somewhat as commercial aircraft orders surged in March.

Businesses responded by replenishing depleted inventories. But the shopping surge receded when the new year started; consumer spending grew only 1.1 percent in the first quarter.\n\nAlthough the tax overhaul promised to increase take-home pay, its effects may have been blunted for several reasons, including the time it took for the Internal Revenue Service to produce updated withholding tables and for payroll managers to adjust their systems.

Nonetheless, she added, \u201cI think there is a legitimate question as to how much of the tax cuts get saved to pull down debt, and how much actually gets spent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for business spending, many of the tax incentives were aimed not at immediate investment decisions, but at those in the medium term. \u201cIt does take time for that to filter through,\u201d Ms. Bostjancic said. Some businesses may have also sped up their timetables for purchases at the end of 2017 in order to take advantage of bigger deductions before the tax changes went into effect.\n\nFor several years, first-quarter growth rates have been weaker than the longer-term trends indicated, only to rebound in later months. This year, the result could reflect a falloff in spending after an unusual surge that followed the havoc wrought by late-summer hurricanes. Severe winter weather could have also slowed consumption. But some analysts wonder if data adjustments are part of the problem.\n\nGovernment economists try to account for seasonal changes, but the corrective measures may be only partially successful. \u201cThere\u2019s a little weakness in Q1 and then the other quarters are artificially inflated because of that,\u201d Ms. Bostjancic said.\n\nPhoto\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIn any case, the gross domestic product estimate released Friday by the Commerce Department is not the final word on the first quarter. The estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months. In the past, the final number has been higher or lower by as much as a percentage point.\n\nThis G.D.P. report, though, is the latest that the Federal Reserve will have when its policymakers meet next week. At last month\u2019s meeting, Fed officials raised interest rates and affirmed that they expected two more increases this year. Their concern is that a tight labor market will push up inflation as employers increase wages to compete for workers.\n\nThe number of workers applying for jobless benefits last week fell to its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Salary and benefit costs to employers also increased, according to new figures released Friday.\n\nFor most Americans, who have seen little income growth in recent decades, though, fears of steeper inflation seem overblown. That is why some economists warn against raising rates too much and too fast, arguing that the increases will choke off the recovery.\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the March meeting, Jerome H.

Employers have added an average of just over 200,000 jobs per month so far in 2018, a pace that has held relatively steady for the past two years. The unemployment rate hasn\u2019t budged since October, but remains at its lowest level since 2000.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals still remain solid,\u201d said Dan North, chief economist for Euler Hermes North America.\n\nThe slowdown in March wasn\u2019t a surprise. February\u2019s job growth was probably inflated by a surge in hiring in construction and the retail sector that reflected unseasonably warm weather in much of the country. Both sectors slumped in March as winter storms blew through the eastern United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had such unsustainably strong results in January and February that it was largely expected that we were due for some payback,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley. \u201cThe weak number in headline payrolls does not change the fact that trend job growth is strong.\u201d\n\nWaiting on Wages\n\nThe one dull spot in February\u2019s report was wage growth, which slowed from January. That figure was revised up slightly on Friday, and earnings rebounded further in March, rising 2.7 percent from a year earlier. Economists caution against reading too much into the month-to-month data on wages, which is volatile and prone to distortions.\n\nThe bigger picture is that wage growth remains weaker than most economists would expect when unemployment is so low. Economists have proposed a long list of possible explanations, from globalization to weak productivity growth. Most still expect employers to have to raise pay eventually to attract and retain workers. But so far, employers are resisting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a standoff, almost, on wages,\u201d said Jason Guggisberg, a vice president at the staffing firm Adecco. \u201cWho\u2019s going to go first?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Manufacturing Picture\n\nPhoto\n\nThe manufacturing sector has posted solid job gains over the past year, and that growth continued in March, when American factories added 22,000 jobs.

Markets tumbled after a report of unexpectedly strong wage growth in January led to fears of inflation, and the interest-rate hikes it could bring.\n\nThe market reaction to Friday\u2019s report was more muted. The uptick in wages was sufficient to suggest that the job market remains healthy, but probably not big enough to force the Federal Reserve to reconsider its policy of gradual rate increases, said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America.\n\nIndeed, in a speech in Chicago on Friday, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, suggested his view of the economy had changed little in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThe labor market remains strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong,\u201d Mr. Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to prepared remarks released by the central bank. He added that he would be \u201clooking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell\u2019s prepared remarks made no mention of the looming threat of a trade war with China. But Ms. Meyer said the added uncertainty surrounding trade could tend to make policymakers more cautious.\n\n\u201cThe risks have increased given some of the headlines around trade,\u201d Ms. Meyer said.\n\nSeeking Workers\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise in the blockbuster report for February was the surge of workers into the labor force. That flood of new workers partly reversed in March, when the labor force shrank by 158,000 people. Beyond such monthly gyrations, however, the labor force has been growing gradually, an impressive feat given the ongoing retirement of the baby-boom generation.\n\nWith available workers increasingly scarce, companies are going to greater lengths to find potential employees. Some are hiring people with criminal records or loosening hiring requirements. Others are trying to entice people previously on the economy\u2019s sidelines, like at-home parents and recent retirees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had more conversations about retirees in the last month than I have in the last year,\u201d said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm. \u201cThat\u2019s an ideal population because they\u2019re still highly skilled and they\u2019re experienced.\u201d", "title": "U.S. Job Growth Eased in March; Unemployment Steady at 4.1%", "authors": ["Ben Casselman"]}

But that could be difficult to quantify because of the country\u2019s opaque political system and the state\u2019s control of information.\n\nChina could back off from rules that favor local competitors and require American companies to share technology if they want access to the Chinese market. For example, foreign automakers face pressure to transfer electric-car technology to their local partners, and foreign technology companies are increasingly required to submit to security reviews. Foreign businesses have long complained that many of the rules they must follow are unwritten.\n\nChina\u2019s government-financed campaign is already paying off in some ways. Drive into downtown Shanghai from Pudong International Airport and you pass a seemingly endless series of huge hangars and vast, glass-walled design centers, all part of the country\u2019s effort to create a commercial aircraft manufacturing giant to rival Boeing or Airbus. Travel to factory districts in Shanghai and on the outskirts of many other Chinese cities and you see enormous, newly built factories ready to churn out electric cars, the batteries they use and other components.\n\nProving that the Chinese government unfairly supports the effort could be difficult, however.\n\nThe United States could press its argument with the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trading rules and prohibits big loans from government-controlled banks at artificially low interest rates. But the W.T.O. requires many contracts and government documents to prove cases, evidence that can be hard to get in a tightly controlled country like China.\n\nEven when the W.T.O. rules against China, persuading the country to comply can be challenging. One such ruling, involving China\u2019s restrictions on foreign electronic payment systems, was issued nearly six years ago. China is still mulling how it will comply \u2014 despite numerous complaints from the Obama administration and more recent nudges from the Trump administration.\n\nSo the United States has turned to tariffs.

China, by contrast, is an increasingly assertive global rival, sending naval vessels to the Baltic Sea and building a naval base in East Africa.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In response to American tariffs, Beijing could simply shift business from American companies like Boeing and Ford to European rivals like Airbus and Daimler.\n\nChinese officials dispute the American accusations about their unfair trade practices. They say Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs violate W.T.O. rules, and they dispute claims that China forces American companies to hand over technology. As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials say the plan is only guidance, not a government directive \u2014 and that foreign companies are free to participate, too.\n\nIn China\u2019s current industrial policy, the Trump administration sees an extension of how the country has already come to dominate one major industry of the future: solar power.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump himself is no fan of solar panels. He has spoken enthusiastically about coal, not renewable energy, throughout his campaign and his presidency. But the solar power industry is one of the biggest success stories so far in China\u2019s efforts involving advanced industries.\n\nThe United States played a central role in developing solar panels and manufacturing them until a decade ago. Around then, the Chinese government decided to finance a lavish expansion of the sector. State-controlled banks lent tens of billions of dollars at low interest rates despite the high-profile bankruptcies of solar manufacturers.\n\nChinese firms now produce three-quarters of the world\u2019s solar panels. Most American and European companies have closed factories, and many have become insolvent. China\u2019s success in producing solar panels has given Beijing a blueprint for seizing the lead in a long list of other high-tech industries.\n\nMany foreign companies are caught between China\u2019s industrial ambitions and Washington\u2019s efforts to stop them, including major aerospace companies and carmakers. The conflict may spread: Made in China 2025 could create major competitors to General Electric and Intel, and to companies outside the United States like Siemens and Samsung.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTariffs could hurt such companies if the United States and China follow through on their plans. They also risk losing their competitiveness if Beijing succeeds in subsidizing the creation of large Chinese rivals in their industries.\n\nBoeing, for example, could be hit by American tariffs on civilian aircraft parts it buys from Avic, a state-controlled Chinese military and aviation company \u2014 required purchases if the company, which is based in Chicago, wants to sell planes in China. China, in turn, is pushing a consortium that includes Avic to become a Boeing rival. Boeing, like other multinational companies, has refrained from endorsing or criticizing the tariffs.\n\n\u201cAlthough our members are unhappy with retaliatory tariffs being used,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, \u201cthere is a belief that greater pressure has to be brought to bear on China.\u201d", "title": "U.S. and China Play Chicken on Trade, and Neither Swerves", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"]}

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "In short, adjustments, yes, wholesale revisions, no. There are several reasons for this caution. One has to do with preserving the industry\u2019s reputation and satisfying what amounts to its historical obligation. The Obama administration rules were plenty tough, calling for a doubling in fuel economy for new cars and light trucks, to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025, equivalent to a real-world average of 36 m.p.g. But the automakers signed on, not least because multibillion-dollar bailouts by the Bush and Obama administrations kept them afloat, for which they still owe the American taxpayer a very big thank-you. Backsliding now on public health and the environment would not do the automakers a lot of good.\n\nA second reason is California. Because of its uniquely severe smog problems, and because its clean air rules predate federal rules, California has been allowed under the Clean Air Act to set its own, and traditionally tougher, air pollution standards, as long as it is granted a waiver by the federal government to do so. This in effect has confronted the automobile industry with the need to manufacture two versions of its cars \u2014 one for California and the dozen states that have adopted California\u2019s standards, and another for the rest of the country.\n\nPart of the genius of the Obama program was that it harmonized California\u2019s rules and the federal rules. But if the Trump administration tries to undermine this deal, California has said that it will once again go its own way, fracturing the American car and light truck market. Automakers don\u2019t need that headache and expense.\n\nThere\u2019s always a chance that a determined Mr. Pruitt, who deeply resents California\u2019s aggressiveness on this and other clean air issues, could try to revoke California\u2019s waiver and force the state to toe the federal line \u2014 something he signaled in a statement on Monday. That would inspire a legal donnybrook that Mr. Pruitt has no guarantee of winning and would make his efforts look even more feckless and destructive. California is \u201cprepared to take any and all legal action\u201d to protect its air emissions standards, Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, said last week.\n\nFinally, there is scant evidence that the automakers want to slow the steady march toward cleaner cars. Mary Barra, General Motors\u2019 chief executive, has expressed support for the current nationwide standards, which can only improve Detroit\u2019s competitiveness in an increasingly climate-conscious global market. Though sales of electric vehicles represent barely 1 percent of global car sales, China has a new zero-emission-vehicle mandate, which requires that 12 percent of new cars have no tailpipe emissions. France and Britain have pledged to end the sale of diesel and gas cars by 2040.", "title": "Opinion | Unclean at Any Speed: Pruitt\u2019s Attack on Obama Auto Pollution Rule", "authors": []}

Forty or fifty years ago, such people did exist. But now they don\u2019t.\n\nTo understand why, let me talk about what I know: the field of economics. This happens to be a field with a relatively strong conservative presence compared to other social sciences, and as far as I can tell even contains considerably more self-identified conservatives/Republicans than hard science. Even so, trying to find influential conservative economic intellectuals is basically a hopeless task, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, while there are many conservative economists with appointments at top universities, publications in top journals, and so on, they have no influence on conservative policymaking. What the right wants are charlatans and cranks, in (conservative) Greg Mankiw\u2019s famous phrase. If they use actual economists, they use them the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.", "title": "Opinion | Unicorns of the Intellectual Right", "authors": []}

This art was a little bit out of the market. That\u2019s why the provenances are quite special.\u201d\n\nMr. Zarug, in his interview, also spoke of how challenging it was to find art from the period with extensive exhibition or ownership histories.\n\nInitially a dealer who focused on Judaica, antique books and manuscripts, Mr. Zarug said he began hunting for things to buy in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall. \u201cThe U.S.S.R. in 1990 was like the Wild West,\u201d he said. Mr. Zarug said his diversification into Russian avant-garde art happened by chance.

But the song was more deeply about a famed Manhattan boundary, one insurmountable at the time: \u201cUptown\u201d was shorthand for the well-lit East Side corridor where nouvelle society, powered by the Wall Street boom, resided in splendor. \u201cDowntown\u201d was the shadowy province beneath 14th Street \u2014 a countercultural warren of tenement walk-ups and industrial loft spaces.\n\nSuch a duality seems quaint now that artists are being priced out of Ridgewood, Queens, and billionaires range freely in aeries from Central Park South to Little West 12th Street, but in the early \u201980s, where you lived was an inarguable announcement of your politics, your values and your status. To say you lived uptown, even if you rented in a white brick 1960s building on upper Second Avenue, was to suggest where you longed to be: in a duplex at 740 Park Avenue like the one designed by Mark Hampton for the corporate raider Saul Steinberg and his third wife, Gayfryd, the couple who defined the era\u2019s excess. The burnt-umber brocade walls of their 34-room apartment, with its George II gilt-wood chairs and antique ormolu tables, were hung with Old Masters; on the marble mantel sat a harp that neither inhabitant knew how to play.\n\nTo declare yourself \u201cdowntown\u201d meant that as you lay on your futon next to the bathtub in a sublet studio on St. Marks Place, you imagined yourself an artist in a cavernous former factory in the no man\u2019s land that people had recently christened TriBeCa, living inside a loft with whitewashed walls, built-in platforms covered with gray industrial carpet, curved glass-brick partitions and steel tables by the designer Joe D\u2019Urso. Not everything was monochrome in the land of lofts, of course: For a jolt of color and madness, there were paintings by Neo-Expressionists, including David Salle, Eric Fischl and Julian Schnabel. The design world was also enraptured by Memphis, the Milan-based collective started by Ettore Sottsass in 1981. Few New Yorkers actually accessorized their homes with those Tinkertoy shapes in Crayola-color lacquer, but Memphis had an outsize influence; omnipresent in home design magazines, it was a playful reminder not to take Minimalism too seriously.\n\nAnd while the uptown aesthetic of these years may now seem anachronistic \u2014 cluttered with Louis XV canopy beds and gold-leaf mirrors \u2014 it was, in fact, its own revolution. Decorators like Hampton \u2014 and like Angelo Donghia, who outfitted apartments for Diana Ross and Ralph Lauren before dying of an AIDS-related illness in 1985 \u2014 transformed grand Fifth Avenue domiciles once bedecked with uncomfortable, inherited cane-backed settees into cushy sanctuaries adorned with the pattern-mad chintz of English country manors. Hampton developed formal window treatments \u2014 elaborately layered swags and jabots \u2014 for the homes of Est\u00e9e Lauder and others, while Donghia brought in enormous palms and poufs upholstered in men\u2019s flannel suiting fabrics.

And although the speech he smothered behind his dancing hand was now doubly unintelligible to the class, his complete surrender to his own merriment would prove irresistible. By the time he was helpless with it he would have his students in stitches, with abrupt barks of clockwork hilarity coming from Charles and a dazzling flow of unsuspected lovely laughter transfiguring Josephine, who was not pretty, while Eileen, who was, dissolved in a jelly of unbecoming giggles.\u201d\n\nWhat did you think?", "title": "Variety: Acrostic", "authors": ["Caitlin Lovinger"]}

But he said that \u201cMexico has got to help us at the border, and a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA.\u201d\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, gave protected status to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The program requires immigrants to have resided in the United States since 2007, meaning any crossing the border now would not be eligible.\n\nMr. Trump announced last year that he was ending the program, but courts have blocked his decision. He has said he is open to negotiating with Democrats on it, but has repeatedly backed away from potential deals that he argues do not include immigration changes that are tough enough.\n\nOutside the church on Sunday, the president said the Democrats \u201cblew it\u201d after having \u201chad a great chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll have to take a look,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral Democrats challenged the idea that they were at fault for a breakdown in negotiations.\n\n\u201c\u2018NO MORE DACA DEAL\u2019?!!\u201d Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou were never doing a DACA deal. Your actions gave you away: cancelling DACA with no plan, making racist comments about Black/Brown immigrants, ejecting several by bipartisan deals. You didn\u2019t fool anybody.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Dwight Evans, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said on Twitter that DACA recipients were \u201cstudents, military service members, teachers, scientists, doctors, and lawyers \u2014 they are integral members of our community.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Evans said the president\u2019s comments were \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks also drew a rebuke from a high-profile member of his own party. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio wrote on Twitter: \u201cA true leader preserves & offers hope, doesn\u2019t take hope from innocent children who call America home.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump directed an equal measure of anger at Mexico, saying the country was \u201cdoing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S.\u201d He said Mexican leaders \u201cmust stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The United States, Mexico and Canada are locked in difficult negotiations over a revamping of the trade pact.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweets seemed at odds with some unifying steps taken last week by members of his administration: The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico to discuss ways to work together on security and trade issues, according to a description of the conversation released by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut Mr. Trump may have been hearing a harder-line administration voice over the weekend. He was accompanied to his Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, by Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has shaped much of the administration\u2019s tough stance on immigration.\n\nThe president, in his tweets, criticized what he called \u201cCatch & Release,\u201d a practice in which detained undocumented immigrants are sometimes released as they wait for a hearing before an immigration judge. In some cases, they are released because the government has nowhere to house them.\n\nCritics say the practice \u2014 which, contrary to the president\u2019s tweet, is not enshrined in law \u2014 gives the immigrants an opening to skip their hearing and settle undetected in the country. The Trump administration has declared an end to the practice, though it may take a while before significant changes are carried out.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweets on Sunday echoed remarks on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d by Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, whom the president has praised in the past.\n\n\u201cOur legislators actually have to stand up, and the Republicans control the House and the Senate, they do not need the Democrat support to pass any laws they want,\u201d Mr. Judd said on the program. \u201cThey can go the nuclear option, just like what they did on the confirmation. They need to pass laws to end the catch-and-release program that\u2019ll allow us to hold them for a long time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Judd also said that the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy was helping to lure the caravan of Central Americans to the United States.\n\nA representative for a group called Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which organized the caravan, said that it would take four to six weeks before it reached the United States-Mexico border, and that the number of participants would be significantly smaller by then.\n\nMost people are likely to drop out of the caravan in Mexico, rather than journey all the way to the border, the representative said, because they know they would be turned back by American border officials.\n\n\u201cMany of them know they won\u2019t qualify for asylum. They are afraid of being detained,\u201d said Roberto Corona, the group\u2019s communications director, adding that most of them just wanted to reach Mexico, where they plan to speak with members of that country\u2019s Congress.\n\nMigrants who cannot prove that they face persecution or that their lives are endangered in their home country are unlikely to be allowed to remain in the United States.

After Mr. Cond\u00e9 won, the Guinea government transferred an agreement to run the container-port terminal at Conakry, Guinea\u2019s capital, to the Bollor\u00e9 Group from a French rival.\n\nThe deal, first reported by the French newspaper Le Monde, added a strategic jewel to the Bollor\u00e9 Group\u2019s network of assets in West Africa, where it has a virtual stranglehold on much of the transporting of billions of euros worth of cargo. A map of the group\u2019s holdings shows a web of Bollor\u00e9-run roads, railways, waterways, airports and ports that covers two-thirds of the continent and employs more than 25,000 people.\n\nA similar pattern emerged in Togo, another former French colony. There, the same Havas unit was said to support, with below-market-rate services, the re-election of President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 in 2010.\n\nPhoto\n\nA few months before Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9, who has close ties to Mr. Bollor\u00e9, won a second term, his government awarded a contract for the container port at Lom\u00e9, the country\u2019s capital, to the Bollor\u00e9 Group.\n\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the Bollor\u00e9 Group said it had originally gotten a contract to operate the port in 2001, long before Havas was doing business in Guinea. In 2013, Havas stopped doing political consulting for French and African figures after some of its clients, including the former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, became ensnared in scandals.\n\nThe Bollor\u00e9 Group has routinely sued French and African media outlets for defamation over reports on its business dealings on the continent. Journalists at Canal+, a French television channel owned by Vivendi, have accused Mr. Bollor\u00e9 of using his influence to try to suppress an investigative report about a popular revolt against Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9 in Togo. Two producers were fired after the report aired in December.\n\nThe suits have challenged the media outlets France Inter, France 2, Rue89 and Mediapart, among others. Those reports included investigative pieces alleging that workers at the company\u2019s Socapalm and Safacam units, which operate palm oil plantations in Cameroon, were being exploited.\n\nSince 2009, the Bollor\u00e9 Group has brought more than 20 defamation suits involving over 40 reporters and nongovernmental organization activists in France, according to Sherpa, a French anticorruption organization that pursues humanitarian abuses by corporations. \u201cBecause of their systemic nature, we regard these legal actions as \u2018gag suits,\u2019\u201d Sherpa said in a statement.\n\nThe Bollor\u00e9 Group has said the suits were meant to combat what it described as biased reporting.\n\nThe formal investigation of corruption charges against Mr. Bollor\u00e9 and the others means French judges believe there is evidence that points to serious wrongdoing. But the magistrates can later drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed to trial.", "title": "Vincent Bollor\u00e9, French Billionaire, Faces a Rare Corruption Inquiry", "authors": ["Liz Alderman"]}

His father, Ermanno, was a lawyer, and his mother, the former Jolanda Brogi, was a teacher.\n\nThe main early exposure to culture for him and Paolo, who is two years younger, came not from movies, but from trips to Florence to see Verdi operas. One day in Pisa just after World War II, though, everything changed for them.\n\n\u201cBy chance we happened to pass a local movie theater,\u201d Mr. Taviani recalled in a 1986 interview with The New York Times. \u201cAnd the people coming out were muttering, \u2018Don\u2019t go in, it\u2019s an atrocity!\u2019 So naturally we were curious. And there on the screen was everything that had happened to all of us just a few months before.\n\n\u201cSeeing it unreel before us was glorious and tragic,\u201d he continued, \u201cand we realized at once that film was the one means we had to understand our own reality. The movie was Rossellini\u2019s \u2018Paisan,\u2019 and from that day on we knew that the cinema was the road for us.\u201d\n\nNeorealism was in vogue, thanks to the films of Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti and others. That genre had faded by the time the Tavianis began working in the movie business in the mid-1950s, first behind the scenes, then directing documentaries. But when they began making features together in 1962 with \u201cUn uomo da bruciare\u201d (\u201cA Man for Burning,\u201d directed with Valentino Orsini), a drama about a union organizer, they were envisioning a variation on the filmmaking that had first caught their attention.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe wanted to take the legacy of neo-realism and add to it the grandeur of the spettacolo \u2014 the panoramas of John Ford, the melodrama of Giotto\u2019s frescoes,\u201d Mr. Taviani said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the brothers worked with top stars like Isabella Rossellini and Marcello Mastroianni, their films often used unknown actors. They drew on history and literature \u2014 their source material included Tolstoy, for \u201cSan Michele aveva un gallo\u201d (\u201cSt. Michael Had a Rooster\u201d) in 1972; and Luigi Pirandello, for \u201cKaos,\u201d in 1984. They would mix panoramic shots with close-ups in which, as one review put it, \u201cyou can play connect the dots with the actors\u2019 pores.\u201d\n\nTheir formula for co-directing their more than 20 films was simple: They would alternate scenes, and when it was one brother\u2019s turn to direct, the other would not actively interfere but would keep vigil at the video monitor.\n\n\u201cWe have a very acute nonverbal, telepathic communication,\u201d Vittorio Taviani told The Times in a 2013 interview. \u201cIf the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head, the other understands. So we have a silent meeting, we correct it, and then we go off again.\u201d\n\nIdeas would often be exchanged and scripts discussed while they walked their dogs together in a Rome park.\n\n\u201cIn the sun or the rain or the snow we keep walking,\u201d Mr. Taviani said in a 1986 interview with The Times, \u201cand talk about whatever comes into our heads \u2014 movies, dogs, beautiful things, horrible ones, the things that make us angry.

Who wouldn\u2019t want to have a brother with whom to share the difficulty of making films, without the work suffering even the most minimal stylistic incoherence?\u201d\n\nThe brothers had directed a half-dozen features and received some showings at international festivals when, in 1977, their big break came with \u201cPadre Padrone,\u201d a film about a shepherd whose brutal father deprives him of an education but who goes on to become a well-regarded linguist nonetheless.\n\nThe film won the Palme d\u2019Or, the top prize at Cannes, as well as the festival\u2019s International Critics Prize. Janet Maslin, reviewing it in The Times, called it \u201cvivid and very moving, coarse but seldom blunt, and filled with raw landscapes that underscore the naturalness and inevitability of the father\u2010son rituals it depicts.\u201d\n\nAmong the brothers\u2019 better-known later films are \u201cLa notte di San Lorenzo\u201d (\u201cThe Night of the Shooting Stars,\u201d 1982), a somewhat autobiographical tale about an Italian village at the end of World War II, and \u201cCesare deve morire\u201d (\u201cCaesar Must Die,\u201d 2012), a fictional film about a production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d staged in a prison, for which the brothers cast real inmates and ex-convicts.

The company said it had not yet made a decision on him, but merely calling his status into question effectively sealed his fate.\n\nMr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company\u2019s longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company\u2019s Audi and Porsche luxury brands.\n\nMr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. M\u00fcller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.\n\nBut he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen\u2019s powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.\n\nAnd Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. P\u00f6tsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.\n\nThe challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable.

The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen\u2019s deception was uncovered.\n\nThe scandal exposed the degree to which virtually all of the European carmakers took advantage of regulatory loopholes to sell diesels that polluted far more in everyday use than in official tests, causing poor air quality that led to thousands of premature deaths. As a result, cities across Europe have taken steps to restrict the use of diesel vehicles in urban centers. German carmakers have suffered the most from the backlash because of their dependence on the technology.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s upcoming departure.", "title": "Volkswagen Set to Oust Matthias M\u00fcller as C.E.O.

The company\u2019s unique culture is pervasive not only within its vast factory complex but also in the city of 125,000 across a barge canal. Volkswagen is Wolfsburg\u2019s dominant employer, the main source of tax revenue, even the owner of the local professional soccer team.\n\nStatus at the company automatically brings status in the community. License plates issued for company cars include letter codes \u2014 understood by everyone in Wolfsburg \u2014 that signify whether the driver is a high-ranking Volkswagen manager or even a manager\u2019s spouse.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s deeply embedded, conformist ethos was seen as a proximate cause of the scandal. It was why no one challenged the managers who devised illegal software to cover up excess engine emissions, and why no one reported the wrongdoing to any outside authorities for nearly a decade.\n\nPhoto\n\nChanging the culture is one of Mr. Diess\u2019s primary tasks. It is effectively a condition of the agreement Volkswagen made with United States authorities to settle civil and criminal actions stemming from the emissions wrongdoing. Volkswagen is required to establish a stronger whistle-blower system, and ensure that employees believe they can use it.\n\n\u201cCulture is certainly the most difficult task for Diess,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the car industry.\n\nMr. M\u00fcller took over in late 2015 after the scandal became public, but lately seemed to lose momentum.

Worker representatives have another 10 seats on the 20-person board, meaning that unions and the state government together control the company.\n\n\u201cThere is no balance of power in the supervisory board,\u201d Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.\n\nIn a demonstration of worker power, the supervisory board on Thursday also named a high-ranking labor representative, Gunnar Kilian, as head of personnel. The board-level position includes responsibility for negotiations with unions.\n\nIn another major change, Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Sanz, a Spaniard who has been the board member in charge of procurement since 2001, will retire. Mr. Garc\u00eda Sanz exemplified Volkswagen\u2019s preference for managers with a long record of loyalty.\n\nWorker control helps explain why people in Wolfsburg identify so strongly with Volkswagen. But it will also make it difficult for Mr. Diess to reduce the work force, a move considered essential if Volkswagen is to become as efficient as its biggest rival, Toyota.\n\nThe Wolfsburg system has defeated outsiders in the past. The last time Volkswagen had a chief executive who had not spent nearly all his career at the company was when Bernd Pischetsrieder, like Mr. Diess a former BMW manager, took over in 2002.

We have to fight the battle of depersonalization all the time, but when you\u2019re trying to save somebody\u2019s life, you can\u2019t be emotional.\n\nDr. Guillamondegui: It\u2019s a tragedy for the people involved, the community at large.

It\u2019s much easier to know the trajectory of a single gunshot wound where you have an entrance and an exit and you can figure out the path. When somebody comes in with multiple gunshot wounds based on someone with an automatic rifle shooting them eight times, you\u2019ve got to figure out which bullet is going to kill them, and that can be a lot more challenging.\n\nDr. Guillamondegui: If a small bullet hits the right place, it\u2019s just as deadly as a big bullet that hits the right place.\n\nGiven the era we seem to be in, are you finding that bystanders are more prepared to offer first aid?\n\nDr. Guillamondegui: It started out slow, and now it\u2019s kind of building momentum.\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombing was kind of an eye-opener because of all of the extremity injuries that occurred. It married very well with what we\u2019ve seen in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars: that tourniquets work, and they protect people from dying.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf pressure doesn\u2019t work, if wadding up some padding doesn\u2019t work, the next step is a tourniquet above the wound and tightening it down until the bleeding stops. That is something a 5-year-old can do. Whether you want to get into the ethics of teaching a 5-year-old to use a tourniquet, that\u2019s up to you. I can\u2019t see that any normal bystander without training would feel comfortable doing that, even if given the opportunity to. But in the modern world, the real concept is that we will each be at risk for this event occurring sometime in our life, and if we\u2019re not prepared to at least lend a hand, we\u2019re going to put people at risk.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Miller: People out of harm\u2019s way, if the harm has been done and is over, they want to help.

The flow gets changed by onlookers who are trying to do the best they can to help, and what they don\u2019t realize is we see 6,000 traumas a year.\n\nDr. Miller: You have to use your troops appropriately, and there are some of us who won\u2019t come in for the first surge. It\u2019s become, unfortunately, a science behind these mass shootings and disasters.\n\nDr. Guillamondegui: If you have a mass event and we look back on what we can do better, very little of that is going to be the clinical acumen of what we do. It\u2019s going to be the logistics.\n\nNot many trauma centers have recently dealt with as many mass shootings as Vanderbilt. How do you and your staff cope?\n\nDr. Miller: The balance between empathy and objectivity is very difficult sometimes because in the heat of the moment, you\u2019re trying to save somebody\u2019s life, but your empathy for the patient and the family after that can overwhelm you.

You must be able to take a break and intervene mindfulness and things that have meaning in your life. Whatever floats your boat. For me, it\u2019s triathlons. For Oscar, it\u2019s biking and swimming. We have to try and separate what we do here from what we do in the regular world.

Only about 2 percent of India\u2019s retail sales are online now, but tens of millions of Indians are getting onto the internet every year via cheap smartphones and rock-bottom mobile data prices.\n\nAmazon has committed at least $5.5 billion so far to building its India presence, fighting to gain market share among the country\u2019s young, increasingly tech-savvy shoppers. After starting an Indian site, Amazon.in, from scratch in 2013, Amazon blew past local players like Snapdeal and is now a close No. 2 to Flipkart in sales.\n\nWalmart\u2019s interest in India is the latest extension of the retailer\u2019s battle with Amazon. Rooted for decades in its network of stores, Walmart has been trying to bolster its online offerings. In just the past few years, it has acquired the hip, largely online clothing brands Bonobos and ModCloth, started a higher-end mattress and bedding line sold exclusively online and expanded home grocery delivery to 100 American cities.\n\nBased in Bangalore, Flipkart was founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. The two men, who are not related, worked briefly at Amazon\u2019s back-office operations in India before deciding to form their own company.\n\nLike Amazon, Flipkart initially started selling books online before expanding into a vast array of products. On its way to becoming India\u2019s top online retailer, it successfully navigated problems such as customers\u2019 preference for paying in cash and the country\u2019s spotty roads and delivery networks.\n\nWhile Walmart operates stores around the globe, India would be a relatively new frontier for the huge retailer. The company operates wholesale stores in India, but it has no public-facing retail or e-commerce presence.\n\nFlipkart would be one of Walmart\u2019s largest acquisitions since it acquired Asda, a large British grocery chain, in 1999. That deal would be valued at about $16 billion today, adjusted for inflation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnalysts point out that Walmart has made very few large acquisitions in its 56-year history and that some of those deals remain works in progress.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jet, based in Hoboken, N.J., was supposed to be Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon\u2019s appeal with higher-income, urban-dwelling millennials in the United States.\n\nBut there are signs that Walmart is still trying to fully integrate Jet into its larger e-commerce strategy. After reporting that its e-commerce sales growth had slowed in the fourth quarter, Walmart said it would focus on driving new customers through its main Walmart.com site, not through the Jet platform.\n\nAcquiring Flipkart would give Walmart an instant leg up on Amazon in India, but it is still likely to face stiff competition from its primary rival. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India as his chance to make up for the company\u2019s failure to establish a major presence in China, just like Walmart. That likely means the online giant will double down on its investment there now that Walmart has come onto the scene.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they should do it,\u201d Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said of Walmart\u2019s potential deal for Flipkart. \u201cAmazon is like an A.T.M. machine. I wouldn\u2019t want to be competing with Amazon in India.\u201d\n\nIn addition to pouring billions into its Indian e-commerce site, Amazon is also investing in original content from Bollywood movie studios and has developed local versions of crucial products, such as its Prime video streaming and Echo voice-activated speakers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s assault was so intense that a couple of years ago, some analysts were predicting that Flipkart would be crushed. Complicating matters, Flipkart was racked by management turmoil.\n\nBut Tiger Global, one of Flipkart\u2019s earliest and largest investors, pushed for the appointment of one of its own executives, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, as chief executive in January 2017. Mr. Krishnamurthy is credited with steadying the company and improving the customer experience.\n\nSoftBank, a Japanese investment firm that has been making large bets in India over the last few years, also agreed to provide $2.5 billion in fresh capital last summer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWalmart would bring an even larger potential source of funding to Flipkart as it tries to keep growing.\n\n\u201cFor the ecosystem, this is good,\u201d said Satish Meena, a senior analyst in New Delhi for Forrester, a technology research firm. \u201cThere is more money and more expertise coming into the system.

But it also has the more dubious distinction of being the most contested, most ignored and, at times, most misunderstood of those laws.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, an array of forces worked to divide American communities into black and white quarters. Some involved explicit discrimination, including racial redlining in federal mortgage insurance, and real estate covenants that restricted home buyers by race. But some were more subtle, like the steering by real estate agents of racial minorities into certain neighborhoods, biased lending and underwriting, and the concentration of low-income housing in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nBy the late 1960s, racial tensions came to a head, marked by civil disturbances that the bipartisan Kerner Commission attributed to the growth of \u201ctwo societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d The fair housing bill, which had been filibustered for many years by segregationist senators, received a critical push from this report.

Statistics can be fascinating and revealing, challenging long-held assumptions and leading to more rational decisions. But when teams ask less of their players, we seem less likely to witness true greatness.\n\nConsider the fifth inning on Wednesday, when Nola faced Yoenis Cespedes with one out and the bases empty. It should not have been strange that he was allowed to do this. But now, with managers so nervous about letting pitchers face hitters three times in one game, it seemed almost quaint.\n\nCespedes had homered off Nola\u2019s curveball in the first inning, but this time, Nola struck him out with that very same pitch.

Yet at the height of the American occupation of neighboring Iraq, Assad encouraged Syrian jihadists to go martyr themselves by killing Americans.\n\nIn May 2011, as the peaceful uprising was gathering momentum, Assad declared an amnesty that released virtually all the Islamic extremists in his prisons. Now he had another use for them, which they understood perfectly well. If they took up arms, as one partisan of Al Qaeda told Abouzeid, \u201cthis would allow the regime to say to the world, \u2018Look at the terrorists.\u2019\u201d In the years that followed, Assad got his wish. He and his Russian and Iranian backers relentlessly portrayed their fight as their own \u201cwar on terror\u201d while setting out to slaughter any moderate forces that did not fit that description. This was a recipe for chaos, and such was the fractious, fractured nature of the conflict that over time even the hardened, disciplined fighters linked to Al Qaeda fought among themselves.\n\nAbouzeid navigated this increasingly treacherous terrain with legendary courage as she wrote for Foreign Affairs and other publications, building the stories of the people in this book around long, repeated interviews and, often, long days and nights under fire alongside them. The result is a tremendous sense of intimacy with the victims and the violence that surrounds them.\n\nIn Saraqeb, Abouzeid focuses on Ruha, a little girl of 9 when the war begins and a woman much older than her 14 years when the book ends. \u201cWe are children of now, not children of before,\u201d Ruha says in the closing pages.", "title": "War Without End", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "What is lawyer-client privilege?\n\nMost of the time, if someone possesses information that is relevant to getting at the truth about a suspected crime, the rules require that person to disclose such evidence, and prosecutors can use those facts in court. But courts have created exceptions to protect confidential communications between a client and a lawyer and a lawyer\u2019s work product on behalf of a client, like notes and files the lawyer gathered in anticipation of litigation.\n\nThe idea, said Samuel W. Buell, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white-collar criminal law at Duke University, is that it is generally in the broader public interest to encourage people to consult lawyers and talk candidly with them. That way, lawyers can steer their clients toward lawful conduct in the first place, and better-informed lawyers will make the legal system function more smoothly.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Mr. Buell said, the search warrant for Mr. Cohen\u2019s office was \u201cnot going to happen unless they feel that they have to, and they think they have something that is really serious going on.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since the public does not know the details of what law enforcement officials are looking for, that adds a layer of complexity to making sense of the raid.\n\n\u201cIt bears remembering that not everything in Michael Cohen\u2019s office, home or hotel is even covered by the privilege to begin with,\u201d said Miriam Baer, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white-collar criminal law at Brooklyn Law School. \u201cThere are a lot of papers, data or files that could be in Michael Cohen\u2019s office that don\u2019t fit the definition of privilege.\u201d\n\nAre all lawyer-client materials off limits?\n\nNo. In certain cases, lawyer-client materials do not receive special legal protections. One of them is called the \u201ccrime-fraud exception.\u201d Under this doctrine, the privilege does not protect lawyer-client materials in situations in which the lawyer was helping the client commit a continuing or planned crime or fraud, since that would not serve society\u2019s goal of ensuring lawyers can render sound legal advice. If the judge who signed off on the warrant invoked that doctrine, it would be \u201cextremely significant,\u201d said Katrice Bridges Copeland, a law professor at Pennsylvania State University and a former white-collar defense lawyer.\n\n\u201cTo have gotten this search warrant means they are finding that there was no separation between the attorney and the client, meaning they were working together in furtherance of a crime or some sort of fraud to cover up some previous crime,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a big deal. It\u2019s not easy to make that showing to the court and get a search warrant on an attorney.\u201d\n\nWhat if the government gets more than it should?\n\nWhen the government seizes materials and sorts through them itself, it carries the risk that officials may see confidential files about unrelated cases or material that is covered by a valid claim of lawyer-client privilege. A defense lawyer could later use that to try to get a case dismissed. To mitigate that risk, the manual says the Justice Department is supposed to create a separate \u201ctaint team\u201d of officials who will go through the materials first. They are not supposed to tell their colleagues working on the main case what they saw in any files they end up setting aside. If the search is contested, a judge might review the materials the taint team decides are relevant before the main case team gets to see them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWho must sign off on a search warrant for a lawyer\u2019s files?\n\nThe manual requires high-level supervisory approval \u2014 such as from the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s not profitable to argue with Mr. Buffett about the markets. He is right, of course. The return prospects for bonds aren\u2019t particularly appealing today. That\u2019s because low bond yields reduce the odds that you will earn a return that keeps pace with inflation in coming years. And with the Federal Reserve pushing its target interest rate higher, bond prices are likely to suffer. (When rates rise, bond prices fall. A bond fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the interest paid plus changes in bond prices.)\n\nBut Mr. Buffett is a singular investor, one with deep pockets and an extremely long-term perspective, and he has an excellent track record of exploiting market sell-offs. Most people aren\u2019t like that.\n\n\u201cWhile Warren Buffett might be able to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy, most of us just follow the herd,\u201d said Allan Roth, founder of the Wealth Logic financial advisory firm. \u201cBonds provide liquidity and courage when stocks are falling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBonds can be a boon for any investor who needs help in the courage department. \u201cYou own bonds to reduce volatility, not to earn a return,\u201d says Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer at the Gerstein Fisher financial advisory firm.\n\nMoreover, what concerns Mr. Buffett are the poor prospects for long-term bonds, especially given their current low yields. He routinely points out that a 30-year Treasury bond is the wrong place to be when rates are rising, as they have been lately.\n\n\u201cPensions and institutions that need to match their long-term liabilities with an asset use 30-year bonds. But most investors don\u2019t have that problem. Nobody owns them,\u201d said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nAccording to Morningstar Direct, $59 billion is invested in long-term bond funds and exchange-traded funds (defined as portfolios with average durations above six years). But that total is dwarfed by the more than $1.5 trillion invested in intermediate-term portfolios (3.5- to six-year average duration), which include core bond funds hewing to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index. Another $431 billion is invested in short-term portfolios (one- to 3.5-year average duration).\n\nDuration is a measure of sensitivity to changing interest rates; the longer the duration, the more the price of a bond will fall when rates rise. For example, Dodge & Cox Income fund, with a duration of around four years, lost 0.9 percent in the first quarter. Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index fund, with a duration of more than 15 years, lost 3.75 percent.\n\nMs. Jones points out that from a low yield of 1.38 percent in July 2016, the 10-year Treasury note now yields nearly 3 percent. \u201cWe are in a bond bear market,\u201d she said. But that\u2019s nothing like a stock bear market.\n\nSince July 2016, the average intermediate bond fund has managed to post flat performance as higher yields have offset price declines. Shorter-term portfolios have eked out a small gain. On an inflation-adjusted basis, bond funds have negative returns over that stretch. A stock bear market, by contrast, doesn\u2019t begin until stocks have fallen at least 20 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nStill, core bond funds\u2019 struggles have been unsettling. And with a strong-enough economy spurring the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, bond investors may need to reduce expectations.\n\nLast quarter may well have been the start of bad times for bonds. Peter Chiappinelli, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, points out that bonds moving in the same downward direction as stocks \u201chas happened before and will happen again. That bonds are a dampener is not preordained by God,\u201d Mr. Chiappinelli said. \u201cAs we saw in the \u201970s and \u201980s, there are times when stocks and bonds can have a positive correlation,\u201d he said, meaning those assets can move in the same direction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate is ratcheting up its risk. The duration of the index has increased from around 3.5 years in 2008 to six years today as the composition of the index shifted in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Treasury bonds, which tend to have longer durations, now represent more than one-third of the index compared with 22 percent in 2007. And corporations have spent the last decade issuing longer-term bonds to take advantage of low interest rates.\n\nMr. Chiappinelli said investing in a portfolio that is increasing its duration when interest rates \u201cwere at historic lows is the exact opposite of prudence.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Treasuries are quite sensitive to rate increases, and Ms. Jones found that the credit quality of the corporate bonds in the index had decreased since the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWe tend to talk about owning the aggregate index as a core, and then adding some risk around it. Well, now might be a time to keep your core but add some less risky bonds,\u201d Ms. Jones said.\n\nFunds that own high-quality bonds with shorter durations, such as Fidelity Short-Term Bond, can help reduce your portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to rising rates. Or you might want to consider a wholesale shift to shorter duration funds.\n\n\u201cShorten up your entire bond portfolio to two or three years and you could probably afford to own fewer bonds and increase your stocks,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. His expectation is that the overall volatility of a portfolio 30 percent in short-term bonds and 70 percent in stocks is going to be on par with one that is 40 percent invested in a fund tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index and 60 percent in stocks.\n\nMr. Roth recommends owning a laddered series of federally insured five-year certificates of deposit as a bond proxy. Online banks now offer five-year C.D.s yielding 2.5 percent or more.\n\nMs. Jones favors funds that hold floating-rate bonds \u2014 whose yields adjust when interest rates change \u2014 as a way of coping with the current environment. Ms. Jones suggests sticking with floating-rate funds that invest in high-quality bonds, such as the iShares Floating Rate Bond E.T.F. It has an average duration of less than one year and yields nearly 2 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo combat inflation, you might want to add a fund that invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, such as Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the return of bonds will be, and I am not suggesting it will be as good as the past 17 years, but I do expect the volatility of bonds relative to stocks to stay the same,\u201d Mr. Roth said.\n\nUnless you are as patient and prescient as Mr. Buffett, owning a slug of less-volatile bonds can help you stick to a long-term investing strategy when stocks fall.", "title": "Warren Buffett Isn\u2019t a Fan of Bonds.

Let me say I\u2019m not confident that such a conversation would have yielded much of value; for one thing, given how different children are, it\u2019s hard to evaluate claims that a parent didn\u2019t treat them equally.

The fact is, it\u2019s hard to predict how he\u2019ll process it, and it\u2019s not up to you to do so. Don\u2019t try to manage his access to the truth. Let him see the letter.\n\nI work at a nonprofit where a majority of our staff works far more than 40 hours a week. We are allowed to work from home one day a week. One of my co-workers has told me that when she works from home, she is actually running errands and taking care of her kids and that she will sometimes work at night to make up for it. Since I and many of our co-workers already work many nights and weekends, this doesn\u2019t seem fair. She is often unavailable when she is supposed to be working.\n\nThis co-worker is currently on maternity leave, but we\u2019ve learned that she will be allowed to work from home indefinitely when her maternity leave ends. I fear that she is going to pull even less of her weight and that the rest of us will have to cover for her. To complicate matters, I suspect she gets this leniency because she is friends with one of our bosses. This is not the first time new rules have been created to accommodate her, but not others in a similar situation.\n\nOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to get involved \u2014 if she wants to be dishonest, that\u2019s up to her. On the other hand, her lies have a direct impact on me; I have to work more because she\u2019s working less. Our clients are also affected, and because we are dealing with legal matters, her dishonesty may be a breach of her ethical responsibilities to them. Should I stay quiet? If not, how can I talk to management about this? Name Withheld\n\n\n\nIt would, I agree, be good for your organization and for your clients to remedy this situation. If your nonprofit has an H.R. department, you can start there, and there\u2019s always the board, which is charged with advising and supervising management. Consider contacting a board member if there\u2019s one you know and trust, or send the board the relevant information \u2014 perhaps anonymously, if you\u2019re worried about retaliation. The board should be concerned that members of the staff feel they cannot bring such issues to management. And the board should care about staff morale and efficiency and doing the best for your clients, all of which are at stake.\n\nTaking such measures may not be easy. But if you stay quiet, you\u2019re condoning an abuse of the system. Because it can be hard to estimate how long a legal task will take, clients and colleagues count on staff members to pull their weight. Your colleague isn\u2019t producing at the rate she would were she working the hours she has been paid for. What\u2019s more, her special treatment unfairly imposes burdens on others, and it creates a bad atmosphere, which can itself affect productivity.

The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system. Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nEarnings were supposed to lift stocks...\n\nBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.\n\nDisappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\n\n\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\n\n\u2022 3M\u2019s earnings met Wall Street expectation, but the stock is down 8.5 percent, its worst post-earnings selloff in more than a decade. The reason? The company lowered the high end of its guidance.\n\n\u2022 Caterpillar jumped 3 percent after its top and bottom lines easily beat expectations. But it shares gave up all their gains and then some during its conference call when executives said the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share. The stock is now off 6.5 percent.\n\n\u2022 Shares of Apple are off 1.5 percent Tuesday and more than 7 percent since Thursday\u2019s close amid worries that demand for iPhones will be much weaker than expected this year.\n\n\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.\n\nIn all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nContext\n\nAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take\n\nDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\n\nTime to worry?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.\n\nNo news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.\n\nA number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.\n\nA similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere may not be a pay gap between female and male C.E.O.s\n\nThat stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)\n\nMore from Andrew\u2019s column:\n\nOne of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.\n\nImportant caveat: The new study isn\u2019t a sign that the overall gender pay gap in corporate America has improved, or that there\u2019s been a rush of women appointed as C.E.O.s. \u201cThere is still discrimination against women getting to the top,\u201d Sandra Mortal, one of the study\u2019s authors, told Andrew.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTakeda has made another bid for Shire\n\nIn a statement, Shire said that its board was considering the new offer, the terms of which it didn\u2019t disclose.

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "Regulators appear ready to agree. The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed changing the capital requirement to make it \u201cmore closely tailored to each firm.\u201d That could wind up lowering the amount of capital that big banks must maintain.\n\nThe change was not supported by another bank regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is currently headed by Martin J. Gruenberg, an Obama administration appointee. It also prompted a \u201cno\u201d vote from one of the Fed\u2019s three sitting governors, Lael Brainard, also an Obama administration appointee, who recently said it was too soon to lower capital requirements for the biggest banks.\n\n\u201cSome observers contend that current capital requirements are too onerous and are choking off credit,\u201d Ms. Brainard said last Thursday in a broad speech about bank regulation. \u201cBut the evidence suggests otherwise: U.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong.\u201d\n\nUnder the Fed\u2019s proposed new method, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs\u2019s leverage ratio would most likely drop from 5 percent to 4.25 percent of their assets and certain off-balance sheet holdings, while Wells Fargo\u2019s might fall to 4 percent. Capital required for eight large banks under the proposed leverage ratios is around $86 billion less than the amount demanded at the 5 percent level, according to calculations by The New York Times.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Fed, in explaining the impact of the changes, said capital held by the banks would not fall by much. That\u2019s because a second set of capital requirements, based on assets\u2019 riskiness, would be set higher than the leverage ratio after the changes. The Fed estimated a theoretical reduction of $9 billion across the eight banks. That amount would be even smaller once the Fed\u2019s annual tests of banks\u2019 strength are taken into account.\n\nBut as regulators adjust capital rules in the coming months, the big banks are expected to enjoy significant relief. Several proposed changes could free up more than $50 billion of capital at large banks, according to recent research by Goldman Sachs, money that could in theory be distributed to shareholders.\n\nThe changes are part of a push, spearheaded by Randal K. Quarles, who oversees bank supervision at the Fed, to ease some of the regulations that came into effect after the financial crisis of 2008. The leverage ratio proposal builds on ideas that were under discussion at the Fed before Mr. Quarles\u2019s confirmation as a Fed governor last year but go beyond that approach. It is prompting concern from those who view the leverage ratio as an important tool to help protect the financial system by preventing banks from becoming overextended.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bair, who was head of the F.D.I.C. during the tumult of 2008, and who does not support the proposed changes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe change most likely won\u2019t lead to an immediate weakening of the financial system. But, over time, if the financial industry keeps pressing for looser regulations, and Washington obliges, there is concern that the absence of a strong leverage ratio could reduce confidence in the financial system, particularly in periods of stress.\n\nThe leverage ratio\u2019s importance is revealed in how large banks finance themselves. They get most of the money they need for lending and trading from two main sources \u2014 they borrow it in markets or they raise it from depositors. But an overreliance on those two sources can leave a bank vulnerable to runs, because many of the creditors and depositors can demand the bank return their money at short notice. That is why banks must get some of their funding from equity capital, which consists of retained profits and funds from shareholders, who cannot demand immediate repayment of their money.\n\nSome capital rules allow banks to hold less capital against an asset that is perceived by regulators to be less risky. The weakness of this approach was revealed in 2008 and during the European debt crisis when supposedly safe assets turned out to be dangerously risky. The leverage ratio, by contrast, requires banks to have a set amount of capital, regardless of the type of assets it holds.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of the leverage ratio, regulators increased it for the largest banks four years ago. At the higher ratio, the big banks had to have capital equivalent to 5 percent of their assets and certain off-balance sheet holdings. Under the new rule, it would decline significantly. The Fed and the Comptroller want to set the ratio at 3 percent, and then add half of a capital surcharge that is applied to eight large United States banks because their operations pose a heightened risk to the global financial system. (Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who previously oversaw bank supervision, floated this sort of change a year ago, but his suggestion would not have led to lower leverage ratios for three banks and it would have resulted in smaller reductions for the five others.)\n\nBank representatives say the leverage ratio has been a crude tool that has not made the financial system safer. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d said Greg Baer, president of the Clearing House Association, which represents banks.\n\nSupporters of the leverage ratio, however, say that it should be at least as important as the malleable capital requirements, to provide reliable protection in a storm. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have strong, vigilant regulators but we shouldn\u2019t put all of our faith in them,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress said. \u201cWe should have this capital requirement that is simple, transparent and doesn\u2019t rely on expert determinations.\u201d", "title": "Washington Wants to Weaken Bank Rules.

It was agreed that they met through Temple University, where he was on the board of trustees and she was director of operations for the basketball team, and that the two became friends. It was agreed that a sexual interaction occurred between them on a night in early 2004 at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. But Ms. Constand said that she had been sexually assaulted that night \u2014 given pills and wine which left her incapacitated and incapable of consenting to sex \u2014 and Mr. Cosby and his lawyers said the interaction was consensual.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Ms. Constand. The jury returned the verdict on the second day of its deliberations; the first trial against Mr. Cosby for the same crimes, which took place last summer, ended with a deadlocked jury after six days.\n\nTo many, Mr. Cosby is a star in the pantheon of powerful sexual abusers, proof of the rampant inescapability of male sexual violence. In this narrative he is an African-American corollary to Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of assault or harassment by more than 30 women .

First, personalized data collection would be allowed only through opt-in mechanisms that were clear, concise and transparent. There would be no more endless pages of legalese that nobody reads or can easily understand. The same would be true of any individualized targeting of users by companies or political campaigns \u2014 it should be clear, transparent and truly consensual.\n\nSecond, people would have access, if requested, to all the data a company has collected on them \u2014 including all forms of computational inference (how the company uses your data to make guesses about your tastes and preferences, your personal and medical history, your political allegiances and so forth).\n\nThird, the use of any data collected would be limited to specifically enumerated purposes, for a designed period of time \u2014 and then would expire. The current model of harvesting all data, with virtually no limit on how it is used and for how long, must stop.\n\nFourth, the aggregate use of data should be regulated. Merely saying that individuals own their data isn\u2019t enough: Companies can and will persuade people to part with their data in ways that may seem to make sense at the individual level but that work at the aggregate level to create public harms. For example, collecting health information from individuals in return for a small compensation might seem beneficial to both parties \u2014 but a company that holds health information on a billion people can end up posing a threat to individuals in ways they could not have foreseen.\n\nFacebook may complain that these changes to data collection and use would destroy the company. But while these changes would certainly challenge the business model of many players in the digital economy, giant companies like Facebook would be in the best position to adapt and forge ahead.\n\nIf anything, we should all be thinking of ways to reintroduce competition into the digital economy.

They can reduce the number of teachers, but that means larger class sizes, which will outrage parents. They can and have cut programs for students with special needs, but cruelty aside, that can only save a bit of money at the margin. The same is true of cost-saving measures like neglecting school maintenance and scrimping on school supplies to the point that many teachers end up supplementing inadequate school budgets out of their own pockets.\n\nSo what conservative state governments have mainly done is squeeze teachers themselves.\n\nNow, teaching kids was never a way to get rich. However, being a schoolteacher used to put you solidly in the middle class, with a decent income and benefits. In much of the country, however, that is no longer true.\n\nAt the national level, earnings of public-school teachers have fallen behind inflation since the mid-1990s, and have fallen even more behind the earnings of comparable workers. At this point, teachers earn 23 percent less than other college graduates. But this national average is a bit deceptive: Teacher pay is actually up in some big states like New York and California, but it\u2019s way down in a number of right-leaning states.\n\nMeanwhile, teachers\u2019 benefits are also getting worse. In particular, teachers are having to pay a rising share of their health insurance premiums, a severe burden when their real earnings are declining at the same time.\n\nSo we\u2019re left with a nation in which teachers, the people we count on to prepare our children for the future, are starting to feel like members of the working poor, unable to make ends meet unless they take second jobs. And they can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nWhich brings us back to Bevin\u2019s unhinged outburst.\n\nOne way to think about what\u2019s currently happening in a number of states is that the anti-Obama backlash, combined with the growing tribalism of American politics, delivered a number of state governments into the hands of extreme right-wing ideologues. These ideologues really believed that they could usher in a low-tax, small-government, libertarian utopia.\n\nPredictably, they couldn\u2019t. For a while they were able to evade some of the consequences of their failure by pushing the costs off onto public sector employees, especially schoolteachers. But that strategy has reached its limits. Now what?\n\nWell, some Republicans have actually proved willing to learn from experience, reverse tax cuts and restore education funding.

Investment laws from 2014 intended to open up the economy to foreign investment are falling short of their goals. Even the much-promoted (though exaggerated) successes of the revolution in health care and education have been eroded by shortages and lack of state investment.\n\nThe major economic challenge will be unifying Cuba\u2019s dual currency system, which uses a domestic peso and a separate international peso for trading with other countries. (The international peso trades artificially at a rate of one-to-one with the United States dollar, and the domestic peso trades at a rate generously assumed to be 24 local pesos to the international peso.) Unifying the currencies will cause upheaval in the economy, increasing the prices of imported goods and ending the double-booking system that many businesses use to keep themselves artificially solvent, leading to inflation and unemployment. Modernizing and advancing the Cuban economy requires addressing this wrenching change.\n\nThis is where the United States can come in. While it is not in America\u2019s interest to promote investment to prop up an anachronistic, repressive regime, it is also not in its interest to stand by while a neighbor\u2019s fragile economy crumbles under the weight of its failed policies.

Nearly half of Americans with cholesterol levels that put them at high risk of a heart attack or stroke are not taking medication to reduce that risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under current guidelines, among people 60 and older, 87 percent of men and 54 percent of women not already taking a statin would be considered eligible for treatment.\n\nThere is no question that statins can protect the health of people who have already had a heart attack or stroke (or even angina) and thus face a significant risk of a recurrence that could prove fatal. But many people \u2014 especially those who are uncomfortable taking drugs for any reason \u2014 resist taking a daily statin if they have no history or symptoms of cardiovascular disease, only a risk of developing them, especially since it has not yet been proven that the drugs help such people live longer.\n\nFurthermore, people correctly regard \u201crisk\u201d as a possibility, not a probability, and vary in the degree of risk they are willing to tolerate. One chance in 100 may be acceptable to one person, while another may regard one chance in 1,000 as too risky.\n\nDoctors define cardiovascular risk as a percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke occurring within the next 10 years based on the presence of well-established risk factors: high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, age, gender and race (and, in some cases, family history). You can determine your own risk using the calculator developed by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association at cvriskcalculator.com.\n\nIf your calculated risk is 7.5 percent or higher, your doctor is likely to suggest you consider taking a statin, although a relatively high cholesterol level may not result in such a recommendation if you have no other heart risk factors. The risk score is meant \u201cto start a conversation, not to write a prescription,\u201d according to Dr. Don Lloyd-Jones, professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a spokesman for the heart association.\n\nLet\u2019s say your risk is 19 percent. That means among 100 people with similar risk factors, 19 are likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. Is that a risk you\u2019re willing to take? Or would you rather reduce your risk by a third by taking a statin? Only you can make that determination, and it should be based on a full understanding of the known benefits and risks of statins, not something you may have heard from a friend or read online.\n\nThe current labeling on statin prescriptions doesn\u2019t help matters.

In February, she encountered her first public relations crisis when Weight Watchers announced during a global employee event that it planned to offer free six-week memberships to teenagers. The well-oiled social media opprobrium machine heaved into gear, with the Balance Eating Disorder Treatment Center introducing an aggrieved hashtag, #wakeupweightwatchers, and the Academy for Eating Disorders posting an open letter to Ms. Grossman that cited studies linking restrictive diets during adolescence to potentially severe mental and physical consequences.\n\nThe following month, Oprah Winfrey \u2014 who in 2015 bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers, along with becoming its spokeswoman \u2014 sold a quarter of that stake, prompting speculation about her long-term involvement. (Ms. Winfrey later said that she was donating some of those shares to a charity and that she remained committed to the company.)\n\nSitting in a fabric-lined boardroom with the company\u2019s senior vice president of corporate communications, Stacie Sherer, Ms. Grossman was as measured as a cup of popcorn (up to two SmartPoints) about the teenager kerfuffle.\n\n\u201cWhenever you do anything that\u2019s different from the norm, you\u2019ll have some people who think it\u2019s the most incredible thing in the world, that you\u2019re going to help generations get healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re going to have some people who want to weigh in thinking that we\u2019re putting the teenagers of the world on a diet which is exactly what we\u2019re not doing.\u201d She cited the company\u2019s consultation with pediatric experts. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re going to do that\u2019s not rooted in science, and that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said, \u201c and so it\u2019s just a matter of clarification and communication.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe herself was an awkward-aged 14-year-old in the Long Island town of Valley Stream when she attended her first Weight Watchers meeting, taken there by her mother, Elaine Waldman, a homemaker who struggled with health problems as well as the scale. \u201cIt was mostly women just having a conversation about food and how they felt, and I remember listening to other people and supporting other people,\u201d Ms. Grossman said.

Told this story for as long as she could remember, their daughter developed a strong sense of filial obligation. She went to Manhattanville College a year early, transferring to George Washington University as a senior, and majored in English literature and philosophy with plans to become a lawyer.\n\nA sudden, if unfocused, epiphany came after a summer working as receptionist and occasional fit model for the company that made Nik Nik, the brightly patterned polyester shirts popular during the disco years. She broke an engagement to her high-school boyfriend and telephoned her parents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving to New York,\u201d she announced, to horrified silence.\n\nHer graduation was in 1977, when the city was dangerous and dirty. She found an assistant job at another shirt company, Manhattan Industries, which paid $15,600 a year, and moved into a 330-square-foot studio apartment in an elevator building on First Avenue between 73rd and 74th Streets. The long bus ride to the west side cost 50 cents. \u201cI\u2019d be scrounging, looking for the quarter,\u201d said Ms. Grossman, who is currently renovating a $5.65 million condo at United Nations Plaza.\n\nShe moonlighted one winter as a server at Cachaca, a nightclub on 62nd Street above the better-known discoth\u00e8que Hippopotamus, to make extra cash for the holidays. \u201cYou know what? It was fabulous,\u201d she said.\n\nHer career in shirts progressed to the men\u2019s wear brand Enro. One day, the fashion designer Jeffrey Banks arrived there for a meeting and spotted Mindy Waldman handling a busy front desk. \u201cI watched this young woman \u2014 21, 22 years of age \u2014 dealing with irate salespeople and messengers, doing it so calmly and efficiently \u2014 I was just so captivated by her,\u201d he said in a phone interview. She would eventually become his vice president of sales, part of a rare convergence of talent that included the then-unknown designers John Varvatos and Isaac Mizrahi.\n\nLater, she worked for Willi Smith, a lover of bright color who collaborated with artists like Barbara Kruger and Keith Haring. \u201cLiterally the first designer to really articulate that fashions should come from the street up not the top down,\u201d Ms. Grossman said. \u201cTo bring democratization to fashion, before Target ever thought of it.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith died of AIDS-related causes in the spring of 1987. Later that year, a month before her 30th birthday, Mindy Waldman married Neil Grossman, a mathematical physicist turned lawyer turned financier. They have a grown daughter, Elysabeth, nicknamed Lizzy, and a 15-month-old granddaughter, Emma. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous, it\u2019s so unbelievable, I\u2019m obsessed,\u201d Ms. Grossman said, adding brightly of Lizzy: \u201cAnd she\u2019s on the whole Freestyle and loves it, because a lot of today\u2019s young moms, they have to be healthy for their kids.\u201d (Under the Weight Watchers Freestyle system introduced in December, more than 200 foods including beans, peas, chicken breast and seemingly every fish in the sea can be consumed with wanton abandon.)\n\nShe went from Mr. Smith\u2019s company to then-fledgling Tommy Hilfiger, as vice president of sales and marketing, and then to the aesthetically similar Ralph Lauren as the president of its bridge line, Chaps. Later, she started Polo Jeans, which was directed at young people, and which has remained one of Mr. Lauren\u2019s most successful and enduring brand extensions.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Grossman\u2019s next stop was Nike, where she expanded the apparel business by over a billion dollars, with a particular focus on women\u2019s wear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut she was eager to be a chief executive, and after a recruiter from Barry Diller\u2019s InterActive Corp. contacted her about heading its retail division, she sold Mr. Diller on a plan to revive the then-ossified Home Shopping Network.\n\nVodka and Cereal\n\nInspired by the chatty format of her favorite cooking shows, Ms. Grossman brought higher-end labels and A-list celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Serena Williams to the channel, along with much-heralded new Herman Miller Aeron chairs. In August 2008, spun off from IAC by Mr. Diller, Home Shopping Network went public.

With waterfront property in St. Petersburg, Fla. and a house with vineyard in Millbrook, N.Y., Ms. Grossman considered retirement, but the opportunity to run Weight Watchers intrigued her. The financial returns are less important to her, she insisted, than freshening a brand that, with its cruises and oft-deserted storefronts, some considered as stale as an outdated package of SandwichThins (three SmartPoints).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the turnaround girl \u2014 I\u2019m the transformation-growth person,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Winfrey, a little out of breath after a 45-minute run, praised Ms. Grossman, one of around five candidates brought to her by a search firm. \u201cShe\u2019s an executor and a doer, not just a sayer and a talker,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said during a phone interview.\n\n\u201cThe thing that did it for me was that she understood immediately that it was a lifestyle and not a diet, and that we were still operating as though it was a diet,\u201d she went on. \u201cShe said the same things that I had also felt and expressed, that it allows for your own accountability, but it\u2019s really so much more than that, so that was music to my spirit.\u201d (And how many FitPoints had that run earned Ms. Winfrey? \u201cI don\u2019t count them, because it\u2019s so ridiculous!\u201d Ms. Winfrey said. \u201cIf I were to count them, probably it would be four, and it would be so irritating.\u201d)\n\nWeight Watchers has long had to fend off other programs like Nutrisystem, Medifast and Jenny Craig. But the new millennium has also brought competition in the form of free tracking apps like MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! \u201cI keep doing the research and I realized that our greatest competition is people thinking they can get healthy themselves,\u201d Ms. Grossman said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen there has been the rise of gleaming, \u201caspirational\u201d alternatives like Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop and boutique fitness classes. \u201cThere\u2019s a portion of wellness that seems for a small few,\u201d Ms. Grossman said diplomatically, \u201cand we think wellness should be part of everyone\u2019s life and accessible to all.\u201d (Weight Watchers\u2019s membership costs range from about $3 per week for an online-only plan to $12 a week with personalized coaching.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe has countered the industry\u2019s largely middle-of-the-road rotation of celebrity endorsers like Marie Osmond (Nutrisystem) with the of-the-moment music producer DJ Khaled, who has embarked on a tour of various cities with a food truck. Fond of gardening, he has boasted of a 26-pound weight loss \u2014 though this week he came under fire for pouring vodka (only three SmartPoints, but still!) over his breakfast cereal.\n\nWhether because of such moves, or the wind beneath her wings of Ms. Winfrey, Weight Watchers during a February earnings call announced a 23 percent increase in subscribers from the previous year and set a goal of $2 billion in revenue, up from the present $1.3 billion, by 2020.\n\n\u201cMindy loves a challenge,\u201d Mr. Banks said. \u201cIn any job that\u2019s she ever had, she\u2019s had a mind like a computer.\u201d\n\nDebating \u2018SwishPoints\u2019\n\nIn the hackathon\u2019s deliberation chamber, Ms. Grossman did not seem as enthralled with SwishPoints as her fellow judges: \u201cI just question \u2014 really, how much utilization is that really going to get? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the mom, and you do it \u2014 the big thing you want to do is now be swishing?\u201d\n\nThe executives huddled in heated discussion for a few minutes, and then filed out so that Ms. Grossman could announce the results. Third prize went to a team that had figured out how to livestream Weight Watchers meetings to users who couldn\u2019t show up in person. Second was G1\u2019s menu scanner. First place was a tie between two of the teams.\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s a big opportunity if The Incredibles and Swishpoints had a baby, seriously,\u201d Ms. Grossman said with a broad smile, and thanked out-of-towners for making the trip.\n\n\u201cAs much as we believe in technology,\u201d she said, \u201chaving people together is also pretty fabulous.\u201d\n\nAnd it was time for a beer at the happy hour \u2014 two to six SmartPoints, depending.", "title": "Weight Watchers Gets Its Own Makeover", "authors": ["Alexandra Jacobs"]}
{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Taking Action on Segregation\n\nA 2014 report found that New York City has one of the most segregated school systems in the country. Nearly 70 percent of students are black and Latino, and they overwhelmingly go to school in racially isolated classrooms, with few white and Asian children. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Fari\u00f1a have repeatedly blamed the city\u2019s segregated neighborhoods and have suggested there is little they can do. Even after facing intense public pressure, they have taken only modest steps, such as setting aside seats in some schools for low-income students. When the mayor released what had been billed as a \u201cbigger vision\u201d for integrating schools, he resisted even using the word \u201csegregated.\u201d\n\nA high-profile example of the problem is the lack of black and Latino students at the eight specialized high schools where admission is decided by a single test. This spring, only 10 percent of offers at these schools went to black and Latino students. When Mr. de Blasio was running for mayor in 2013, he pledged to diversify these schools, but more recently he has suggested that his hands are tied and that any change must come from the state.\n\nWhat to Do About Renewal\n\nMr. de Blasio came into office pledging to lift up low-performing schools, rather than close them, as his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had done. But his $582 million Renewal initiative, which flooded 94 schools with resources while subjecting them to sometimes contradictory directives, has produced disappointing results. This year, the city proposed closing eight of the schools \u2014 the largest number it had ever closed in one year \u2014 drawing protests from parents and elected officials.\n\nMr. Carranza will have to decide whether to continue the initiative, whose future looks cloudy; the official who led the effort was recently moved aside, and no successor has been named. Fifty schools are expected to remain in the program next year. Another challenge: The city\u2019s Education Department has said that, to replace some of the schools it is closing, it will open eight new schools in the fall, something that this administration has little experience doing.\n\nClosing the Achievement Gap\n\nThough the city has made real progress on increasing overall graduation rates, the academic divides between different groups of students are yawning. Citywide, the graduation rate last year was 87.5 percent for Asian students and 83.2 percent for white students. For black students, the rate was 70 percent and for Hispanic students, 68.3 percent. Just 32.5 percent of students still learning English graduated.", "title": "Welcome to New York, and Here\u2019s a To-Do List", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.\n\nThe scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\n\nGiven that the misconduct of the bank\u2019s sales force mostly took place in the lower ranks and did not lead to large immediate losses, it was hard for outsiders to detect the misdeeds. Regulators eventually acted when evidence of the misconduct trickled out. The $1 billion penalty brings some closure. But the lingering lesson of the Wells Fargo scandal is that abuses can go on for a long time at large, hard-to-police banking institutions.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nCritics\u2019 corner\n\nThe NYT\u2019s James Stewart has been \u201ca harsh critic of Wells Fargo\u2019s previous management for fostering a culture of rule-breaking and customer abuse, and for marginalizing as disloyal and even firing anyone at the bank with the courage and integrity to try to stop the illegal practices.\u201d But with the new fine, he writes: \u201cEven I have to wonder: Has Wells Fargo been punished enough?\u201d\n\nA Russia-focused V.C. firm opens in the U.S. with $200 million\n\nNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.\n\nBut Fort Ross Ventures is making a go of it.\n\nThe firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.\n\nVictor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201d\n\nCracking the Russian market can be difficult, Mr. Orlovski said, with that country\u2019s culture differing significantly from that in the U.S. or western Europe. Uber (which Mr. Orlovski said his firm is a small investor in) folded its Russian operations into a joint venture with that country\u2019s leading tech giant, Yandex, after finding it hard to compete there.\n\nFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.\n\nFor one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.\n\nFort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nIs the European Union bending to Trump on trade?\n\nThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.\n\nBut that outcome is looking less likely.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that the European Union is prepared to offer some concessions to avoid the steel and aluminum tariffs that the United States has threatened to impose. The European Union\u2019s exemption to the tariffs expires on May 1, which means any negotiations would have to progress quickly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)\n\nThe Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\n\nA compromise by the European Union would also suggest that the United States\u2019 large trade deficits are an advantage in its trade battles. Last year, the European Union exported $151 billion more to the United States than it imported from the U.S. If the United States raised barriers to the bloc\u2019s exports, it\u2019s economies, particularly that of Germany, with which the United States last year had a $64 billion deficit, could suffer.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nAllergan and Takeda each weigh a takeover of Shire\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.\n\nLater on Thursday, Allergan decided to drop its pursuit.\n\nStill the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.\n\nFor Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.\n\nBut Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)\n\nTakeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTakeda said in a statement that on April 12 it had informally offered \u00a346.50, or about $66, a share for Shire, made up of both cash and newly issued shares. That represented a roughly 30 percent premium to where the target company\u2019s shares had closed on the prior day.\n\nUnder the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.\n\nShire said in its own press release that Takeda had bid three times, culminating in last week\u2019s offer. But the Irish company rejected each offer as too low.\n\nTakeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.\n\nYet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.\n\nUnder British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.\n\nAdvising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nGE\u2019s digital pivot\n\nNo old-line company embraced the digital wave with more gusto than General Electric. The industrial giant spent billions, hired thousands of software engineers, and even created image-morphing television ads to recast itself as \u201ca digital-industrial company,\u201d writes the NYT\u2019s Steve Lohr.\n\nToday, there are no such ambitions. The spending at GE Digital is being slashed, amid layoffs and sharply narrowed aims at G.E. under John Flannery, who became chief executive last August.\n\nFrom Mr. Lohr:\n\nThe rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology. No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.\n\nFearless Girl\u2019 is being moved and Wall Street bull go with her\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\n\nJ.

The bank said the policies could have contributed to about 27,000 customers having their cars repossessed after defaulting on their loans.\n\nCompliance: In 2011, the currency comptroller\u2019s office said, the bank \u201cfailed to implement and maintain a compliance risk management program commensurate\u201d with its size and complexity.\n\nTaking Steps to Atone\n\nWells Fargo agreed to submit plans to regulators detailing how it plans to strengthen its compliance and risk-management programs and \u201cremediation efforts\u201d for customers.\n\nThe consumer bureau said at least 50,000 customers would probably \u201crequire remediation\u201d and that the total to be repaid would exceed $10 million. Wells Fargo said the settlement would result in the $5.9 billion in first-quarter profits it reported last week being reduced by $800 million.\n\nLatest in a Series of Penalties\n\nUnder the deal announced on Friday, Wells Fargo will effectively pay $500 million to each regulator. The consumer bureau said it was imposing a $1 billion penalty but was deducting from that the amount that Wells Fargo was paying to the currency comptroller\u2019s office.", "title": "Wells Fargo Pays $1 Billion to Federal Regulators", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "But at the same time, according to several administration officials, Mr. Mulvaney has been eager to ensure that the bureau fulfilled the president\u2019s commitment to go after Wells Fargo. In conversations with colleagues in the Trump administration, Mr. Mulvaney has emphasized his role in orchestrating the $1 billion fine.\n\nLast week, after Reuters reported the possibility of the $1 billion penalty, Mr. Mulvaney accused his staff at the consumer bureau of leaking \u201cconfidential\u201d details about the settlement talks. Just hours after testifying before Congress, Mr. Mulvaney sent a memo to staff saying he had instructed the bureau\u2019s inspector general to look into leaks by employees.\n\n\u201cI am extraordinarily concerned that some of these leaks might have come from bureau employees,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI recognize that there may well be some (a few? a lot?) of people who work here who aren\u2019t happy that I\u2019m working here. That\u2019s fine. I also recognize that these folks might be interested in undermining my leadership here, or in quite simply looking to make me look bad.\u201d\n\nThe penalty against Wells Fargo is likely to help insulate Mr. Mulvaney and the Trump administration against charges from Democrats and consumer groups that they are giving a pass to big banks. But aside from the expected Wells Fargo settlement, the consumer bureau \u2014 like other financial regulators in the Trump era \u2014 has been pursuing far fewer cases against banks than under the Obama administration.\n\nThat is largely by design. Administration officials including Mr. Mulvaney have repeatedly said that overly harsh regulation has left the banking industry with less capacity to make loans to American businesses and to otherwise support a growing United States economy.\n\nThe evidence for such claims is scant. At the end of last year, federally insured banks had $9.7 trillion of loans outstanding \u2014 at or near their historical high point \u2014 even as most of the regulations erected under President Barack Obama remain intact, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nAnd the industry is extraordinarily profitable. Wells Fargo, for example, said last week that it earned $5.9 billion in the first three months of the year.

In one post, a student wrote about a boy in math class who kept asking for sexual favors: \u201cHe kept asking and he made me feel guilty for saying no. When I went to the bathroom with him he told me what to do, and when I didn\u2019t want to, he blocked my exit to the door \u2026\u201d\n\nIn Osprey, Fla., Minnah Stein, a senior at Pine View School, has been organizing documentary screenings and other programs to teach students in her school district about sexual violence and their Title IX rights, which legally protect them from discrimination on the basis of gender in educational settings. So far, about 2,500 students in her county have participated in her sexual violence prevention programs.\n\n\u201cThis is the most pressing civil rights issue of my generation,\u201d Ms. Stein, 17, said.\n\nAbusive behavior is often modeled after what kids see in the media, in adult interactions or elsewhere in their environment, said Elizabeth Jeglic, a licensed clinical psychologist specializing in sexual violence prevention and a psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Sexual harassment and bullying can lead to even more abusive behavior if it\u2019s not stopped early on, she says, causing a ripple effect as generations of young people grow older.\n\nChallenges arise in part because from a very early age, research shows, children are socialized to behave according to their gender. Girls, for example, are often taught to be modest and may feel flattered when boys tease them. Boys are more likely to be taught to hold in their feelings, and to be aggressive in the pursuit of a crush and push boundaries.\n\nThis kind of gender stereotyping can become an indirect link to more problematic behaviors like sexual harassment, said Dr. Jeglic, and be harmful for kids of all ages and genders. If parents, teachers or other guardians suspect that children in their care are experiencing sexual harassment, bullying or abuse from their peers, she said, it\u2019s important to validate their experience, listen to what they have to say and help them understand what happened.", "title": "What #MeToo Means to Teenagers", "authors": []}

Residents in many cities said they were concerned that Amazon\u2019s arrival would increase the cost of living and opposed offering special incentives to attract the company.\n\nIn Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\n\nAs in other cities that have experienced such booms, the growth has led to tensions. Longtime residents, many of them African-American, have been displaced, and the city\u2019s homeless population has grown. A recent study commissioned by the mayor\u2019s office found that the city had lost 18,000 affordable housing units since 2000. That gap could grow to 31,000 units by 2025 if current trends continue \u2014 without taking Amazon into account.\n\n\u201cThere are many neighborhoods in Nashville where the fight is lost,\u201d said James Fraser, a Vanderbilt University professor who has been active in the city\u2019s affordable-housing movement.\n\nAdriane Harris, who leads housing policy for the Nashville mayor\u2019s office , said concerns about gentrification were legitimate.

However, H-1B recipients work in a variety of jobs. They can be architects, scientists, models and tattoo artists. Some are math and science teachers in rural school districts that have trouble recruiting American instructors.\n\nHow many visas are issued each year?\n\nCongress established that 65,000 H-1B visas are available each year for workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees, and 20,000 more are earmarked for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher. Universities and research organizations are exempt from the cap.\n\nWhy is there a lottery to choose petitions?\n\nIn the past several years, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has received more petitions than there are visas. If the maximum number of applications is reached during the first five business days of April, the agency holds a lottery to randomly select which petitions it will process.\n\nCan the visas lead to permanent residence?\n\nVery often they do. Companies can choose to sponsor an H-1B worker for permanent residence. The green card applications are often approved, though they can take years to be issued.\n\nWhere are most foreign workers from?\n\nIndia is the country of origin for more than 80 percent of H-1B recipients, with China a distant second. Next in line during the 2016 fiscal year were the Philippines, South Korea and Canada.\n\nDo H-1B workers compete with Americans?\n\nSupporters of the visa program say they fill a critical need for talent that is not available in the United States, especially when the economy is strong and the labor market is tight. Employers must attest that an H-1B worker will not adversely impact the wages and working conditions of American workers.\n\nCritics say that employers often hire H-1B workers for lower salaries than they would pay Americans to do the same job. They point to Americans who have been displaced when companies have outsourced areas like technology maintenance to a company that brings in H-1B workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWho\u2019s right?\n\nAs usual with immigration policy, it\u2019s complicated. More than 40,500 companies sponsored workers for H-1B visas in the 2017 fiscal year. Many employers specifically target a worker with hard-to-find expertise whom they wish to hire to do specialized work \u2014 obviously because they could not find someone in the United States to do the job. In many cases, H-1B workers have gone on to create start-ups and develop cutting-edge technology that keeps America competitive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

About 20 companies accounted for 32 percent of approved H-1B petitions, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. Many of the employers are global outsourcing companies from India that supply entry-level workers to retailers, insurance companies and banks. Not all. Among them are also American firms who appear to be using the program to create a pool of cheap labor.\n\n\u201cBig household-name American companies are just as culpable as the outsourcing companies of abusing the program,\u201d said Norman Matloff, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the H-1B program.\n\nSo there has been some misuse?\n\nAlmost everybody agrees that there has, though it is probably not as widespread as critics claim. Abuses rarely result in penalties for the companies, experts say. In one highly publicized case in 2015, some Disney employees said they were told to train their foreign replacements if they wanted severance payments.

In April 2017, he signed a \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order, which has served to justify several recent changes.\n\nFor one thing, United States Citizen and Immigration Services, the federal agency that reviews the petitions, has tightened its oversight.

Now, it is requiring more details about what work will be performed, why a foreigner is needed to do it, and what wages are being paid.\n\nWhat more does the administration plan to do?\n\nThe administration says it will end an Obama-era program that has allowed spouses of H-1B visa holders to work, as long as they had been approved and were waiting for a green card. Those work permits have been issued under a program known as H-4EAD.\n\nFederal authorities have also suggested they may change the selection process for H-1B visas to ensure that they are granted to the \u201cmost skilled or highest-paid\u201d job candidates.\n\nFinally, Trump says he would like to scrap the lottery.\n\nWhat about the role of Congress?\n\nMore sweeping changes can occur only if Congress passes new laws or overhauls the immigration system.

According to a recent report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, at least 18 state legislatures are preparing bills to legalize and regulate sports gambling. That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject. In 1992, a federal law banned sports betting in most of the country. A Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll showed that a majority of Americans disapproved of legalization. This reflected long-held concerns, not only in regard to the activity itself but also to the dangers it posed to the integrity of our games. High-profile gambling scandals \u2014 ranging from the 1919 Black Sox fixing of the World Series to revelations that the baseball legend Pete Rose bet on games in which he participated \u2014 confirmed for many people that sports and betting were not a good match. By 2014, however, polls began to show that a majority of Americans had begun to rethink their skepticism. What changed in the intervening years? A lot, including the introduction of the internet \u2014 which for a period made online gambling (especially poker) easily accessible without bringing down the Republic.

But French teachers don\u2019t always encourage open discussion. Instead, they tend to lecture students on tolerance and values, which experts say has little effect.\n\n[Read an Opinion piece by Bari Weiss on anti-Semitism and the murder of Mireille Knoll.]\n\nAnd until now, combating anti-Semitism in France has centered on the Holocaust. Students regularly tour Auschwitz and visit memorials. Sarah Gensburger, a sociologist who curated a 2012 exhibition at Paris\u2019s city hall on the thousands of Jewish children who were deported from this city and murdered between 1942 and 1944, said most visiting class groups came from two heavily immigrant districts in northern Paris. She said the students emerged profoundly shaken.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough, Dr. Gensburger said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been developing more and more programs, places, meant to transmit the memory of the Holocaust as a way to build citizenship and tolerance,\u201d she said, yet the government still counts hundreds of anti-Semitic incidents each year, and many more probably go unreported.\n\n\u201cYou can bring people to Auschwitz or wherever you want, but it will not change the everyday social networks and dynamics they live in,\u201d she said.\n\nThese dynamics can be murderous. In 2012, a 23-year-old Frenchman born to working-class Algerian immigrants walked up to a Jewish school in Toulouse and killed three children, ages 3, 6 and 8, and the father of two of them. Last year, one of the killer\u2019s brothers published a book describing the anti-Semitic climate he grew up with:\n\n\u201cIn my family, we blamed the Jew, we blamed them for everything,\u201d he wrote. Relatives would regularly say, \u201cThe Jews stole Algeria, the Jews control the world.\u201d\n\nObviously, all French Muslims don\u2019t share these views. But in the recent attacks, ambient stereotypes seemed to transform neighborhood thugs and delinquents into anti-Semitic killers.\n\nTo fight prejudice, some teachers say they\u2019ve had to supplement France\u2019s national curriculum. Samia Essabaa, who teaches high school English in a heavily immigrant area northeast of Paris, says it\u2019s essential to valorize the places where students\u2019 own families are from. On school trips to places including Morocco, she emphasizes the shared history of Jews and Muslims, like the fact that both religions ban pork, that both Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left, and that North African Jews eat couscous too.\n\nShe said that once her students know that Jews \u201cparticipated and contributed to the development of their country of origin, then we can tackle a lot of things, because it\u2019s no longer a history of the other.

Because of bends in the hair, sebum from the scalp, a natural protectant, can\u2019t travel down the length of the shaft. The bends themselves also make curly hair prone to breakage.\n\nHair loss happens in phases. Pain and little bumps around the follicle, called traction folliculitis, are the first signs that a style is too tight. Subsequent thinning, traction alopecia, can still be reversed. After that, when the follicle is put under repeated tension, it scars over and hair stops growing permanently. This is called scarring alopecia.\n\nBraids, wigs and extensions can be worn safely and are not the direct cause of hair loss. But when they put too much tension on the hair or are worn constantly, the follicles inflame and hair breaks. Women may notice hair loss but feel trapped in a cycle of wearing extensions to cover it.\n\n\u201cPatients come into my office, and they don\u2019t even want the nurses to see their hair,\u201d said Michelle Henry, a dermatologist in Manhattan who specializes in hair-loss treatments. \u201cThese styles \u2014 braids, weaves \u2014 are so a part of our culture that people think their hair loss is hereditary.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCan You Really Camouflage Balding Spots?\n\nMs. Collins started posting striking before-and-after photos on her Instagram account two years ago. When word got out, she was styling about 120 clients a week. (\u201cI was running myself into the ground,\u201d she said.) She has a lighter client load now that she has passed on her technique to the nine stylists at her salon, Razor Chic in Lithonia, Ga. Education is part of her broader mission.\n\n\u201cA lot of stylists don\u2019t know how to camouflage someone\u2019s hair,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cThat\u2019s another reason I\u2019m always teaching classes.\u201d She teaches in-person and online styling seminars, streamed through her website, razorchic.com.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Camouflaging hair loss comes down to giving each client the right haircut and color, then working with her face shape to conceal balding along the edges or at the crown (or both) with whatever hair is remaining.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer chemical straightening strategy depends on hair texture and length. If someone has medium to long hair, she won\u2019t put a full relaxer in it, \u201cbecause I want the fullness and volume,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only time I\u2019ll do a bone-straight relaxer is if I have to go very short.\u201d New clients spend around $500 for services and any maintenance products Ms. Collins recommends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to give a person a nice look so they can walk around confident enough to rock their own hair,\u201d she said.\n\nHow Do You Begin to Grow Back Your Own Hair?\n\nDr. Henry balances empathy with an urgent message about the condition. \u201cThe conversation I have with my patients is you can stop wearing these styles now and save your hair, or you can continue and end up with permanent hair loss,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause traction alopecia is caused by inflammation, Dr. Henry injects the scalp with steroids. \u201cI also make a compound with minoxidil that helps growth, a steroid and a little bit of tretinoin to help it all penetrate,\u201d she said. Platelet rich plasma therapy, in which growth factors from the patient\u2019s own blood are injected into the scalp, can stimulate hair growth, too.\n\nDr. Aguh doesn\u2019t ask her patients to go cold turkey on a hairstyle because such a regimen is too difficult to stick to. Instead, she requests smaller, consistent changes. Relaxed hair is more likely to break when it\u2019s braided, so she asks patients who are wearing extensions and also use relaxers to space out chemical treatments, for at least 12 weeks, and eventually go natural.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re really noticing a lot of thinning, you have to get a style that doesn\u2019t include your broken hair at all,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aguh also recommends essential oils including thyme, rosemary, cedar wood and peppermint to patients who aren\u2019t pregnant, aren\u2019t prone to seizures and don\u2019t have heart conditions. \u201cEssential oils are very strong so they must be diluted with inactive oils like grape seed, coconut or olive oil,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce hair loss is permanent (a dermatologist can diagnose which phase the scalp is in), transplants are the only reliable treatment.\n\n\u201cBut most people have nonscarring hair loss,\u201d Dr. Aguh said. \u201cThey have the potential to get that hair back if they make styling changes and get treatment.\u201d", "title": "What Black Women Need to Know About Hair Loss", "authors": ["Crystal Martin", "Skin Deep"]}

Instead, I watched institution after institution simply \u201cpass the trash\u201d \u2014 a term for what happens when schools let reportedly abusive faculty flee elsewhere, without alerting their new employers to the allegations against them. Teachers quietly moved from high school to high school; professors covertly transferred colleges. I watched the same dynamics play out among students when I reported on a college admissions consultant who helped expelled young men put what she called their \u201cbest spin\u201d on misconduct allegations so that they could go back to school, their new classmates none the wiser.\n\nReaders were horrified: one campus activist wrote a letter in response, describing the relief she felt when her own college assailant was expelled, how glad she was that he would not be able to harm her again. The activist concluded \u201cmy rapist is not my responsibility.\u201d A more than fair point. But then whose responsibility is he?\n\nIn 2014, I profiled some of the young men who had been kicked off campus for sexual misconduct, and found many had grown increasingly resentful and closed off to change. \u201cAt first I thought they didn\u2019t want me to participate in campus activities,\u201d one told me. \u201cThen I thought they didn\u2019t want me to graduate. Now they don\u2019t want me to have a job or be part of society. Do they want me to commit suicide? Is that what they want me to do? What is the endgame?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about these questions as #MeToo has unfolded, and especially these past few weeks as celebrities have floated the prospect of comebacks. Let me be clear: They\u2019re doing it very wrong. Mr. Rose should be donating millions of dollars to domestic violence shelters, not planning a star-studded return to TV that leverages his transgressions to boost his career.\n\nBut #MeToo is supposed to reckon with the misdeeds of all men, not just the rich and powerful. Bad men are not just on our TV screens, but in our classrooms, our workplaces, our friend circles, even our families. Where should they go if they\u2019re fired from their jobs, expelled from their schools, kicked out of their homes or shunned by their communities?\n\n#MeToo is also supposed to reflect a spectrum of coercive behavior, not just crimes that should lead to prison sentences. Bill Cosby is one thing; but many women don\u2019t want the V.P. of sales who got too handsy at the Christmas party to be banished forever, let alone go to prison. If they\u2019re faced with what looks like no other option, will women be more likely to report him, or less?\n\nThere\u2019s a reason schools and companies opt to pass the trash: It\u2019s by far the easiest option. Businesses get to say they\u2019ve protected their workers or students (and evade liability in the process). And perhaps more important, it allows them to dodge very real and difficult questions: What do we want from abusers? Under what terms should they be allowed to return to normal life? Is there a way to explore possibilities of redemption that don\u2019t put more of a burden on the people harmed in the first place?\n\nI don\u2019t have answers to those questions. What I do have is a plea to take them seriously.

Medeiros, a former senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the flux on Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. Days after accepting Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet, the president fired his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, was forced to step down.\n\nNow, Mr. Trump has entrusted the diplomacy to Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, whom he nominated to replace Mr. Tillerson and who is embroiled in a difficult Senate confirmation process. Mr. Pompeo traveled secretly to Pyongyang over Easter weekend to meet Mr. Kim, bringing along only aides from the spy agency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But much of his one-day visit was devoted to logistical issues, like the venue and date for a meeting, which is expected in late May or early June. The lack of involvement by the White House or the State Department, another official said, has limited the amount of substantive preparation for the meeting with Mr. Kim.\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s hawkish successor, John R. Bolton, is another wild card. Two weeks before he was recruited as national security adviser, he said a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was useful only because it would inevitably fail, and then the United States could move swiftly on to the next phase \u2014 presumably a military confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt could be a long and unproductive meeting, or it could be a short and unproductive meeting,\u201d he said on Fox News.\n\nSince entering the White House, however, Mr. Bolton has stuck to a traditional definition of his job, brokering proposals to present to Mr. Trump, officials said. Even among officials who worry about war, there is sympathy for his view that \u201cfailing quickly\u201d would be valuable. The United States, they said, should flush out Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions before he has another six months or a year to master intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s presence has also not stopped Mr. Trump from praising Mr. Kim and voicing optimism \u2014 even excitement \u2014 about their looming encounter. On Friday, he tweeted, \u201cNorth Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World \u2014 big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration viewed Mr. Kim\u2019s statement about halting nuclear tests as more intriguing than his acceptance of a continuing American troop presence because he made it to his own people. Still, they noted his unwillingness to rule out short- and medium-range missiles, which they said could divide Japan from the United States.\n\nOfficials also acknowledged the challenge of staying in sync with Mr. Moon, who is acting as a mediator between the United States and North Korea and who is deeply invested in ending years of estrangement between the North and South.\n\nMr. Moon contends that it would not be difficult to broker a \u201cbroad\u201d agreement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in which North Korea commits to giving up its arsenal and the United States makes security guarantees, including a peace treaty and normalized ties, and offers aid that Mr. Kim needs to rebuild his economy.\n\nSouth Korea envisions a sequential process, starting with an agreement to freeze North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and ending with total denuclearization. The North, officials said, will insist that for each step it takes, the United States offer reciprocal incentives.\n\nSuch an approach is not new: The George W. Bush administration tried it with Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, in 2005. But the process could be open-ended if North Korea and the United States, mistrustful of each other, haggle each step of the way, as they did then.\n\nThe key to success, South Korean officials said, is if North Korea and the United States can agree to narrow the time span between the initial freeze, which Mr. Moon has called \u201cthe entrance,\u201d and complete denuclearization, which he calls \u201cthe exit.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean officials are banking on Mr. Kim\u2019s desperate desire to improve the economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s need for a diplomatic victory before the midterm elections in November.\n\nOnce they reach a broad deal, analysts said, Mr. Kim could move to dismantle production facilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles and allow access to nuclear sites in the North; the two leaders could exchange liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington; and Mr. Trump could ease sanctions, especially those that affect ordinary North Koreans.\n\nLike their American counterparts, South Korean officials do not believe that Mr. Kim will swiftly relinquish his nuclear weapons. But there is a growing belief in Seoul that he might ultimately bargain them away, if it helps him rebuild the economy. That is why some in South Korea viewed his announcement on testing as a hopeful sign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt means that North Korea is willing to give up an ICBM capability that threatens the United States,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. \u201cThis is why it is good news for the Trump administration.\u201d", "title": "What Does Kim Jong-un Want?

Prince Mohammad appears determined to intensify the rivalry with Iran as he continues to raise Riyadh\u2019s concerns over Iranian expansion in the Arab world and beyond.\n\nThe roots for perpetuating this conflict lie in the domestic context.

Now everyone who buys or uses or even just cares about a product or service has been collectively upgraded to something more ephemeral, almost spiritual, a loose association of souls brought together in one churchlike congregation: a \u201ccommunity.\u201d\n\nImagining such groups as little virtual villages is an old tech clich\u00e9, an echo from the days when the agglomerations of people on the internet were smaller, more like-minded and manageable. It\u2019s still how Facebook describes its more than two billion users, stretching the notion of \u201ccommunity\u201d thin enough to cover over a quarter of the earth\u2019s population. This is the scale of the demographic Mark Zuckerberg has now spent so much time reminding us \u2014 and, over two days of testimony in Washington, our congressional representatives \u2014 that he feels very, very sorry to have disappointed. As he told Recode last month, he is sorry that the company \u201clet the community down.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d is derived from the Anglo-Norman and Middle French communit\u00e9, meaning, primarily, \u201cjoint ownership.\u201d A community, at least in theory, is a site of collective decision-making; it is maintained by the people who built it, for their own benefit. It monitors itself and invests in its own health. It rewards participation with a real stake in the common good. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that community tends to strike us as a positive thing; the Welsh Marxist theorist Raymond Williams once wrote that the word\u2019s most salient attribute was that it \u201cseems never to be used unfavorably.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an association that still lingers between a \u201ccommunity\u201d and a physical location \u2014 the idyllic small town, say, or the utopian village, real or imagined. It evokes a cozy, friendly, simple place in which people live in easy harmony and cooperation, each with a role to play, each mattering to the whole.\n\nBut the countless, ever-multiplying communities of today are something different: not collections of humans functioning in unison but random assortments of people who do the same things, like the same things, hate the same things or believe the same things. Life online is absolutely full of communities. There are fan communities, hobbyist communities, communities for users or enthusiasts of every consumer product imaginable. Every interest, every circumstance and point of identification, it seems, benefits by gathering under this feel-good umbrella word, which instantly puts a friendly gloss on every activity. People who interact are a community. People who don\u2019t interact but share some quality or belief become a community. People who are lumped into communities by other communities are communities. \u201cCommunity\u201d makes everything sound better. It makes \u201cthe activist community\u201d sound approachable; it makes \u201cthe skin-care community\u201d sound important; it makes \u201cthe Christian community\u201d sound inclusive and kind; it makes \u201cthe medical community\u201d sound folksy and skilled at the bedside; it makes \u201cthe homeless community\u201d sound voluntary; it makes \u201cthe gun rights community\u201d sound humanistic; it makes \u201cthe tech community\u201d sound like good citizens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tech community, of course, is partly responsible for this explosion.

They invite members to \u201cparticipate,\u201d but not, in the end, to make decisions together; the largest rewards, and the greatest powers, stay private.

(The student was naked in public and apparently behaving erratically.)\n\nMuch of the recent conversation about police violence in the United States has focused \u2014 quite rightly \u2014 on concerns about racism and the flagrant abuse of power. But even when law enforcement seems to be acting in good faith, there is a concern about escalation. According to a recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum, American police academies put too much emphasis on weapons, tactics and legal statutes and not enough on psychology and communication. How can police officers be better trained to remain calm and defuse tense situations?\n\nAn unexpected model comes from the field of health care, a profession that has found ways to address the incidence of violence in encounters with those it aims to serve. Hospital workers often come into contact with volatile people: agitated drug users, panic-stricken accident victims, the hysterical parents of sick or injured children and so on. Those workers report nonfatal violence-related injuries at many times the rates of members of other occupations, including law enforcement (though police officers have higher rates of fatalities).\n\nBecause health care professionals are not permitted to attack, shoot or otherwise harm patients, they have been forced to develop techniques for de-escalating potentially violent situations. In 1991, for example, Massachusetts General Hospital hired the security expert Bonnie S. Michelman to revamp its security programs. Ms. Michelman made infrastructure changes like installing closed-circuit TV and silent alarms. More important, she started teaching a de-escalation course to hospital staff members, showing them how to detect early signs of agitation and pre-empt aggression.

Mr. Zuckerberg, the authoritarian leader of this \u201ccountry,\u201d is a compelling character in his own right, and watching him answer Congress\u2019s questions about Facebook\u2019s inner workings was deeply revealing. (If occasionally frustrating \u2014 such as when tech-challenged senators asked him basic questions about how computers work, which at times created the sensation of watching a very long Genius Bar appointment.)\n\nMy own Facebook feed is a total mess \u2014 I wrote a column last year about joining more than 100 Facebook groups, and permanently throwing off Facebook\u2019s idea of who I am as a result. I imagine that the algorithms saw me joining groups like \u201cFlat Earth Believers\u201d and \u201cQuilting For Beginners,\u201d along with lots of pro-Trump and anti-Trump groups, and just gave up on targeting me.\n\nBut as I sat in the halls of Congress, watching Mr. Zuckerberg testify in front of dozens of angry lawmakers, I logged on to Facebook, and right at the top of my feed was one of those \u201c10 years ago\u201d memory posts, with a throwback photo from my college years. It was a bracing reminder of how simple and harmless Facebook used to seem, back when I wrote that English paper, and how much has changed since.", "title": "What It\u2019s Like Watching Mark Zuckerberg Get Grilled by Congress", "authors": []}

A volcano is an unlikely explanation for the mysterious red storm observed on the surface of Jupiter since the early 19th century. The planet has been found to be mostly gas, lacking a defined crust to rupture in an Earth-style volcanic eruption that would release hot materials from the interior of the planet.\n\nThe spot remains a mystery, and it is not even certain that the storm reported by scientists in 1831 is the same one seen now. The exact nature of the chemical reactions that produce its red-orange color is also not known.\n\nThe latest observations by the Juno spacecraft, combined with historical records, show significant changes in the size, shape and motion of the Great Red Spot. It has shrunk in diameter in recent decades, NASA scientists reported in 2017 in Astronomical Journal, but has increased in height and depth, with its hot, swirling gases reaching at least 200 miles below the surface. The spot has recently started to drift westward at a faster rate than ever before.\n\nIt has also become brighter, and its color has become more intensely orange since 2014, possibly because it is exposed to more ultraviolet radiation at higher altitudes.", "title": "What Lies Beneath Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "In 1991 the Hallmark greeting card company, based in Kansas City, Mo., decided it was time to get serious about diversity. America was changing, as was Hallmark\u2019s work force, and while the brand had dabbled in cards for black consumers since the 1960s, it didn\u2019t have a perennial line that addressed them directly.\n\nOver the years, businesses of all kinds have had to acknowledge blind spots for racial exclusion, including \u201cflesh-colored\u201d crayons mixed and melted in dusty peach shades to cosmetics lines that offer few to zero options for dark complexions. Hallmark realized that speaking authentically to black people would require a slight shift in its traditional tone and direction. And so, 81 years after its founding, the company created Mahogany, its first year-round imprint dedicated to cards for the African-American community.\n\nWhat makes a greeting card black? According to Dierdra Zollar, the editorial director for the Mahogany brand studio, sometimes it\u2019s explicit, like a Father\u2019s Day card bearing the silhouette of an African-American man, or a card touting \u201cblack love\u201d for romantic occasions. Others, however, are more subtle.\n\nMrs. Zollar said that a black customer browsing the greeting card aisle at a CVS may notice on a Mahogany card \u201cfamiliar expressions,\u201d terms or phrases that hint at a shared history. \u201cI see these cultural signifiers that let me know you\u2019ve been to my house, you\u2019ve been in my neighborhood, you\u2019ve participated in some of these church affairs, you have that insider knowledge that really speaks to being known,\u201d she said.\n\nI saw it for myself while browsing cards for mothers on Hallmark\u2019s website on a recent afternoon. The 543 options covered a lot of what someone might want to say to a mother \u2014 barring more extreme cases of familial dysfunction \u2014 from a \u201cThank You for Your Love on Rosh Hashana\u201d card to one whose cover featured a drawing of an androgynous figure farting out Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence formula. The inside read: \u201cHappy Birthday from your smartass kid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut many of the Mahogany cards did indeed stand out from the rest. They addressed their intended recipients as \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cAuntie,\u201d and their covers said things like, \u201cBaby, your love game is tight.\u201d I found that if the inside of a card mentioned \u201cstrength\u201d or \u201cdignity\u201d in the face of obstacles, it was often a Mahogany product. One Mother\u2019s Day offering read, \u201cThere is something deep within black women that allows them to stand strong, carry on, and make it over \u2014 with their dignity, class, and courage intact \u2014 no matter what challenges they have to face in life.\u201d", "title": "What Makes a Greeting Card Black?", "authors": ["Cord Jefferson"]}
{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "When Mark Zuckerberg appears Tuesday afternoon before members of two Senate committees, it will be the culmination of a Facebook public relations blitz in the face of a series of controversies that have tarnished the reputation of the world\u2019s largest social network.\n\nBeginning late last month, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s 33-year-old founder and chief executive, suddenly granted interviews to The New York Times, Vox, Recode, Reuters and other news outlets before a conference call with dozens of reporters last week. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, has been on her own, more limited apology tour, mainly on television. The company has also moved aggressively to announce changes to its rules, introduce a social media research initiative and promise additional disclosures to try to get ahead of congressional demands and possible regulation.\n\nIt will be the first appearance before Congress for Mr. Zuckerberg, who looks only slightly older than during his giddy first television appearance in 2004 to explain the unexpected growth of the college service he called \u201cThe Facebook.\u201d The company he built into a global behemoth, with more than two billion users, now faces the most intense scrutiny of its 14-year history. Here are the major issues he is likely to be asked to address:\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe New York Times, The Observer and The Guardian reported last month that Facebook data, including private information, of more than 50 million users had been given without their permission to a company, Cambridge Analytica, that had consulted for Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and for other political candidates. Since then, Facebook has updated that number, saying that as many as 87 million people may have been affected by the misuse of data. The social network also acknowledged additional security weaknesses, including one that it said may have allowed \u201cmalicious actors\u201d to collect the public profile information on \u201cmost people.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s main task may be to persuade members of Congress and millions of Facebook users that their information will be safe on the platform.\n\nF.T.C. Investigation\n\nThe committees are likely to ask about a consent decree Facebook signed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011, which said it had \u201cdeceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.\u201d The F.T.C. is now investigating whether the company violated the decree, which could make it vulnerable to fines that, under the regulations, could reach an astronomical sum: up to $41,484 for each of the millions of users whose data went to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook denies that it has violated the 2011 decree.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussian chicanery\n\nFacebook has taken heat for months for its slow response to Russia\u2019s hijacking of its platform to influence the 2016 presidential election. Russian military intelligence created profiles of fake Americans to promote emails stolen from Democrats by Russian hackers, and a so-called troll factory in St. Petersburg created pages to denigrate Hillary Clinton, promote Mr. Trump and post inflammatory messages on immigration, race, guns and other topics. It took Facebook until September 2017, 10 months after the election, to go public with its first findings on the Russian meddling, which it says appeared in the news feeds of 126 million customers \u2014 equal to nearly half the adult population of the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nFake news\n\nMr. Zuckerberg got off to a clumsy start when, two days after the election, he said it was \u201cpretty crazy\u201d to believe that the \u201csmall amount\u201d of false news spread on Facebook might have influenced the outcome. Since then, the company has taken a number of steps to increase the reliability of information on its platform, though the moves have garnered mixed reviews. The underlying problem, studies show, is that false, sensational stories spread faster through social media than factual stories do.\n\nPolitical bias and polarization\n\nRepublicans may question Mr. Zuckerberg about reports in 2016 from former Facebook employees that they had routinely suppressed articles from conservative publications. But a larger body of research suggests that Facebook, as well as other social media, tend to reinforce and intensify existing political views by creating an echo chamber of friends and like-minded users. Facebook has published its own research pushing back on that conclusion.", "title": "What Mark Zuckerberg Will Be Grilled On at the Congressional Hearings", "authors": ["Scott Shane"]}

The factories are shut down. The most recent migrants who have arrived are not from Italy\u2019s south, but other nations. And the center-right broke the left\u2019s long-unchallenged governing streak and won municipal elections last June.\n\nToday, if there is one place in Italy where the country\u2019s economic and migrant crises collide, it is in Sesto. And if there is one place to take the measure of the right\u2019s creeping anti-immigrant influence in politics and society, Sesto is that place, too.\n\nNationally, since Italy\u2019s inconclusive elections last month, political leaders have struggled to form a government, but there remains a good chance that the Five Star Movement, with a subtle Italians-first message, and the anti-immigrant, right-wing League could be a part of it.", "title": "What May Life in Italy Be Like Under the Right?

{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.\n\nBut the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.\n\nOne way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)\n\nIncreasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.\n\nHow does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)\n\nAt Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.\n\nThere are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nAlphabet slips after earnings.\n\nStrong advertising sales during the first quarter helped Google-parent Alphabet beat analysts expectations.

He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.\n\nMr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\n\nSears has already sold some assets, closed hundreds of stores and laid off workers across the country as offset falling sales. The company sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker for $775 million last year.\n\n\u2014 Michael Corkery\n\nPhoto\n\nNot so fast on that Shazam deal\n\nThe European Commission said Monday that it has opened an in-depth investigation into Apple\u2019s acquisition of Shazam, the maker of an app that identifies songs after listening to just a few seconds of them.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.\n\nApple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.\n\nPhoto\n\nBehind the bidding for India\u2019s e-commerce leader\n\nThe U.S. retail giant is reportedly close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, the top e-commerce company in India, at a $20 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg. Existing investors like Tiger Global Management and SoftBank have agreed to sell substantial portions of their shares, giving Walmart a stake of 60 percent to 80 percent.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don\u2019t expect Amazon, Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival, to give up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMove over, Spotify: Tencent Music reportedly plans to interview potential underwriters for a U.S. I.P.O., with a valuation exceeding $25 billion, according to WSJ.

What do you wonder?\n\nIn \u201cKendrick Lamar Wins Pulitzer in \u2018Big Moment for Hip-Hop\u2019,\u201d Joe Coscarelli writes:\n\nIn late January, the Compton, Calif., rapper Kendrick Lamar lost the Grammy Award for album of the year to Bruno Mars. \u201cDAMN.,\u201d Mr. Lamar\u2019s fourth LP, was his third straight to be nominated but ultimately fall short of the trophy, considered by most to be the top prize in popular music. But perhaps not anymore. On Monday, Mr. Lamar\u2019s \u201cDAMN.\u201d took home an even more elusive honor, one that may never have even seemed within reach: the Pulitzer Prize for music. Mr. Lamar is not only the first rapper to win the award since the Pulitzers expanded to music in 1943, but he is also the first winner who is not a classical or jazz musician. \u201cThe time was right,\u201d Dana Canedy, the administrator of the prizes, said in an interview after the winners were announced. \u201cWe are very proud of this selection. It means that the jury and the board judging system worked as it\u2019s supposed to \u2014 the best work was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.\u201d She added: \u201cIt shines a light on hip-hop in a completely different way. This is a big moment for hip-hop music and a big moment for the Pulitzers.\u201d Mr. Lamar was not immediately available to comment on his win. But Terrence Henderson, the record executive known as Punch from Mr. Lamar\u2019s label, Top Dawg Entertainment, acknowledged the achievement on Twitter, writing that from now on, no one should \u201cspeak with anything less than respect in your mouth for Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Ms. Canedy said the board\u2019s decision to award Mr. Lamar, 30, was unanimous.

Can you give any examples to support your opinion?\n\n\u2014 Do you think this is a \u201cbig moment for hip-hop\u201d? Is it an important moment for the Pulitzers as well?

Credit Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\n\n11:00 a.m.\n\nAnn Magnuson, actress and performance artist\n\nMy days changed depending on what show I was putting on, what sort of rehearsal schedule I had and how late I\u2019d been up the night before, though I had a rule for myself: Always be back before sunrise. My primary motive back then was to put on a show, and anything that slowed me down from that had to be curtailed. By 1981, I was no longer the manager at [the East Village performance space] Club 57, but I still helped out and performed there a lot. The Ladies Auxiliary of the Lower East Side \u2014 sort of a punk rock version of my mother\u2019s Junior League group, which I started with some other girls from the East Village \u2014 hosted several events at the club. We had a prom, a debutante ball, a ladies\u2019 wrestling night. In 1981, I suggested a bacchanal \u2014 a night of pagan merriment as spring was coming. So in April we held the Rites of Spring Fertility Bacchanal. We made an altar to a llama, and everyone dressed in kind of Greco-Roman outfits \u2014 I wore a toga with sequins. Wendy Wild made magic mushroom punch. We also created a percussive orchestra that was all pots and pans and a lot of racket, and that was the debut of the band Pulsallama. It was really like a combination of living theater and installation art, very communal. That\u2019s what happened at Club 57 a lot: We told people, \u201cThis is the theme. Come be a part of it.\u201d The doors would open and things would get going by 10, and by midnight it would be raging. In the mornings, usually around 11 a.m., I\u2019d go to one of the coffee shops around the corner on Avenue A. Odessa was one, and Leshko\u2019s was the other. People divided themselves into camps based on which one they favored \u2014 I liked Odessa better, but I\u2019d go to both. That\u2019s where you\u2019d run into people, share breakfast.\n\nJennifer Beals, actress\n\nWhen \u201cFlashdance\u201d came out in 1983, Paramount put me up in the Carlyle Hotel to do promotion. It was an incredible contrast from the last time I had lived in New York, when I was 17, during the summer of 1981, in a $500-a-month sublet loft that my boyfriend and I had found paging through our bible, the call to another life \u2014 The Village Voice \u2014 in his basement in Evanston. I remember I was drawn to the ad for the loft because it was in a place that sounded like \u201ctrifecta\u201d; my father had taken me to the track, so that seemed comforting and familiar. (What a loft was, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure.) Being at the Carlyle was amazing, but I was still an undergrad at Yale at the time, and the whole thing felt unreal, as though I was living two lives. One day, I was walking uptown to an appointment just before noon, and coming toward me was Robert Duvall. He recognized me and stopped to congratulate me on the film. It was crazy. He said he was going to lunch with some friends, and did I want to join? I couldn\u2019t, but I did turn around and walk with him for some blocks to the restaurant. It was a brilliantly sunny day, and standing outside was Dustin Hoffman. Bob introduced us, and Dustin congratulated me on the film and told me my acting was \u201cnaturalistic.\u201d It dawned on me that there are so many different styles of acting and you don\u2019t have to adhere to just one. I was 19. I didn\u2019t know anything. That completely opened my mind.\n\nImage The painter David Salle in his Manhattan studio, 1983. Credit Thomas Hoepker/Magnum Photos\n\n12:00 p.m.\n\nDavid Salle, artist\n\nThe election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 is sometimes used as a marker of the beginning of the end of the art world as it was then known, as if the two were somehow related, as if an election ushered in some new aesthetic permission, a new vulgarity, which is really a kind of negative magical thinking. I doubt if many artists experienced it that way. Everyone I knew hated Reagan and couldn\u2019t wait for him to get out of office. I remember being in someone\u2019s loft \u2014 it might have been [artist] Brian Hunt\u2019s \u2014 with a group of friends, watching the inauguration on a little black-and-white television. The silence, as they say, was deafening. No one could believe that this B-actor was about to occupy the White House.\n\nSamuel R. Delany, writer\n\nI got up at anywhere from 3 to 5 in the morning and worked as long as I could. I worked in my office at home, an eight-room walk-up on the Upper West Side. It was a very different kind of neighborhood from the one I grew up in in Harlem \u2014 just starting to be gentrified. The apartment was big, but the hall was in very bad repair, or at least looked it. \u201cMom says that your apartment looks like a crack den,\u201d my daughter told me once. A \u201ccrack den\u201d lined with books.\n\nAt 11 to 12, I\u2019d had a nine-hour day. I would walk around the neighborhood, go down to 42nd Street and do a lot of movie cruising. I\u2019d go for two, three, four hours and have a fairly good time. There was a theater called the Capri that I went to a lot. There were others: the Venus, and down in the 14th Street area, the Variety Photoplays, a Spanish one called The Jefferson, The Metropol [Metropolitan]. Some of them were open 24 hours a day, or they were closed maybe four hours a day for cleaning. They were relatively small, rundown theaters; they tended to have a fair amount of drug use going on. A lot of it was crack. Before that it had been pot. These places were used largely by working-class men, white, black and Latino, people who thought of themselves as straight and gay, many of whom were amenable to sexual things. They could be stimulated by the heterosexual pornography that was on the screen. This kind of activity is highly socially ordered: You don\u2019t barge in on other people, that\u2019s all part of it. I tended to feel particularly safe in the theaters. AIDS was a very strange situation; starting in \u201982 you knew very little about it, and then a few years later you suddenly realized it was the largest killer among your personal friends. It cut down a great number of the people who were out there doing it, but at the same time, the ones who were left were much more intense about it. You weren\u2019t afraid of getting it, you were wondering when are the symptoms going to show up.\n\n1:00 p.m.\n\nDebbie Allen, actress\n\nI held auditions for \u201cFame,\u201d the TV show, on a Sunday at the New York School of Ballet because that\u2019s where I trained, and Mr. Thomas [ballet dancer Richard Scott Thomas] was happy to give me a studio. I had been starring on Broadway in \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d and I had done the movie \u201cRagtime,\u201d which was also coming out, but dance has always been my heartbeat. So when they talked to me about playing the character Lydia Grant, the dance teacher, I said, \u201cYes, I would be so interested if I could also be responsible for the choreography.\u201d Because by this time, I had been developing as a choreographer, working with the Henry Street Playhouse and the New York Shakespeare Festival, and I really loved doing it. And they said, \u201cYeah, you can have that\u201d \u2014 they weren\u2019t even thinking about it. They paid me like a tenth of what they paid me to do the acting, and it became my whole life. We were shooting the pilot, and I was trying to find the best dancers I could. They were supposed to be 17 or 18. Some of them were lying about their age and I knew it, but I didn\u2019t care. I said, \u201cTo hell with it!\u201d Jasmine Guy auditioned; she wasn\u2019t of age yet. Bronwyn Thomas, she was like happy feet on her toes. She was the ultimate ballerina, and she became that on \u201cFame.\u201d I was excited that I would be able to introduce this new band of gypsies to the Hollywood scene.\n\nImage An unpublished male nude Polaroid from 1981 by photographer Tom Bianchi. Credit Tom Bianchi\n\n2:00 p.m.\n\nTom Bianchi, photographer\n\nColumbia Pictures had given me this SX-70 camera at a conference, and I started documenting life in the Fire Island Pines [an area of Long Island known as a haven for gay life], which just seemed very important to me. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, a boy like me didn\u2019t know there was a place for him in the world like that. Very quickly, I realized it had potential to be a book. Two editors at Simon & Schuster thought it was terrific, but they said, \u201cYou have to produce this yourself, and we can possibly get you a distribution deal. We can\u2019t put the money out for something this queer.\u201d Then [writer and editor] Bob Colacello saw the project and said, \u201cAndy Warhol has a three-book deal with Houghton Mifflin. He has one book but he doesn\u2019t have the next two. Maybe he could do your book under that contract.\u201d So I went to the Factory and stood at a tall table with Andy and Bob, and Andy went through the dummy. It was almost a surreal experience, because I had the feeling that this person is only vaguely here. As Andy turned the pages, he said things like \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice,\u201d \u201cOh, that could be larger,\u201d \u201cOh \u2026 \u201d At the end of it, he said, \u201cYes, I think we should do your book. I\u2019ve gotta go to something, Bob will call you.\u201d I took the elevator down to the street and I saw a phone booth and the first thought that came to my mind was, \u201cDo not call any of your friends and tell them Andy Warhol is doing your book because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s for real.\u201d And sure enough, he didn\u2019t.", "title": "What New York Was Like in the Early \u201980s \u2014 Hour by Hour", "authors": []}

It was midnight in November, and we were 30 miles off the coast of Libya, where our small ship was quickly filling with scores of terrified, freezing refugees whom we had rescued from the chilly waters.

Here\u2019s a look at the many times Mr. Hannity discussed Mr. Cohen on the program since the April 9 raid.\n\n\u2018Cohen was never part of the Trump administration\u2019\n\nHours after the news broke, Mr. Hannity opened his show by mentioning it. He immediately connected the action by federal prosecutors in New York to Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\n\u201cMueller\u2019s witch-hunt investigation is now a runaway train that is clearly careening off the tracks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe raid on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, court records show, was part of a monthslong investigation. It was overseen by the United States attorney for the Southern District. However Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, said on April 9 that the search was carried out on a referral by Mr. Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nWithout mentioning his own connection to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Hannity then told viewers that \u201cCohen was never part of the Trump administration or the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nMr. Hannity went on to compare Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and the raid on Mr. Cohen to an F.B.I. investigation in 2015 and 2016 that focused on Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of her email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou think Hillary Clinton\u2019s attorneys had their offices raided during this email investigation?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe raised the issue again later that evening, referring to it as \u201cthe double standard aspect\u201d in a conversation with the Fox News reporter Sara Carter.\n\nMichael D.

Trump President Elliott Broidy Republican donor Sean Hannity Fox News host\n\n\u2018Russia collusion has now become Stormy Daniels payment by his own lawyer\u2019\n\nIn a monologue that night, Mr. Hannity repeated his view that the raid on Mr. Cohen amounted to overreach by the F.B.I. and Mr. Mueller in particular.\n\nAt several points, he alluded to the $130,000 payment Mr. Cohen has acknowledged making to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump while he was married.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. is more than capable of tracing a Russia collusion investigation somehow to a porn star and the door of Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen,\u201d he said.\n\nLater that night, Mr. Hannity discussed the raid with Mr. Dershowitz. He opened their conversation by referring to what he saw as the expanding scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201c\u2018Russia collusion\u2019 has now become \u2018Stormy Daniels payment by his own lawyer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hannity said.\n\nAt no time did he disclose that his own name might be in Mr. Cohen\u2019s files as a client.\n\n\u2018Mueller has now basically backdoored his way into every single Trump business deal\u2019\n\nThe following evening, \u201cHannity\u201d again opened with the host decrying \u201cRobert Mueller\u2019s never-ending partisan witch hunt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis focus widened somewhat to include the impact the raid might have on Mr. Trump.\n\nBoth in the early part of his show and in a subsequent conversation with Mr. Dershowitz, he mentioned Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in the Trump Organization and his connection to Mr. Trump\u2019s business operations.\n\n\u201cMueller has now basically backdoored his way into every single Trump business deal, at least since Michael Cohen has worked with Donald Trump,\u201d he said during his opening segment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I never retained his services. I never received an invoice. I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees. I did have occasional brief conversations with Michael Cohen \u2014 he\u2019s a great attorney \u2014 about legal questions I had or I was looking for input and perspective.\u201d\n\nThe host described the relationship as \u201cminimal\u201d in response to Mr. Dershowitz\u2019s initial objection.\n\n\u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s a complex situation when you are speaking to millions of people,\u201d Mr. Dershowitz later commented.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Mr. Hannity interrupted, \u201cit was such a minor relationship in terms of it had to do with real estate and nothing political.\u201d", "title": "What Sean Hannity Has Been Saying About Michael Cohen", "authors": ["Michael Gold"]}
{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 has often been described as the worst nuclear disaster in history. But there are records of several larger and more destructive catastrophes. In \u201cThe Age of Radiance,\u201d a history of the nuclear era, Craig Nelson cites a 1957 plutonium-plant accident in the Ural Mountains that irradiated an area 14 times as large as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. There are other examples, too, but these accidents weren\u2019t publicized, because they took place in the U.S.S.R. during the secretive era before glasnost. So what makes Chernobyl history\u2019s worst? It\u2019s the fact that we all know about it.\n\nIn other words, our collective reckoning of what is or isn\u2019t a disaster entails publicity. Disasters are news because they are news.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only one who sees disaster everywhere. In every section of the newspaper, one has either just happened, is unfolding now or is about to occur. It\u2019s surprisingly common in the sports section, as in \u201cSixers avoid another near disaster with comeback\u201d \u2014 in sports, success and catastrophic failure can lie just a point or two apart. Most news disasters, though, are more literal, from the almost benign \u201cnatural disaster\u201d to the more threatening \u201cclimate disaster\u201d to the downright sinister \u201cdisaster capitalism.\u201d\n\nIn March, FEMA released a new five-year strategic plan, calling for less bureaucracy and more civilian disaster preparedness. It was soon followed by a news release from the Union for Concerned Scientists, reporting that the plan had been scrubbed of references to climate change. Citizens of the United States, according to the FEMA administrator Brock Long, needed to \u201cgo back to the old civil defense days of being ready.\u201d This advice would be echoed, two weeks later, in Rick Santorum\u2019s claim that instead of fighting for gun control, students should learn CPR: disaster preparedness as pre-emptive victim-blaming. (Santorum has since said that he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d)\n\nIf disasters must be sudden, as both of Merriam-Webster\u2019s definitions attest, must they also be surprising and unpredictable? Disasters, like accidents, are often described as \u201cwaiting to happen.\u201d The Challenger explosion has become a case study in avoidable disaster; it was known among NASA staff that one component had a high risk of failure under the unusually cold flight conditions that morning. They went ahead with the launch anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s possible all disasters are disasters waiting to happen. The word is so common that it\u2019s easy not to see its Latin roots hiding in plain sight: Dis as in negative, aster as in star. Ill starred. The etymology suggests that disasters are destined, inevitable, like a Greek tragedy. Fourteen years before the Titanic sank, the American writer Morgan Robertson published a novella called \u201cThe Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility,\u201d in which the titular ship sinks after striking an iceberg. Twelve years before that, a British journalist named W.T. Stead wrote a short story meant to serve as a warning to the public of inadequate safety measures on ocean liners. He died on the Titanic.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But the sense that a catastrophe could have been avoided through better planning only heightens our impression of the event as a disaster. Climate disasters, for instance, are now entirely expected, and we\u2019ve known for years that the worst outcomes could be avoided with immediate and drastic action. But we don\u2019t take that action. Our utter failure to respond in kind is part of the disaster.\n\nOn March 17, a BBC headline announced plans for a \u201cNorcroft Colliery memorial for \u2018unknown\u2019 mining disaster.\u201d David Hinchliffe, a former member of Parliament, was working to fund a memorial for the victims of an 1821 incident outside Barnsley, England, in which 10 workers, five men and five boys, were killed when a chain broke as they tried to ascend a mine shaft. He\u2019s the one who called it \u201can unknown disaster\u201d \u2014 \u201cwith unmarked graves, it has been forgotten.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow could a disaster be unknown? And while certainly tragic, wouldn\u2019t 10 deaths in a 19th-century mine more properly be termed an accident \u2014 one that\u2019s not particularly unexpected or urgent? But the youngest victim of the accident, John Hinchliffe, was the M.P.\u2019s great-great-grandparents\u2019 eldest son. The living Hinchliffe learned of the accident while researching his family history. That personal connection can collapse the distance from now to then: For Hinchliffe, the event could have the intensity, the immediacy, of disaster.\n\nThis is the difference between a disaster and an accident, between a school shooting and the everyday murders and suicides that add up to tens of thousands of gun deaths every year, few of them registering on the national consciousness. Disasters are public events that feel personal.\n\nIt\u2019s why people remember where they were on 9/11, and some even claim to remember watching the first plane strike on TV that morning \u2014 an impossible memory, since the only known footage of the event was captured accidentally and was not on the news that day. We don\u2019t have perfect recall for traumatic events: Studies have shown that our memories change and degrade over time, new information bleeding into them. But we see clips of disasters over and over \u2014 the tall, forked plume of the Challenger explosion, the second plane disappearing sleekly into the South Tower. Repetition gives these iconic, smoke-in-the-sky images the intimacy of memories. They confuse our personal history.\n\nThe spectacle of this media attention can be dangerous: School shootings and suicides often happen in clusters, one inspiring another. The constant horror of grim news can numb us to its significance. And while some events are turned into high-resolution dramas, others are, inevitably, ignored, too distant or abstract to make an impression.\n\nBy the end of that BBC story, readers learned that John Hinchliffe was just 8 years old when he fell about 17 stories to his death on the floor of a mine. Seeing the scale of it \u2014 the small boy and the very long fall \u2014 makes it feel more visceral, more known. This is both the power and the danger of \u201cdisaster\u201d: It lets you choose what becomes real and immediate, and what stays far away.", "title": "What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True \u2018Disaster\u2019?", "authors": ["Elisa Gabbert", "First Words"]}

They were looking to have any sex.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI met one man whose wife had implicitly consented to her husband having a lover because she was no longer interested in sex, at all. They both, to some degree, got what they needed without having to give up what they wanted. But the other husbands I met would have preferred to be having sex with their wives. For whatever reason, that wasn\u2019t happening.\n\nI know what it feels like to go off sex, and I know what it\u2019s like to want more than my partner. It\u2019s also a tall order to have sex with the same person for more years than our ancestors ever hoped to live. Then, at menopause, a woman\u2019s hormones suddenly drop and her desire can wane.\n\nAt 49, I was just about there myself, and terrified of losing my desire for sex. Men don\u2019t have this drastic change. So we have an imbalance, an elephant-size problem, so burdensome and shameful we can scarcely muster the strength to talk about it.\n\nMaybe the reason some wives aren\u2019t having sex with their husbands is because, as women age, we long for a different kind of sex. I know I did, which is what led me down this path of illicit encounters. After all, nearly as many women are initiating affairs as men.\n\nIf you read the work of Esther Perel, the author of the recently published book \u201cState of Affairs,\u201d you\u2019ll learn that, for many wives, sex outside of marriage is their way of breaking free from being the responsible spouses and mothers they have to be at home. Married sex, for them, often feels obligatory. An affair is adventure.\n\nMeanwhile, the husbands I spent time with would have been fine with obligatory sex. For them, adventure wasn\u2019t the main reason for their adultery.\n\nThe first time I saw my favorite married man pick up his pint of beer, the sleeve of his well-tailored suit pulled back from his wrist to reveal a geometric kaleidoscope of tattoos. He was cleanshaven and well mannered with a little rebel yell underneath. The night I saw the full canvas of his tattoo masterpiece, we drank prosecco, listened to \u201980s music and, yes, had sex. We also talked.\n\nI asked him: \u201cWhat if you said to your wife, \u2018Look, I love you and the kids but I need sex in my life. Can I just have the occasional fling or a casual affair?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been out of the work force for 10 years, raising our kids and trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. If I asked her that kind of question, it would kill her.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to hurt her, but you lie to her instead. Personally, I\u2019d rather know.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe I would rather know. My own marriage had not broken up over an affair so I couldn\u2019t easily put myself in her position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a lie if you don\u2019t confess the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kinder to stay silent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying I couldn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be afraid of talking honestly about my sex life with the man I\u2019m married to, and that includes being able to at least raise the subject of sex outside of marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck with that!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe go into marriage assuming we\u2019ll be monogamous,\u201d I said, \u201cbut then we get restless. We don\u2019t want to split up, but we need to feel more sexually alive. Why break up the family if we could just accept the occasional affair?\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cHow about we stop talking about it before this affair stops being fun?\u201d\n\nI never convinced any husband that he could be honest about what he was doing. But they were mostly good-natured about it, like a patient father responding to a child who keeps asking, \u201cWhy, why, why?\u201d\n\nMaybe I was being too pragmatic about issues that are loaded with guilt, resentment and fear. After all, it\u2019s far easier to talk theoretically about marriage than to navigate it. But my attitude is that if my spouse were to need something I couldn\u2019t give him, I wouldn\u2019t keep him from getting it elsewhere, as long as he did so in a way that didn\u2019t endanger our family.\n\nI suppose I would hope his needs would involve fishing trips or beers with friends. But sex is basic. Physical intimacy with other human beings is essential to our health and well-being. So how do we deny such a need to the one we care about most? If our primary relationship nourishes and stabilizes us but lacks intimacy, we shouldn\u2019t have to destroy our marriage to get that intimacy somewhere else. Should we?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI didn\u2019t have a full-on affair with the tattooed husband. We slept together maybe four times over a few years. More often we talked on the phone. I never felt possessive, just curious and happy to be in his company.\n\nAfter our second night together, though, I could tell this was about more than sex for him; he was desperate for affection. He said he wanted to be close to his wife but couldn\u2019t because they were unable to get past their fundamental disconnect: lack of sex, which led to a lack of closeness, which made sex even less likely and then turned into resentment and blame.\n\nWe all go through phases of wanting it and not wanting it. I doubt most women avoid having sex with their husbands because they lack physical desire in general; we are simply more complex sexual animals. Which is why men can get an erection from a pill but there\u2019s no way to medically induce arousal and desire in women.\n\nI am not saying the answer is non-monogamy, which can be rife with risks and unintended entanglements. I believe the answer is honesty and dialogue, no matter how frightening. Lack of sex in marriage is common, and it shouldn\u2019t lead to shame and silence. By the same token, an affair doesn\u2019t have to lead to the end of a marriage. What if an affair \u2014 or, ideally, simply the urge to have one \u2014 can be the beginning of a necessary conversation about sex and intimacy?\n\nWhat these husbands couldn\u2019t do was have the difficult discussion with their wives that would force them to tackle the issues at the root of their cheating. They tried to convince me they were being kind by keeping their affairs secret. They seemed to have convinced themselves. But deception and lying are ultimately corrosive, not kind.\n\nIn the end, I had to wonder if what these men couldn\u2019t face was something else altogether: hearing why their wives no longer wanted to have sex with them. It\u2019s much easier, after all, to set up an account on Tinder.", "title": "What Sleeping With Married Men Taught Me About Infidelity", "authors": ["Karin Jones", "Modern Love"]}

John had already booked his hotel room. \u201cStars are going to have to start falling out of the skies,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us not to be there.\u201d\n\nBy early February, Phil was averaging 23 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and six steals a game. He needed to decide about Montana Tech, but he didn\u2019t have a clear feeling. Then one day he was driving out to one of his horn-hunting spots, hoping to clear his head, when he received a text from a coach at the University of Montana. Phil called the coach right away, and the coach asked if he wanted a spot on the team. Phil pumped his fist and politely said that yes, he\u2019d like that very much. In a follow-up call with Phil\u2019s parents, the Griz offered Phil a \u201cpreferred\u201d walk-on spot, meaning he was guaranteed a place on the team but would have to pay his own way. Phil told the coach he was in. (Rachi Wortham, an assistant coach at the University of Montana, said, \u201cWe can confirm recruitment,\u201d but he declined to comment further.)\n\nAfter the call, John sat down in his leather recliner and exhaled. Becky was still partial to Tech \u2014 the school had great academics, and the free ride wouldn\u2019t hurt, given that the Malatares still had two more kids to put through high school and college. But Phil had made up his mind. He called Adam Hiatt to relay his decision, but he asked his parents not to share the news widely. He didn\u2019t want to disrupt the Warriors\u2019 playoff run.\n\nThe season came down to three weekends in late February and early March: the district championship, the divisional championship and state. By this point, Will had rediscovered his shot, and the Warriors played with devastating joy. In the last regular-season game, Phil and Will combined to score 72 points.\n\nPitts called a coach from a Montana college, gushing that Will had a 35-foot shooting range, defense that can\u2019t be taught, strong grades. The coach wanted to know about Will\u2019s family. Pitts said that Will\u2019s father was a cop and that if the coach gave him a chance, his mother would \u201chave him there tomorrow.\u201d Assuming his most authoritative sales voice, Pitts declared that Will would make it: \u201cI\u2019d stick my job on the line for him.\u201d The coach said he\u2019d think about it. Pitts hung up and shook his head.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 20, just before divisionals, word spread of a suicide: a teenage basketball player from Two Eagle River, a competing team on the Flathead reservation. Pitts was worried. \u201cThe next week or two, another kid might do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe divisional tournament was held in Hamilton, in the Bitterroot Valley, the ancestral homeland of the Salish. On the bus ride down before the first game, Pitts asked the players if they wanted to make a statement about the suicide. The boys thought it was a good idea and settled on a video as the way to do it. They decided that Phil would speak first and Will last, but when the camera rolled, Phil got nervous. One player didn\u2019t: Greg. His voice was calm and resolute. \u201cI was focused on helping these people,\u201d he later said. \u201cIt felt awesome.\u201d", "title": "What the Arlee Warriors Were Playing For", "authors": ["Abe Streep"]}

The resulting smartphone photo session drew huge attention on Instagram, prompting Buzzfeed to declare: \u201cNo Picture Matters More Than Beyonc\u00e9 And Jay-Z Posing In Front Of The Mona Lisa,\u201d and adding, \u201cIt might very well be the best picture of our generation. Or any generation.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy enough for a critic or curator to dismiss the \u201cMona Lisa experience\u201d as nothing more than selfie tourism. Yet Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, like pretty much everyone who visits the Louvre, did actually look at the painting.\n\nThe way the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is viewed is, in fact, soberingly representative of the way most art is viewed in today\u2019s saturated, digitally mediated, visual culture. How many more (or fewer) seconds do cellphone-wielding visitors spend looking at individual works at a commercial art fair or exhibition than at the Louvre? How is an artistic reputation made these days, other than through Instagram?\n\n\u201cShe is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave,\u201d the British critic Walter Pater wrote in 1873, evoking the timelessness of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d long before the advent of mass tourism, mobile phones, apps and fragmented attention spans.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pater\u2019s much-quoted description of \u201cLa Giaconda\u201d (as the painting is also known) is redolent of a culture in which a privileged few would spend hours with masterpieces to try to divine their profoundest meanings.\n\nBut mechanical \u2014 and digital \u2014 reproduction has changed things.

The disgust and the fury at the complicity of politicians, and the federal government\u2019s silence, grew into a thunderous chorus demanding that the prime minister speak up and fire the ministers backing the Hindu Ekta Manch.\n\nBelatedly reacting to popular outrage, Mr. Modi finally said: \u201cIncidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a civilized society. As a country, as a society, we all are ashamed of it.\u201d He promised justice. His vague statement delicately alluded to another case in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where a lawmaker from Mr. Modi\u2019s party is accused of rape. Mr. Modi stayed away from his party\u2019s involvement in both cases.\n\nYet instead of uniting India in horror, the incident has deepened religious, political and ethical divides. It has also made clear that there is no automatic political cost to crime or falsehood if it furthers the hegemonic political narrative. The politicians involved were sacked only after a huge public outcry. Government ministers, officials, right-leaning media and right-wing supporters have been perfectly sanguine about using the dead child to polarize society with whataboutery, fake news and wild conspiracy theories.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Modi\u2019s party, Meenakshi Lekhi, attacked opposition protests, suggesting that they were selective and opportunistic. \u201cYou see their plan,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst shout \u2018minority minority\u2019, then \u2018Dalit Dalit\u2019 and now \u2018women women\u2019 and then try to somehow fix blame of state issues on the center.\u201d An influential ex-editor tweeted that Muslim Rohingya refugees were to blame for the crime. A B.J.P. youth activist posted a comment, now deleted, on his Facebook page saying that the rape must have been fun. A pornography site reported a surge in searches for videos using the raped and murdered girl\u2019s name.\n\nThe sense of national crisis today is because Indians feel a rising urgency to either counter this ethical collapse or to capitalize on it in the run-up to the next election.\n\nMr. Modi came to power in 2014, and four years into his term, religious and cultural bigotry stands mainstreamed in Indian society.\n\nMany who voted for Mr. Modi\u2019s economic promises are disappointed by his failure to deliver, and impatient with his deliberate silences around sectarian and sexual violence and hate speech by his party colleagues and ministers. The systematic destruction of democratic institutions is hard to ignore.\n\nThe B.J.P. and its Hindu nationalist affiliates are bent on refashioning India into a country that is increasingly hostile to secular, democratic, pluralist and minority Indians.

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Unfortunately, the court\u2019s conservative majority has severely weakened the protections the law was intended to provide. The biggest blow came in a 2013 decision, Shelby County v. Holder. In that case, the five conservative justices, led by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., gutted the heart of the act, which identified several states with long histories of voting discrimination, most in the South, and required them to get federal permission before changing their voting laws. While that remedy may have been a necessary response to 1960s-era racism, the chief justice wrote, \u201cthings have changed dramatically.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, he was right: Racial discrimination in voting is no longer as blatant or systemic as it was in 1965. But the idea that the American fixation on race and power had magically evaporated in just a few decades was, at best, strikingly na\u00efve. It was also disproved within hours of the court\u2019s ruling, when Republican lawmakers in Texas and North Carolina, both states that had been covered by the Voting Rights Act, rammed through discriminatory new voting laws that they had been gunning to pass for years, including some that had been blocked under the act.\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t enough evidence that things have not, in fact, changed dramatically, the point was driven home by the election of Donald Trump in 2016, and the resurgence of overt racism and white nationalism that has followed, with no meaningful pushback from the president.\n\nIn the years before Mr. Trump\u2019s election and in the time since, Republican lawmakers around the country aggressively pushed through laws to make voting harder for certain groups, particularly minorities. Poll taxes and literacy tests have given way to voter-ID laws, cutbacks to early voting and same-day registration, polling place closings, voter-roll purges, racially discriminatory redistricting and felon disenfranchisement laws \u2014 most of which, though justified on race-neutral grounds, harm minority voters more.\n\nThey can also depress turnout, when voters who are not in fact blocked from voting become discouraged by a state apparatus that exudes hostility toward their attempts to exercise their fundamental right.\n\nAre these laws, passed almost invariably by Republican lawmakers, intentionally racist? Or are they merely taking partisan advantage of the fact that black people today vote overwhelmingly for Democrats? It shouldn\u2019t matter. Either way, black voters are targeted, their right to vote hampered.\n\nIn the past couple of years, lower federal courts \u2014 notably in Texas, Wisconsin and North Carolina, home to some of the worst voting laws in the country \u2014 have begun to recognize this. They have become more skeptical of lawmakers\u2019 rationales for passing voting restrictions and have zeroed in on the real impact of such laws on minorities and other vulnerable groups. In striking down a remarkably harsh North Carolina law in 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that lawmakers had targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nThis is an important step toward a robust judicial defense of voting rights. Now Congress must repair the damage the Supreme Court inflicted on the Voting Rights Act. The most important fix is to restore and strengthen the federal government\u2019s oversight of states and localities that continue to discriminate in voting. This would stop bad laws before they could take effect. It would also eliminate the years of delays that are part of most election-related litigation.", "title": "Opinion | What the Supreme Court Doesn\u2019t Get About Racism", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Good morning. It\u2019s full-on spring in New York at last, and there is some delicious writing about restaurants in the analog version of The Times that we delivered to our subscribers\u2019 front doors this morning. Pete Wells\u2019s accounting of the food, service and pleasures of Noma in Copenhagen leads the Food section, and Priya Krishna runs at his side, examining the success of a Hawaiian restaurant group in Utah, of all places. The combination \u2014 soft air, exciting news from away \u2014 has left a lot of us here in the shop itching to travel, same as when Mr. Mallard flies off to explore the rest of the river in \u201cMake Way for Ducklings.\u201d There\u2019s cool stuff out there.\n\nTravel often yields fruit for NYT Cooking. Kim Severson went to India last year with the chef Asha Gomez and came back with an amazing recipe for Kerala roadside chicken (above). Julia Moskin went to South Africa and returned with a super recipe for braai-spiced T-bone steaks. I learned how to make the best margarita ever on the porch of a beautiful home in the King William neighborhood of San Antonio, when I was in town to, among other things, learn how to make cabrito. Tejal Rao went to New Orleans and picked up a great recipe for grilled oysters with hot-sauce butter; it served as the ending of this marvelous love story she wrote. We really have the best jobs in the world.\n\nBut maybe you\u2019re not going to barbecue goat this evening, or chase down fresh curry leaves or Kashmiri chiles, or open oysters, or grill big steaks. Maybe you\u2019d just like a quick and elegant dinner of chicken in mustard sauce, with rice and roasted asparagus instead.\n\nPerhaps you don\u2019t want a recipe at all, but a kind of narrative prompt, a description of a meal, something to modify according to your larder and your inclinations. Like, for instance, you could roast sweet potatoes and serve them split open with sour cream and lashings of harissa, a little sprinkled mint. Those would be delicious on their own, but you could also serve them as a side dish for simply broiled lamb chops, the meat showered in salt and pepper, then blasted in the oven until crisp-skinned and rosy-hued within.", "title": "What to Cook Right Now", "authors": []}

It should take about 20 minutes to install and put everything back together if Mr. Murphy doesn\u2019t poke his head into the proceedings and set me on fire. Meantime, there\u2019s been a toaster oven and rusting patio grill to explore.\n\nSo maybe you could join me for some grilled soy-basted chicken thighs with spicy cashews (above)? You can make the dish with peanuts if the cashews seem too expensive. And then serve the meat on top of a big salad of something sturdy and green and crisp. That\u2019s a really delicious meal.\n\nOr maybe don\u2019t cook over heat at all. Follow Gabrielle Hamilton\u2019s instructions for how to make steak tartare and you\u2019ll end up with a crazily delicious open-faced dinner on thick pumpernickel bread, and life will be good. But understand something: You have to follow the recipe exactly if you really want to thrill to its excellence. Gabrielle\u2019s recipes are not wide-ranging guidelines. They are Sondheim lyrics.

Up in Shishmaref, Alaska, you might make it with caribou or musk ox. Firm tofu is an excellent substitute for beef, as are chunks of boneless, skinless chicken thigh.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI am a young professional working for a nonprofit. I\u2019ve been in the same workplace for a couple of years, and there are many things I love about it. A few months ago, however, I got a new supervisor. I\u2019ve always been receptive to constructive criticism (and have received positive performance reviews). But this supervisor never gave me positive feedback, took credit for projects I\u2019d taken the lead on, and intensely micromanaged me \u2014 even leaning over my shoulder and criticizing how I format a spreadsheet. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he suggested I quit. The stress being too much to bear, I elected to move to another job in the same organization. While the pay was lower, it would allow me to take some classes to beef up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 an ideal situation for me right now. Here\u2019s the problem. Initially, I agreed to help with minor tasks from my old department while it searched for my replacement. But it doesn\u2019t appear as though my old supervisor is actively searching. I am still under as much stress as I was working for him full time, but now I\u2019m getting less pay. How do I set boundaries and encourage management to hire a replacement without jeopardizing my new position, which accommodates my education schedule so well? ROSE\n\nWith hindsight, you have probably realized that it was a mistake to make such an open-ended offer. It would have been generous enough to suggest helping out with certain tasks for a specified period of time. That would have given your old supervisor \u2014 who doesn\u2019t seem to have done you any favors \u2014 a clearer incentive to replace you promptly.\n\nTo give him one now, proceed on two tracks. First, communicate what\u2019s going on to your current supervisor. Don\u2019t make it a huge complaint, just be matter-of-fact. You thoughtfully offered to help your old department through a transitional period for the good of the organization \u2014 but you can\u2019t keep doing two jobs forever, and you want to focus on doing the best you can in your new role. Your new manager needs to know that this is happening \u2014 and, frankly, should immediately step in to handle the matter without further discussion.\n\nBut second, you can simultaneously set some boundaries yourself.

In a planning guide on the National School Walkout\u2019s website, organizers encourage participants to hold marches, participate in voter-registration drives and set up speeches.\n\nWho is organizing it?\n\nThe idea for the National School Walkout came from Lane Murdock, a high school sophomore from Ridgefield, Conn., about 20 miles from Newtown, the site of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\n\nIn the Change.org petition that Ms. Murdock started, she cited the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February as a catalyst for the event.\n\n\u201cIt is time for teenagers to speak their minds and put their frustration into action,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Individual walkouts at schools are being organized and staged by local students.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nThe walkout\u2019s website says the event has three goals: to \u201chold elected officials accountable,\u201d to advocate \u201csolutions to gun violence\u201d and to encourage students to be more engaged in politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore specifically, the event seeks to push Congress to pass legislation to halt gun violence. Among the specific requests are bills to strengthen the background check process for gun purchases; a ban on bump stock attachments, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire like automatic weapons; and raising the minimum age to purchase assault-style weapons to 21.\n\nOrganizers are also encouraging participants to pressure state and local governments to enact similar laws. They are also seeking to increase voter registration among younger Americans in the hopes of electing candidates who support gun control.\n\nDidn\u2019t we just have a walkout?\n\nOn March 14, one month after 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting, students across the United States stepped out of their classrooms at 10 a.m. to call for stronger gun control laws.\n\nStudents left schools by the hundreds and thousands, sometimes in defiance of school administrators and school boards. In some cities, including New York, participants in the walkout then staged protests or marches.\n\nThe walkouts in March were the first major nationally coordinated action of a student-driven movement for gun control that was sparked by the Parkland shooting. Still, many students did not participate, especially in more conservative and rural parts of the country where gun control is not in wide favor.\n\nTen days later, on March 24, demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives rally, as well as at more than 800 protests held around the world to call for action against gun violence.\n\nWhy is this one different?\n\nThe walkout held last month was much briefer, scheduled to last for 17 minutes, one minute to honor each of the Parkland victims. In practice, some students continued to protest for the rest of the day. This walkout on Friday is intended to last an entire school day.\n\nThe National School Walkout also comes as attention to the Parkland shooting has faded somewhat. Despite efforts by the student-driven movement, neither Congress nor the White House has taken significant action on gun control and gun safety measures. Congress did pass a spending bill in March that included measures to provide grants for school safety and to improve reporting to the background check system for gun purchases.\n\nGun regulation advocates have seen victory in Florida, three weeks after the Parkland shooting, Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill with some of the limits that students have been urging. But some have argued the legislation did not go far enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn their website, organizers for the National School Walkout wrote that they see their event as part of a larger push to advocate gun control and that the issues they are addressing need \u201cconstant attention if we hope to change anything.\u201d", "title": "What to Expect From the National School Walkout for Gun Safety", "authors": ["Michael Gold"]}

But before you go, pack these essentials to make the most of your trip.\n\nWe\u2019ve shared packing tips for any 36-hour trip in previous lists, so we talked to Ria Misra, an editor at Wirecutter, about some of the things you might want specifically for a trip to Copenhagen. Here are her picks.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Your:\n\nCycling gear. Copenhagen is very bike-friendly, and if you plan to tour Harbor Circle by bike, you may want to bring your own helmet in case your rental place doesn\u2019t offer them. Ms. Misra suggests the sleek Giro Savant, which will take up relatively little space in your luggage. She also suggests Smartwool\u2019s Merino 150 base layers (available in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes) to wick away sweat and protect you from the sun.\n\nProtection from the rain. Curling up in a cozy sweater at one of the city\u2019s many coffee shops sounds snug \u2014 but if that sweater is sopping wet from your bike ride or walk over, that vision of hygge melts quickly. Ms. Misra suggests a packable rain jacket, such as Patagonia\u2019s Torrentshell Jacket, that will layer easily over your clothes. When you\u2019re off the bike, the small yet durable AmazonBasics Automatic Travel umbrella will keep both you and your belongings dry.\n\nSuper stylish carryall. The Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven K\u00e5nken Backpack is made of water-resistant fabric (helpful if you do get caught in the rain), it\u2019s sturdy enough to withstand plenty of wear and its simple but streamlined design will blend in neatly in the city streets.

Before you go though, pack these essentials to make the most of your trip.\n\nWe\u2019ve shared packing essentials for any 36-hour trip in previous lists, so we talked to Ria Misra, an editor at Wirecutter, about some of the things you might want specifically for a trip to Lisbon, and her thoughts on the best products to fill those needs. Here are her picks.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Your:\n\nA good camera and a travel tripod. With gorgeous hilltop views and sweeping overlooks of both the city and the sea, you\u2019ll want a great camera to capture the scene. The Olympus OM-D EM-10 Mark II delivers crisp, clear images, but also is compact enough that you can comfortably transport it around the city. A travel tripod will help you set up those shots (or just give yourself time to jump in-frame after setting a timer!)\u2014but walking up Lisbon\u2019s hilly terrain will make you glad to shed any unnecessary weight. The MeFoto Roadtrip Travel Tripod packs down comfortably small for easy carrying. Ms. Misra reminded us to secure that camera, too \u2014 especially before a hilly walk. The BlackRapid Sport Breathe was the most comfortable camera strap Wirecutter tested, and also leaves your camera easily accessible for quick snapshots while you walk around town.\n\nA sheddable, lightweight outer layer. With nighttime drinks in Lisbon\u2019s gorgeous rooftop bars and cafes, and afternoon walks by the waterfront, you\u2019ll want a layer that you can slip on easily when the wind off the water kicks up, but that disappears inconspicuously when you head into a local bar for a glass of port and today\u2019s market specials. Outdoor Research\u2019s Tantrum Hooded Jacket packs down tiny, but is easy and comfortable to layer over an outfit when you want to.\n\nA bag for all your souvenirs, and then some. If you pick up some of the cork souvenirs that the city is known for (over a third of the world\u2019s cork forests are in Portugal) along the way, you\u2019ll need a place to hold it \u2014 and Baggu\u2019s Duck Bag is roomy and durable enough to give you a place to stash it (plus a few of your other essentials as you move around the city). This canvas bag has a long strap in addition to its handles, so you can sling it around your shoulder when wandering through museums and shops.\n\nAn ebook reader. If you have one, you probably already take it with you everywhere, but stick with us here. An Amazon Kindle Paperwhite in your tote will keep you entertained through an afternoon coffee break at one of Lisbon\u2019s world-class coffee bars (like F\u00e1brica Coffee Roasters, for example) or just while people watching in the square. Both of those are activities we heartily recommend. Another virtue, though, is that you can also flip through a travel guide as you move around the city, without looking like you\u2019re flipping through a travel guide \u2014 great for the tourist who wants to blend into the crowd.

His signature fluorescent-tube sculptures are rarely as impeccably selected or installed as they are here. The gallery\u2019s spaces seem made for them, meaning that the show illustrates both Minimal art\u2019s utter dependency on but also its glorification of the \u201cwhite cube,\u201d Brian O\u2019Doherty\u2019s well-known term for the unblemished exhibition space that became an increasingly essential framing device for so much art after 1960. Zwirner, which represents the estate of the artist, who was born in 1933 and died in 1996, fully complies with Flavin\u2019s demanding installation protocols: The outlets and cords for these plug-in pieces must be completely invisible.\n\nThe total unity of the space, the sculptures and the light they emit (there is no other lighting in the show) is, as intended, a bit awe-inspiring. The exhibition is also indirectly dispiriting, since probably no American museum can give Flavin\u2019s work the space and care, as here, to make it so convincing to the neophyte.\n\nThe 10 pieces on view date from 1963 to \u201972; as the show\u2019s title implies, all use one or both of the most generic shades General Electric produces: the warmish Daylight and the relatively clinical Cool White. The lack of color underscores how shocking these works once were.\n\nWithout disguising themselves as hardware store items, the tubes argue, in different arrangements, for their effect as art. They also indicate how carefully Flavin used their every aspect \u2014 the fluorescent tubes, their spreading glow and their white enamel base elements (which face outward or in, making the light more mysterious), as well available architecture, especially corners, which three of the works occupy. In \u201cuntitled (to Cy Twombly) 2\u201d of 1972, a tube of Cool White and one of Daylight, cross each other and a corner evoking Russian Constructivism. The show culminates in a gallery that contains three works from a series of \u201cmonuments\u201d dedicated to Vladimir Tatlin, one of the most prominent Constructivists. The display feels at once like a chapel and an Art Deco dance floor. Doing the best with the least so overtly and seductively, Flavin is the most magical and emblematic of the Minimalists.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "Sara Magenheimer is like a poet who plies her craft in film and video rather than in words, although she makes sculpture and art in other media, too. The results are impressive in \u201cNOON,\u201d her current show at the New Museum.\n\nThe title work is an installation that can be seen through the museum\u2019s front window. It includes video monitors and clothes on racks and breaks the word \u201cnoon\u201d into \u201cno\u201d and \u201con,\u201d or combines it with other words and images of ticking clocks in various locales, prompting you to think about the artificial constructs imposed on time. Inside the museum, a series of videos ruminates further on temporality and sequencing, language and different forms of perception.\n\nOne of the strongest works is \u201cBest Is Man\u2019s Breath Quality\u201d (2017), in which the video\u2019s subject is a box jellyfish. This creature is extremely poisonous, and its sting is so toxic that one survivor described the pain as worse than that of natural childbirth or injuries from a car accident. Both spineless (\u201cas if lacking a spine is weak\u201d) and translucent (\u201cnothing to hide!\u201d), the talking jellyfish persuasively challenges the human-defined hierarchy of species.\n\nOther videos hinge on monologues and dialogues spoken by eerily familiar automated voices that ruminate on punctuation and abstract, philosophical ideas of language. Ms. Magenheimer\u2019s art often feels like Gertrude Stein\u2019s work set to music (in one video, an evocatively pitched-down PJ Harvey song) and juiced up with images, like those of deer captured by surveillance cameras, primates looking into a mirror installed in a forest, or a lone piece of luggage on an airport conveyor belt, accompanied by a voice-over describing loneliness and heartbreak.", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "An early example that uses stretchers is \u201cNorth Star\u201d (1968), whose crackling bands of color involve both hard-edge and stain painting and whose rectangular shape is transgressed by numerous notches, as well as by two cutout squares, so that it resembles a large mask. \u201cFor Happiness\u201d (1970) also combines multiple painting techniques; it has 13 ropes that jauntily tilt its surface back and forth in space, challenging understanding of the piece as a whole.\n\nIn contrast to this complexity, \u201cHoo Doo Mandala\u201d and \u201cMandala\u201d (both 1970) are relatively square and frontal, but also gently billowed and scalloped by their anchoring ropes. Their radiant, asymmetrical geometries are reminiscent of everything from semaphore and hot-air balloons to tantric painting and the early Modernist works of the married artists Sonia Delaunay and Robert Delaunay.\n\nIn several works from 1972, Mr. Overstreet switches to an explosive, staccato drip technique, whose intimations of starry skies are regularly contradicted by dividing lines or added segments of canvas, leaving us suspended between deep space and eccentric objects. I look forward to seeing these exuberant, groundbreaking creations becoming standard in museums and new art histories. ROBERTA SMITH\n\nJared Bark\n\nThrough May 12. Yancey Richardson, 525 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 646-230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ready-made, an industrially manufactured object repurposed as art, was popular in the 20th century. But could there be such a thing as ready-made photography? Jared Bark could be said to have found it in his \u201cPhotobooth Pieces\u201d at Yancey Richardson. Mostly created between 1972 and 1975, these arrangements turn the strips of four photographs that were made in booth machines into artful grids.\n\nMr. Bark made his first work of this sort in Times Square in 1969. After that, he traveled around the country, asking people at Woolworth\u2019s drugstores to step inside the machines and pose. (He also acquired his own booth in 1972.) The resulting portrait grids, with their serial repetition of images, contain elements of Minimalism and Pop Art, as well as of the filmic realism of \u201970s auteur directors like Robert Altman.\n\nThe range of humanity on display here is also impressive \u2014 particularly when compared with that of similar projects, like Andy Warhol\u2019s photo booth works \u2014 as people of all ages and ethnicities appear in photos taken in, for instance, Phoenix or Provo, Utah.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition to inviting strangers to participate in his work, Mr. Bark often stepped inside the booth himself. Those results are more experimental, composed into abstract diamonds or squares, and with body parts photographed in rapid-fire succession, or a light bulb dangling alone in space.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA feeling of nostalgia and obsolescence pervades these pieces. Photo booths are nearly relics, now that almost everyone\u2019s phone has a camera. But Mr. Bark\u2019s works are like an ancestor of the selfie or the images on social media, with an endless view of photographed humanity scrolling by. MARTHA SCHWENDENER\n\nZoe Pettijohn Schade\n\nThrough May 6. Kai Matsumiya, 153\u00bd Stanton Street, Manhattan; 617-678-4440, kaimatsumiya.com.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt took Zoe Pettijohn Schade as long as a year and a half to make each of the intricate large gouaches in \u201cShifting Sets,\u201d a show lining the walls of Kai Matsumiya\u2019s tidy Stanton Street gallery. Weirdly timeless meditations on death, they simultaneously evoke cutting-edge Photoshop effects and rococo wallpaper, with tiled and overlapping imagery that includes skulls from the Parisian catacombs; toy army men in marbleized silhouette; and delicate, color-graded pigeon feathers modeled on one blackening example the artist found in her garden.\n\nWhat\u2019s most fascinating, though, isn\u2019t the pieces\u2019 nominal content so much as the seeming evanescence of the labor that went into them: If you lean in close, you can see every semi-opaque brush stroke in every pale gray feather, but from any greater distance, such small evidences of the artist\u2019s time and attention disappear in the overall dazzle.\n\nThe same kind of visual dynamic flickers across the whole of \u201cCrowd of Crowds: 100th Monkey\u201d (2017), which is covered in diagonal rows of grimacing, long-tailed primates. Because some of them are ghostly gray, and others mere silhouettes filled in with more feathers, skulls, or tombstones, it can take minutes of staring to notice just how simple the pattern is. WILL HEINRICH\n\n\u2018Clay Today\u2019\n\nThrough May 6. The Hole, 312 Bowery, Manhattan; 212-466-1100, theholenyc.com.\n\nPhoto\n\nContemporary art has been experiencing a ceramics renaissance for several years now, though its full breadth remains underexplored by galleries and museums. \u201cClay Today,\u201d a new exhibition at the Hole, provides a welcome, if not rigorous, introduction to the utterly creative and clever ways that artists are using this material.\n\nThe exhibition opens with a showstopper near the entrance: Francesca DiMattio\u2019s \u201cBoucherouite IV\u201d (2017), a blue-and-white human-size figure of sorts, whose body is a technical marvel of zigzagging rows of clay fringe. Bulging with appendages, \u201cBoucherouite\u201d incorporates items like a flowered porcelain handle and a Delftware vessel. Traditional ceramics have not been completely abandoned, but rather overtaken by experimentation. This feeling is echoed in Trevor Baird\u2019s vases adorned with panels of comics, and in Rebecca Morgan\u2019s gorgeously goofy face jugs. Allison Schulnik\u2019s \u201cRutile Pink Unicorn Vessel\u201d (2017) is a simple, oversize urn whose surface is teeming with miniature versions of the title creature.\n\nIn other places, clay looks a lot like something else, as in Diana Rojas\u2019s riff on a retail display of shoes. The most compelling of such works hang on the wall: Valerie Hegarty, Thomas Mailaender and Jesse Edwards have turned ceramics into imitations of paintings, photographs and TV sets, with the objects getting flatter as the illusionistic space deepens.\n\nIn the show\u2019s most exciting art, firm reference points slip away. Two pieces by Shinichi Sawada recall the ritual objects of a lost society. Heidi Lau\u2019s \u201cSeventh and Eighth Level of Hell\u201d (2018) evokes an alien, ominous world that incorporates elements of our own. And Roxanne Jackson\u2019s \u201cWild Mineral\u201d (2017) suggests the sawed-in-half skull of a dangerous, mythical creature. These works, grouped along one wall, demonstrate what can happen when clay becomes a vessel for pure imagination.

K-12 website, which includes This is Statistics, resources, professional development, student competitions, curriculum, courses and careers.\n\n_________\n\nUpdated: April 12, 2018\n\nWho do you think is the most popular musical artist in the U. S.? Your response, I bet, will be tempered by what you and your friends think and not take into account the entire country. For a more national perspective, the weekly Billboard 100 lists current songs across all genres, ranked by radio audiences, sales data and streaming activity. But, that does not consider how popularity varies around the country. The four maps that we showed came from a group of fifty in the New York Times article \u201cWhat Music Do Americans Love the Most? 50 Detailed Fan Maps\u201d and were published on August 7, 2017. The maps set out \u201cthe contours of music fandom and culture in the United States.\u201d From these heatmaps (maps in which data values are represented by a range of colors), you can pinpoint the relative popularity of artists down to small U. S. regions.\n\nThe article determined \u201cmost loved\u201d music by comparing YouTube viewings by artist. How were the artists chosen, the data calculated, and the data shown? First, the top fifty artists were identified from the spring 2017 Billboard Top 100 list, which is not as current as we may have liked. We selected Rihanna (#2 on Billboard), Drake (#13), Taylor Swift (#18), and Luke Bryan (#42) to have some diversity of type of music and region of the country where they were most popular. Then, using YouTube\u2019s geocoded streaming data for the period January 2016 through April 2017, the number of times each of these artists was streamed was determined for each small region. This number was converted to a proportion by dividing the number of the artists\u2019 streamings by the total number of viewings for all fifty artists. Finally, the proportions were color-coded from light pink representing the smallest proportions to dark purple representing the greatest proportions. As the article states, \u201cIf one part of the map is lighter, it doesn\u2019t mean people there weren\u2019t watching the artist\u2019s videos; it just means fans were more likely to listen to a variety of other artists.\u201d\n\nLipi from Madison, Ga., summed up the graphs rather concisely. \u201cThese graphs show the level of popularity for Billboard singers in all fifty states. It shows that Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan are well-liked in almost all fifty states. However, Drake is popular in the Southwest, while Rihanna is more popular in the Southeast. I wonder what attracts these demographics to certain kinds of music. I notice that people are interested in many different kinds of music.\u201d\n\nHere are some questions you may want to think about critically.\n\n\u2022 Rihanna is #2 on Billboard, but she has very few purple regions. Thinking about how popularity is calculated and where she is popular, how could this be true? Similarly, Luke Bryan, who is only #42 on Billboard, seems relatively popular all over the country. How could this be true?\n\n\u2022 In the article, notice that some maps are mostly light pink. What may this imply about the map\u2019s artist? Also, no artist has a mostly purple map. Why do you think this is?\n\n\u2022 Rick of California says that some of his favorite rock \u2018n roll groups, like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and AC/DC, are missing from the list, so rock n\u2019 roll, as we know it, has ended. Can we claim this from the graphs?", "title": "What\u2019s Going On in This Graph? | April 10, 2018", "authors": []}

In a Washington, D.C., boardinghouse, Fairchild roomed with a former colleague from the Department of Agriculture named Wallace Swingle; together, they brainstormed about building a team that would travel to foreign countries and \u201cadminister the introduction of plants.\u201d As Stone explains, they \u201cfancied their title as \u2018agricultural explorer\u2019 \u2014 a term so whimsical, so obvious, that it came out of their mouths at the same time.\u201d\n\nSoon enough there was a sign on a door and a new government agency: the Office of Seed and Plant Introduction.

The search for an effective cough medicine can be frustrating.\n\nAmericans spend $8 billion a year on over-the-counter cough and cold products, yet there is little evidence that they suppress coughs. The American College of Chest Physicians underscored this point bluntly in 2017: \u201cFor adult and pediatric patients with cough due to the common cold, we suggest against the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner.\u201d\n\nWhen over-the-counter products fail, cough sufferers often look for \u201csomething stronger\u201d \u2014 namely codeine, widely regarded as the standard by which cough medicines are measured. Much of the interest in codeine dates from a 1950 experiment, unlikely to be undertaken today, in which 17 Swedish medical students agreed to inhale ammonia fumes. The cough that ensued was modestly ameliorated by pretreatment with escalating doses of codeine.\n\nBut a subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 82 patients with upper respiratory infections found that the drug was \u201cno more effective than placebo,\u201d and some experts have labeled the cough-suppressing effect of codeine a \u201cmedical myth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCodeine has a chemically similar cousin, dextromethorphan \u2014 the \u201cDM\u201d component of many cough medicines. But a systematic review concluded that dextromethorphan was about as good as honey at reducing cough frequency. Both codeine and dextromethorphan carry the potential for abuse and have serious side effects that have led to warnings from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSo what to do for a persistent cough after a cold? Stay hydrated, use a humidifier, and be patient. A cough from a cold will usually resolve within three weeks. You could also try honey, as it seems to be as effective as over-the-counter products.

Things have been falling apart on multiple fronts since the 1970s: Political polarization has marched side by side with economic polarization, as income inequality has soared.\n\nAnd both political and economic polarization have a strong geographic dimension. On the economic side, some parts of America, mainly big coastal cities, have been getting much richer, but other parts have been left behind. On the political side, the thriving regions by and large voted for Hillary Clinton, while the lagging regions voted for Donald Trump.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that everything is great in coastal cities: Many people remain economically stranded even within metropolitan areas that look successful in the aggregate. And soaring housing costs, thanks in large part to Nimbyism, are a real and growing problem. Still, regional economic divergence is real and correlates closely, though not perfectly, with political divergence.\n\nBut what\u2019s behind this divergence?

In 2015, for instance, the Justice Department reached settlements with a continuing care facility in Norfolk, Va., and one in Lincolnshire, Ill., for discriminating against residents with disabilities.\n\nUnlike nursing homes, which are subject to federal regulations and regular inspections, assisted and independent living facilities operate under widely varying state laws.\n\nOklahoma and Alabama require residents to be \u201cambulatory,\u201d for instance, but Kentucky allows admission of the \u201cmobile nonambulatory,\u201d meaning people who use walkers or wheelchairs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany states have similar policies, though with different language, like \u2018must be able to self-evacuate,\u2019 which is often interpreted to mean \u2018no wheelchairs,\u2019\u201d said Susan Silverstein, a senior lawyer for the AARP Foundation, which is representing the plaintiffs. \u201cFacilities often justify their policies by citing state laws that are ambiguous.\u201d\n\nAdministrators of the facilities named in the New York lawsuit, including Elm York Assisted Living and Madison York Assisted Living, (which share ownership with the other residence in Queens), often cited state laws as reasons to exclude wheelchair users, according to the complaint.\n\nAnd in this case, they appear to be correct. New York State regulations governing \u201cadult care facilities\u201d and Medicaid-funded assisted living programs, which all four facilities are licensed to offer, do prohibit residents who are \u201cchronically chairfast and unable to transfer\u201d or require assistance to transfer \u2014 even when, as in this case, the buildings have elevators.\n\nThose 40-year-old policies predate the federal laws barring discrimination based on disability, but the state has not revised them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Andrew Cuomo, as defendants.\n\nNeither the governor\u2019s office nor the four assisted living facilities would comment.\n\nThe state\u2019s health department said it considered \u201creasonable wheelchair accessibility\u201d in adult homes a priority and that it began working with existing homes last year on \u201cremediation plans that include appropriate upgrades.\u201d Newly constructed adult homes, it noted, must comply with federal, state and local accessibility requirements.\n\nThe suit asks that the four facilities adopt nondiscriminatory admission and retention policies, and that the state update its regulations to reflect federal law. It also seeks training and monitoring to ensure compliance.\n\nWhile administrators might still turn away applicants for individual reasons, they couldn\u2019t maintain blanket rules against wheelchairs. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a much larger number of people in the next few years who will need assisted living, and those facilities need to be open to people,\u201d Mr. Freiberg said.\n\nAlthough the assisted living industry mainly attracts people who are paying for the care themselves, \u201cthe percentage covered by Medicaid is growing,\u201d said Eric Carlson, a lawyer at Justice in Aging, an advocacy group not involved in the lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA recent Government Accountability Office report pointed out that in 2014, Medicaid covered assisted-living services for more than 330,000 people in 48 states \u2014 part of the effort to support alternatives to expensive nursing homes.\n\nA favorable settlement or trial verdict in the New York lawsuit could bring changes in assisted living beyond Medicaid programs and beyond New York State. \u201cPrivate-pay assisted living is still subject to the Fair Housing Act,\u201d said Jota Borgmann, senior staff lawyer at Mobilization for Justice, a legal services organization and co-counsel in the case.\n\nSimilar court cases have already changed assisted living regulations and practices around the country, Mr. Carlson pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s not like flipping a switch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s step by step, but they have impact.\u201d\n\nWhile the relatives that testers described to administrators were fictitious, a retired lawyer in her 60s, known in court filings only as Jane Doe because she feared she might be blackballed from care facilities, is quite real. She\u2019s also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with her brother, who acts as her power of attorney.\n\nDisabled by severe osteoporosis, the plaintiff lived at VillageCare for five years, until last spring when a urinary tract infection and its complications sent her to a hospital, then to a nursing home for rehabilitation.\n\nAfter two months, according to the complaint, VillageCare told her she needed more assistance than it could provide, including help with \u201cambulation,\u201d and told her she could not return. It began eviction proceedings, which her brother contested.\n\nIn December, the facility agreed to an in-person interview and assessment. The session \u2014 including cognitive tests, sitting and standing, and taking her shoes on and off \u2014 lasted four hours.\n\n\u201cIt was grueling,\u201d said her brother, who traveled from his Florida home to accompany her. \u201cIt was a very difficult thing, but my sister did it. She walked with her walker just fine.\u201d\n\nBut VillageCare refused to readmit her, saying she needed assistance with activities of daily living, including \u201clocomotion.\u201d So she remains in a nursing home, where she is discouraged from walking at all, and worries that she may never go home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disheartening,\u201d her brother said. \u201cI keep telling her, \u2018You\u2019re going to be out any day,\u2019 and I\u2019ve been wrong.\u201d", "title": "Wheelchairs Prohibited in the Last Place You\u2019d Expect", "authors": ["Paula Span", "The New Old Age"]}

Many people born in Caribbean countries arrived as children on their parents\u2019 passports and had never applied for their own travel or immigration documents; many others took their status for granted.\n\nThe Home Office did not keep records that would have confirmed their status, and a Home Office whistle-blower revealed that thousands of landing cards from the 1950s and \u201960s, which would have confirmed the migrants\u2019 arrival dates, had been destroyed during a move. As The Guardian chronicled in a series of articles, the callousness of the bureaucracy led many to be threatened with deportation, denied health services, fired or left homeless.\n\nMrs. May, now Britain\u2019s prime minister, recently apologized to the many thousands of people affected, but she deserves little credit. As home secretary she set the stage for the scandal by pledging to create a \u201creally hostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants, and it was only when public outrage soared, and leaders of former British colonies had gathered in London for a Commonwealth meeting, that she said, \u201cWe are genuinely sorry.\u201d\n\nThe British government has now set up a special team to urgently affirm the legal rights of these migrants and reimburse them for their losses. That is the least it should do.\n\nNothing can really compensate them for the hell many went through. Nor do the apology or belated fixes change the fact that this was due to the government\u2019s hostility to immigrants, and especially immigrants of color. The same official hostility can be found in many parts of Europe toward Middle Eastern refugees and in the Trump administration\u2019s policy toward immigrants from Central America.\n\nWhen Mrs. May speaks of creating a hostile environment for immigrants; or Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, says that with mass immigration \u201cour worst nightmares can come true\u201d; or President Trump describes immigrants as criminals, they feed a hostility that spreads through bureaucracy, law enforcement and the public.

I\u2019d like to be able to have casual work conversations with her during the work day, but she always wears earphones (listening to either music or podcasts).

I feel like I need to have something particularly meaningful to say, because now I\u2019ve made her stop all work to hear me. To complicate matters, I sit in a small, private office so I have privacy during the day while she sits in a large room with employees all around her. My short-term solution has been to type back and forth on a messaging system \u2014 but it feels so inefficient and, really, kind of dumb when it\u2019d be quicker to resolve something in 25 (spoken) words or fewer.

That said, she urged consumers to wait for the all-clear from the C.D.C. before eating chopped romaine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fast-moving outbreak,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting reports of new illness daily from our state and local health departments.\u201d\n\nWhy is this outbreak so worrisome?\n\nEscherichia coli is in our intestines, the environment, foods and animals, but most of the time it doesn\u2019t make you sick. However, this particular strain \u2014 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli 0157:H7 \u2014 is particularly dangerous. Symptoms appear from one to 10 days after eating and can vary, but may include severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. While the people affected range in age from 10 to 85 years, the median age is 34 \u2014 meaning the bug is making otherwise healthy, strong people really sick. The hospitalization rate for E. coli illness is typically around 30 percent, but this strain has put 67 percent of the cases in the hospital. Five people have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. Given delays in reporting, those numbers are expected to grow.\n\nThe other concern is that unlike a recent multistate outbreak of salmonella in eggs, which resulted in a recall of a specific egg product, no specific grower, supplier or brand has been identified as the source of the romaine outbreak.\n\nWhere has the outbreak occurred?\n\nInfections linked to the outbreak have been found in 16 states, illustrating how widely bags of romaine are distributed around the country. You can find a list of states where cases have been reported on the C.D.C. website. Most of the reported cases have come from Pennsylvania (12), Idaho (10), New Jersey (7), Montana (6) and Arizona (3). New York, Connecticut, Ohio and Michigan have had two cases each, with one case each in Alaska, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Virginia and Washington state.\n\nHow do I know if the greens I\u2019m eating contain romaine?\n\nMost people can\u2019t reliably distinguish romaine from other forms of lettuce, Ms. Halloran said. A head of romaine lettuce is more oblong than the round shape typical of iceberg. \u201cIt\u2019s the one with the pointy football shape,\u201d Ms. Halloran said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s chopped up you\u2019re not going to see that. It\u2019s a bit crunchier and chewier than bibb lettuce. The outer leaves are dark green and the inner leaves are yellow so color isn\u2019t going to tell you. If you\u2019ve had Caesar salad you\u2019ve almost certainly had romaine lettuce.\u201d\n\nWhy does the C.D.C. say it\u2019s O.K. to eat heads and hearts of romaine, but not bagged?\n\nThe documented cases have been linked to bagged romaine eaten at home or in restaurants, not full heads or hearts of lettuce. The lettuce at the source of the outbreak is grown in Arizona for bagged use. The C.D.C. suggests that the contamination is limited to some part of the bagged lettuce supply chain.", "title": "When Is It Safe to Eat Salad Again?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "A liberal can believe that government can do more good or less, and one can debate how much to conserve. But progressivism is inherently hostile to moderation because progress is an unmitigated good. There cannot be too much of it. Like conservative fundamentalism, progressivism contributes to the polarization and paralysis of government because it makes compromise, which entails accepting less progress, not merely inadvisable but irrational. Even when progressives choose their targets strategically \u2014 Hillary Clinton, for example, called herself \u201ca progressive who likes to get things done\u201d \u2014 the implication is that progress is the fundamental goal and that its opponents are atavists.\n\nUnlike liberalism, progressivism is intrinsically opposed to conservation. It renders adhering to tradition unreasonable rather than seeing it, as the liberal can, as a source of wisdom. The British philosopher Roger Scruton calls this a \u201cculture of repudiation\u201d of home and history alike. The critic of progress is not merely wrong but a fool. Progressivism\u2019s critics have long experienced this as a passive-aggressive form of re-education.\n\nBecause progress is an unadulterated good, it supersedes the rights of its opponents. This is evident in progressive indifference to the rights of those who oppose progressive policies in areas like sexual liberation.\n\nThis is one reason progressives have alienated moderate voters who turned to Donald Trump in 2016. The ideology of progress tends to regard the traditions that have customarily bound communities and which mattered to Trump voters alarmed by the rapid transformation of society, as a fatuous rejection of progress. Trump supporters\u2019 denunciation of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d is just as often a reaction to progressive condescension as it is to identity politics.\n\nWhere liberalism seeks to ameliorate economic ills, progressivism\u2019s goal is to eradicate them. Moynihan recognized this difference between Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which he always supported \u2014 as exemplified by his opposition to Clinton-era welfare reform \u2014 and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, which he sympathetically criticized. The New Deal alleviated poverty by cutting checks, something government does competently even if liberals and conservatives argued over the size of the checks. The Great Society partook more of a progressive effort to remake society by eradicating poverty\u2019s causes. The result, Moynihan wrote, was the diversion of resources from welfare and jobs to \u201ccommunity action\u201d programs that financed political activism.", "title": "Opinion | When Liberals Become Progressives, Much Is Lost", "authors": []}

But new legal challenges to these practices are succeeding and may stymie the government\u2019s deportation agenda by taking profits out of the detention business.\n\nYes, detention is a business. In 2010, private prisons and their lenders and investors lobbied Congress to pass a law ordering Immigration and Customs Enforcement to maintain contracts for no fewer than 34,000 beds per night. This means that when detention counts are low, people who would otherwise be released because they pose no danger or flight risk and are likely to win their cases in immigration court remain locked up, at a cost to the government of about $125 a day.\n\nThe people detained at these facilities do almost all of the work that keeps them running, outside of guard duty. That includes cooking, serving and cleaning up food, janitorial services, laundry, haircutting, painting, floor buffing and even vehicle maintenance. Most jobs pay $1 a day; some work they are required to do pays nothing.\n\nWorkers in immigration custody have suffered injuries and even died.

Two fans of Mr. Yiannopoulos were charged with shooting a protester outside of one of his speeches.\n\nPart of the problem is that American culture still largely sees men\u2019s sexism as something innate rather than deviant. And in a world where sexism is deemed natural, the misogynist tendencies of mass shooters become afterthoughts rather than predictable and stark warnings.\n\nThe truth is that in addition to not protecting women, we are failing boys: failing to raise them to believe they can be men without inflicting pain on others, failing to teach them that they are not entitled to women\u2019s sexual attention and failing to allow them an outlet for understandable human fear and foibles that will not label them \u201cweak\u201d or unworthy.\n\nNot every attack is preventable, but the misogyny that drives them is.

Of them he wrote, \u201cthey plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice.\u201d Homer invoked the muse for his epic poem (\u201cSing to me of the man, Muse\u201d) as did Virgil. Over time, the muse became a less incantatory figure and more of a sexual one: The word is commonly used, for example, as a shorthand for the many wives and lovers Pablo Picasso captured in his work. With the rise of the model as celebrity in the latter half of the 20th century, the muse became more objectified. She could be the woman a fashion designer trusted to wear his clothes, both on and off the runway. Or she could be a figure of whom a world-famous photographer\u2019s lens never tired. These women and their looks \u2014 from Misia Sert\u2019s bohemian opulence at the turn of the last century to Twiggy\u2019s sprightly boyishness in the 1960s \u2014 can be as much an expression of their times as their era\u2019s music, literature or even politics.\n\nIn the early \u201980s, model-muses became as famous as the artists they inspired, paving the way for the supers of the subsequent decade such as Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Kate Moss. Today, the industry\u2019s commercial interests have transformed the role of the muse into something much more lucrative, but during the careers of models like Pat Cleveland and Alva Chinn, the relationship between model and designer was born more out of a sense of simpatico. Cleveland and Chinn were two of the first women of color to be photographed for mainstream fashion magazines and to walk the runways for major designers like Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld. Both, too, walked in the Battle of Versailles (a kind of fashion face-off between French and American designers in 1973) for the African-American designer Stephen Burrows, whose color-blocked, lettuce-edged dresses represented the free-spirited disco nights of the time.

But Zo\u00eb Beck, co-founder of a group called Publishers Against the Right, worries that market-oriented chain stores have weakened bookstores\u2019 role as a place of political debate. \u201cWhat J\u00f6rg Braunsdorf is doing is something I find exemplary,\u201d wrote Ms. Beck, in an email. \u201cThe need now is greater than ever.\u201c\n\nFor Mr. Braunsdorf, 58, social engagement has always been part of running a bookstore. Originally from Wetzlar, a small city in what was then West Germany, Mr. Braunsdorf started working in his 20s at a book collective there run by a group of his young left-wing friends. They did not do much business, but the shop was a meeting place for students and activists: There, they printed fliers decrying nuclear power plants or calling for affordable housing.\n\nToday, 37 years later, Mr. Braunsdorf is still working at a bookstore, but now it\u2019s his own shop, in Berlin, and other political issues have come to the forefront. \u201cNone of us expected that this confrontation with fascism would be so close at hand,\u201d he said, alluding to the AfD success in entering Parliament. \u201cI think in the next years we are going to need to not just protest \u2018against,\u2019 but really come up with a \u2018for.\u2019 What do we want, in our society?\u201d\n\nMr. Braunsdorf, who has hosted German-Arabic reading events at his shop for refugee children and moderated debates about gentrification, the economy and politics, said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine running a bookstore just as a selling point.\u201d", "title": "When Neo-Nazis Marched Through Berlin\u2019s Old Jewish Quarter, a Bookshop Took Notice", "authors": []}

That\u2019s a concern no matter who occupies the White House but especially when the president is as impulsive as Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee needs to hold hearings to examine publicly how the measure can be modified to ensure there is a more effective congressional check on the president\u2019s ability to begin military operations so that the war on terrorists isn\u2019t used as cover to fight any enemy, anywhere.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Congress tried to reclaim some of its clout by passing the 1973 War Powers Act, which mandated that if a president sent troops into \u201chostilities,\u201d they could stay only 60 to 90 days unless Congress approved the deployment or extended the time period. In recent years, executive branch lawyers have concluded that presidents may act unilaterally if they decide that a strike would be in the national interest and that it would fall short of an all-out war involving ground troops. Congress, reluctant to be held accountable for putting troops in danger, and wary of challenging presidents, largely acquiesced.\n\nThat is until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when Congress passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force to cover American-led operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2002 it passed a second authorization, to cover the war in Iraq. Although 17 years have passed since the attacks on the United States, President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump, defying credibility, kept using the same authorizations to justify operations against the Islamic State and other groups that didn\u2019t even exist in 2001 and to legitimize operations in many other countries, including Yemen, the Philippines, Kenya, Eritrea and Niger.\n\nUnder the Kaine-Corker proposal, these 2001 and 2002 authorizations would be replaced with one that approves the use of force not just against Al Qaeda and the Taliban but also against six groups not in the 2001 authorization: the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the East African group Al Shabab, Al Qaeda in Syria, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Haqqani Network, which operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "STARTING IN 1979, when I was 21, I was an out reporter writing for underground queer newspapers, in which I covered key acts of political warfare in New York City. This was the beginning of President Reagan\u2019s terrifying and far-reaching unification with the Christian right. As a particularly despised group of people, queers were fighting police brutality on one front and racist admission policies in gay and lesbian bars on the other, homophobia at home and the closet at work. At the time, there was still no gay rights bill in the city, and sodomy was illegal in more than half of the states. Simultaneously, there were people who insisted on being out and who created rich subcultures that forged new ground in sex, night life, imagination \u2014 and rebellion.\n\nThree years later, in 1982, I witnessed a violent New York City Police raid on a gay bar, Blues, a place for black men in Times Square. The cops beat up patrons, breaking mirrors and shattering bottles. Then as now, police violence against black men largely went unpunished. And when the gay community came out in anger to demonstrate in favor of Blues\u2019s patrons, the action received no television coverage. The only documentation was by the Super 8 filmmaker Jim Hubbard. His grainy footage shows a multiracial, angry gathering of queer men and women holding small homemade signs; there were no mass-produced T-shirts emblazoned with slogans, no shiny pins, no professionally printed posters. This was what resistance looked like then: nothing to buy, and nothing to sell.\n\nSO HOW DID we get from that to the highly visible, art-directed expressions of the late 1980s and early \u201990s, which \u2014 as proven by the pink pussy hats and Black Lives Matter shirts of recent years \u2014 still resonate today? Look first to late-70s conceptual artists, including Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger, who drew attention to cultural contradictions with their stark, text-based works, originally pasted on buildings and construction sites in the newly gentrifying SoHo. Public fine art, in combination with the era\u2019s advertising, inspired a generation of graphic designers, including Avram Finkelstein, whose collective created the famous \u201cSilence=Death\u201d logo, later donated to ACT UP (Aids Coalition to Unleash Power) in 1987. Provocative protest iconography soon became the norm: Artists like Tom Kalin, Marlene McCarty, Loring McAlpin and Robert Vasquez formed Gran Fury, one of a number of art collectives in ACT UP. In 1991, AIDS activists\u2019 four-year campaign to expand the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s definition of AIDS, so that more infected women could get health benefits, was accompanied by a Gran Fury poster that read \u201cWomen Don\u2019t Get AIDS They Just Die From It.\u201d\n\nImage Also in \u201987, the collective General Idea made its first AIDS painting, updating artist Robert Indiana\u2019s 1965 LOVE motif. Credit Acrylic on canvas, courtesy of the Estate of General Idea and Esther Schipper, Berlin. Photo \u00a9 Andrea Rossetti\n\nIn many ways, this AIDS rebellion, and the aesthetic it created, drew from the 1960s Civil Rights template. Much as the Black Power movement had established its own look (black berets, leather jackets and a raised fist), so too did New York\u2019s AIDS activists develop a signature telegenic appearance, with their slogan T-shirts, jeans and Doc Martens. Artists such as Keith Haring, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the collective General Idea made highly visible pieces about loss, inserting AIDS into public spaces, advertisements and even mass-produced apparel. By 1991, the filmmaker Jerry Tartaglia and others in an organization called Visual AIDS Artists\u2019 Caucus had conceived of the red AIDS ribbon as a sign of solidarity in a country that was stigmatizing and isolating infected people. That year, the 11-year-old actress Daisy Eagan wore one to accept her Tony Award for her work in \u201cThe Secret Garden,\u201d and the ribbon became an instant piece of iconography \u2014 of the AIDS movement, of course, but for all future movements as well, a symbol of the conflation of money and power that was a new kind of social currency altogether, one in which one should be, or appear to be, socially aware.", "title": "When Protest Movements Became Brands", "authors": []}

Then, in an emotionally frank speech, Kennedy eulogized the civil rights leader, called for an end to violence and social injustice and addressed, for the first time in public, the assassination of his brother President John F. Kennedy five years earlier.\n\n\u201cFor those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.\u201d\n\n[Read and listen: Robert F.

Though movies aren\u2019t always faithful to their source material, the city loomed large in the initial stories. It was where the biggest comic publishers were based and where most of their writers were living.\n\n\u201cThat was the center of both the Marvel and DC universe,\u201d Ms. DeConnick said. \u201cPeople were telling stories of their lives, of their families, and what was important to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly Washington, D.C.,\u201d she added, \u201cthinks Washington, D.C., is the center of the universe.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s also not an ideal place for dynamic visuals, said Corey Creekmur, a film professor and comics scholar at the University of Iowa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNew York is famously vertical, and Washington isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, pointing to scenes of Superman flying over Metropolis, the fictional version of New York City, and the Avengers plummeting into Midtown. \u201cIt\u2019s not the space associated with superheroes in that regard.\u201d\n\nThere are also logistics to consider. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to build tall buildings in the swamp, things for Spider-Man to swing off of,\u201d Mr. Fraction said.

On the National Mall alone, there\u2019s a delicate balance between stairs, permitted equipment and flags: You can film the Washington Monument outside the circle of flags around the base, but you cannot film the Lincoln Memorial above its white steps, and all of the Korean and Vietnam War memorials are open \u2014 except that only a hand-held camera is permitted.\n\n\u201cA lot of it has to do with the scope of special effects, pyrotechnics, big explosions \u2014 anything like that is going to be really sensitive to our federal core,\u201d said Herbert Niles, who heads the film division of the district\u2019s Office of Cable Television, Film, Music and Entertainment.

Like Batman clashing with the police in Gotham City, there\u2019s often an inherent conflict between the superheroes\u2019 vision of justice and the government\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDo we play along with the government, or do we work outside the government?\u201d he said of the plotlines that drove the splintering factions in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d (2016). \u201cAnd I think of that as a post-9/11 narrative.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the relentless cycle of political news and clashes between Hollywood and the current administration, Washington probably won\u2019t get the spotlight in superhero films anytime soon.\n\nBesides, fictional realms based in reality like Black Panther\u2019s Wakanda have become much more intriguing to moviegoers.\n\n\u201cHollywood is picking up on a widespread alienation from Washington and a widespread disengagement,\u201d Mr. Prelinger, the U.C.

I found it difficult to keep a straight face as I spoke to the journalist sent by China Central Television, or CCTV, the state television network. Both of us were sitting there holding pieces of paper, and my script had all the questions and answers written out for us to recite. It was absurdly stage-managed, with state security agents directing how I was to behave and speak.\n\nThe theater hides a grim reality: I read the script in exchange for freedom for me and my girlfriend.

And the United States should invoke the Global Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions on the people in power at Chinese media companies, as well as those within the Chinese police and state security apparatus who are responsible for these televised humiliations.

World Equestrian Games in 2010 after her mount Jerich Parzival started bleeding from his mouth.\n\nBut other instances seem more clear cut, such as when Jur Vrieling, a rider from the Netherlands, was disqualified after he lashed his horse Zirocco Blue with a whip and drew blood at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I saw a sign in Arlee, a small town in the foothills of the spectacular Mission Range, indicating that the boys\u2019 high school basketball team, the Warriors, had won a state championship. I proposed a profile of its star, Phillip Malatare, who was then a junior, to my editor at The Times Magazine, Charles Homans. The plan was to follow Phil, a Division I prospect, as he tried to reach a college program.\n\nBut I quickly realized that the notion of profiling one player was ridiculous. Phil was related to more than half of the Warriors, and the team\u2019s dominant style of play was predicated on cooperation and a lot of running. I also discovered there was more to the story than basketball. David Whitesell, the father of another one of the team\u2019s players, told me that during the previous year\u2019s championship run, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes \u2014 a wealthy and powerful nation \u2014 had been combating a suicide cluster that directly affected the team.\n\nI told Mr. Whitesell, Phil\u2019s parents and the team\u2019s coach, Zanen Pitts, that the story was about a season with the basketball team, but that if they decided to grant access I would also cover the adversity the community had faced. They all decided to welcome me.

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "The current model for understanding SIDS suggests a confluence of risks. First, the infant may have some intrinsic anatomic or physiological risk factor. Second, there is a critical period of development when babies are vulnerable, before the age of 6 months. Third, there is an environmental component involving sleep position, bed sharing or overheated rooms. The final mechanism of death may be a failure to arouse out of deep sleep.\n\nMaybe, Dr. Goodstein said, when babies sleep in the same room as their parents, the background sounds or stirrings prevent very deep sleep and that helps keeps the babies safe. Room sharing also makes breast-feeding easier, which is protective against SIDS.\n\nDr. Ian M. Paul, a professor of pediatrics and public health sciences at Penn State Children\u2019s Hospital, has questioned whether it\u2019s reasonable to suggest that families undertake room sharing for as long as a year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that room sharing is protective against SIDS in the first four to six months,\u201d when the great majority of SIDS deaths occur, he said. \u201cAfter that there was no hard data to support that room sharing without bed sharing was any safer than the baby sleeping in their own room.\u201d\n\nDr. Paul was the first author on an article last summer in the journal Pediatrics that looked at the relationship between room sharing and sleep behaviors. The families that continued room sharing longer, he said, were at higher risk of moving the child into the parents\u2019 bed, which is unsafe. As for babies, \u201cthose that moved to their own room sometime after age 4 months had better sleep consolidation and longer overall sleep extended out to age 2\u00bd years.\u201d\n\nFamilies need to consider all these factors, he said, in figuring out what will work best for themselves and their babies. \u201cWe do know that poor sleep has effects on the child in the short and the long term and on the family.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To discuss \u201ctransitioning out of the room at 4 months gives me a mental reminder in my anticipatory guidance to reinforce safe sleep in that new sleep environment, and I talk about the potential benefits of having a baby get better sleep consolidation in that second half of the first year.\u201d\n\nIn the first four to six months, Dr. Paul said, room sharing can help support breast-feeding. But by 6 months, he says it\u2019s fine for the baby to be in a separate room. The baby should no longer need to be breast-fed overnight, and in fact, mothers may be more likely to keep breast-feeding longer if they are not waking up several times a night.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor women who need to breast-feed in the night, and are concerned that they may fall asleep while nursing, Dr. Goodstein suggested, stay in bed but clear the bed of pillows, loose blankets, comforters \u2014 and try to stay awake so that you can put the baby back into a \u201csafe sleep environment,\u201d that is, the bassinet or crib that is not the parental bed. Babies should not be put down on surfaces like water beds, couches or cushioned armchairs, where there is a very large increase in the risk of SIDS.\n\n\u201cParents need to be aware of norms, that there are going to be awakenings,\u201d Dr. Goodstein said. \u201cAt some point when they\u2019re getting a little older, we should give them some time to self-soothe \u2014 we need to have these discussions about infant sleep safety, injury prevention, SIDS risk reduction, we need to acknowledge that parents have a hard job.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is a hard job, and Dr. Paul said that many parents and many pediatricians were relieved by his position.\n\n\u201cI got so much fan mail when we published our paper,\u201d he said. \u201cPediatricians, many of them, didn\u2019t think it was a common sense recommendation for some families.\u201d\n\nBut everyone also understands the desire to see these deaths stop, and no one wants to take risks. \u201cThere are still 3,700 babies dying from unsafe sleep in this country, one dying every two or three hours of every day,\u201d Dr. Goodstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a national tragedy. We really have to work at dropping these numbers down.\u201d\n\nJodi Mindell, a pediatric sleep expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and chairwoman of the Pediatric Sleep Council, said that while the emphasis in the early months when risk is highest must be on the importance of keeping babies safe, we should also help families think about other aspects of sleep in the period between 3 and 6 months: \u201cEstablish good sleep foundations, with early bedtime, consistent bedtime routines.\u201d\n\nShe advised that doctors educate parents about safe sleep surfaces and the importance of no one smoking in the home.\n\n\u201cWe need to make it safe whether or not the baby is in the parents\u2019 room,\u201d Dr. Mindell said. \u201cOur job is to help families and support them in their decisions.\u201d", "title": "When Your Baby Is Your Roommate", "authors": ["Perri Klass", "The Checkup"]}

Instead, she paid for a study to see if anything could be done. It turned out there was a lot.\n\nMs. Moore is the sixth generation of her family to live on the same farm, where she has upgraded the farmhouse substantially and transformed the farmland into the Moore Farms Botanical Garden.\n\nPhoto\n\nHer credentials as a philanthropist are well established. She has given $70 million to the University of South Carolina, which named the business school after her, and made a $10 million gift to Clemson University, where her father was a star football and baseball player.\n\nBut Ms. Moore knew she was going to need the town\u2019s constituents, regardless of age or race, to buy into a vision they all could share. There were more than a few doubters, she said.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of credibility in the town because of my father and grandparents, not because of my resources,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it without that. I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve gone into towns with a large amount of money, and it failed. It\u2019s hugely complex.\u201d\n\nLike much in philanthropy today, many of these makeover projects require a mix of giving and investments with a social return so they can be sustainable. That combination helped Hamilton, Mo., population 1,809.\n\nIn 2008, two of Jenny Doan\u2019s seven children gave her a sewing machine designed for quilting. Twelve feet long and seven feet wide, the machine was too big for the family\u2019s home. So they bought a building to house it. Real estate was cheap because the town was struggling and many buildings had been neglected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the suggestion of one of her sons, Ms. Doan began to make YouTube videos on how to quilt. The videos took off. She kept sewing and making videos, and the family enterprise, the Missouri Star Quilt Company, kept buying and fixing up buildings.\n\nThe company now owns 26 buildings, including 14 quilt shops, three restaurants and a quilting retreat house for women, where up to 40 visitors can stay.\n\n\u201cWe bought as many buildings as we could,\u201d Ms. Doan said. But they all required extensive work before the Doans could use them.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe said the company had poured all of its profits back into the town for many years. It even put in the sidewalks along Main Street. Missouri Star Quilt now employs 450 people, mostly from the town.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the poorest counties in Missouri, and now people have a job,\u201d Ms. Doan said.\n\nRebuilding a civic space can be daunting and take years, if not longer, said Paul S. Grogan, president and chief executive of the Boston Foundation, one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest community foundations. He said it was important to record small milestones.\n\n\u201cThe little victories add up to something significant,\u201d said Mr. Grogan, whose background is in community development. \u201cIt becomes substantial. In a neighborhood accustomed to failure, you generate some success.\u201d\n\nMs. Moore said she had started with the Bean Market, a historic building that was \u201cspit and taped\u201d together. It is now a central event space for Lake City. She moved on to the old feed and grocery store, which is now a Smithsonian-certified art gallery that hosted an exhibition of the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya in 2014.\n\nBut she has also funded less-glamorous tasks, like running high-speed fiber-optic lines into town.\n\nFor community leaders who lack resources, Mr. Grogan said, rehabilitating just one house or creating a community garden can have a catalytic effect. \u201cYou think, \u2018How could those things possibly make a difference?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut they do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEventually, though, these towns need to attract outsiders to keep them viable. Ms. Doan\u2019s quilting stardom \u2014 her YouTube channel has nearly 500,000 subscribers \u2014 drew tourists to Hamilton. That, in turn, brought in other businesses.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, not everyone was happy we were turning our farm community into a quilting community,\u201d Ms. Doan said. \u201cFor those people who weren\u2019t happy, we hired their children, and now they love us.\u201d\n\nIn Lake City, Ms. Moore knew she had to create an event to bring in visitors. Plenty of people go to nearby Charleston for its historical charm and opera festival and to Myrtle Beach for its golf and 60-mile stretch of coastline, but Lake City was not on anyone\u2019s must-see list.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a meeting with advisers, some of whom she had known since she was a girl, one talked about an art festival in Grand Rapids, Mich., that is supported by members of the DeVos family, whose wealth comes from Amway, the multilevel marketing company. Ms. Moore thought that doing something similar with art from Southeastern states might work in Lake City.\n\nThat festival, ArtFields, is now in its sixth year. When it opens next Friday, 400 works of art will be on display in buildings that Ms. Moore has renovated and in downtown shops.\n\nOne shop owner, Barbara Miles, met with controversy last year when she selected a provocative tapestry from the festival to hang in her store, the East Main Market. But Ms. Moore said she had decided the artwork should stay. \u201cIt was a real humdinger of an image,\u201d she said.\n\nSome philanthropists are drawn to the challenge of renewing neighborhoods in big cities.\n\nMarcus Samuelsson, the world-famous chef who owns Red Rooster in Harlem, started Harlem EatUp!, a weeklong food and cultural festival in the neighborhood, four years ago.\n\nHe said the festival, which draws attendees from the city and beyond, helped 80 businesses in the neighborhood. But Mr. Samuelsson said he was proud that 40 percent of the events were free, up from 20 percent when the festival started.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarlem is a neighborhood with a deep cultural history, but Mr. Samuelsson saw this festival as a way to highlight its businesses. His goal has been to use a week of fun to bring economic benefits to Harlem and Spanish Harlem by connecting event sponsors with local chefs and restaurant owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great place to live, to open a business, to create jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important that the restaurateurs meet sponsors like Ernst & Young or Citibank. That\u2019s massive because the next time they need a business loan, they might be coached by Ernst & Young and get the loan from Citibank.\u201d\n\nThat added benefit of opening up people\u2019s eyes to a community is something all of these endeavors have in common.", "title": "When Your Fixer-Upper Is Your Hometown", "authors": ["Paul Sullivan", "Wealth Matters"]}

These central figures in Aminatta Forna\u2019s fourth novel, \u201cHappiness,\u201d have come to middle age \u2014 and London \u2014 as worldly, self-sufficient individuals, albeit grieving private losses. Their friendship will deepen when Attila\u2019s niece is rounded up by the immigration authorities and the niece\u2019s young son goes missing. To find him, Jean enlists the help of her ragtag team of wildlife sighters \u2014 the immigrant street cleaners, traffic wardens and hotel staff who move stealthily, like hunted animals, in the shadows of the city, inhabiting the crepuscular seams of urban life.\n\nThe foxes are seen as outsiders, scavengers, carriers of violence and disease. When one apparently bites a child, there is an uproar. Caring liberals merely want these animals relocated to the country where they \u201cbelong.\u201d But others, like London\u2019s mayor, intend to extirpate them by whatever means necessary. It\u2019s seemingly no coincidence that Forna describes this man in terms that are familiar to observers of American politics: \u201cHis hair was parted low on one side from where the mass of it surged forward like an ocean breaker onto the beach of his forehead where it was cast backward onto the crown of his head, finally spilling over the back of his collar. That he was vexed was evidenced by the way he held up his hand, thumb and forefinger into the shape of an O which almost exactly mirrored the shape of his mouth.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAttila, watching the mayor on TV in full rhetorical throttle, pronounces him a hypomaniac. And Jean\u2019s evidence-based science is no match for the facile hysteria he whips up. Nature \u2014 trees, birds, wild animals \u2014 has no right to interfere with the lazy Western narcissism of this man\u2019s political base. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that complicated in getting rid of a pest,\u201d he declares. To which Jean retorts, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem unless you call it one.\u201d The bitten child is \u201crecovering\u201d in the hospital, having received six stitches. Jean\u2019s perceived lack of empathy, coupled with what is seen as her disdain for the need to keep all children safe from everything, make her the object of a bitter tweet storm.\n\nHer predicament parallels Attila\u2019s growing sense that much of his own work is pusillanimous and dangerously indulgent. Asked to give expert evidence in the case of a woman from Sierra Leone who set fire to her apartment after the sudden death of her husband, he struggles to find evidence of the PTSD her lawyers say will keep her from deportation. Instead, he identifies the cause of her anxiety as something perhaps even more insidious: \u201cthe monstrous absence of empathy\u201d of the white neighbors who avoided her after the tragedy, as if her grief were somehow contagious.\n\nAt its weakest, \u201cHappiness\u201d devolves into a stern lecture, delivered through Attila, arguing that our avoidance of discomfort has become a pathology, one that supports an ever-expanding therapeutic industry. As Attila excoriates our childish pursuit of wrinkle-free lives, Forna even gives him a phrase to describe it: \u201cprelapsarian innocence.\u201d In opposition, Forna offers the examples of certain resilient survivors of war zones and of Jean\u2019s foxes, who outwit the humans intent on annihilating them. Yet I found this dichotomy unconvincing. After all, we lack the resources to identify and treat most psychological victims of war; for the most part, they simply vanish into obscurity.\n\nYet Forna\u2019s finely structured novel powerfully succeeds on a more intimate scale as its humane characters try to navigate scorching everyday cruelties. Pausing to watch immigrant jugglers, Jean finds a bag hidden in the bushes containing worn sneakers and a school exercise book: \u201cSomething about it, this pitiful collection of belongings, the ambitions encompassed by the study notes in the exercise book, the men performing for an uninterested public; watching them brought Jean a feeling of pity and strange protectiveness.\u201d Like Jean, we can only guess at the horrors these jugglers have fled, only imagine the terrors of their journey and how much they have endured to come here, to the West, to perform for us, the \u201cuninterested public.\u201d", "title": "When a Young Immigrant Vanishes in London, Can a Wildlife Biologist Help?", "authors": ["Melanie Finn", "Aminatta Forna"]}
{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "Juska, the author of several other novels, including \u201cThe Blessings\u201d (2014), neatly lays the groundwork for a character who would be liable to miss flagrant warning signs. When Maggie\u2019s husband of 17 years left her for another woman, he accused Maggie of having been blind to his misery. Her teenage daughter, Anna, has a history of anxiety and disordered eating, and in the book\u2019s sections told from Anna\u2019s point of view, we learn that Maggie is only dimly aware of her daughter\u2019s continued struggles. Yet as the story moves through its many layers, Maggie\u2019s initial response to Nathan becomes problematic in a different way. As she tells her students, \u201cRemember, fact and truth are two different things.\u201d Nathan\u2019s essay is disturbing \u2014 especially in hindsight \u2014 but where do you draw the line? Nearly all personal writing betrays an element of sadness, shyness or emptiness. And when living behind screens becomes the norm, aren\u2019t even the most successful and well adjusted among us a little bit awkward and isolated?\n\nIn keeping with a novel about a writing instructor, Juska\u2019s prose is clean and straightforward. She strikes a cozy tone that is the literary opposite of toxic masculinity. In the opening pages, we learn that Maggie lives in a home with \u201chigh beamed ceilings, the soft pile of logs by the wood stove, the sun-bleached pillows piled in the window seat.\u201d We are also introduced to the loose-shingled red barn that \u201clooks romantic from a distance,\u201d and serves as the repository for Maggie\u2019s students\u2019 old essays. The pace can drag, and no novel needs so many descriptions of the color and cast of the sky. But in our age of political rancor and tweet storms befitting our state of emergency, there is something radical about a take on the gun problem that concerns itself more with raising questions than ire.\n\nPhoto\n\nDarkness suffuses \u201cHow to Be Safe,\u201d Tom McAllister\u2019s heady and unsettling exploration of America\u2019s gun violence epidemic. A mass shooting hits the Rust Belt town of Seldom Falls, Pa., once a leading producer of elevator parts and now a pocket of the nation where opportunity has dried up and \u201cguns were gifts you got for 13-year-old boys.\u201d The book\u2019s primary narrator is Anna Crawford, who was recently suspended from her job as a teacher at the school for her negative attitude and unstable behavior. When news of the shooting breaks, she is briefly considered a suspect, and neighbors and friends are all too willing to buy into the idea of Anna as villain. \u201cReports cited anonymous sources talking about everything I\u2019d ever done wrong \u2014 shoplifting, taking too many smoke breaks at work, knocking over a neighbor\u2019s mailbox after an argument. An ex shared nude photos of me, because, he said, anyone who could kill kids had lost her right to privacy.\u201d Anna is quickly cleared of the crime, but people still avoid her. Even her online therapist blocks her.\n\nWhile those surrounding Anna go through the motions of healing, she does not grant herself forgiveness. She is steadfast in her sadness, perhaps the one thing she has claim to. Staggering about town, often half-drunk by midafternoon, she serves as a docent to tragedy and all that follows: the media swarms, the rallies, the memorials, the political infighting, the blip of a presidential visit, the hashtags. In a sadly Delphic feat, McAllister imagines a Friday morning student reflection program called \u201cNever Again.\u201d\n\nYet this is far more than a ripped-from-the-headlines story. McAllister, the author of the melancholic novel \u201cThe Young Widower\u2019s Handbook\u201d (2017), delivers here a portrait of a nation vibrating with failure and humiliation. Anna\u2019s history with abusive men long predates the shooting, which partly explains her willingness to serve as sponge for a fresh cycle of misogynistic vitriol. She contends with jeers and emailed threats, only to empathize with her abusers. One of the book\u2019s greatest successes is its exploration of the overlapping forces and impulses behind our nation\u2019s sexual-harassment and firearms crises. Anna visits a confession booth that has popped up on her town\u2019s main street. \u201cI said I was lazy and unfocused and I understood why I was unlovable, but I still wished it weren\u2019t so. Then I said sometimes at night I think maybe I\u2019m actually the one who did the shooting.\u201d\n\nMcAllister is a writer of poetic inclinations, and his prose occasionally trips over itself with Werner Herzog-esque beats meant to impart resonance to a story that doesn\u2019t need it. In a section where Anna\u2019s ex-boyfriend Robbie makes her bacon and eggs, we learn: \u201cEggs are chickens that haven\u2019t been born yet. You eat them and then inside you they are born and your body is filled with birds.\u201d On the whole, though, the writing sears \u2014 and reminds us of literature\u2019s power to fill a void that no amount of inhaling the vapors of Twitter will satisfy. \u201cWhat I envisioned was this: No memorial at all. No stone. No American flags every three feet. No ribbons. No priests and no Bible. No symbolic floral arrangements to represent vitality or youth or rebirth. No poet reading a poem about rising from the ashes. No obelisks, for God\u2019s sake.

Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Faoro are high school friends from New Jersey; the other roommates are from Connecticut, North Carolina and Kosovo.\n\nThe expansiveness of their shared living space \u2014 and the big backyard \u2014 has allowed the housemates to hold large gatherings: at a Chinese New Year party, for example, friends helped them make, and consume, 800 dumplings.\n\nIt has also proved an ideal space for letting loose creative energies. Ms. Barringer, a seamstress and freelance costume technician, has ample space to work, as does Mr. Eisenberg, who does commercial design and fabrication, in addition to his own papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 projects.\n\nA few Saturdays ago, Mr. Strein, who interned at Dickson\u2019s, a butcher in Chelsea Market, used leftover beef tallow to make candles in the backyard.

Excessive marching, wild animals, kitchen duty, a looming scout test, nighttime raids, an evil-smelling latrine and 14-year-old bunkmates, both named Sasha, with no time for small girls who don\u2019t wear bras. Vera must speak and sing in Russian, bathe in a creek, attend Orthodox services in a downpour. Even her brother the wolf pup ignores her. Still, she doesn\u2019t give up. \u201cCamp is O.K.,\u201d she writes home gamely, requesting bug spray while reporting that she has no friends yet.\n\n\u201cBe Prepared\u201d is a complete delight, from the first sly jokes about the American Girl-ish doll Complicity to Brosgol\u2019s evocative artwork, which ranges from droll to wistful to outright lovely. Vera is a heroine for the ages, enduring day after lonely, buggy day without losing her spirit, compassion or love of beauty. Her sincerity is a beacon in the darkest latrine. Her triumphs are subtle and richly deserved. And her struggles are an eloquent reminder that even without outright tragedy, childhood is filled with challenges, cruelties and opportunities for courage.\n\nPhoto\n\nIvy Aberdeen is another girl of spirit, living with her parents, twin baby brothers and older sister, Layla, in the family home in rural Georgia \u2014 until a tornado rips their house away. That\u2019s just the beginning of Ashley Herring Blake\u2019s middle-grade debut, IVY ABERDEEN\u2019S LETTER TO THE WORLD (Little, Brown, 307 pp., $17.99; ages 8 to 12). The title alludes to Emily Dickinson\u2019s poem addressing a world \u201cthat never wrote to me,\u201d raising questions about what we withhold from the people closest to us.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, 12-year-old Ivy\u2019s best comfort comes from drawing, until she befriends June. Same-sex attraction is rare in middle-grade fiction, so it\u2019s gratifying to see the full arc of their relationship as Ivy\u2019s feelings move beyond simple friendship. Blake captures all the exhilaration of a first crush without shying away from Ivy\u2019s confusion and her worries about acceptance. Blake is adept at revealing how powerfully a misunderstanding can lodge in a child\u2019s mind, and Ivy\u2019s (mistaken) assumption about how her sister might react to her feelings for a girl adds another layer of tension to a family in crisis. The sisters\u2019 relationship is one of the great rewards of this novel that includes a large and vivid cast of secondary characters, who give the story its sense of abundant texture.\n\nSet in St. Thomas, Kheryn Callender\u2019s debut, HURRICANE CHILD (Scholastic, 211 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), introduces 12-year-old Caroline, who faces storms of her own.

Caroline\u2019s principal offers a dash of warmth and understanding. But adult support is threadbare; her mother is gone and her father \u201chas enough to worry about already.\u201d At first, this novel seems to be about self-reliance, and the kind of anger that can help brace a person in terrible circumstances. Caroline, we learn early, won\u2019t \u201ccry after a bum smacking.\u201d But she is innately loving, as memories of her mother make clear. Her friendship with a classmate, Kalinda, brings the first sign that Caroline\u2019s future may brighten.

Their journey toward understanding is harrowing but rewarding, because of all the dangers in this novel \u2014 from hurricanes to hauntings \u2014 the greatest by far is isolation. When Caroline risks heartbreak and scorn to tell Kalinda how she feels, most readers will understand why.\n\nThey will also know why Caroline embarks on a perilous search for her mother. The stakes are high, the revelations are serious and Callender doesn\u2019t sugarcoat. But readers who face troubles of their own may recognize Caroline\u2019s fierce resolve: Others may be \u201cfine with letting go of people they love,\u201d but she is not.

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "Gaddis writes as he presumably teaches, informally mixing literary and historical analyses with the observations of his students, reminiscing in a personal voice about long-ago conversations or sharing conclusions that came to him over the years of the seminar. The book is as much personal remembrance as strategic reflection, and is chock-full of aphorisms and enigmatic adages.\n\nPhoto\n\nGaddis believes the best way to hone strategic thinking is not just by mastering the advice of Machiavelli or Clausewitz (who both figure prominently in the class), much less contemporary high-tech wizardry, but also by understanding the interplay of history, literature and philosophy over 2,500 years of Western civilization \u2014 with occasional insights from Sun Tzu and other non-Western thinkers. In some sense \u201cOn Grand Strategy\u201d is a traditional argument for the value of classical education in the broadest sense.\n\nThe student of strategy learns to balance a grasp of detail with proper humility: It is, of course, wise to have a plan and contingencies. But how will these prompt rival counter-responses? Do such agendas have the means adequate for their ends? Or are they more dreams, warped by ego and emotion (\u201cAnd the heat of emotions requires only an instant to melt abstractions drawn from years of cool reflection. Decades devoid of reflection may follow\u201d)? The better way is to be Isaiah Berlin\u2019s versatile fox, not a single-minded obsessed hedgehog, or to embrace Machiavelli\u2019s virtues of imitation, adaptation and approximation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA recurrent theme is the danger of omnipresent hubris. Even a great power cannot master the unexpected and uncontrollable \u2014 from the great plague at Athens, to the harsh Russian winter, to I.E.D.s and tribal factionalism in Iraq. Why in the world, during a breathing spell in their war against Sparta, did democratic Athenians attack neutral and democratic Syracuse, 500 miles away? The answer is the same blinkered arrogance that sent Philip II\u2019s huge but poorly led Spanish Armada into the British northern seas. Understanding the underappreciated role of irony is essential for a leader, and might have prevented the disasters of both 415 B.C. and 1588. Tolstoy and Clausewitz appreciated that bad things can come from good intentions and vice versa. The best generals live with and react to paradoxes, Gaddis argues. The worst ignore or seek to undo them.\n\nPhoto\n\nGaddis sees these more successful global strategists as rope-a-dope pragmatists who remain elastic and patient enough to capitalize on events and opportunities as they unfold, rather than forcing them to fit preconceived schemes. Caesar tries to force a Roman republic into a global hegemony without full cognizance of the inevitable blowback from centuries of republican government, and so predictably is assassinated by a dying generation of dreamy senators. His savvier adopted son, Augustus, like the later Otto von Bismarck, builds coalitions, finds pre-existing seams to exploit at home and abroad, and waits to take advantage when enemies \u2014 or friends \u2014 stumble. Stalin\u2019s prewar Bolshevik nightmare was responsible for 20 million dead, but apparently was not so loathsome that the Soviet Union could not prove temporarily useful for Churchill and Roosevelt in bleeding out the Nazi Wehrmacht.\n\nMorality matters, if defined less as self-righteous ardor and more as self-awareness of a leader\u2019s effect on those around him and an appreciation of paradox. A pragmatic St. Augustine has no problem with war \u2014 if it is a last resort to save civilization, without which there can be neither calm nor organized religion.\n\nStill, courting calculated risk is essential. The gambler Winston Churchill took chances in 1940, albeit rational ones backed by educated guesses that, for all Hitler\u2019s bluster, the Third Reich had neither the air nor sea power to destroy the Anglosphere. Risk is not always risk when it is the natural expression of national advantages and a mixture of caution and audacity.\n\nPhoto\n\nGaddis\u2019s American heroes are Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, who he thinks \u201crescued democracy and capitalism.\u201d Roosevelt somehow was cognizant early on of how the singular military and economic potential of America might save Europe and Asia, but only if he first prepared reluctant Americans materially and psychologically for the inevitable war to come. Woodrow Wilson, among others, was not so successful in creating a postwar peace because he forced conditions to preconceived realities that bore little resemblance to emerging ironies at Versailles \u2014 and was without a sellable idea of an American role after World War I.\n\nGaddis concludes with an invaluable warning that true morality embraces neither messianic interventionism nor the quest for utopianism \u2014 indeed that is how millions become deluded, endangered or doomed. Instead, ethical leadership pursues the art of the possible for the greater (not the greatest) good. Augustine did not demand the city of God absolutely over the city of man. Augustus did not self-righteously return the Principate to the strife of the late republic.

Last year, the New England Patriots went to the White House on April 19.\n\nSome teams choose to visit the White House later in the year, particularly if they can combine it with a trip to play against the Redskins or the Ravens, who are based near Washington.\n\nThe Eagles will probably have several prominent no-shows if the team makes the trip from Philadelphia. After their victory over the Patriots in February, some top players, including safety Malcolm Jenkins, defensive lineman Chris Long and wide receiver Torrey Smith, said they would not visit the White House if invited.\n\nIn an interview on CNN, Mr. Smith said he would not go to a party if the host were a sexist or a racist or insulted his friends. \u201cSo why is it any different when this person has the title of president of the United States?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple to me.

Long before he bought the team, he earned a doctoral degree in social policy and lectured on topics like incarceration rates. In the lobby at the Eagles\u2019 training complex, he put large photos of Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk, rather than sepia-tone images of the team\u2019s best former players, to remind visitors of the team\u2019s higher mission.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Weeks after Mr. Trump attacked the league, several dozen owners, players and league executives met to discuss a plan to donate money to an array of groups fighting social injustice. At one point, a player said that it was difficult to trust the owners because they supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Lurie took exception.\n\n\u201cAnother fact I want to throw out there: Many of us have no interest in supporting President Trump,\u201d Mr. Lurie said, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times. \u201cYes, there are some. There are some players who do, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is not where you brandish a group of people because they own assets in a sport we love, supporting what many of us perceive as, you know, one disastrous presidency,\u201d he said, using a vulgarity to emphasize \u201cdisastrous,\u201d then adding, \u201cDon\u2019t quote me.\u201d\n\nThe Trump White House has been the source of tension with other sports teams. In September, after Stephen Curry of the N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors said that he and his teammates were considering a boycott of the visit, Mr. Trump announced that the team would not be invited.\n\nThe history of sports teams visiting the White House dates to the 19th century, when baseball teams were invited. President Jimmy Carter is believed to be the first to invite an N.F.L. team, when he welcomed the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1980. The visits became a yearly tradition during the Reagan administration, and nearly every Super Bowl champion since then has received an invitation.\n\nThe few exceptions include the Giants, in 1991, who did not go because of the first Gulf War, and the Denver Broncos in 1999, presumably because President Bill Clinton was embroiled in impeachment proceedings.", "title": "When \u2014 if Ever \u2014 Will the Super Bowl Champion Eagles Visit the White House?", "authors": ["Ken Belson", "Michael D.

Just how many stark naked males there are and whether the girl hippies are equally unclothed has been the subject of urgent dispute among those who have been attending previews of \u2018Hair\u2019 during the last three weeks.\u201d\n\nMs. Bender reported that the amount of nudity varied throughout the preview performances. Mr. Ragni told her, \u201cAnybody who feels like it can take his clothes off. Everybody wants to now, even the stagehands. We turned them on.\u201d\n\nThe nudity in \u201cHair\u201d continues to push boundaries. In 2014, a production of the show in Los Angeles marked the first time full-frontal nudity was seen onstage at the Hollywood Bowl. And in 2017, a London production at The Vaults included a clothing-optional performance.\n\n\u2018Hair\u2019 and Its Cultural Relevance Today\n\nToday, gay characters are routinely portrayed onstage, marijuana enjoys legal protection in some states and antiwar sentiment is less prevalent in the United States. Nudity, if not ubiquitous, appears onstage with some frequency. And bad language? It\u2019s no big deal.\n\nThough much has changed between 1968 and 2018, \u201cHair\u201d continues to be relevant. Many of the cultural divides that began to express themselves in 1968 seem to still exist today. Flag burning, for example, remains a contentious issue.\n\nPerhaps this is why \u201cHair\u201d has continued to be produced so frequently. Since the first Broadway production closed in 1972, four subsequent Broadway revivals have been staged, the most recent at the St. James Theater in 2011.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s just the music that drives its popularity. Mr. Barnes said in his review, \u201cThis is a happy show musically,\u201d while also noting \u201cGalt MacDermot\u2019s music is merely pop-rock, with strong soothing overtones of Broadway melody.\u201d Despite this somewhat lukewarm appraisal, Mr. Barnes wrote that the music \u201cprecisely serves its purpose, and its noisy and cheerful conservatism is just right for an audience that might wince at \u2018Sergeant Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u2019\u201d", "title": "When \u2018Hair\u2019 Opened on Broadway, It Courted Controversy From the Start", "authors": []}

But not much has.\n\nSome laws have been tightened, and the Indian government now wants to apply the death penalty for rapists of young children. But rape conviction rates are still low and dozens of Indian politicians accused of sexual abuse still get elected (though that is clearly not unique to India).\n\nIndia remains so deeply divided along religious, ethnic and political lines that even a crime this awful instantly gets politicized, sucked into the vortex of a never-ending communal war. Many scholars blame the rise of the Hindu right, saying it has made it open season on Muslims, no matter where or how young they are.\n\nAfter the girl\u2019s death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose party is rooted in Hindu nationalism, came under heavy criticism for not speaking out quickly enough to denounce the attack. Only after protests erupted did he address this case and another recent rape allegation, saying \u201cour daughters will definitely get justice.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Mr. Modi\u2019s party deny that they mishandled this or that their politics have polarized India. All they had been trying to do after the girl died, they said, was \u201cpacify the people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, some of the staunchest defenders of the suspects in the girl\u2019s killing have been high-level officials in Mr. Modi\u2019s party.

The suspect posted a gruesome video of the attack on social media, where it went viral. Among Hindu extremists, the attacker became a hero overnight. And while many Indians were sickened, many others were enthused.\n\nThe list goes on: Muslims lynched for transporting cows, an animal Hindus revere. A Muslim boy stabbed on a train. Just last week, the police said that a youth leader from Mr. Modi\u2019s political party bragged about burning down hundreds of homes of Rohingya refugees, Muslims from Myanmar.\n\nScholars say it is hard not to see the girl\u2019s killing as part of an ominous pattern. According to a recent analysis, hate crimes have risen sharply on Mr. Modi\u2019s watch. The victims are mostly Muslims and lower-caste Hindus.\n\nThe authorities in the Rasana area are struggling to contain the anger, on both sides. This area, like most of India, is religiously mixed, with Hindus and Muslims living close to one another and usually getting along, until someone stirs them up.\n\nPhoto\n\nFirst it was Hindu lawyers physically blocking police officers from filing charges in the girl\u2019s killing at a court. Then protests and counterprotests broke out, some violent and led by officials in Mr. Modi\u2019s party who asserted that the suspects had been set up and were innocent.\n\nDozens of Hindu housewives and grandmothers joined in, carrying out a hunger strike, saying they were ready to die. Several nearly did and had to be hospitalized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe talking points among the Hindu protesters ring with a certain sameness: They accuse the state government of being manipulated by Muslims. And they are demanding that the Central Bureau of Investigation, a federal agency widely seen as a tool of Mr. Modi\u2019s party, take over the investigation from the state police.\n\nAt the same time, Muslim protesters in other parts of this state have flooded into the streets \u2014 and clashed with the police \u2014 insisting that the suspects be hanged.\n\nThe state government in Jammu and Kashmir, an area mostly administered by India but the subject of a decades-long and very bloody dispute with Pakistan, is already on the brink. It is facing a stubborn insurgency in the Kashmir Valley and a heavy crackdown by the Indian security forces.\n\nThe government itself is an awkward alliance formed purely for political survival between a Muslim-led party pushing for autonomy and Mr. Modi\u2019s party, the Hindu-right Bharatiya Janata Party, known as the B.J.P. (Neither party won enough votes to control the State Assembly on its own.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn mid-April, two state ministers from the B.J.P. who joined protests in support of the suspects in the rape case were forced to resign to keep this shaky political alliance alive.\n\nStill, the ousted politicians doubled down and continued to protest, along with some lawyers. Across India, especially in big cities, many people, no matter what their religion was, were disgusted by the crime and the divisiveness that followed. But the instigating and abuse continued.\n\nAccording to several accounts in the Indian news media, one prominent Hindu lawyer insulted a lead investigator, saying, \u201cShe is a girl, how intelligent can she be?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The girl, who loved her horses and would ride them without a saddle using her scarf as the reins, was nowhere to be found.\n\nHer father felt something was deeply wrong. He immediately grabbed a flashlight and organized a search party, scouring all the ditches, drains and farms in the area. Nothing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey went house to house. Nothing.\n\nWith panic rising, and dozens of fellow nomads joining him, they waded into the nearby woods. Still, nothing.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen they came to a small Hindu temple. The nomads said they were intimidated by the man who presided over it, a former revenue officer known for his ability to read palms, horoscopes and, some even said, the future. He reassured the girl\u2019s parents in a voice of authority: Don\u2019t worry. Your daughter\u2019s fine. Someone is looking after her.\n\nAccording to the police, at that very moment, a group of young men, directed by this same temple custodian, was raping the girl in the temple. After three days they decided to kill her.\n\nThe motive for the crime, investigators say, was nothing less than ethnic cleansing. Investigators said that Sanji Ram, the custodian at the temple, hated the nomads for coming into his area and that he orchestrated the killing to drive them away.\n\nThe nomads come from a predominantly Muslim ethnic group called the Bakarwals. For generations, they have drifted across Jammu and Kashmir with flocks of sheep and goats, and horses and dogs, threading their way through rugged mountain valleys and clip-clopping down crowded roads.\n\nThey stand out, with their colorful tents pitched next to highways and their light eyes.\n\nSeveral Bakarwal elders said they did not know how big their community was, maybe 200,000, nor were they sure of their origins. Some said they came from the Caucasus, others said Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s written our history,\u201d said Talib Hussain, a Bakarwal elder.\n\nBut life is changing for the Bakarwals. A few families have begun to settle in the Rasana area, buying land from Hindu farmers, building sturdy brick houses and sticking around more of the year so their children can go to school, a big step forward for them. The dead girl\u2019s family was among them.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis infuriated Sanji Ram, whom villagers described as a devout Hindu and a passionate Modi fan. Several villagers said Mr. Ram was happy to lease his farmland to Hindu nomads but never, as a policy, to Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestigators said that Mr. Ram recruited a son, a nephew and a number of other young men from the village to kidnap the 8-year-old girl.\n\n(Her name is being withheld because an Indian court has threatened to jail journalists for revealing any information about her or her family. The court says this is necessary to protect the family\u2019s dignity, though the girl\u2019s name was already given out by police officers and is all over social media.)\n\nAfter she was killed and her body dumped in a ditch, investigators say two other police officers, both Hindu, destroyed evidence. Before the girl\u2019s dress was turned over to a crime lab, the officers tried to scrub it clean.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t work, and investigators said they had \u201cclinching\u201d DNA evidence. They also said that all eight suspects confessed.\n\nFew, if any, Hindus in Rasana accept this. On a recent day, several Hindu elders took me to the temple, a little pink building at the edge of the woods. The floor was cleanly swept concrete, the walls decorated with wrinkled, brightly colored posters of Hindu gods.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Suresh Sharma, a villager who helped Mr. Ram at the temple. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the girl could have been locked in here, people coming and going all the time.\u201d\n\nBut that in itself seemed hard to believe.

But it also means holding the line on church teachings that young activists disagree with.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are also differences in approach. Pastors often want to work within the system to effect change, while many activists try to disturb and upend the system.\n\nBishop Blake is not someone to be found on protest lines or shouting down law enforcement; he tends to advocate through more formal channels. He departs from some activist ministers in his social conservatism, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. Yet he tries to strike a welcoming posture in an era of activists who can feel like the church is judging them.\n\nHe hosted a rally at his church to protest the killing of Trayvon Martin. Last year, he wrote a letter to the mayor of St. Louis suggesting that if police practices were not reformed, his denomination could take its annual convention \u2014 and the millions of dollars that come with it \u2014 elsewhere.

Last year, the Rev. Dr. William Barber II, the pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C., helped to start the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, patterned after the effort that Dr. King established to address urban poverty. Dr. King\u2019s campaign, which was to include setting up an encampment in Washington, was cut short by his death.\n\nDr. Barber is apt to politicize his sermons on Sundays and advocate civil disobedience to win change.

Instead, it is proposing a system that would require a certain proportion of auto parts to be made by workers earning certain wages.\n\nThat proposal is likely to be more palatable to Canada and could also encourage Mexico to ultimately pay higher wages. And it could help Mr. Trump court the votes of congressional Democrats, who complain that Mexico\u2019s low wages are the reason companies have relocated auto production from the United States.\n\nStill, the proposal is likely to face opposition from Mexican negotiators, given that their current wage scales are too low to qualify.

Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance, arguing that these changes would do little to address the mercantilist and protectionist trade policies China has adopted for decades.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s advisers said the president remains resolute and views the pugilistic approach as the only way to force China to end two decades of industrial policies that have hollowed out American manufacturing and resulted in a ballooning trade deficit.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested in a tweet that he saw no reason to back down, since the United States was already on the losing end of trade with China.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion.

He added that the volume of the tariffs was in line with the White House\u2019s calculation that the Chinese have cheated the United States out of $50 billion worth of intellectual property through coercion and cyberattacks.\n\nWhile tariffs would affect a small part of the overall United States economy, they impinge on a relatively large share of American exports to China. If China places tariffs on $50 billion of goods from the United States, as promised, that would be more than one-third of American exports to China. In contrast, American tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods would affect only one-tenth of China\u2019s vast exports to the United States.\n\nWithin that slice of the economy, the pain could be acute. American farmers and manufacturers, in particular, could suffer. On Wednesday, China said it would penalize American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, hours after the United States announced tariffs on flat-screen televisions, medical devices and industrial machinery.\n\nThe economic effects could also quickly escalate beyond tariffs. The United States is preparing restrictions that could prevent China from investing in high-tech industries like semiconductors and electric vehicles, and it may consider other restrictions, including visas.\n\nChina, in return, could make life more difficult for the many American companies that do business in the country, or pare back its purchases of United States debt.

It has long been exempt from the type of cost-benefit analysis that the Office of Management and Budget performs on most rules that government agencies issue.\n\nWith a host of unintended or unclear provisions stemming from the rapid passage of the law, the Treasury will need to decide how the legislation is implemented. It has already begun issuing guidance to clarify the law\u2019s intent and in March moved to block hedge funds and private equity firms from trying to circumvent a new rule aimed at limiting the use of the so-called carried interest tax break.\n\nSome congressional Republicans are rooting for Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s office to wield greater oversight of the tax law, in the hopes that it would push for the most lenient interpretations of regulations that enable the largest number of businesses to pay lower rates under the law. Other lawmakers and business groups are pulling for Mr. Mnuchin, believing that adding review by the Office of Management and Budget could slow down the creation of regulations that businesses say they need to make investment and tax planning decisions this year.\n\nMr. Mulvaney has taken the view that tax regulations issued by the Treasury are of significant economic importance and that decisions that determine the fate of hundreds of millions of dollars are being made without sufficient scrutiny by his office. The budget office analyzes regulations issued by agencies across the federal government, with its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determining whether agencies have sufficiently addressed problems during rule-making and either accepting regulations or sending them back to be reworked.\n\nThe Treasury Department does consult the budget office on some of its rule-making, but since a 1983 memorandum of understanding, the office has not had the authority to review the Treasury\u2019s tax guidance, on the theory that it is not economically significant enough to warrant it.\n\nAn executive order from Mr. Trump last year called for that arrangement to be re-examined. With the Treasury Department now playing a greater role in policymaking \u2014 for instance, overseeing enforcement of parts of the Affordable Care Act and trying to limit corporations from engaging in mergers to avoid taxes \u2014 Mr. Mulvaney and other White House officials think that the I.R.S. should be subject to greater accountability when making decisions that often go beyond technical clarifications.\n\nGreater accountability, however, could come with costs.\n\nIf Mr. Mulvaney wins the argument, \u201cit will slow the process down,\u201d said John A.

Treasury officials are concerned that the budget office lacks the resources and tax expertise to properly assess tax guidance and that the process will get bogged down, potentially delaying rules to clarify the law for months. One early hurdle would be hiring; the budget office does not currently employ its own team of tax lawyers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a moderate level of concern that it could potentially slow down the guidance process,\u201d said Ken Spain, a partner at CGCN Group, a lobbying firm with a number of tax-related clients. \u201cAny time you blur the lines on what is already a tricky process to navigate, it\u2019s going to give the business community some degree of heartburn.\u201d\n\nOfficials from previous administrations also say that opening the tax regulation effort beyond Treasury would invite not just comments from the budget office, but from the White House political team and other advisory groups in the government.\n\n\u201cMidlevel political appointees get their fingers in there, find out when the meetings are and have their opinions,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution who served in President Barack Obama\u2019s Treasury Department.\n\nSuch an expansion, Mr. Looney said, also offers more avenues for lobbyists to press their case for why their clients should receive more preferable tax treatment. \u201cThe swamp is going to be enriched by this one,\u201d he said.\n\nBudget office officials say the desire for final oversight over the tax bill is in line with the administration\u2019s deregulatory push and that a more uniform approach to rule-making would benefit the federal government.

The Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or S.O.F.R., was created to wean the world\u2019s financial markets off the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, a benchmark rate that currently serves as the basis for hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial instruments \u2014 from interest rate swaps to credit card and mortgage debt \u2014 that incorporate floating interest rates. Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and financial institutions alike have wanted to find a replacement for Libor, as the process for setting the rate has been vulnerable to manipulation. The New York Fed\u2019s new rate is based on the rates in the active market for a kind of short term-loan known as a repurchase agreement, or repo, which uses Treasury securities as collateral. Matt Phillips\n\nREGULATION\n\nCompanies in Britain must lay out gender pay gaps.\n\nBy Wednesday, thousands of companies with at least 250 employees in Britain must publish figures showing their gender pay gap for the fiscal year ending in 2017. The requirement to submit this data to the government has put pressure on companies to explain the differences, which are often a result of fewer women in management and more women in lower-paid levels or occupations. EasyJet, one of the companies that has already filed, reported a 52 percent pay gap and its chief executive cut his salary by 34,000 pounds to match his female predecessor\u2019s earnings. The filings have fueled debate over pay for women, which has been under greater scrutiny since the British Broadcasting Corporation attracted high-profile criticism for its pay practices.

March\u2019s data, due from the Labor Department on Friday, is unlikely to match those highs. Still, all signs point to the job market \u2014 and the economy, in general \u2014 remaining strong.

And in good news for workers, economists expect a modest pickup in wage growth, which was sluggish in February and has been weak for much of the nearly nine-year-long recovery.

Many called him a good listener, while others described him as approachable, free of the rigidness and inaccessibility of typical party chiefs.\n\nThrough it all, he has also been a relentless defender of the revolution and the principles and politics it brought.\n\nStories of his Everyman qualities have spread widely in recent years: how he rode his bike to work instead of taking a government vehicle during gas shortages; how he defended the rights of a gay club in Santa Clara in the face of protests; how he patiently listened to academics grouse (sometimes about him) as minister of higher education.\n\nMore recently, he was a leading voice in the push for internet access in Cuba, arguing that the nation could not seal itself off from the outside world.

I know bureaucracy. This is not my first rodeo. But at one point, I lost it, just sobbing, wondering what I was going to do.\u201d\n\nThese borrowers are not alone. As of 2016, according to FedLoan data that the Department of Education used in a presentation, FedLoan had processed 1,068,888 employer certification forms and rejected one-third of them. Of those rejected, 21 percent presented an unqualified employer, though it\u2019s not clear how many were close calls, as the National Association of Social Workers may have been.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a scorching report last summer about an array of public service loan forgiveness messes. It noted that some borrowers reported months of delays in getting answers about certification form questions. One complainant reported that his form was rejected because of employer ineligibility while his co-worker\u2019s was approved a week later.\n\nAs for that litigation I mentioned before, one lawsuit over certification problems does shed some light on these matters. The American Bar Association and four individual borrowers, some of whom experienced the same FedLoan flip-flop as Mr. Francum, sued the Department of Education in late 2016. In a brief last year, the department, opining on the topic of whether people can rely on FedLoan not to change its mind, said that any response from FedLoan \u201cdoes not reflect a final agency action on the borrower\u2019s qualifications\u201d for forgiveness.\n\nIn other words, that certification form is by no means certain. Which is pretty rich, given that the Department of Education introduced the forms several years ago precisely because so many people were confused about whether their employment qualified. So good luck to you if you work for, say, a 501(c)(6) and want some financial certainty in your life. (I know of no employees of a 501(c)(3) organization whose employment was rejected, and the Department of Education website indicates that none of them should be. Please get in touch with me if it has happened to you.)\n\nAnd no, FedLoan will not precertify a job before you apply. Nor will it allow a forward-thinking employer to send in a job description for preapproval before trying to hire someone. Once upon a time, FedLoan\u2019s website encouraged employers to brag to prospective employees about current workers who had received certification, but that ended quickly once the American Bar Association\u2019s dumbfounded lawyers pointed it out in a legal filing.\n\nThat suit shows no sign of settling soon. So people like Ms. Gramlich wait and wonder. \u201cI\u2019ve been advocating for less fortunate populations my whole adult life, and here I am one of those people now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I cannot get out of this mess.\u201d", "title": "Who Is a Public Servant?

My first actual puzzle was published on October 14, 2015 at BuzzFeed. If you have not done any of the BuzzFeed puzzles, beware: they\u2019ve got a \u2026 different tone from more standard newspaper fare. I miss it!\n\nWhen was your first New York Times crossword published?\n\nMy first New York Times crossword came out just two weeks after the BuzzFeed one. I had to go to seven stores before I could find a physical copy of The New York Times. Leave it to a millennial not to be able to find a newspaper.\n\nHow did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?\n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed puzzles of various sorts \u2014 I was the kid who would rather figure out the Towers of Hanoi than \u2026 uh \u2026 play tag? Is that what normal kids did? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve read. I also really enjoyed playing Scrabble growing up, as well as more general word games. During my junior year of high school I went to my first M.I.T. Mystery Hunt which is where \u201cpaper puzzling\u201d started morphing into a passion for me, and I soon started solving crosswords regularly.\n\nWhat made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?\n\nThe summer before senior year of high school I got it into my head that making a crossword must be something I can do \u2014 it\u2019s basically the same as playing Scrabble! Little did I realize how difficult it really is. I decided I wanted to try making one for my high school\u2019s newspaper, and it\u2019s an abomination that we printed it. Among its funnier flaws was the presence of the entry IS IT TEN? clued as \u201cAre we eating brunch?\u201d That terrible, terrible puzzle (made in Excel!) might have been a one-off, fun project I did and forgot about a few weeks later, if not for the auspicious introduction of David Quarfoot to my high school\u2019s math department my senior year. He saw my pitiful attempt and one-upped me by writing an actually good crossword for the school paper, but he also encouraged me to start writing crosswords seriously. He showed me the software people use to help write good puzzles, as well as where to find a quality word list, not to mention a ton of other advice. My initial efforts improved, but I just didn\u2019t get super invested right away for whatever reason, and my interest petered out. I put crosswords on the back burner during college, never making another serious attempt until spring of my senior year \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what spurred this on exactly, but it was probably the free time I had while also embracing the \u201csenior spring\u201d attitude. But that attempt turned into two, which turned into 10, which has now turned into \u2026 many.\n\nWhy do you do this to yourself?\n\nTo rescue my hometown, Natick, Mass.\u2019s heinous reputation among crossword people. For real, I was very confused when I first got into crosswords and read about \u201cNaticks\u201d considering I did spend 18 years of my life there. I even used to watch the marathon from there, like the clue mentions! Seriously, I love making crosswords because I find grid construction to be a fun and satisfying problem to solve, and theme development/clever cluing to be nice creative outlets. I also really enjoy sharing my puzzles with friends and watching them solve/hearing their feedback. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but making something which provides people I care about a fun experience is really gratifying to me, and crosswords are the medium that\u2019s best allowed me to do that (unless you count karaoke, which my drunken self absolutely does).\n\nDo you use a computer software constructing program and, if so, which one? What do you like about it?\n\nI mostly use CrossFire for grid construction. To be honest, I primarily use it over Crossword Compiler because I have a Mac \u2014 I\u2019ve used and liked both. I really like CrossFire\u2019s user interface, and the grid-filling software in general is just such an improvement over by-hand construction that it\u2019s difficult to imagine myself being anywhere near as strong at grid design as I am without it. The software, in tandem with my word list (formed by taking Jeff Chen\u2019s word list, adding a bunch of stuff manually and via web scraping, and scoring some stuff with a simple algorithm based mostly on Google hits) allow me to make much better grids than I used to be able to in a fraction of the time.\n\nHow many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?\n\nThis is sort of difficult to count. Whenever I hear either a \u201cfun phrase\u201d or a new, crossword-friendly name or word (e.g. OMI, NIETO), I put it into my Notes app and add it to my list later. I also sometimes discover a new corpus of idioms or movies or something that I add programmatically to my word list. These tasks vary in time investment, but I\u2019d say it averages to about one hour of active management per month, plus whatever time I spend manually adjusting scores while constructing.\n\nWhat entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why? And with what entry would you deliberately fail the \u201cbreakfast test,\u201d and why?\n\nBesides the standard crossword crutches which I do my best to avoid (my personal absolute no-noes are random Roman numerals and massive obscurities which happen to have nice letters), there are some problematic words which, despite their prevalence in spoken or written English, I\u2019d never include. An example of such an entry is GYP, whose etymology I learned the hard way \u2014 by including it in a crossword (thinking it was benign) and hearing that it had ruined some solvers\u2019 experiences. [The word GYP is thought to be a slur against the Roma people. \u2014 D.A.] Any entry which has the power to do that \u2014 or which perpetuates the oppression of some oppressed group, or otherwise causes pain \u2014 is one I will not knowingly include in a crossword. In terms of the breakfast test \u2026 I think that some of my BuzzFeed puzzles will tell you how I feel about it! If I had my way, anything that doesn\u2019t fall under the umbrella from the previous paragraph would be fair game. I\u2019ve already debuted SEXILE in The New York Times, and entries that Will [Shortz, The Times\u2019s crossword editor] has asked me to edit out of my submitted grids include B.S. METER and KISS ASS. I\u2019m sure similar things will happen going forward, as I continue trying to push boundaries. Also, c\u2019mon, URINE has such nice letters!\n\nWhat are you working on these days?\n\nI contributed two puzzles to Queer Qrosswords, a puzzle pack organized by Nate Cardin by LGBTQ+ constructors to benefit LGBTQ+ charities. It \u201ccame out\u201d (ha) recently, so please consider a) supporting some awesome charities and b) solving some awesome puzzles!\n\nThank you for spending time with us, Mr. Trabucco.\n\nYour thoughts?", "title": "Who Made My Puzzle?: Sam Trabucco", "authors": ["Deb Amlen"]}

According to a 2017 poll by the Levada Center, 38 percent of Russians regard the mass murderer Joseph Stalin as the \u201cmost outstanding person\u201d in world history, followed by Mr. Putin at 34 percent.\n\nHere\u2019s where the intellectual dimension of the Great Game comes in: Societal self-criticism, alien to a large part of Russian society, is a defining feature of many Western countries. Publicly expressed and debated tensions between the state and the people, and among various factions of the public, are what make a liberal society tick.\n\nBut the strength of this skepticism can prove to be a weakness if exploited by a force that seeks the destruction of the very concept of truth. As an intellectual force, Russia is to Europe what Mephisto is to Faust: \u201cI am the Spirit that denies!\u201d To paraphrase Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who wrote the most famous version of their story: For all the West has built, should rightly to destruction run.\n\nThis is why the Russian disinformation and its grotesque twisting of facts is so effective. Mr. Putin knows that Europeans deeply distrust their governments on questions of war and peace, especially after several of them relied on twisted intelligence to justify the Iraq war. The poison used on the former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England, and the chemical weapons dropped with impunity on the children of Syria kill people as well as trust in elected representatives in London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nThere is no doubt that the international community has violated its own standards at times, conducting legally questionable or outright illegal actions in Kosovo, Iraq and Syria. Russia and China are doing the opposite: using their power as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to block justice and to undermine the West.\n\nWho will win in the long run? It is too soon to know whether the West is willing to stand up collectively to the challenge. The good news, though, is that Russia and China may yet lose at the new Great Game. It\u2019s expensive to play, and global power grabs untethered to a broader vision of global order tend to falter, as resources and lives expended abroad fail to bring peace and progress at home.\n\nThe German poet Theodor Fontane famously described the catastrophe that ended the British Army\u2019s attempt to secure hegemony against Russia in the Hindu Kush in 1842: \u201cWith 13,000 the trek began \u2014 one came home from Afghanistan.\u201d In one way or another, Russia and China may soon reap similar results.", "title": "Opinion | Who Will Win the New Great Game?", "authors": []}

The coalition of black leaders, which includes Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democratic congressman and former mayor of Kansas City, has a street on the East Side in mind: Paseo Boulevard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Paseo, as it is known, cuts a 10-mile north-south path through Kansas City that is a mix of promise and struggle. Parts of the boulevard have wide, grassy medians, Grecian columns, pergolas and classically styled mansions. But it also passes blighted homes, empty lots and depressed property values. It was named after Paseo de la Reforma, a grand thoroughfare in Mexico City.\n\nFor two years, advocates have lobbied the parks board, which oversees the city\u2019s boulevard system, to change the name. Jean-Paul Chaurand, the board president, responded last month with a letter stating that longstanding policy has been to name streets after local residents who made significant contributions to the city. He suggested creating a commission to discuss the renaming further.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat did not sit well with the advocates, who are pushing for the City Council to act, or for a referendum that would allow voters to decide the issue.\n\n\u201cIt is a travesty to the progress of racial justice and racial integration that it\u2019s being stopped,\u201d said Vernon P. Howard Jr., president of the city\u2019s chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a leader of the coalition pushing to rename Paseo Boulevard.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have white folks cross east of Troost,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cLet\u2019s have them make this an integrated street, where they are required to stretch themselves and be a part of the African-American community.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne prominent black leader who is skeptical of the idea is the mayor, Sly James.

Boulevard,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one in a shopping area. I\u2019ve never seen one that\u2019s been in anything other than a black neighborhood. Is Martin Luther King strictly a black hero? I would say not. I think he\u2019s a hero for everybody, and he ought to be honored that way.\u201d\n\nAt least 955 streets in the United States have been named after Dr. King, and they tend to be in lower-income areas with predominantly black populations, said Derek H. Alderman, a professor of geography at the University of Tennessee. But the idea that placing Dr. King\u2019s name on a street somehow causes a community to decline is inaccurate, Dr. Alderman said. It is more likely the other way around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of the politics of the naming process,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were often the only streets that some African-American activists could get named for Dr. King.\u201d\n\nSince the first renaming of a street for Dr. King \u2014 in Chicago in 1968 \u2014 such moves have spurred debates in cities like Indianapolis a decade ago, and High Point, N.C., in 2015. Businesses and residents often complain about the hassles of address changes. Some people lament the supplanting of historical street names. Others say bluntly that the King name would hurt their communities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Others have proposed streets in upscale areas that are mostly white, like the J.C. Nichols Parkway, which runs near the Country Club Plaza shopping district. Mr. Nichols, a developer who died in 1950, used racially restrictive covenants to prevent nonwhites from living in certain neighborhoods.\n\nMr. James, the mayor, appointed an advisory group this month to talk to residents and figure out the best way to honor Dr. King.\n\n\u201cWhy not put it right in the heart of the affluent part of the city,\u201d said Rita Hoop, a 50-year-old lawyer who is white, as she walked through the plaza, which Mr. Nichols designed. \u201cThat racial divide will not be addressed until every community addresses it, not just the black community.\u201d\n\nBut when Warren Turner, 53, was asked if a King street should be placed in a white neighborhood, he did not mince words: \u201cHell, no.\u201d\n\nMr. Turner, who has lived on the Paseo for a quarter-century, said it would be an honor to have it renamed because of what Dr. King meant to black people like him.\n\n\u201cI think, maybe it would bring some of the prestige back to the Paseo,\u201d he said.", "title": "Whose Neighborhood Should Get a Street Named for Dr. King?", "authors": ["John Eligon"]}

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "This week, Citi, clearly feeling the competitive heat, announced plans to add goodies to one of its American Airlines cards, including double miles on all restaurant and gas station purchases. While Citi did not offer up hard numbers like Delta and Amex, the company did tell me that the growth of its American Airlines card portfolio was outpacing the predictions of overall economic metrics.\n\nA few years ago, Barclays made an aggressive bid for the JetBlue credit card business and won it. The bank now reports that it has doubled the overall size of the business in two years.\n\nSo what accounts for the continued appeal of the airline credit card, and who ought to have one?\n\nSome things that have always been true about these cards remain so: If you travel a lot on the same airline and spend a lot of money in your everyday life, earning the same reward currency when you travel and when you\u2019re using your card can help you quickly earn more and better free trips.\n\nBut things have also changed. In addition to the miles, many of the mileage cards now come with privileges. You might get a free checked bag. Or you can board your flight in the fifth group instead of the seventh, thereby getting space for your carry-on in the overhead bin.\n\nThis is clever and ought to inspire some healthy cynicism. After all, the airlines created the problem that the cards are now solving by charging for checked baggage. Now, for an annual fee of $95 or $150 or $450, you can avoid multiple $25 or $35 nicks for checking bags. And even if you can\u2019t be sure what a free flight will cost in miles, at least the baggage giveaway is something tangible.\n\n\u201cAs points become more confusing and devalued, people turn to perks \u2014 and they are easy to see and easy to value,\u201d said Brian Kelly, the founder of The Points Guy, a website that makes money from referrals by channeling consumers to the most useful cards. (Wirecutter, a New York Times company, has also made money this way in the past and plans to again in the future.) \u201cThe issuers are doubling down on perks, and it appears to be paying off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe card offerings are now complicated enough that it\u2019s nearly impossible to offer generic advice about who ought to have one. For me, the sign-up bonuses for the Delta and American cards plus the baggage fee waivers on Delta were enough to persuade me. The top-tier American card also comes with airline lounge access, which I finally treated myself to (and deducted on my taxes) after too many years of hacking together standing desks at abandoned airport gates so I could work comfortably on my laptop.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne bit of math should be obvious: If you\u2019re carrying a balance and paying 18 percent annual interest, the rewards don\u2019t come close to making that up. According to American Express, 21 percent of its outstanding credit card loans belonged to people with a Delta credit card as of the end of 2017.\n\nMany people don\u2019t spend or earn enough to justify switching cards. Sure, they might extract a bit more value from a simple card that refunds 2 percent of all purchases, but then they would have to change all automated payments, which is a giant headache.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that plenty of people simply do not know that generic points cards from the likes of Chase and its Ultimate Rewards program might offer more in the way of returns. Many bloggers offer helpful advice about this offering.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want to do the math themselves, Jay Sorensen did it for you. Mr. Sorensen, who runs the IdeaWorksCompany airline revenue consultancy, ran hundreds of simulations to come up with the following data for an award seat availability study he does with the rental site CarTrawler: The average value per mile redeemed for economy class travel ranges from 0.7 cents to 1.4 cents, depending on the airline. For long-distance business class seats, it ranges from 1.5 cents to 2.4 cents. So a 2 percent cash-back card would more often be a better value.\n\nBut some consumers simply do not care about the math \u2014 or perhaps are hypnotized by years of gauzy marketing and the daydreaming it inspires. \u201cWhile you may be right that the value per mile has decreased, that\u2019s a function of a lot of things,\u201d said Denny Nealon, who runs Barclays\u2019 United States partnerships business. \u201cAirline miles are an incredibly aspirational and valuable currency.\u201d\n\nAnd those aspirations cement the emotional hook of credit-card airline miles: They offer the distinct possibility that you could use everyday spending to get yourself as far as possible from your everyday life.\n\n\u201cWhat we are in the business of doing is travel,\u201d said Bridget Blaise-Shamai, vice president for loyalty and customer insights at American Airlines. \u201cWe could have this conversation 100 years from now, and it would remain relevant.\u201d", "title": "Why Airline Credit Cards Have an Enduring Appeal", "authors": ["Ron Lieber", "Your Money"]}

The winter of 1947 was the hardest to hit Europe in a generation. The continent was in ruins, its people were starving and its economies were out of balance. Italy\u2019s and France\u2019s inflation rates were 62.1 and 49.2 percent respectively. In the face of this bleak situation, American policymakers concluded that the key to restoring the prewar European standard of living was restarting the German economy. And this could only be achieved by priming the German pump, and those of the other continental economies, with American dollars. While pragmatic, this proposition was, to put it mildly in the political context of the time, very controversial. Hitler had been dead only two years. Germany was divided into four sectors. Its people were widely loathed and two of its conquering powers, the Soviet Union and France, were counting on reparations from their former Nazi enemy to help rebuild their own economies. Meanwhile, most Americans were done with foreign entanglements. As future Secretary of State Dean Acheson, then a subordinate at the State Department, later recalled, two slogans neatly summed up the popular view of foreign policy: \u201cBring the boys home\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a Santa Claus.\u201d\n\nBehind this American pragmatism \u2014 which would ultimately translate into $14.3 billion of assistance between 1948 and 1952 (approximately $130 billion in 2017) \u2014 was neither philanthropy nor dreams of hegemony. Secretary of State George Marshall and the powerful thinkers at the department of that era \u2014 Will Clayton, George Kennan and Charles \u201cChip\u201d Bohlen in addition to Acheson \u2014 were looking for a way to stabilize the continent without long-term American economic and security commitments. Although anticommunism and the Keynesian approach to capitalism animated the effort, the Marshall Plan was nonetheless not some clever attempt to sell American surpluses to broken economies. As Steil notes, to help Western Europeans get back on their feet the Truman administration \u201corchestrated a shift in policy at home away from protectionism and toward encouragement of imports.\u201d\n\nThe Marshall Plan was successful, though, as Steil, the senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, demonstrates, American intervention in postwar Europe did not quite work out as expected. While the Marshall Plan helped restart Europe\u2019s economy, it did not provide a glide path for the United States to avoid a long-term security entanglement.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe American initiative provoked Stalin and led to a series of Kremlin overreactions and misjudgments, including the Berlin blockade of 1948-49. Stalin, who had no interest in reviving Germany\u2019s economy let alone European trade, was the captive of conspiracy theories that seamlessly linked the Marshall Plan to a capitalist plot to resurrect the anti-Soviet Wehrmacht. Meanwhile, although Western Europeans worried about Stalin \u2014 especially after he tightened his control over Eastern Europe in response to widespread enthusiasm for Marshall Plan funds \u2014 they were just as concerned about the ghost of Hitler. In a way that Harry Truman and George Marshall did not predict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was the price that London and Paris expected the United States to pay for their full participation in what they saw as the risky endeavor of resuscitating the western part of Germany. In the words of Lord Hastings Ismay, NATO\u2019s first secretary general, the Atlantic alliance existed to keep \u201cthe Soviet Union out, the Americans in and the Germans down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSteil has written an ambitious, deeply researched narrative that not only delineates the interlocking gears of international politics and economics in early postwar Europe but also introduces a large cast of statesmen, spies and economists that perhaps only Dickens could have corralled with ease. Slow going at first, the book builds intellectual excitement as the characters act and react to one another. NATO is not the only unexpected child of American pragmatism. So, too, in a way, is the drive for European unity. As the American vision for reconstruction takes hold, the British and, especially, the French come to embrace economic coordination not out of a commitment to liberalism but out of a desire to contain the German economic power that Washington is determined to unleash. This pragmatic European turn is dramatized by the conversion of the influential French statesman Jean Monnet. Immediately after the war, Monnet was an economic nationalist, advocating for French control of the German Ruhr to ensure French domination of postwar European steel production. He then became a champion of European unity.", "title": "Why American Pragmatists Saved Postwar Europe", "authors": ["Timothy Naftali", "Benn Steil"]}

But that national decline in infant mortality has since slowed. In 1960, the United States was ranked 12th among developed countries in infant mortality. Since then, with its rate largely driven by the deaths of black babies, the United States has fallen behind and now ranks 32nd out of the 35 wealthiest nations.

In fact, a black woman with an advanced degree is more likely to lose her baby than a white woman with less than an eighth-grade education.\n\nThis tragedy of black infant mortality is intimately intertwined with another tragedy: a crisis of death and near death in black mothers themselves. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality \u2014 the death of a woman related to pregnancy or childbirth up to a year after the end of pregnancy \u2014 is now worse than it was 25 years ago. Each year, an estimated 700 to 900 maternal deaths occur in the United States. In addition, the C.D.C. reports more than 50,000 potentially preventable near-deaths, like Landrum\u2019s, per year \u2014 a number that rose nearly 200 percent from 1993 to 2014, the last year for which statistics are available. Black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts, according to the C.D.C. \u2014 a disproportionate rate that is higher than that of Mexico, where nearly half the population lives in poverty \u2014 and as with infants, the high numbers for black women drive the national numbers.\n\nMonica Simpson is the executive director of SisterSong, the country\u2019s largest organization dedicated to reproductive justice for women of color, and a member of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an advocacy group. In 2014, she testified in Geneva before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, saying that the United States, by failing to address the crisis in black maternal mortality, was violating an international human rights treaty. After her testimony, the committee called on the United States to \u201celiminate racial disparities in the field of sexual and reproductive health and standardize the data-collection system on maternal and infant deaths in all states to effectively identify and address the causes of disparities in maternal- and infant-mortality rates.\u201d No such measures have been forthcoming. Only about half the states and a few cities maintain maternal-mortality review boards to analyze individual cases of pregnancy-related deaths. There has not been an official federal count of deaths related to pregnancy in more than 10 years. An effort to standardize the national count has been financed in part by contributions from Merck for Mothers, a program of the pharmaceutical company, to the CDC Foundation.\n\nThe crisis of maternal death and near-death also persists for black women across class lines. This year, the tennis star Serena Williams shared in Vogue the story of the birth of her first child and in further detail in a Facebook post. The day after delivering her daughter, Alexis Olympia, via C-section in September, Williams experienced a pulmonary embolism, the sudden blockage of an artery in the lung by a blood clot. Though she had a history of this disorder and was gasping for breath, she says medical personnel initially ignored her concerns. Though Williams should have been able to count on the most attentive health care in the world, her medical team seems to have been unprepared to monitor her for complications after her cesarean, including blood clots, one of the most common side effects of C-sections. Even after she received treatment, her problems continued; coughing, triggered by the embolism, caused her C-section wound to rupture. When she returned to surgery, physicians discovered a large hematoma, or collection of blood, in her abdomen, which required more surgery. Williams, 36, spent the first six weeks of her baby\u2019s life bedridden.\n\nThe reasons for the black-white divide in both infant and maternal mortality have been debated by researchers and doctors for more than two decades. But recently there has been growing acceptance of what has largely been, for the medical establishment, a shocking idea: For black women in America, an inescapable atmosphere of societal and systemic racism can create a kind of toxic physiological stress, resulting in conditions \u2014 including hypertension and pre-eclampsia \u2014 that lead directly to higher rates of infant and maternal death. And that societal racism is further expressed in a pervasive, longstanding racial bias in health care \u2014 including the dismissal of legitimate concerns and symptoms \u2014 that can help explain poor birth outcomes even in the case of black women with the most advantages.\n\n\u201cActual institutional and structural racism has a big bearing on our patients\u2019 lives, and it\u2019s our responsibility to talk about that more than just saying that it\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Dr. Sanithia L. Williams, an African-American OB-GYN in the Bay Area and a fellow with the nonprofit organization Physicians for Reproductive Health. \u201cThat has been the missing piece, I think, for a long time in medicine.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

Around Christmas 2016, in a rage, he attacked her, choking her so hard that she urinated on herself. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Do you want to die in front of your kids?\u2019 \u201d Landrum said, her hands shaking with the memory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen he tore off her clothes and sexually assaulted her. She called the police, who arrested him and charged him with second-degree rape. Landrum got a restraining order, but the district attorney eventually declined to prosecute. She also sought the assistance of the New Orleans Family Justice Center, an organization that provides advocacy and support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Counselors secreted her and her sons to a safe house, before moving them to a more permanent home early last year.\n\nLandrum had a brief relationship with another man and found out in March 2017 that she was pregnant again and due in December. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; though I had a lot going on, I wanted to give my boys back the sister they had lost, \u201d Landrum said, looking down at her lap. \u201cThey don\u2019t forget. Every night they always say their prayers, like: \u2018Goodnight, Harmony. Goodnight, God. We love you, sister.\u2019 \u201d She paused and took a breath. \u201cBut I was also afraid, because of what happened to me before.\u201d\n\nEarly last fall, Landrum\u2019s case manager at the Family Justice Center, Mary Ann Bartkowicz, attended a workshop conducted by Latona Giwa, the 31-year-old co-founder of the Birthmark Doula Collective. The group\u2019s 12 racially diverse birth doulas, ages 26 to 46, work as professional companions during pregnancy and childbirth and for six weeks after the baby is born, serving about 400 clients across New Orleans each year, from wealthy women who live in the upscale Garden District to women from the Katrina-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward and other communities of color who are referred through clinics, school counselors and social-service organizations. Birthmark offers pro bono services to these women in need.\n\nRight away, the case manager thought of her young, pregnant client. Losing her baby, nearly bleeding to death and fleeing an abusive partner were only the latest in a cascade of harrowing life events that Landrum had lived through since childhood. She was 10 when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. She and her family first fled to a hotel and then walked more than a mile through the rising water to the Superdome, where thousands of evacuees were already packed in with little food, water or space. She remembers passing Charity Hospital, where she was born. \u201cThe water was getting deeper and deeper, and by the end, I was on my tippy-toes, and the water was starting to go right by my mouth,\u201d Landrum recalls. \u201cWhen I saw the hospital, honestly I thought, I\u2019m going to die where I was born.\u201d Landrum wasn\u2019t sure what doulas were, but once Bartkowicz explained their role as a source of support and information, she requested the service. Latona Giwa would be her doula.\n\nGiwa, the daughter of a white mother and a Nigerian immigrant father, took her first doula training while she was still a student at Grinnell College in Iowa. She moved to New Orleans for a fellowship in community organizing before getting a degree in nursing. After working as a labor and delivery nurse and then as a visiting nurse for Medicaid clients in St. Bernard Parish, an area of southeast New Orleans where every structure was damaged by Katrina floodwaters, she devoted herself to doula work and childbirth education. She founded Birthmark in 2011 with Dana Keren, another doula who was motivated to provide services for women in New Orleans who most needed support during pregnancy but couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cBeing a labor and delivery nurse in the United States means seeing patients come in acute medical need, because we haven\u2019t been practicing preventive and supportive care all along,\u201d Giwa says. Louisiana ranks 44th out of all 50 states in maternal mortality; black mothers in the state die at 3.5 times the rate of white mothers. Among the 1,500 clients the Birthmark doulas have served since the collective\u2019s founding seven years ago, 10 infant deaths have occurred, including late-term miscarriage and stillbirth, which is lower than the overall rate for both Louisiana and the United States, as well as the rates for black infants. No mothers have died.\n\nPhoto\n\nA scientific examination of 26 studies of nearly 16,000 subjects first conducted in 2003 and updated last year by Cochrane, a nonprofit network of independent researchers, found that pregnant women who received the continuous support that doulas provide were 39 percent less likely to have C-sections. In general, women with continuous support tended to have babies who were healthier at birth. Though empirical research has not yet linked doula support with decreased maternal and infant mortality, there are promising anecdotal reports. Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement noting that \u201cevidence suggests that, in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support provided by support personnel, such as a doula, is associated with improved outcomes for women in labor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn early November, the air was thick with humidity as Giwa pulled up to Landrum\u2019s house, half of a wood-frame duplex, for their second meeting. Landrum opened the door, happy to see the smiling, fresh-faced Giwa, who at first glance looked younger than her 23-year-old client. Giwa would continue to meet with Landrum weekly until her Dec. 22 due date, would be with her during labor and delivery and would make six postpartum home visits to assure that both mother and baby son remained healthy. Landrum led Giwa through her living room, which was empty except for a tangle of disconnected cable cords. She had left most of her belongings behind \u2014 including her dog and the children\u2019s new Christmas toys \u2014 when she fled from her abusive boyfriend, and she still couldn\u2019t afford to replace all her furniture.\n\nThey sat at the kitchen table, where Giwa asked about Landrum\u2019s last doctor visit, prodding her for details. Landrum reassured her that her blood pressure and weight, as well as the baby\u2019s size and position, were all on target.\n\n\u201cHave you been getting rid of things that are stressful?\u201d Giwa asked, handing her a tin of lavender balm, homemade from herbs in her garden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to be worried, but sometimes. \u2026\u201d Landrum said haltingly, looking down at the table as her hair, tipped orange at the ends, brushed her shoulders. \u201cI feel like my heart is so anxious.\u201d\n\nTaking crayons from her bag, Giwa suggested they write affirmations on sheets of white paper for Landrum to post around her home, to see and remind her of the good in her life. Landrum took a purple crayon, her favorite color, and scribbled in tight, tiny letters. But even as she wrote the affirmations, she began to recite a litany of fears: bleeding again when she goes into labor, coming home empty-handed, dying and leaving her sons motherless. Giwa leaned across the table, speaking evenly. \u201cI know that it was a tragedy and a huge loss with Harmony, but don\u2019t forget that you survived, you made it, you came home to your sons,\u201d she said. Landrum stopped writing and looked at Giwa.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s O.K., why don\u2019t I write down something you told me when we talked last time?\u201d Giwa asked. Landrum nodded. \u201cI know God has his arms wrapped around me and my son,\u201d Giwa wrote in large purple letters, outlining \u201cGod\u201d and \u201carms\u201d in red, as Landrum watched. She took out another sheet of paper and wrote, \u201cHarmony is here with us, protecting us.\u201d After the period, she drew two purple butterflies.\n\nPhoto\n\nLandrum\u2019s eyes locked on the butterflies. \u201cEvery day, I see a butterfly, and I think that\u2019s her. I really do,\u201d she said, finally smiling, her large, dark eyes crinkling into half moons. \u201cI like that a lot, because I think that\u2019s something that I can look at and be like, Girl, you going to be O.K.\u201d\n\nWith this pregnancy, Landrum was focused on making sure everything went right. She had switched to a new doctor, a woman who specialized in high-risk pregnancies and accepted Medicaid, and she would deliver this baby at a different hospital. Now she asked Giwa to review the birth plan one more time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 30, I go on call, and that means this phone is always on me,\u201d Giwa said, holding up her iPhone.\n\n\u201cWhat if. \u2026\u201d Landrum began tentatively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping a backup doula informed of everything,\u201d Giwa said. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everything\u2019s going to be O.K. this time,\u201d Landrum said. But it sounded like a question.\n\nWhen the black-white disparity in infant mortality first became the subject of study, discussion and media attention more than two decades ago, the high rate of infant death for black women was widely believed by almost everyone, including doctors and public-health experts, to affect only poor, less-educated women \u2014 who do experience the highest numbers of infant deaths. This led inevitably to blaming the mother. Was she eating badly, smoking, drinking, using drugs, overweight, not taking prenatal vitamins or getting enough rest, afraid to be proactive during prenatal visits, skipping them altogether, too young, unmarried?\n\nAt Essence magazine, where I was the health editor from the late \u201980s to the mid-\u201990s, we covered the issue of infant mortality by encouraging our largely middle-class black female readers to avoid unwanted pregnancy and by reminding them to pay attention to their health habits during pregnancy and make sure newborns slept on their backs. Because the future of the race depended on it, we also promoted a kind of each-one-teach-one mentality: Encourage teenagers in your orbit to just say no to sex and educate all the \u201csisters\u201d in your life (read: your less-educated and less-privileged friends and family) about the importance of prenatal care and healthful habits during pregnancy.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1992, I was a journalism fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. One day a professor of health policy, Dr. Robert Blendon, who knew I was the health editor of Essence, said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d be interested in this.\u201d He handed me the latest issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, which contained what is now considered the watershed study on race, class and infant mortality. The study, conducted by four researchers at the C.D.C. \u2014 Kenneth Schoendorf, Carol Hogue, Joel Kleinman and Diane Rowley \u2014 mined a database of close to a million previously unavailable linked birth and death certificates and found that infants born to college-educated black parents were twice as likely to die as infants born to similarly educated white parents. In 72 percent of the cases, low birth weight was to blame. I was so surprised and skeptical that I peppered him with the kinds of questions about medical research that he encouraged us to ask in his course. Mainly I wanted to know why. \u201cNo one knows,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut this might have something to do with stress.\u201d\n\nThough I wouldn\u2019t learn of her work until years later, Dr. Arline Geronimus, a professor in the department of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, first linked stress and black infant mortality with her theory of \u201cweathering.\u201d She believed that a kind of toxic stress triggered the premature deterioration of the bodies of African-American women as a consequence of repeated exposure to a climate of discrimination and insults. The weathering of the mother\u2019s body, she theorized, could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, including the death of her infant.\n\nAfter graduating from the Harvard School of Public Health, Geronimus landed at Michigan in 1987, where she continued her research. That year, in a report published in the journal Population and Development Review, she noted that black women in their mid-20s had higher rates of infant death than teenage girls did \u2014 presumably because they were older and stress had more time to affect their bodies. For white mothers, the opposite proved true: Teenagers had the highest risk of infant mortality, and women in their mid-20s the lowest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeronimus\u2019s work contradicted the widely accepted belief that black teenage girls (assumed to be careless, poor and uneducated) were to blame for the high rate of black infant mortality. The backlash was swift. Politicians, media commentators and even other scientists accused her of promoting teenage pregnancy. She was attacked by colleagues and even received anonymous death threats at her office in Ann Arbor and at home. \u201cAt that time, which is now 25 or so years ago, there were more calls to complain about me to the University of Michigan, to say I should be fired, than had happened to anybody in the history of the university,\u201d recalls Geronimus, who went on to publish in 1992 what is now considered her seminal study on weathering and black women and infants in the journal Ethnicity and Disease.\n\nBy the late 1990s, other researchers were trying to chip away at the mystery of the black-white gap in infant mortality. Poverty on its own had been disproved to explain infant mortality, and a study of more than 1,000 women in New York and Chicago, published in The American Journal of Public Health in 1997, found that black women were less likely to drink and smoke during pregnancy, and that even when they had access to prenatal care, their babies were often born small.\n\nExperts wondered if the high rates of infant death in black women, understood to be related to small, preterm babies, had a genetic component. Were black women passing along a defect that was affecting their offspring? But science has refuted that theory too: A 1997 study published by two Chicago neonatologists, Richard David and James Collins, in The New England Journal of Medicine found that babies born to new immigrants from impoverished West African nations weighed more than their black American-born counterparts and were similar in size to white babies. In other words, they were more likely to be born full term, which lowers the risk of death. In 2002, the same researchers made a further discovery: The daughters of African and Caribbean immigrants who grew up in the United States went on to have babies who were smaller than their mothers had been at birth, while the grandchildren of white European women actually weighed more than their mothers had at birth. It took just one generation for the American black-white disparity to manifest.\n\nWhen I became pregnant in 1996, this research became suddenly real for me. When my Park Avenue OB-GYN, a female friend I trusted implicitly, discovered that my baby was far smaller than her gestational age would predict, even though I was in excellent health, she put me on bed rest and sent me to a specialist. I was found to have a condition called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), generally associated with mothers who have diabetes, high blood pressure, malnutrition or infections including syphilis, none of which applied to me. During an appointment with a perinatologist \u2014 covered by my excellent health insurance \u2014 I was hounded with questions about my \u201clifestyle\u201d and whether I drank, smoked or used a vast assortment of illegal drugs. I wondered, Do these people think I\u2019m sucking on a crack pipe the second I leave the office? I eventually learned that in the absence of a medical condition, IUGR is almost exclusively linked with mothers who smoke or abuse drugs and alcohol. As my pregnancy progressed but my baby didn\u2019t grow, my doctor decided to induce labor one month before my due date, believing that the baby would be healthier outside my body. My daughter was born at 4 pounds 13 ounces, classified as low birth weight. Though she is now a bright, healthy, athletic college student, I have always wondered: Was this somehow related to the experience of being a black woman in America?\n\nThough it seemed radical 25 years ago, few in the field now dispute that the black-white disparity in the deaths of babies is related not to the genetics of race but to the lived experience of race in this country. In 2007, David and Collins published an even more thorough examination of race and infant mortality in The American Journal of Public Health, again dispelling the notion of some sort of gene that would predispose black women to preterm birth or low birth weight. To make sure the message of the research was crystal clear, David, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Illinois, Chicago, stated his hypothesis in media-friendly but blunt-force terms in interviews: \u201cFor black women,\u201d he said, \u201csomething about growing up in America seems to be bad for your baby\u2019s birth weight.\u201d\n\nOn a December morning three days before her due date, Landrum went to the hospital for her last ultrasound before the birth. Because of the stillbirth the previous year, her doctor did not want to let the pregnancy go past 40 weeks, to avoid the complications that can come with post-term delivery, so an induction had been scheduled in 48 hours.\n\nDuring Giwa\u2019s last prenatal visit, the day before, she explained to Landrum that she would be given Pitocin, a synthetic version of the natural hormone that makes the uterus contract during labor, to start her contractions. \u201cWill inducing stress out the baby?\u201d Landrum asked. \u201cI can\u2019t lie; I used to wake up and scream, when I\u2019d be dreaming about getting cut open again. I know my body is fine, and I\u2019m healthy, but I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect how honest you are, and your trauma is real,\u201d Giwa told her, slowing down her words. \u201cBut my hope for you is, this birth can be a part of your healing. Your uterus is injured and has been scarred, but you\u2019ve pushed out two babies, so your body knows what it\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, lying on the table, Landrum looked out the window, smiling as the sound of her baby\u2019s heartbeat filled the room. A few minutes later, the technician returned and looked at the monitor. The baby\u2019s heart rate appeared less like little mountains than chicken scratching. He was also either not moving consistently or not breathing properly. A nurse left the room to call Landrum\u2019s doctor to get her opinion. The nurse returned in 20 minutes and gave Landrum the news that the baby would be induced not in two days but now. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait; we\u2019re going to get him out today,\u201d she said to Landrum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very anxious,\u201d Landrum told Giwa on the phone as she walked to labor and delivery, a few floors up in the same hospital, \u201cbut I\u2019m ready.\u201d An hour later, Giwa arrived, wearing purple scrubs, her cloth bag filled with snacks, lavender lotion and clary sage oil. She made sure the crayon-drawn affirmations were taped on the wall within Landrum\u2019s line of vision, then settled into a chair next to the bed, low-key but watchful. Though some doctors resent or even forbid the presence of a doula during labor and delivery \u2014 and some doulas overstep their roles and create conflict with doctors and nurses \u2014 Giwa says she and the other Birthmark doulas try to be unobtrusive and focused on what\u2019s best for the mother.\n\nA medical resident, who was white, like all of the staff who would attend Landrum throughout her labor and delivery, walked into the room with paperwork. Right away, she asked Landrum briskly, \u201cHave you had any children before?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe hadn\u2019t read the chart.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had three babies, but one died,\u201d Landrum explained warily, for the third time since she had arrived at the hospital that day. Her voice was flat. \u201cI had a stillbirth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe demise was last year?\u201d the resident asked without looking up to see Landrum stiffen at the word \u201cdemise.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I speak to you outside,\u201d Giwa said to the nurse caring for Landrum. In the hall, she asked her to please make a note in Landrum\u2019s chart about the stillbirth. \u201cEach time she has to go over what happened, it brings her mind back to a place of fear and anxiety and loss,\u201d Giwa said later. \u201cThis is really serious. She\u2019s having a high-risk delivery, and I would hope that her care team would thoroughly review her chart before walking into her room.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important roles that doulas play is as an advocate in the medical system for their clients. \u201cAt the point a woman is most vulnerable, she has another set of ears and another voice to help get through some of the potentially traumatic decisions that have to be made,\u201d says D\u00e1na-Ain Davis, the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the City University of New York, the author of a forthcoming book on pregnancy, race and premature birth and a black woman who is a doula herself. Doulas, she adds, \u201c are a critical piece of the puzzle in the crisis of premature birth, infant and maternal mortality in black women.\u201d\n\nOver the next 10 hours, Giwa left Landrum\u2019s side only briefly. About five hours in, Landrum requested an epidural. The anesthesiologist required all visitors to leave the room while it was administered. When Giwa returned about a half-hour later, Landrum was angry and agitated, clenching her fists and talking much faster than usual. She had mistakenly been given a spinal dose of anesthesia \u2014 generally reserved for C-sections performed in the operating room \u2014 rather than the epidural dose usually used in vaginal childbirth. Now she had no feeling at all in her legs and a splitting headache. When she questioned the incorrect dose of anesthesia, Landrum told Giwa, one nurse said, \u201cYou ask a lot of questions, don\u2019t you?\u201d and winked at another nurse in the room and then rolled her eyes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Landrum loudly complained about what occurred, her blood pressure shot up, while the baby\u2019s heart rate dropped. Giwa glanced nervously at the monitor, the blinking lights reflecting off her face. \u201cWhat happened was wrong,\u201d she said to Landrum, lowering her voice to a whisper. \u201cBut for the sake of the baby, it\u2019s time to let it go.\u201d\n\nShe asked Landrum to close her eyes and imagine the color of her stress.\n\n\u201cRed,\u201d Landrum snapped, before finally laying her head onto the pillow.\n\n\u201cWhat color is really soothing and relaxing?\u201d Giwa asked, massaging her hand with lotion.\n\n\u201cLavender,\u201d Landrum replied, taking a deep breath. Over the next 10 minutes, Landrum\u2019s blood pressure dropped within normal range as the baby\u2019s heart rate stabilized.\n\nAt 1 a.m., a team of three young female residents bustled into the room; the labor and delivery nurse followed them, flipping on the overhead light. They were accompanied by an older man Landrum had never seen. He briefly introduced himself as the attending physician before plunging his hand between Landrum\u2019s legs to feel for the baby. Landrum had been told that her OB-GYN might not deliver her infant, but a nurse had reassured her earlier in the day that if her doctor was not available, her doctor\u2019s husband, also an OB-GYN, would cover for her. This doctor, however, was not the husband, and no one explained the switch. Giwa raised an eyebrow.

His work \u2014 inspired by, and evocative of, graffiti \u2014 brought the street into the gallery, and vice versa, much as Jean-Michel Basquiat and his high school friend Al Diaz did around the turn of the decade, when their symbol \u201cSAMO\u201d suddenly sprouted on walls all across the city, the siren of a new sensibility.\n\nThe line between high and low culture, between fringe and mainstream, blurred. Hip-hop was one example. Madonna, who released her first album in 1983, was another. Both popularized and commercialized sounds and styles that Latino and black New Yorkers had already embraced. But they also reflected the abiding dissonance of those years: The very communities that were being creatively pillaged were being politically ignored and repressed, and their frustration would boil over as the decade progressed. Black New Yorkers marched in protest in 1986 after a young black man who was fleeing a mob of white youths was struck by a car and killed in the Howard Beach section of Queens. Those marchers were led by a fiery minister named Al Sharpton, whose relative anonymity at the start of the decade would be a distant memory by its end.\n\nJust as the era had its defining art and music, it had its signature restaurant, the Odeon. It opened in late 1980, pulling New Yorkers from more polished precincts to TriBeCa, which was then an urban frontier. In its sleek, unfussy dining room, glamour and grit sat cheek by jowl, and going to the bathroom to powder your nose could mean one of two things. That was immortalized in the novel \u201cBright Lights, Big City,\u201d which was published in 1984 and greeted less as fiction than as a distillation of the zeitgeist in all its greedy, seedy glory. It featured an illustration of the Odeon\u2019s Art Deco neon sign on its cover and established its author, Jay McInerney, as one of the nascent decade\u2019s bards. Like his protagonist, he relished being naughty but yearned to be rich; those desires were hardly irreconcilable in a city that simultaneously embraced the materialism of the Reagan era and rejected its moralism, where stretch limos deposited partygoers in unseemly neighborhoods and yuppies ran rampant while \u201cDie Yuppie Scum\u201d graffiti spread.\n\nThe Odeon was like Area, the rising Chelsea department store Barneys and so many other temples of the time: an improbable, irresistible nexus of tribes \u2014 bankers and sculptors, models and socialite housewives, power publicists and literary brats \u2014 that hadn\u2019t always played together before. \u201cThere had been a dividing line between uptown and downtown, and we wanted to make Barneys a hit so that everybody would come,\u201d Simon Doonan, who became the store\u2019s display director in the mid-80s, told me. \u201cWe broke down that division, which was more pronounced than it is now: The 1980s were when the cracks appeared.\u201d And Barneys was yet another gilded place to see and be seen, amid the wares of New York-based designers \u2014 Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors \u2014 who weren\u2019t so much clothes makers as shamans, with a cache and currency that rivaled any Hollywood star\u2019s.\n\nTheir labels live on, with less shimmer. So does the Odeon, minus the bathroom rites. But the most important survivor of the early 1980s \u2014 something that was crystallized then \u2014 is the idea of New York as a cradle like none other in America, the country\u2019s messiest and most mesmerizing laboratory. \u201cNew York today is stronger economically, culturally more important and has a much different position in the world than it did then,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy on the faculty of New York University since 1973. We have the early 1980s, in part, to thank for that.\n\nAnd I still feel the spirit, strivings and tensions of those years. We\u2019re a city once again at odds with the White House and its random and regressive edicts \u2014 with what it exalts and what it ignores. People are marching, though with pussy hats and Black Lives Matter signs as well as rainbow flags. We\u2019re at the forefront of the perversely belated quest for justice for women who have been sexually harassed and abused, and we\u2019re reckoning with how much our reality falls short of our ideals. New Yorkers, as always, come here to remake themselves \u2014 and to reinvent the city around them.

United States that \u201cwillfully\u201d is \u201ca word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.\u201d That means a court could interpret the provision as requiring proof a defendant purposely sought to mislead the government in filing a false certification. Such an interpretation would be a substantial hurdle to proving a violation.\n\nAnother possibility is having to show merely that executives knew they were engaged in wrongful activity. That is much easier to prove and something that prosecutors would no doubt prefer.\n\nCongress adopted a similar certification requirement in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 in response to the accounting frauds at Enron and WorldCom. Under the law, the chief executives and chief financial officers of publicly traded companies must certify that any report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cfairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operation\u201d of the company, with a knowing or willful violation subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nThe first high-profile prosecution under the statute involved Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of HealthSouth. But the case resulted in an acquittal, a black eye for the Justice Department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley certification statute has been used in only a few cases since. In each instance, prosecutors had evidence that the executive had direct knowledge of the fraudulent activity.\n\nAbsent proof of an executive\u2019s involvement, or at least knowledge, of the fraud, a willful violation of the certification requirement in Ms. Warren\u2019s legislation would be difficult to prove. We can expect executives to put in new procedures to show that they tried to comply with the law, which can provide a basis for claiming there was not an intentional violation of the certification requirement.\n\nFor those reasons, I doubt the Too Big to Jail Act would result in increased criminal liability for executives.

There is almost no variety of self-selecting online community where this dynamic doesn\u2019t hold at least some sway \u2014 a guardedness, whether overt or subtle, against taking time to entertain challenges or skepticism toward group dogma.\n\nThere\u2019s one very simple trend that might explain this, and a lot besides. As more people began to spend more of each day arguing about serious issues with strangers online, it became necessary to sort out which opinions could be summarily dismissed. So the devil\u2019s advocate is pictured as a highhanded nerd popping up to play logic games in the face of pressing issues. Concern trolls are disingenuous drags on the conversation. There\u2019s hand-wringing, derailing, distraction, tone policing, silencing, gaslighting, \u201csea lioning\u201d \u2014 a label for every depressing rhetorical habit that could possibly present itself, each term a tool for narrowing down the number of ideas waiting in line for your consideration. Taken as a whole, this taxonomy feels both totally rational and slightly desperate \u2014 a way of insisting, against abundant evidence to the contrary, that a productive conversation remains possible.", "title": "Why Have We Soured on the \u2018Devil\u2019s Advocate\u2019?", "authors": []}

At the border, I haven\u2019t seen a single Hamas flag, or Fatah banner, or poster for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, for that matter \u2014 paraphernalia that have been widespread in virtually every other protest I have witnessed. Here, we have flown only one flag \u2014 the Palestinian flag.\n\nTrue, Hamas members are participating, as they are part of the Palestinian community. But that participation signals, perhaps, that they may be shifting away from an insistence on liberating Palestine through military means and are beginning to embrace popular, unarmed civil protest. But the Great Return March is not Hamas\u2019s action. It is all of ours.\n\nAnd our action has been so much more than tires burning or young men throwing stones at soldiers stationed hundreds of meters away. The resistance in the encampments has been creative and beautiful. I danced the dabke, the Palestinian national dance, with other young men. I tasted samples of the traditional culinary specialties being prepared, such as msakhan (roasted chicken with onions, sumac and pine nuts) and maftool (a couscous dish). I sang traditional songs with fellow protesters and sat with elders who were sharing anecdotes about pre-1948 life in their native villages. Some Fridays, kites flew, and on others flags were hoisted on 80-foot poles to be clearly visible on the other side of the border.\n\nAll this was taking place under the rifle sights of Israeli snipers stationed about 700 meters away. We were tense, we were fearful \u2014 indeed, I\u2019ve been in the proximity of people getting shot and tear-gassed \u2014 but we were joyful. The singing, the dancing, the storytelling, the flags, the kites and the food are more than symbols of cultural heritage.\n\nThey demonstrate \u2014 clearly, loudly, vibrantly and peacefully \u2014 that we exist, we will remain, we are humans deserving of dignity, and we have the right to return to our homes. I long to sleep under the olive trees of Bayt Daras, my native village. I want to show Ali, Karam and Adam the mosque that my grandfather prayed in. I want to live peacefully in my historic home with all my neighbors, be they Muslim, Christian, Jewish or atheist.\n\nThe people in Gaza have been living one tragedy after another: waves of mass displacement, life in squalid refugee camps, a captured economy, restricted access to fishing waters, a strangling siege and three wars in the past nine years. Israel assumed that once the generation who experienced the Nakba died, the youth would relinquish our dream of return. I believe this is partly why Israel keeps Gaza on the brink of humanitarian collapse \u2014 if our lives are reduced to a daily struggle for food, water, medicine and electricity, we won\u2019t be able to think about larger aspirations. The march is proving that my generation has no intention of abandoning our people\u2019s dreams.\n\nThe Great Return March has kindled my optimism, but I am also realistic. Alone, the march will not end the siege and the occupation, address the huge power imbalance that exists between Israel and the Palestinians or right the historical wrongs. The work continues until everyone in the region can share equal rights. But I could not be more inspired by or proud of my people \u2014 seeing us united under one flag, with nearly unanimous acceptance of peaceful methods to call for our rights and insist on our humanity.", "title": "Opinion | Why I March in Gaza", "authors": []}

My wife, Jeanne, and I bought an apartment in New York City that we were later unable to sell when I got a job in Washington in the 1990s, and we were driven nearly to bankruptcy. Ultimately, we lost that apartment in foreclosure, which left me feeling like an utter failure.\n\nI hated dredging up the emotions from such a tumultuous time \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t? I felt the same angry tightness in my gut that hit me while I was trying to get a deadbeat tenant out of the New York apartment, the same weight on my chest I felt after giving up that apartment, then the biggest investment of my life. But I wanted to write a book that people might see a little of themselves in, and many of us have lived through financial stress and confusion. Telling it honestly might engage readers, and accomplish the main thing I was trying to do with the book: to reach readers who, like me, are a little afraid of thinking about money.\n\nI was also guided by that wonderful line from Jude Fawley, the tormented protagonist of Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cJude the Obscure,\u201d who said, \u201cI may do some good before I am dead \u2014 be a sort of success as a frightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBesides, two decades after the lowest point in our financial mess, the story has a happy ending. We did climb out of the tightest times. Although paying college costs for our three children did put us under financial pressure again, we have stood on our own. Also, I really did a creditable job of putting my financial life in order \u2014 getting a will, vetting my 401(k), assessing my life insurance and more. I could tell a story that, when all is said and done, I feel good about.\n\nOne of the delights of the project was tracking down the lawyer who guided us through the worst times, who had explained to me that, despite the advice of friends and even of another lawyer I\u2019d hired to help us through the tenant problem, we didn\u2019t have to file for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy specialist, Gregory Johnson, was great to reconnect with after all those years in a series of emails and an emotional phone call in which I was able to thank him for saving our financial lives. He said that he had seen so many cases like ours, and that he understood the anxiety we\u2019d gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s like the horror movies,\u201d he said; the biggest fear comes from anticipation.\n\nIn writing this book, I was aided by the fact that I had written about my family before. My previous book, \u201cOddly Normal,\u201d described raising our youngest son, Joseph, who had a difficult childhood and struggled with his sexuality. We as parents struggled, too, to help him become more comfortable with himself. That book, which I wrote with Joseph\u2019s permission and help, was received well, and that led me to think that sharing our financial stories might also lead to good things.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping.", "title": "Why I Wrote a Book About My Finances (Foreclosure and All)", "authors": ["John Schwartz"]}

I do not have custody of them \u2014 I lost it when I left the Hasidic world, and so I have no control over their education. Today, they cannot speak, read or write in English past a second-grade level. (As for my three daughters, their English skills are fine. Girls, not obligated with Torah study, generally receive a decent secular education.)\n\nLike me, my sons will be expected to marry young and raise large families. They too will receive no guidance on how to provide for them and will be forced into low-wage jobs and rely heavily on government support.\n\nThey are not alone. Across the state, there are dozens of Hasidic yeshivas, with tens of thousands of students \u2014 nearly 60,000 in New York City alone \u2014 whose education is being atrociously neglected. These schools receive hundreds of millions of dollars in government funding, through federal programs like Title I and Head Start and state programs like Academic Intervention Services and universal pre-K. For New York City\u2019s yeshivas, $120 million comes from the state-funded, city-run Child Care and Development Block Grant subsidy program: nearly a quarter of the allocation to the entire city.\n\nAccording to New York State law, nonpublic schools are required to offer a curriculum that is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to that of public schools. But when it comes to Hasidic yeshivas, this law has gone unenforced for decades. The result is a community crippled by poverty and a systemic reliance on government funding for virtually all aspects of life.\n\nMen like Mr. Felder, beholden not so much to his Hasidic constituents as much as to their leaders who promise him votes, would like to pretend that this problem doesn\u2019t exist. The leadership of the Hasidic community argues that the issue is exaggerated, an attempt by outsiders to malign their community. They point to outliers, successful entrepreneurs \u2014 the Hasidic-owned electronics store B & H Photo Video in New York City is often touted \u2014 as examples of success.\n\nBut these are rare exceptions.\n\nAccording to a report by Yaffed, or Young Advocates for Fair Education, an organization that advocates for improved general studies in Hasidic yeshivas, an estimated 59 percent of Hasidic households are poor or near-poor. According to United States Census figures, the all-Hasidic village of Kiryas Joel, an hour north of New York City, is the poorest in the country, with median family income less than $18,000.\n\nOne heavily Hasidic district of Brooklyn, South Williamsburg, has, over the last decade, shown dramatic increases in using public income support such as cash assistance, Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. New York\u2019s Hasidic community is also experiencing explosive growth \u2014 surveys show that the Jewish population of the five boroughs has increased for the first time in half a century, entirely because of the high birthrate among the ultra-Orthodox, which only increases the burden on taxpayers.\n\nKnowing all of this, it takes a special kind of audacity on Mr. Felder\u2019s part to successfully strong-arm the state\u2019s highest legislative body to legally deprive his own constituents\u2019 children of an education and a future. Some might call this chutzpah.

I\u2019ve survived divorced parents, a neglectful childhood, depression, an eating disorder, an abusive relationship, a traumatic car accident and a sexual assault. Seeing that list, it sounds absurd that all of that could happen to me. But here I am, paying for my therapy and yoga and journaling as often as I can. I\u2019m trying my best. Some of the women I work with are also going to school. When I think of their hard work, I swell with pride. I regard those who have survived eating disorders and toxic relationships as heroes. My friends and wonderful partner remind me almost daily that I\u2019m killing it, but I still think of myself as a loser. Some days I\u2019m furious with myself for not trying harder and being better. I beat up on myself for not going back to school sooner or getting a better job or writing more. I wish I could give myself the love I give others. And I wish I believed I can succeed because I\u2019m really not sure.

But that doesn\u2019t help if you yourself can\u2019t esteem who you are and what you\u2019ve done. Most of the letters we receive at Dear Sugars come from people just like you, Proud, who tell themselves the same bad story: that no matter how hard they work to transcend their struggles, they aren\u2019t enough. And this bad story always begets a bad outcome. Rather than taking pride in all you\u2019ve accomplished \u2014 supporting yourself, acing your classes, establishing loving relationships, working to heal yourself \u2014 you see only your inadequacies. Even the hardships you\u2019ve endured get written off as \u201cmelodramatic.\u201d The question is: Why? I suspect the answer lies in a kind of twisted loyalty to the sorrow of your past. When you grow up amid instability, fear, and sadness, these feelings become your default setting, the known, and the safe. And it\u2019s hard to leave them behind and enter the kingdom of self-love. It makes you feel na\u00efve and unguarded, fully vulnerable to what the writer Sarah Manguso calls \u201cthe burden of hope.\u201d\n\nCheryl Strayed: I couldn\u2019t agree more with Steve\u2019s point that you don\u2019t magically arrive in the land of self-love and confidence by accident, Proud. There are reasons you\u2019re struggling to feel O.K. about yourself: the wounds of your past. Everything else \u2014 your solid track record as a student and employee, your wonderful partner and friends, your deeply enriching self-care roster of therapy, yoga and journaling \u2014 are all thanks to you. Not luck. Not coincidence. You. You know why? Because you\u2019re a survivor. You have done incredibly well against many odds. And you\u2019ve done that, in part, by refusing to allow those wounds of yours to rule your life. Well done, sister. I\u2019m proud of you. You made it this far, but there\u2019s further to go.

Laundry hung out to dry on poles sticking out from the sides of buildings was so ubiquitous that it was jokingly called Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cnational flag.\u201d\n\nThat began to change in the 1980s, when washing machines and dryers became affordable as Hong Kong got wealthier, buoyed by the opening up of China\u2019s economy and the city\u2019s establishment as a major financial center.\n\nWalk around Hong Kong\u2019s public housing blocks and old tenement buildings today, and it quickly becomes clear that many residents still hang their clothes outside to dry. But rising incomes have allowed much of Hong Kong\u2019s population to move into sleek, glass apartment towers, without all the visible hanging laundry.\n\nNow, as housing prices grow ever more expensive per square foot, the challenge is no longer affording the washing and drying machines themselves, but finding the space to put them.\n\nOne result was a surge in demand for drop-off service at commercial laundries, which have long been common in Hong Kong. That led to such a backlog at some laundries that some customers faced days-long waits just to get their clothes back.\n\nPhoto\n\nEnter self-service laundromats.\n\nOn a recent evening after work, Michael Bolger, 27, sat reading a dog-eared book while waiting for his clothes at Coffee & Laundry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bolger, a native of Ireland who works at a bitcoin exchange, said that when he first moved to Hong Kong in 2016, his flat was too small to fit a dryer, and the humidity prevented his clothes from drying properly on a line.

The shop, steps away from a street full of antique stores, is tiny and strictly functional, with shiny white floor tiles, bright fluorescent lights and a single red bench. Instead of a cafe, there are lockers rented out to SF Express, a logistics company sometimes referred to as China\u2019s FedEx.\n\nPatten Mak, the chain\u2019s operations manager, said the combination of high demand and low maintenance and labor costs made it possible for even a tiny laundromat to earn the equivalent of thousands of dollars per month, enough to entice new chains to enter the market.\n\nAcross the harbor, in the working-class neighborhood of Tai Kok Tsui, a woman tapped away at a game of mah-jongg on her phone while waiting for her sheets to dry at a branch of Water Laundry, another local chain. Nearly every inch of the wall in the small laundromat was covered with machines.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cUs working class, we don\u2019t have the money to buy a washing machine, and there\u2019s no space to dry clothes at home,\u201d said the 40-year-old housewife, who gave her name as Ms. Lo.

The men\u2019s favorite Galen Rupp chased the lead pack until he dropped out around the 20-mile mark with hypothermia; in the women\u2019s race the favorites Molly Huddle and Shalane Flanagan dropped to paces much slower than their goal but still finished.

And evangelicals have their particular version of these Trump-the-indispensable conceits, from the analogies to King David (who slept around a lot, too, didn\u2019t he?) to the widespread belief that Trump\u2019s repeated against-the-odds victories mean that Providence somehow chose him for this role \u2014 and whom God has elevated, let no man impeach.\n\nBut for all their inevitable appeal, these are bad reasons to pre-emptively reject impeachment, in the Daniels case or any other that Mueller might reveal. And I don\u2019t just mean they\u2019re bad reasons because they\u2019re too partisan and tribal; I mean that the evidence from the last case like this, the Clinton impeachment in all its splendor, is that the partisan and tribal response does not necessarily serve your party or tribe that well.\n\nThere is no way of knowing exactly what would have happened, of course, had Clinton been pushed out by Senate Democrats and Al Gore installed in his place. But there are good reasons to suspect that as an incumbent steward of late-1990s prosperity untainted by his steadfast support for a lying boss, Gore would have had an easier time dispatching George W. Bush in 2000, and the entire trajectory of the early 2000s would have been more favorable to Democrats. And there are also good reasons to think that professional feminists, who contorted themselves absurdly in defense of Clinton\u2019s predatory conduct, would have been better off accelerating their reckoning with the pigs of liberalism rather than waiting for the age of Trump and the old age of Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThese lessons could apply to a Trump impeachment as much as to the Lewinsky affair. A Republican Party that ran in 2020 with a boring Midwestern guy (albeit, yes, one sure to be trailed by protesters in Handmaid outfits) as the steward of prosperity would not necessarily be worse off than a party lashed to its current leader; if Gerald Ford could almost win in Nixon\u2019s shadow, why not Pence in Trump\u2019s? And a religious conservatism that sacrificed a lot of cultural credibility in defending Trump might regain a little by abandoning him, vindicating itself against what seem now like reasonable charges of \u201ccharacter for thee but not for me\u201d hypocrisy.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s the providential aspect. Sure, making use of Donald Trump to keep Hillary Clinton from being president is a fascinating flourish by history\u2019s Author, but the idea that the Almighty might use a porn star to make Mike Pence president represents, if anything, an even more amazing miracle. So anyone interested in looking for the hand of God in history should probably welcome that miracle\u2019s arrival, rather than resisting in the name of MAGA.\n\nAm I jesting? Only to a point. That God has a sense of dramatic irony and narrative surprise seems like one of the most obvious lessons to be drawn from the Trump era. That God is using Trump not as an agent of his good work but as a kind of ongoing test of everyone else\u2019s moral character seems like a not-unreasonable inference to draw. That God would offer religious conservatives in danger of selling their souls a chance not just to step back from the brink but to literally replace Donald Trump with a fellow religious conservative \u2014 well, that seems like just the kind of opportunity that a beneficent deity would grant to erring members of his flock.\n\nAnd for those same religious conservatives to pass up the chance, preferring a scorched-earth battle in defense of priapism, would be a sad confirmation of the point that a beloved Christian author made many years ago: The doors of hell are locked on the inside.", "title": "Opinion | Why Not Mike Pence?", "authors": []}

Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with him.\n\nWhy did you choose to set this novel on Cape Cod?\n\nThe Cape is the scene of my childhood happiness. As a traveler, you look for conflicted or misunderstood or little known places \u2014 good places to write about. But the place that makes you happy as a child is one you return to \u2014 the blue remembered hills, the happy highways of the Housman poem. If you have the opportunity, you go back there to recapture that sense of serenity you had in your childhood. My childhood was late 40s, early 50s \u2014 a period when Cape Cod was small and simple. The cottage we rented didn\u2019t have a refrigerator; there was an ice man who delivered blocks of ice for the chest.\n\nI remember the sunshine, the beaches, the smell of the salt marshes. I grew up in Medford [Massachusetts], but my parents moved to the Cape, and I always wanted to come back here. And so, as soon as I had some money, around 1975, when I was living in London, I bought a house on the Cape and I\u2019ve spent every summer here since then.", "title": "Why Paul Theroux Loves Cape Cod", "authors": []}

Women were beginning to benefit from the addition of the word \u201csex\u201d to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and as the decade progressed, other groups began to assert their own claims to justice. Only five days before Kennedy\u2019s visit to Pine Ridge, Lyndon Johnson signed the Indian Civil Rights Act.\n\nKennedy\u2019s searing experience on a speaking tour of South Africa in 1966 may have had something to do with it, too. In Cape Town and elsewhere, he had enraged the apartheid regime with his forceful speeches against racial oppression. South Africa had created \u201chomelands,\u201d as the government called them; critics called them \u201cBantustans.\u201d African tribal populations were relocated there, to live in deep poverty. They were not very different from Native American reservations.\n\nAs a senator, Kennedy had focused increasingly on poverty, urban and rural, calling attention to inequality in a series of trips into some of the poorest parts of the country. In early February, he spent two days in eastern Kentucky\u2019s coal country, meeting with families trying to survive day to day. It was as if he were the senator from a much larger constituency than New York.\n\nFor all of these reasons, it was no surprise to see Kennedy devote extraordinary resources to a political constituency that had no ability to elect him. According to the historian Thurston Clarke, Kennedy scheduled approximately 70 events during the first month of his campaign \u2014 10 of them on Indian reservations or at Indian schools.\n\nHe began his journey on the morning of April 16. It required a complicated set of flights to reach a tiny town in Nebraska that served as the nearest airport. The long drive from there to the reservation in South Dakota was an education in itself. There was no infrastructure of the type Americans were used to. No buses, no banks, no supermarkets. Unemployment was 75 percent. Half of the homes lacked electricity or running water. Schools had no supplies. Life expectancy \u2014 48 years for men, 52 for women \u2014 was the second-lowest in the hemisphere, after that in Haiti.\n\nTwelve days earlier, Kennedy had accomplished what seemed impossible, when he connected with an angry and distrustful African-American audience in Indianapolis the night that Dr. King was killed. A few days later, after attending a Sunday church service in Washington, he took an impromptu walk through the riot-torn parts of the city, attracting an awe-struck crowd of hundreds. Now he was doing it again, forging a common bond with fellow citizens who looked nothing like him.\n\nKennedy\u2019s motorcade stopped here and there; at Calico Village he sat with a 10-year-old Lakota Sioux, Christopher Pretty Boy, who had lost his parents in a car crash a week earlier. McGovern had tagged along for the day, and together he and Kennedy convened a public hearing of their subcommittee, in a community hall. More than a thousand attended. McGovern later said that he had never seen \u201cso many Indian voters assembled in one place.\u201d He and Kennedy listened as people poured out their stories of hunger, joblessness and inadequate health care.\n\nAfter the hearing ended, Kennedy made an impetuous request: to see the small monument commemorating the massacre of Native Americans at Wounded Knee in 1890. As McGovern later recalled, it was just \u201ca very simple, concrete slab with a small obelisk, and a little church out on the plains. It\u2019s a very desolate area. It\u2019s a mass grave.\u201d But they went 30 miles out of their way to see it, even with a crowd of 5,000 waiting in the rain for a rally in Rapid City. Then, at the end of a long day, Kennedy flew to Eugene, Ore., for another day of campaigning.", "title": "Opinion | Why Robert Kennedy Went to Pine Ridge", "authors": []}

(Definitions vary, however.) \u25a0 Across cultures, what people perceive as beautiful is less consistent with artwork than it is with architecture, landscapes and faces. (Faces are the most consistent.)\n\nWhat researchers do not agree on is whether enjoying a da Vinci engages a different neural process than enjoying a visit to Pornhub or McDonald\u2019s.\n\nDr. Nadal, speaking for Team 1, said in an interview that \u201chumans appear to use only one pleasure system to assess how pleasurable or unpleasurable a sensory experience is.\u201d He calls this discovery \u201cone of the most important insights to emerge from the last 15 years of neuroscience,\u201d and believes it shows that while enjoying Cheez-Its or a sculpture may feel different, in our brains they are processed the same way.\n\nOthers who study pleasure are not convinced.\n\n\u201cTalking in terms of shared neural systems is foolish,\u201d said Paul Bloom, a psychology professor at Yale University and author of the book \u201cHow Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like.\u201d\n\nHe thinks that \u201cart scratches all kinds of itches.\u201d While watching \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or parallel parking a car are all done by the brain, he says that doesn\u2019t mean they are the same.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Christensen, who studied dance before she became a neuroscientist, said she is not disputing that a single reward system processes all pleasures.

Actually some do.\n\nAccording to Debra Herbenick, director of the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at the Indiana University Bloomington\u2019s School of Public Health, eating a ripe tomato or reading nonerotic prose has been reported to provoke an orgasm.

{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "This is far from a perfect system, and a flood of tech sector lobbying has made it worse. Since 2009, Facebook has increased its spending on lobbying fiftyfold. And the $11.5 million it spent in 2017 still ranked it third behind Amazon and Alphabet. Lobbying works. Congress hasn\u2019t passed a single new major privacy law since a 2009 update to federal health privacy rules. Take a second to think of technologies popularized in the last nine years: drones, self-driving cars, Amazon Echo, Google Home, among others. If it blossomed after 2009, chances are, it is not regulated by any federal privacy law.\n\nWhat does that flood of lobbying look like? From 2011 to 2014, as a staffer for Senator Al Franken, then chairman of the Senate privacy subcommittee, I worked to pass a bill to force companies to ask for users\u2019 permission before collecting or sharing records of their movements. The bill would have outlawed so-called \u201cstalking apps\u201d that let abusers secretly track their victims\u2019 locations through their smartphones. Industry lobbyists outnumbered our supporters 54 to 2. Yet in 2012, thanks to a small coalition of privacy, women\u2019s rights, and anti-stalking groups, we managed to pass the bill out of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThat\u2019s when the lobbying really started. When I called a meeting of industry stakeholders, I had to move it from our 12-person conference table to the full Judiciary Committee hearing room, which seats four or five times that. The bill stalled. It was never again brought up for a vote.\n\nPassing a strong industry-specific privacy law is tough. But at least it\u2019s possible. When the Obama administration tried to pass an omnibus privacy bill, the law\u2019s original framework was promising. It stressed that consumers needed control of their information, transparency about how it was used, and accountability when it was abused. In 2015, after Silicon Valley weighed in, the bill that the White House put forward was so toothless that almost every major consumer privacy group opposed it. Around the time our anti-stalking bill stalled, I remember a lobbyist telling me that we should really consider setting our bill aside until Congress could pass a comprehensive privacy law. Now I know why.\n\nIt could be that the Cambridge Analytica scandal will pave the way for previously impossible, European-style reforms. Facebook\u2019s actions tell a different story. Even as it yells mea culpa, Facebook is calculating that it can kneecap new privacy rules with impunity. Facebook is spending its lobbying money not only to gut the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act but also to stop a new California consumer privacy ballot initiative.\n\nThose calculations are right \u2014 if we make this a broad debate about \u201cpersonal data.\u201d Let\u2019s make this a debate about people and pass laws to address the threats they actually face. Let\u2019s talk about the people who are still stalked every year through their smartphones. Or how retailers secretly use face recognition to spot shoplifters, even though the technology misfires more often when trying to identify African-Americans and women. Let\u2019s make this a debate about how Facebook tracked people to determine if they had an \u201caffinity\u201d for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians, and then let advertisers block those people from seeing real estate ads.", "title": "Opinion | Why Silicon Valley Lobbyists Love Big, Broad Privacy Bills", "authors": []}

But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today\u2019s technology.\n\nThe internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet \u2014 not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure \u2014 to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn\u2019t raise it.\n\nThe emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture \u2014 hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation.\n\nThe technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today\u2019s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors.\n\nThe Pentagon is in a different position.

As they age, adolescents\u2019 evolving cognitive capacities allow them to think beyond seeing their parents only as being like, or unlike, how they themselves want to be.\n\nNow they can sort what they see in us into categories that could not exist before.

When President Trump retweeted a video falsely purporting to show a Muslim migrant committing assault, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended him by saying, \u201cWhether it\u2019s a real video, the threat is real.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, Ms. Sanders admitted that Mr. Trump had made up a story about how Japan drops bowling balls on American cars to test their safety, but she argued that the story still \u201cillustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.\u201d When asked about the false claim that Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration had drawn the biggest inaugural crowd in history, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, suggested that inclement weather had kept people away.\n\nIn each instance, rather than insisting the falsehood was true, Ms. Sanders and Ms. Conway implied it could have been true. Logically speaking, the claim that more people could have attended the president\u2019s inauguration in nicer weather does not make the crowd any bigger. But psychologically, it may make the falsehood seem closer to the truth and thus less unethical to tell.\n\nTo find out if this strategy actually helps get politicians off the hook for dishonesty, I recently conducted a series of experiments. I asked 2,783 Americans from across the political spectrum to read a series of claims that they were told (correctly) were false. Some claims, like the falsehood about the inauguration crowd, appealed to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, and some appealed to his opponents: for instance, a false report (which circulated widely on the internet) that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.\n\nAll the participants were asked to rate how unethical it was to tell the falsehoods. But half the participants were first invited to imagine how the falsehood could have been true if circumstances had been different. For example, they were asked to consider whether the inauguration would have been bigger if the weather had been nicer, or whether Mr. Trump would have removed the bust if he could have gotten away with it.", "title": "Opinion | Why Trump Supporters Don\u2019t Mind His Lies", "authors": []}

Any products shipped from those operations to the United States would be subject to the tariffs. Medtronic declined to comment, saying it was still reviewing the proposal.\n\nAnd a report this week by RBC Capital Markets estimated that if the proposed 25 percent tariffs took effect, the move could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year. Some of the higher costs would undoubtedly result in increased prices for those devices, affecting baby boomers, who are now among the biggest recipients of hip and knee replacements.\n\nBrandon Henry, a medical device analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said some of the bigger medical technology companies were surprised to find their products on the list.\n\nGreg Crist, a spokesman for AdvaMed, the trade group for device members, said its members were \u201cdisappointed because this action threatens to affect the health and well-being of American patients and those around the world.\u201d\n\nHow much would be passed on to consumers remains unknown.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this orthopedic device tariff isn\u2019t a straight line,\u201d said David A. Halsey, president of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, in an email, adding that the group was working to assess the possible effects.\n\nIt is still unclear whether the tariffs will be enacted: Companies have until May to lobby the administration for changes. But on Friday, President Trump ratcheted up the pressure by threatening to levy tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports, provoking China to respond that it would strike back yet again.\n\nIndeed, stocks of drug manufacturers remained largely unruffled after the unveiling of the list on Tuesday, but by Friday, the major medical device company stocks had dipped along with the overall market. Medtronic shares were 2.7 percent lower for the week, and Zimmer Biomet was down 2.4 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was unclear whether the tariffs would have a substantial effect on the drug industry, analysts said, even though China is a leading exporter of raw pharmaceutical ingredients. \u201cWe don\u2019t see much impact,\u201d Umer Raffat, a pharmaceutical industry analyst for Evercore ISI, said in a note to investors on Tuesday.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And brand-name drugs made in the United States are frequently so expensive that the list price often has little connection to the product\u2019s manufacturing cost.\n\nNevertheless, at least one trade group sounded the alarm on the tariffs, warning that they could exacerbate the already contentious issue of health care costs, just when the Trump administration has pledged to take action to lower drug prices.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that the proposed tariffs may lead to increased costs of manufacturing for generics and biosimilars and thus higher prescription drug prices for patients in the U.S.,\u201d said Jeffrey K. Francer, senior vice president and general counsel at the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic-drug companies. The generic business has been struggling with falling prices even as brand-name drug prices have risen.\n\nSeveral major manufacturers, including Merck and the generic-drug makers Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThe cynic in me thinks this is another way for companies to say they need to raise their prices,\u201d said Erin R. Fox, a drug-shortage expert at the University of Utah.\n\nMs. Fox said she suspected that the tariffs could exacerbate shortfalls of generic injectable drugs \u2014 decades-old products that are mainstays in hospitals and have been in short supply for years because of manufacturing problems and supply disruptions.\n\nWhile many pill forms of generic drugs are manufactured overseas, most generic injectable drugs are made in the United States, using raw ingredients acquired from overseas. But because many companies do not disclose where those raw ingredients come from \u2014 saying the information is proprietary \u2014 it is hard to know the impact of the proposed tariffs, Ms. Fox said.\n\nTwo drugs on the list of 1,300 Chinese exports are epinephrine and lidocaine, which are both in short supply in their sterile injectable form.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThings are so bad right now with the injectables, we don\u2019t need anything else to pile on, to possibly make things worse,\u201d Ms. Fox said.\n\nHeather Zoumas Lubeski, a spokeswoman for Par Pharmaceutical, a major manufacturer of injectable epinephrine, said the company\u2019s raw ingredients were imported from Europe and that the proposed tariffs would not have an impact on Par or its parent company, Endo International.\n\nEven for some widely used products, it is unclear how American consumers would be affected. While insulin is on the list, all three major companies that sell insulin in the United States \u2014 Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk \u2014 said they did not import insulin from China. (Novo Nordisk said that one rarely used insulin product, the NovoPen Echo, does come from China, but that the company was committed to keeping it accessible to consumers.)\n\nSome analysts and trade lawyers pointed out that the list was an early draft and that many different industries and groups would be lobbying the government in the coming months so that their products would not be punished.", "title": "Why Trump\u2019s Tariffs Could Raise the Cost of a Hip Replacement", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan", "Katie Thomas"]}

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe 40-year-old man stared into the mirror. Lowering his razor, he lifted his chin to see if the lima-bean-size lump was still visible on the right side of his neck, just under his jawbone. His fingers quickly found the small double-lobed bulge. When he first saw it, while shaving maybe a couple of weeks earlier, it was a little tender. The soreness had gone away, but still, the lump made him nervous. Years ago, a friend had found a lump near her collarbone and ended up dying of cancer. He was due for his yearly physical, so he made an appointment to see his doctor. It was probably nothing \u2014 but he wanted to hear it from a professional.\n\nSeeking Reassurance\n\nDr. Katharine DeGeorge, a family-medicine doctor in a small practice just outside Charlottesville, Va., greeted her patient warmly. He was a healthy guy and always fun to talk to. A couple of years ago, he took up long-distance running, and now he was logging 30 to 40 miles most weeks. He told her that he recently had run his first ultramarathon \u2014 50 kilometers, or just over 31 miles. Now he was training for the Chicago Marathon and, after that, a 100-kilometer race. Over all, he felt well, except for this small bump he found under his chin. He thought it was probably a swollen lymph node, but it had been there for a while, he said, and he was a little worried about it. Any sores on your face or in your mouth? the doctor asked. The man told her he\u2019d had a little sore on the inside of his mouth, but it was gone now.\n\nWhen DeGeorge examined the patient, she easily located the nodule he was worrying about. It was almost a centimeter long and felt a little rubbery. Most of the time, lymph nodes are too small to feel, but when fighting off an infection, they can grow. But even enlarged, they usually have a soft texture. DeGeorge was surprised at how firm this one felt. It was easily moved around \u2014 that was normal \u2014 and not at all tender. She told him that the lymph node was probably a response to the sore he had in his mouth. It often takes more than four weeks for these nodes to recede. Still, she would get blood tests just to make sure there was nothing else going on. And she would refer him to an ear, nose and throat doctor (E.N.T.). If the node went back to normal before the appointment \u2014 it often took weeks to get in to see subspecialists \u2014 he could cancel.\n\nSome Unexpected Results\n\nThe doctor was again surprised, later that day, to find a couple of abnormalities in the blood work she ordered. She was reassured by the patient\u2019s normal white-blood-cell count \u2014 it made the possibility of a hidden infection or a malignancy much less likely. But his red-blood-cell count was slightly low, and his bilirubin level was a little high. Bilirubin is a breakdown product of the iron-containing parts of blood and muscle as well as certain proteins in the body. But most of the bilirubin in the system comes from red blood cells as they are destroyed \u2014 either naturally, at the end of their 115-day life span, or earlier by some type of trauma or disease. This waste product is quickly disposed of through the gastrointestinal tract, and so levels of bilirubin are normally extremely low. But the patient\u2019s bilirubin was one and a half times the normal level.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe usual cause of elevated bilirubin is liver disease \u2014 the liver turns the waste product into something that can be disposed of through the gut. If there is something wrong with the liver, the bilirubin might build up to a higher-than-normal level. Based on his exam, labs and absence of symptoms, however, this man\u2019s liver seemed completely healthy.\n\nPhoto\n\nRed-Blood-Cell Results\n\nStill, bilirubin goes up when red blood cells are destroyed at a higher-than-normal rate. And his blood count was a smidgen low. One abnormal lab test result could be an error, but when two linked test results are off, it suggests that the findings are real. She called the lab and added a third test to check the level of a protein called haptoglobin. This protein\u2019s job is to clean up the detritus of discarded red blood cells. Because red blood cells are usually destroyed at a consistent rate \u2014 as they reach the end of their useful lives \u2014 the level of haptoglobin is usually stable. If more blood is being destroyed than usual, the level of haptoglobin drops. And indeed, his haptoglobin level was low.", "title": "Why Wouldn\u2019t the Lump Under the Patient\u2019s Jaw Go Away?", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}

Those 13 and older who were never vaccinated or had chickenpox should get two shots at least four weeks apart.)\n\nStudies have indicated that more than 99 percent of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox even if they don\u2019t remember it, according to Dr. Rosanne M. Leipzig, geriatrician at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older get the new shingles vaccine whether or not they remember having had chickenpox as a child.\n\nThose who never had chickenpox but did get the vaccine for it may also be susceptible to shingles because the vaccine contains a weakened live virus. However, the risk of shingles for those who had the chickenpox vaccine is much lower than for people who had the natural infection.\n\nIf you are uncertain about your disease or vaccine history, you can get a blood test to check for immunity to chickenpox, though the result does not distinguish between protection via the disease or the vaccine. Thus, if the result is positive, Dr. Leipzig says you\u2019d be wise to get the shingles vaccine because you could be harboring the live virus.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. Years ago when I went to bed with what had been a daylong gnawing irritation on one side of my back, I awakened in the middle of the night with the thought, \u201cI have shingles.\u201d First thing in the morning I got a prescription for the antiviral drug acyclovir, which halted progress of the disease.\n\nNot willing to trust my luck a second time, I got the new vaccine. Here\u2019s how it compares to its predecessor Zostavax, which over all reduces the risk of shingles by 51 percent and of PHN by 67 percent. According to the C.D.C., Shingrix can protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s. It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park. The shot itself is painful and can cause a sore arm for a day or two. Some people develop immune-related side effects like headache, fever or an upset stomach that last less than three days, according to the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline. My only reaction beyond local soreness was an acid stomach for a day or two.", "title": "Why You Should Get the New Shingles Vaccine", "authors": ["Jane E. Brody", "Personal Health"]}

Even if you know you should plan for the future, a professional can help you enact and stick to a solid plan. \u201cWith a financial plan, [clients] receive a road map for the future and someone who catches things that slip through the cracks,\u201d Ms. Rogers explained.\n\nFinancial planners can help clarify the process\n\nWhile the average person can probably pay down credit cards, set up a Roth IRA and do some basic investing online, professionals can help streamline the nuances of financial planning.\n\n\u201cI liken it to WebMD. You can look up symptoms, but there\u2019s a limit to what you can do with that information,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cFinance is the same way \u2014 you can find a lot of things on your own, but you need that deep knowledge.\u201d\n\nEven experienced financial advisers don\u2019t always handle their own cases. \u201cI find that it is harder to manage my own affairs than those of my clients,\u201d admitted Barry Korb of Lighthouse Financial Planning in Potomac, Md. \u201cIf I was a doctor, I hope I would know enough not to treat myself. If I was a lawyer, I hope I would know enough not to represent myself. Yet as a financial planner/adviser, I perhaps try too hard to manage my own affairs.\u201d\n\nKnow what to look for\n\nAccording to Jeff de Valdivia of Fleurus Investment Advisory in Fairfield, Conn., \u201cThe term \u2018financial adviser\u2019 is so used and misused that it means almost nothing. A financial adviser should be a person knowledgeable about financial matters who provides expert advice in a way that promotes the financial well-being of [their] clients.\u201d\n\nMany people prefer a fee-based adviser, in which the client pays directly for advice and services, rather than purchasing a plan. You also want to ensure your adviser took a fiduciary oath, meaning they must legally put your needs ahead of theirs. Finally, ask if they\u2019re C.F.P. board certified. That ensures they adhere to a certain level of competence and ethical standards.\n\nThe N.A.P.F.A. organization carefully vets all of its members, providing what Mr. Brown calls a \u201cGood Housekeeping-like seal of approval.\u201d Both N.A.P.F.A. and C.F.P., as well as the Garrett Planning Network, provide search functions that can help you gather a list of reputable planners and advisers in your area.\n\nLess concretely, you also want to feel comfortable with your financial adviser. Mr. Brown likened a financial adviser to a family doctor \u2014 someone who will be with you over the long haul. Find someone with whom you can let all of your finances hang out. After all, brutal honesty is in your best interest.", "title": "Why You Should Hire a Financial Planner, Even if You\u2019re Not Rich", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "Prosecutors must also consult with the criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington. Finally, prosecutors must convince a United States magistrate judge that there\u2019s probable cause to support the search. Faced with a warrant application destined for immediate worldwide publicity, the judge surely took unusual pains to examine it. This search was not the result of Mr. Mueller or his staff \u201cgoing rogue.\u201d\n\nSecond, the search demonstrates that federal prosecutors and supervisors in the Justice Department concluded that Mr. Cohen could not be trusted to preserve and turn over documents voluntarily. The same regulations that require prosecutors to seek high-level approval for a warrant to search a law office also instruct them to use the least intrusive means to obtain evidence from a lawyer, and to consider requesting voluntary cooperation or serving a subpoena. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer has loudly protested that he had been cooperating. This search warrant means that prosecutors \u2014 including the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the criminal division at the Justice Department \u2014 believed that Mr. Cohen could not be trusted to respond fully to a subpoena or might destroy documents.\n\nThird, the search suggests that prosecutors most likely believe that Mr. Cohen\u2019s clients used his legal services for the purpose of engaging in crime or fraud. Attorney-client communications are privileged, which is why it\u2019s so unusual and difficult for prosecutors to get approval to search a law office. Justice Department regulations require federal prosecutors to set up a system to have a separate group \u2014 a so-called dirty team \u2014 review the files and separate out attorney-client communications so that the investigators and prosecutors won\u2019t see anything protected by the privilege.\n\nBut if a client is using a lawyer\u2019s services for the purpose of engaging in crime or fraud, there is no privilege. The very aggressive search of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office for attorney-client files suggests that the prosecutors believe they can convince a judge that communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen fall under the crime-fraud exception. If you think they can\u2019t pull that off, think again \u2014 they\u2019ve already done it once: Mr. Mueller persuaded a judge to apply the exception to compel testimony from Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyer, arguing successfully that he engaged her services in order to commit fraud.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s significant that Mr. Mueller sent this matter to the federal attorney\u2019s office in New York for it to pursue. Mr. Mueller is empowered to investigate both alleged coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign and any matters \u201cthat arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d Mr. Mueller\u2019s referral of the Stormy Daniels matter to New York suggests he believes it is outside that scope of his investigation. Perhaps it arose from press coverage of Ms. Daniels\u2019s incendiary claims and from the bumbling and inconsistent public responses of Mr. Cohen and President Trump. In other words, this could be an own goal by the president and Mr. Cohen.", "title": "Opinion | Why the F.B.I. Raid Is Perilous for Michael Cohen \u2014 and Trump", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets? The first quarter was one the most turbulent periods in recent years for stocks and bonds, not just because of concerns about a trade war but also because the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it aims to keep raising interest rates. The volatility may have benefited the big banks because it might have prompted investors to trade more frequently. Companies and other entities have also continued to borrow heavily in the bond market, issuing $1.9 trillion of bonds, globally, in the first quarter, only slightly below the total for the same period in 2017, according to data from Dealogic. But will that appetite for borrowing remain strong?\n\nAre regular Americans borrowing more? The United States economy may grow faster than expected if ordinary people take on more debt. All three of the banks reporting on Friday lend significant amounts to American consumers. It is unlikely that loans to consumers will surge in one quarter, but the banks\u2019 executives may identify bright spots. Wells Fargo, which does much of its lending to United States households, is in a uniquely difficult position. Regulators put a cap on the bank\u2019s growth earlier this year. Its first-quarter results will show whether this has held back the bank\u2019s consumer lending business. JPMorgan\u2019s report will also be a good time to check in on the progress of its promise in January to build more branches and increase small business lending.\n\nHow much will deregulation help the banks? The Fed on Wednesday proposed an important loosening of capital rules. The regulator said it took this step in part because the existing rules might reduce banks\u2019 participation in low-risk businesses. On the first-quarter conference calls, the banks\u2019 executives may comment on whether the Fed\u2019s proposed adjustments will change how they do business. But it is more likely that analysts will ask whether the change will allow the large banks to distribute more of their earnings to shareholders.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat Elliott may want from Micro Focus\n\nAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\n\n\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\n\n\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of Attachmate\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how big Elliott\u2019s stake is in Micro Focus, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg. But the hedge fund has a long history of pushing for change at tech companies.\n\nShares of Micro Focus, which buys older software makers and runs them more efficiently, tumbled 50 percent in mid-March. The company warned at the time that its sales were declining more than expected amid problems integrating a business that it bought for $8.8 billion from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Micro Focus\u2019s C.E.O., Chris Hsu, stepped down after the news.\n\nOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nLarry Fink is still bullish.\n\nDespite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.\n\nBut he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\n\n\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201d\n\nBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.\n\nThe investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\n\n\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.\n\nEven though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.\n\nAssets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.\n\n\u2014 Landon Thomas Jr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics\u2019 corner\n\nTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes: \u201cLike other asset managers, BlackRock is hoping the return of volatility to markets will push investors back into active funds, on which it charges higher fees.

Fully 90 percent of long-term asset inflows in the quarter went into index and exchange-traded funds, and BlackRock has been shaving fees on many of those products to keep pace with Vanguard and others.

(Mr. Iger is married to Willow Bay.):\n\n\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201d\n\nThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\n\n\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201d\n\nAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\n\n\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah.

The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.\n\nKnauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\n\nDeal speculation lifts GoPro\n\nShares of GoPro climbed more than 7 percent Thursday after The Information reported that China\u2019s Xiaomi has weighed making an offer for the action-camera maker.\n\nGoPro hired JPMorgan Chase earlier this year to advise it on a potential sale.\n\nGoPro went public at $24 a share in June 2014.

The 21st attracted the party\u2019s attention largely because its Republican incumbent, Lamar Smith, isn\u2019t seeking re-election.

But in Italy, lately, this attitude has been adopted by even the historically pro-European parties, which couldn\u2019t resist blaming Brussels for their own failures. Matteo Renzi, first as a prime minister (2014 to 2016) and then as the leader of the center-left Democratic Party (2017), could hardly open his mouth without saying something unpleasant about the union. Did he think he could outsmart his opponents that way? Well, he failed. \u201cBlame it on Brussels!\u201d didn\u2019t pay off for him or his government. It compares with what happened in Britain before the Brexit referendum. David Cameron, while leading the campaign to remain in the bloc, chose to acknowledge the union\u2019s shortcomings; he did it so well that he persuaded his fellow citizens to leave it.\n\nNo. 3: Italy, where feelings run high on these issues, senses an emotional disconnection between Europe and its citizens. For almost 60 years, Italian voters had seen the European Union as a dull but reliable babysitter who would ultimately take care of those rowdy Italian politicians. A former prime minister told me, \u201cIf not for Brussels, I could never resist pressure to expand public spending.\u201d All that is gone now. And a majority of Italians think the sitter is at least partly to blame.\n\nBut what about the union\u2019s very substantial achievements? It\u2019s created common standards in areas from home safety to cellphone roaming; it\u2019s allowed people to trade, work and live where they please; it protects agriculture and fishing; it\u2019s helped millions of students spend time abroad. And it\u2019s enabled 28 countries to speak with one voice and be respected \u2014 as Microsoft, Google and Facebook know well.\n\nAll forgotten? No. But most Italians, yearning for the supposed security of a lost age, find Brussels too distant. National, local and ethnic identities are more familiar, thus more reassuring.\n\nThat remoteness is important. The European Union looks soulless. Its greatest flaw may be that it cannot communicate its achievements. Take Europe Day. Only a small fraction of the 510 million citizens of the union even know about the day, let alone celebrate it, and almost no one has any idea why it\u2019s May 9. In fact, it was on May 9, 1950, that Robert Schuman, then France\u2019s foreign minister, officially proposed placing French and German coal and steel production under one authority; can you see why those 510 million don\u2019t deck the halls?\n\nSo here\u2019s an idea: Let\u2019s declare May 9 \u201cNo Europe Day\u201d and suspend all of the union\u2019s achievements for 24 hours. Border crossings will be reintroduced and trade barriers re-erected. People will exchange their currency for every trip, and soccer teams will field only players from their own countries.\n\nOh, and war will be once again a very real threat. Not far away. Right at home.\n\nOne day would be enough to remind its citizens what Europe is about. And in Italy, if they do form a government, Five Star and the League might understand the importance of our common European home.\n\nSure, it\u2019s not perfect. So let\u2019s not demolish it.

According to Dr. Stefan Simon, the director of Global Cultural Heritage Initiatives at Yale University, \u201cWith the U.S. once responsible for approximately 22 percent of Unesco\u2019s budget, of course the announced withdrawal is detrimental, and would painfully reduce Unesco\u2019s ability to fulfill its important missions, such as advancing and promoting literacy, gender equality, freedom of expression and scientific collaboration.\u201d\n\nIf the United States withdraws from Unesco, it would remain a state party, having signed and ratified the World Heritage Convention. \u201cThere is one consequence only,\u201d Mr. Papagiannis said about the United States withdrawal. \u201cThe U.S. cannot be elected to the World Heritage Committee,\u201d a managing committee made up of elected representatives from 21 countries. The committee is in charge of allocating financial assistance and determining what sites are included on, or removed from, the World Heritage List.\n\nDespite no longer being a paying member, the United States would be able to continue to submit sites for World Heritage List consideration.

Russell Train, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is often described as one of the primary architects of World Heritage, talked about the importance of the concept in a 2002 speech at the 30th Anniversary of the World Heritage Convention in Venice, Italy. \u201cThe World Heritage Convention itself represents a partnership among 175 nations,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cI see the program as an opportunity to convey the idea of a common heritage among nations and peoples everywhere.

In Africa, the presidents who serve longest are often the most corrupt, multiplying the harm they inflict with each passing year.

Instead of engaging in creative diplomacy, he has insulted United States neighbors and allies, walked away from key international agreements, mocked multilateral organizations and stripped the State Department of its resources and role. Instead of standing up for the values of a free society, Mr. Trump, with his oft-vented scorn for democracy\u2019s building blocks, has strengthened the hands of dictators. No longer need they fear United States criticism regarding human rights or civil liberties. On the contrary, they can and do point to Mr. Trump\u2019s own words to justify their repressive actions.\n\nAt one time or another, Mr. Trump has attacked the judiciary, ridiculed the media, defended torture, condoned police brutality, urged supporters to rough up hecklers and \u2014 jokingly or not \u2014 equated mere policy disagreements with treason. He tried to undermine faith in America\u2019s electoral process through a bogus advisory commission on voter integrity. He routinely vilifies federal law enforcement institutions. He libels immigrants and the countries from which they come. His words are so often at odds with the truth that they can appear ignorant, yet are in fact calculated to exacerbate religious, social and racial divisions. Overseas, rather than stand up to bullies, Mr. Trump appears to like bullies, and they are delighted to have him represent the American brand. If one were to draft a script chronicling fascism\u2019s resurrection, the abdication of America\u2019s moral leadership would make a credible first scene.\n\nEqually alarming is the chance that Mr. Trump will set in motion events that neither he nor anyone else can control. His policy toward North Korea changes by the day and might quickly return to saber-rattling should Pyongyang prove stubborn before or during talks. His threat to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement could unravel a pact that has made the world safer and could undermine America\u2019s reputation for trustworthiness at a critical moment. His support of protectionist tariffs invites retaliation from major trading partners \u2014 creating unnecessary conflicts and putting at risk millions of export-dependent jobs. The recent purge of his national security team raises new questions about the quality of advice he will receive. John Bolton starts work in the White House on Monday.\n\nWhat is to be done? First, defend the truth. A free press, for example, is not the enemy of the American people; it is the protector of the American people. Second, we must reinforce the principle that no one, not even the president, is above the law. Third, we should each do our part to energize the democratic process by registering new voters, listening respectfully to those with whom we disagree, knocking on doors for favored candidates, and ignoring the cynical counsel: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019m 80 years old, but I can still be inspired when I see young people coming together to demand the right to study without having to wear a flak jacket.\n\nWe should also reflect on the definition of greatness. Can a nation merit that label by aligning itself with dictators and autocrats, ignoring human rights, declaring open season on the environment, and disdaining the use of diplomacy at a time when virtually every serious problem requires international cooperation?\n\nTo me, greatness goes a little deeper than how much marble we put in our hotel lobbies and whether we have a Soviet-style military parade. America at its best is a place where people from a multitude of backgrounds work together to safeguard the rights and enrich the lives of all.

That\u2019s when he called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the country until we \u201ccan figure out what is going on.\u201d Since then he has given his lawyers a constant headache by tweeting regularly about the ban, saying just days before the latest version that it should be \u201cfar larger, tougher and more specific,\u201d but that this would be \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d In case anyone was still unclear about where he stands, last November the president retweeted inflammatory videos from a fringe ultranationalist group in Britain showing Muslims purportedly engaged in violence. (The videos were, as Mr. Trump likes to say, fake news.)\n\nFrom this angle, the travel ban looks a lot like Mr. Trump\u2019s other attempts to weaponize the federal government in the service of his own personal vendettas. Remember the election integrity commission? An entire operation created solely to justify the president\u2019s false claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016. The commission folded in January without making any findings of fraud. In the case of the travel ban, Mr. Trump is surrounded by anti-immigrant hard-liners, including his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who donated one of his favorite staffers, a zealot named Stephen Miller, to help draft the ban.\n\nIn truth, the latest proclamation functions as little more than legal backfill \u201cto legitimize a presidential command that was born of animus, persists in animus, and seeks to make animus the law of the land,\u201d as a supporting brief says.\n\nThat brief is one of many the court has received arguing against the ban; more than four times as many briefs oppose the ban as support it. They come from immigrants\u2019-rights groups and anti-discrimination advocates, naturally, but also from business and legal leaders, scholars of constitutional and international law, conservatives and liberals and libertarians, cities and states \u2014 and, notably, former national security and military officials, who warn that by encouraging the perception that the United States is anti-Muslim, it \u201cjeopardizes the stability of the support that the United States receives from its allies, erodes essential good will, makes it more difficult for the United States to win hearts and minds abroad.\u201d\n\nThis leads the justices to a thornier question: What to do with a president like Mr. Trump? Should they simply ignore everything he\u2019s said? Are they holding him to a different standard than previous presidents? That\u2019s hard to answer, because no past president behaved like Mr. Trump. In its brief to the justices, the administration argues that the court must not engage in \u201cjudicial psychoanalysis of a drafter\u2019s heart of hearts.\u201d But there\u2019s no need to get Mr. Trump on a couch. He\u2019s said over and over exactly what he thinks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been faced with situations like this before. In World War II, it bowed to claims of unfettered executive authority and allowed American citizens to be locked up for years simply because of their Japanese heritage. It was a shameful moment for the court and for the United States. Today, in the face of an executive order again based on racial animus and unfounded fears, the justices have the chance to deliver a very different message about executive power, and the meaning of America.", "title": "Opinion | Will the Court Stand Up to Donald Trump?", "authors": []}

By 2010, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit had called the Schirn \u201cthe most exciting exhibition hall in Germany.\u201d\n\nAmbitions Beyond the Rhine\n\nMr. Hollein was soon invited by trustees to take the director\u2019s post at the St\u00e4del foundation, a more venerable institution, and home to one of Germany\u2019s best collections of medieval, Renaissance and Baroque painting. He agreed to take the post, as well as the directorship of the neighboring Liebieghaus sculpture museum under a surprising condition: that he keep the Schirn as well.\n\nThis struck some as a power grab, and in Germany, a country whose citizens stick their academic titles on every surface, Mr. Hollein\u2019s lack of a doctorate in art history caused additional concern.\n\nEventually, Mr. Hollein\u2019s efforts began to speak for themselves. At the St\u00e4del, he helped expand the collection to include 20th- and 21st-century art by brokering unusual long-term loans with two German banks \u2014 Deutsche Bank and DZ Bank AG \u2014 that allowed the museum to retain the works in perpetuity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExhibitions of Cranach, Botticelli and Monet attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors. An ambitious digital program \u2014 including art history video lectures in German and English \u2014 brought international attention to what was once a museum of only regional influence.\n\nAnd at both museums, Mr. Hollein indulged his abiding passion for electronic music. At the Schirn, he backed exhibitions featuring experimental composers like Carsten Nicolai and Ryoji Ikeda; at the St\u00e4del, during a 2012 exhibition of Romantic and Symbolist painting, he invited the public to dance until 2 a.m. to D.J.s from the Berlin nightclub circuit.\n\nMr. Hollein\u2019s progress gained attention on the other side of the Rhine. In 2013, he emerged as the odds-on favorite to become director of France\u2019s leading modern art museum, the Pompidou Center in Paris.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMax, in Frankfurt, had been committed to very strong temporary exhibitions \u2014 blockbuster shows as well as more scholarly, researched, niche shows,\u201d said Alain Seban, who was the Pompidou\u2019s president from 2007 to 2015. He praised Mr. Hollein\u2019s \u201ccapability to make the whole curatorial team participate in an exhibition strategy for the museum. And perhaps, considering the current situation of the Met, it\u2019s something that he might have to do there as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Seban would continue to hold the top job \u2014 a situation that closely parallels Mr. Hollein\u2019s new arrangement at the Met, where he will report to Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief executive.\n\nYet leaks to the French press damaged his Pompidou candidacy, particularly reports that his requested salary was three times higher than expected. Mr. Hollein withdrew before the final selection. (The job went to Bernard Blist\u00e8ne, a Pompidou veteran.)\n\nIn his Met interview, Mr. Hollein said he felt that the French government couldn\u2019t give him the freedom he needed to make significant strides.\n\n\u201cI draw a lot of energy where I feel I can move the institution forward,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt clearly was not the money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome people in the art world were surprised to see Mr. Hollein take the job in San Francisco, in part because of its powerful board president, Diane B. Wilsey, who has a reputation for being loath to relinquish control of the Fine Arts Museums.\n\nMs. Wilsey, 74, ceded the chief executive title after the museums paid a $2 million settlement to a former high-ranking executive who said Ms. Wilsey had her ousted for revealing alleged museum misspending.\n\nBut both Mr. Hollein and Ms. Wilsey said they have had a very productive working relationship. \u201cHe pushes the staff, but they like it,\u201d Ms. Wilsey said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re energized by his energy and intelligence and ambitions.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Hollein managed to make an impact during his short tenure at the museum, balancing the budget and initiating shows like \u201cContemporary Muslim Fashions,\u201d which is set to open in September.

He has a large staff of experts and access to data not available to private sector economists, not to mention a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAnd unlike the view of your average economist, Mr. Draghi\u2019s is partly self-fulfilling. If he displays confidence, banks will be more eager to lend, businesses may be more willing to invest in expansion and to hire more people and, lo, it will be so.\n\nFor financial markets, the key question in the weeks to come is whether recent economic data will alter the European Central Bank\u2019s schedule for ending the measures it used to keep the eurozone together during an existential debt crisis. Chiefly, the bank bought hundreds of billions of euros in government and corporate bonds as a way of pumping money into the economy.\n\nIn recent months, the Governing Council has been making subtle changes in the statements it issues after monetary policy meetings as a way of preparing investors for an end to the bond buying, known as quantitative easing. On Thursday, it left monetary policy unchanged, and made no major changes to its statement.\n\nSeptember is expected to be the last month of the purchases, though the bank will continue to reinvest money it gets back when bonds mature. The aim is to gently bring monetary policy back to normal. Sometime late next year, or maybe not even until 2020, the European Central Bank will then probably begin raising its benchmark interest rates, currently at a historic low of zero, for the first time since 2011.\n\nAny indication by the Governing Council that it is revising its timetable would be big news.

Any number of factors could have contributed to his hospitalization.\n\nThat is not to say that deep grief on rare occasions can\u2019t send the body into free fall. The best known of these reactions, and a model for understanding them, is what\u2019s aptly called broken-heart syndrome.\n\nJapanese doctors were the first to describe the reaction in detail, and their name for it was even more evocative: Takotsubo syndrome, after the Japanese term for \u201coctopus trap.\u201d On scans of the grief-stricken, the heart may look as if it being squeezed from below, its upper chambers swelling as if straining to break free.\n\nThe sudden loss of a spouse, child or parent \u201creleases an outpouring from the sympathetic nervous system, the fight-or-flight response, which is what seems to damage the heart in broken-heart syndrome,\u201d said Dr. Anne Curtis, chairwoman of medicine at the University at Buffalo.\n\n\u201cThe heart rate goes up sharply, blood pressure goes up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why people can also have a stroke in situations like this.\u201d\n\nThe octopus trap can ensnare any heart, healthy or not, young or old. The flash-flood of stress hormones causes a temporary weakening of the heart muscle itself. The rush may also precipitate a classic heart attack, in which a clot blocks blood flow, or an arrhythmia, in which the heart revs wildly. The latter two consequences are more rare than the first, and deadlier.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Curtis estimated that about 1 percent of perceived heart attacks are due to broken-heart syndrome or similar surges of stressful emotion. \u201cWe tell people that many will return to normal or near-normal heart function,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the first major American study of the phenomenon, doctors at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine studied 18 women and one man who landed in coronary care with chest pains and no classic signs of cardiac arrest after traumatic events, including the death of a spouse.

In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers reviewed 30,447 people aged 60 to 89 in Britain whose partners had died.

Fear not: The rest of the theme is explained behind the link above.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nPuzzles with answers that must appear with specific clue numbers are challenging to construct because they require precise gridwork. One way to control which clue numbers correspond to which answers is to use \u201ccheater\u201d squares (black squares that don\u2019t change the puzzle\u2019s word count). For instance, the black square before 10-Across reduces all subsequent clue numbers by one. Without that square, the answer SEVEN would be at 25-Across instead of 24-Across. Other cheater squares may have different effects on numbering. For example, the black square before 28-Across doesn\u2019t affect the clue numbering at all, but its symmetric counterpart after 41-Across changes what would have been 44-Down into 49-Down and decreases the clue numbering for the intervening clues by one (after 49-Down the numbering is unchanged). Generally speaking, cheater squares in the upper-left corner of a region reduce all subsequent clue numbering by one, cheater squares in the upper right reduce the numbering of clues by one until the shortened down entry, whose clue number is increased by the number of intervening clue numbers, and cheater squares in the lower left and lower right leave clue numbering unchanged. The unedited version of this puzzle clued the gimmick in the opposite direction. 5-Across and 41-Across were clued as \u201cSee previous answer\u201d and 22-Across and 46-Across were clued as \u201cSee next answer.\u201d The words OVER, SEVEN, WINKS and FIFTY were clued without any reference to their clue numbers or the combined meaning. Perhaps that cluing approach is too difficult and many solvers wouldn\u2019t realize that reading the numbers in the grid in combination with the answers creates a new meaning (i.e., 1 OVER or 40 WINKS). I miss the elegance of the original approach, but if the change improves the solving experience, then I\u2019m all in favor.\n\n\u2018Women of Letters\u2019 Crossword Pack Now Available\n\nIf you would like to solve a brilliant set of crosswords, the \u201cWomen of Letters\u201d pack is now available for the cost of a donation to a woman-friendly charity.\n\nThis pack was edited by Patti Varol and Amy Reynaldo, based on a t-shirt that Erik Agard wore to the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament a couple of years ago, and the puzzles were made by your favorite and upcoming favorite woman constructors.\n\nTo receive this pack, make a donation of $10 or more to any of the charities listed on the \u201cWomen of Letters\u201d page and email your receipt to WomenofLettersCrosswords@gmail.com.\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nAlmost finished solving but just need a bit more help?

Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation.\n\nThe assertion by Ms. Sanders was surprising because the general understanding has been that Mr. Trump himself cannot directly fire Mr. Mueller, and that he would instead have to order the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purpose of the Russia inquiry, to do so. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any involvement in the investigation.\n\nMr. Rosenstein has repeatedly said that he will refuse any order to fire Mr. Mueller unless he decides the special counsel committed misconduct. If the general understanding is correct, then, Mr. Trump would probably have to fire Mr. Rosenstein and hunt for a successor willing to carry out the order \u2014 echoing the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d during the Watergate scandal.\n\nIn 1973, President Richard M. Nixon decided to force the Justice Department to fire Archibald Cox, the first special counsel investigating Watergate. Both the attorney general and the deputy attorney general resigned rather than carry out those orders before the solicitor general, then the No. 3 official in the department, finally agreed to do so.

Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.\n\nTesla had no comment for this column.\n\nAt this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.\n\nSelf-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d\n\nGiven that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.\n\n\u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)\n\nAfter investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system.

At the time, he was an informal adviser to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq, and he accompanied Mr. Maliki to Moscow in September 2012 to sign the arms deal at a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Nader\u2019s role in the deal was earlier reported by Al-Monitor.\n\nThe deal was canceled shortly after because of concerns about corruption, and a spokesman for the prime minister said it would be renegotiated.\n\nEarlier that year, Mr. Nader also attended the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, an invitation-only conference organized by senior officials close to Mr. Putin that Russia presents as its answer to the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nader is on a list of participants from 2012. Representatives of the St. Petersburg forum did not respond to inquiries about his attendance in subsequent years.\n\nSince then, according to people familiar with his travels, Mr. Nader has returned frequently to Russia on behalf of the Emirati government.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "If one theme emerged from Humana\u2019s 42nd edition, it is that living in the United States is a rather complicated proposition nowadays \u2014 especially if you happen to be a woman. Even a comedy like the ace Jaclyn Backhaus playlet \u201cThe National Foosball Championship\u201d (part of an omnibus of short works) revolved around a battle of the sexes.\n\nWhile everybody in Mark Schultz\u2019s \u201cEvocation to Visible Appearance\u201d is despondent, the two female characters feel powerless. Chatty Samantha (Suzy Weller) is dumped by her boyfriend (Lincoln Clauss) after informing him she\u2019s pregnant \u2014 which she may or may not be. Her sister, the sharp-tongued but depressive Natalie (Ronete Levenson), is in a mental institution.\n\nMr. Schultz (\u201cThe Gingerbread House\u201d) and the director Les Waters lay on the gloom a bit thick, but then the play is less about plot than about atmosphere, in this case dread fueled by dead-end jobs, illness and general misery.\n\nA sudden act of violence at a fast-food outlet does not feel earned, and comes across as gratuitous provocation, but the play is almost redeemed by a bizarre conclusion that left the audience as mystified as any I\u2019ve ever seen: In a kind of dark-arts s\u00e9ance, a deafeningly loud doom-metal song is performed live while Samantha attempts to conjure her possibly imaginary unborn child and her father (Bruce McKenzie) dances like a pained cartoon bear. The house lights abruptly come back. There is no curtain call.\n\nThis was quite the mic drop from Mr. Waters \u2014 who, incidentally, is departing as the artistic head of Actors Theater, which runs the festival.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe workplace violence in Susan Soon He Stanton\u2019s \u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d is more muted, but the threat is always there. Ms. Stanton\u2019s starting point was the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case, when he was accused of assaulting Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel housekeeper. At the time, in 2011, Ms. Stanton was herself working at a high-end Manhattan hotel, and the play is her attempt to give the \u201cinvisibles\u201d who form the hospitality industry\u2019s backbone their due.\n\nMs. Stanton likes to have fun with storytelling. (Last year\u2019s \u201cToday Is My Birthday\u201d was narrated through phone calls and voice messages.) Here the myriad quick-take scenes are well handled by the director D\u00e1maso Rodr\u00edguez and the excellent ensemble cast, which captures the hotel\u2019s staff as well as Susan (Rinabeth Apostol), the playwright\u2019s stand-in, usually seen interviewing former co-workers, and Ms. Diallo herself (Rebecca S\u2019Manga Frank).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile it has an appealing documentary quality, \u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d also feels directionless. Susan initially says she wants to leave \u201cD.S.K.\u201d out of her story, for instance, but he has a way of popping in. Re-enactments of Abel Ferrara\u2019s film \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d and the \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d episode based on the incident are hilarious, but keep taking us back to the criminal case Susan claims not to be interested in.\n\nAnother workplace-focused drama is \u201cMarginal Loss\u201d by Deborah Stein (\u201cThe Wholehearted\u201d), which unfurls over the days immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks. The action is set in the New Jersey warehouse from which a Manhattan financial firm is temporarily operating, trying to get back to business.\n\nThe four-character play, directed by Meredith McDonough, is professional, but to what end? No matter how much they suffered or how many friends and colleagues they lost, the characters don\u2019t seem to live beyond the page. Ultimately \u201cMarginal Loss\u201d lacks a strong point of view on what these finance workers are trying so hard to accomplish: to make a ton of money again.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeah Nanako Winkler\u2019s \u201cGod Said This,\u201d the festival\u2019s highest-profile production \u2014 it recently received the Yale Drama Series Prize and will be presented in New York at Primary Stages next season \u2014 is a relatively traditional drama in which a Japanese-American family from Lexington, Ky., deals with the mother\u2019s cancer.\n\nMasako (Ako) is getting chemotherapy in a hospital, attended by her daughters: the good-girl, born-again Sophie (Emma Kikue) and the pot-smoking, rebellious Hiro (Satomi Blair), who has flown in from New York. Masako\u2019s husband, James (Jay Patterson), is not aging well, having turned into a bit of a hoarder. Fights, reconciliations, tears \u2014 events follow a conventional route.\n\nThe lived-in acting is a highlight of the show, directed by Morgan Gould.

Ms. Vandever said that despite being promoted as a poster child for the school, she was one of only two women in Juilliard\u2019s robust jazz program, and often felt stranded.

But Mr. Eisler, who spent 20 years at the firm, said he did not confront Mr. Meier after hearing from Ms. Bruckner.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I did not.\u201d\n\nAfter a report last month by The New York Times detailing a pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Meier, more women have come forward to share their own upsetting encounters with him. But in recounting such experiences, these women said they had also been disturbed by a sense of helplessness that pervaded the firm. Mr. Meier\u2019s behavior was common knowledge, they said, but no one seemed to have the power to stop it.\n\nOver the last six months, a number of fields have been forced to reckon with revelations regarding powerful men who harassed or assaulted underlings, some for many years, without being stopped by their companies or organizations.\n\nAt Richard Meier & Partners Architects, there was no one more powerful than Mr. Meier, a world-famous architect whose firm depended on him for its prestige and success. It was years before #MeToo; protesting harassment was far more perilous.\n\nMs. Bruckner said she did not fault Mr. Eisler for his silence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he felt he had any power to do anything about it,\u201d said Ms. Bruckner, who worked at the firm until 1992, when she left to work for the architect Philip Johnson. She said people in the office were too afraid of what would happen to the firm, and their jobs, should Mr. Meier\u2019s name be sullied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s behavior that goes on for decades and never changes,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t go up against the bad guy because it will have a domino effect; if he falls down, everybody else falls down.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollowing the initial Times report, which involved five women, Mr. Meier, 83, said that \u201cwhile our recollections may differ, I sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my behavior.\u201d He said he would take a six-month leave from his firm.\n\nFour more women have since come forward to share their experiences concerning Mr. Meier: Ms. Bruckner; Eileen Delgado, a former office manager; Lucy Nathanson, Mr. Meier\u2019s former personal assistant; and Liz Lee, who worked as the communications coordinator.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mr. Meier and his partners declined to be interviewed about the new accusations but issued this statement: \u201cThe allegations involving Richard Meier, the most recent of which were nearly a decade old, do not reflect the ethos and culture of the firm, and it would be irresponsible to allow these personal allegations to tarnish the company.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear to what extent executives at the firm, including Mr. Meier\u2019s partners, were aware of the sexual advances women are now publicly describing. Most of the women said they were too afraid for their jobs to lodge formal complaints with the management.\n\nBut some women did, and the firm appears to have reached at least two settlements. Ms. Delgado said she received about $25,000 in 1992 after Mr. Meier threw himself on top of her.\n\nAs reported earlier, Alexis Zamlich received $150,000 in 2009 after Mr. Meier had exposed himself to her, and another employee \u2014 Laura Trimble Elbogen \u2014 reported that Mr. Meier had asked her to undress, accounts that have been confirmed by the firm\u2019s former chief operating officer.\n\nAll three episodes were said to have occurred in Mr. Meier\u2019s Upper East Side apartment.\n\nThe firm has declined to discuss any settlements, but it said that after the two 2009 incidents, it instituted its first sexual harassment training program and updated its sexual harassment policy, which was put in the company handbook in 1993. No women have come forward to report negative experiences at the firm from after 2009.\n\nMs. Delgado, who worked as the office manager for several months in 1991 and 1992, said that Mr. Meier had asked her to work at his apartment, where he gave her a glass of wine and sat beside her on the sofa. \u201cAll of a sudden, I was thrust back and hit my head on a table,\u201d Ms. Delgado said. \u201cThis man was on top of me, his tongue was down my throat, and he put my hand on his penis.\u201d\n\nThe next day at the office, Ms. Delgado told the bookkeeper, Francina Foskey, who she said responded, \u201cOh, God, you, too?,\u201d and then proceeded to spin through a Rolodex, pointing to the names of women who had complained to her about Meier\u2019s sexual overtures. \u201cShe said, \u2018Her, her, her, her,\u2019 and as she\u2019s turning them, we\u2019re counting,\u201d Ms. Delgado said. (Ms. Foskey died in 1997.)\n\nMs. Delgado said she got up the courage to hire a lawyer and settled with the firm under a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Meier\u2019s two other partners at the time were Robert Gatje and Thomas Phifer.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Gatje, interviewed a short time before his death, said that he wound up suing the firm himself but would not say for what because he was bound by a nondisclosure agreement. Asked about the allegations of sexual harassment, Mr. Gatje said: \u201cThat was 25 years ago. Things were a lot different back then.\u201d\n\nMr. Phifer said that he never received a complaint of sexual harassment but that he had his own problems with Mr. Meier.\n\n\u201cWhat did happen is an enormous amount of verbal abuse, which I encountered myself, as did the rest of the office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I left.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Former workers said that Mr. Meier \u2014 a winner of the Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s top award, and the designer of notable buildings like the Getty Center in Los Angeles \u2014 ruled like a despot. They said he was loath to bring on partners, publicly berated even senior employees, and moved through the office as a brooding, bullying presence who inspired fear and deference.\n\nAdam Eli Clem, who worked as an assistant archivist from 1994 to 1996, said Mr. Meier\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d behavior prompted \u201ca kind of underground in the office that functioned to warn people about what they could expect.\u201d\n\nThis was particularly true for women, who knew to wait for one another at the end of the day to avoid leaving a female colleague alone with Mr. Meier. Despite such efforts, some women said they were nevertheless asked by Mr. Meier to work at his apartment.\n\nOne was Ms. Nathanson, Mr. Meier\u2019s personal assistant in 1995, who said he put his hands on her shoulders while showing her a book of vintage erotica.\n\n\u201cI felt trapped in my chair,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt my heart beating faster and faster and faster.

But the unions that withdrew last Friday \u2014 Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, and Communications Workers of America District 1 \u2014 count more than 150,000 members in New York. The state\u2019s biggest union, 1199 S.E.I.U., which represents health care workers, has also endorsed Mr. Cuomo, as have other major unions like the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.\n\nAnd several other union leaders, including some that had supported Mr. Lipton\u2019s group in the past, were already speaking of the W.F.P. in the past tense, and speaking ill of its current leaders.\n\n\u201cThe W.F.P. was a good concept,\u201d said Mike McGuire, a construction union official and former treasurer of the W.F.P., adding that Mr. Lipton and others had turned it into \u201can irrelevant, impotent, money-hungry engine for their own personal agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Lipton said that although the departure of the governor\u2019s labor allies had cost his party \u201cmillions in funding,\u201d both now and in the future, the W.F.P. still had ample power to promote Ms. Nixon\u2019s message through volunteering, canvassing, phone banking and social media. The party had already been using such methods in recent efforts to expel former members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a recently dissolved group of Democrats who cooperated with Republicans, from the State Senate.\n\n\u201cWe just had a dress rehearsal for this,\u201d said Mr. Lipton, noting 120,000 anti-I.D.C. phone calls and a half-million anti-I.D.C. text messages sent this winter. \u201cAnd we think this is going to be much bigger.\u201d\n\nThere are early indications that the alliance with the W.F.P., and a range of community groups whose funding were also threatened by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s labor allies, may offer Ms. Nixon a bevy of surrogates with which to attack the governor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign distributed a statement from Make the Road Action, a progressive community-action group that focuses on immigrant issues. The statement accused Mr. Cuomo of a \u201crecent pattern of falsehoods and exaggerations about his life story,\u201d citing the governor\u2019s suggestion that he was the son of \u201cpoor immigrants\u201d \u2014 his father, Mario M. Cuomo, was a lawyer and three-term governor \u2014 and the fact that he was \u201ca middle-class guy,\u201d something belied by his $173,000 salary, hefty investment portfolio and a lucrative book deal for his memoir. On Thursday, the Nixon campaign debuted an email attack on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s credibility, calling out his \u201clie of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon both fought so hard for the endorsement of the Working Families Party,\u201d Rebecca Katz, an adviser for Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign, said. \u201cTheir ballot line sends a clear signal to voters about which candidate is the most committed progressive.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Ms. Katz tells it, the W.F.P. endorsement could also help offset Mr. Cuomo\u2019s profound financial advantage \u2014 his campaign coffers contain some $30 million \u2014 particularly by appealing to small donors, who have been almost completely ignored by the governor\u2019s past fund-raising.\n\nThe two unions were not the only entities to pull out of the W.F.P.; the night before Ms. Nixon won the endorsement, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign \u2014 sensing the party\u2019s inclination toward his opponent \u2014 announced that it would not seek the endorsement after all.\n\nAbbey Fashouer, a spokeswoman for the Cuomo campaign, underscored what she characterized as his \u201cunmatched progressive record,\u201d citing his work on securing a $15 minimum wage, marriage equality, gun-safety laws, a free college tuition program and paid family leave.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Still, Mr. Cuomo has hefty leads in every public poll thus far.\n\nIn the 2014 Democratic primary, an underfunded candidate, Zephyr Teachout, mounted a surprisingly vigorous bid to unseat Mr. Cuomo, pulling in 34 percent of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lipton pointed out that the W.F.P. \u2014 which counts about 46,000 registered voters \u2014 has drawn at least that many people to the party\u2019s line in recent elections, including in 2016, when Senator Chuck Schumer won 241,672 votes on the party\u2019s line. All told, less than 600,000 Democrats voted in the 2014 primary, about 10 percent of all those registered.\n\nBut several political analysts warned that the unions\u2019 traditional muscle in turning out voters should not be underestimated.\n\nKenneth Sherrill, an emeritus professor of political science at the City University of New York Graduate Center, said the two unions that withdrew from the W.F.P., CWA and 32BJ, were \u201cpowerhouses\u201d that could make a difference in September.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful labor unions are able to deliver votes,\u201d Professor Sherrill said. \u201cAnd this clout is undoubtedly more powerful in the primaries than in the general election.\u201d\n\nH\u00e9ctor J. Figueroa, the president of Local 32BJ, said that his members were strongly behind Mr. Cuomo \u2014 citing accomplishments like a hike in the minimum wage and a paid family-leave program \u2014 and could bring as many as a quarter-million voters, including union members\u2019 families and friends, to bear on the race. \u201cWe intend to do what we do with every election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very robust program.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if Mr. Cuomo\u2019s more traditional campaign efforts \u2014 ratcheting up labor backing, doling out support for liberal causes and staging governmental events seemingly designed to promote the governor \u2014 can be offset by Ms. Nixon\u2019s social media popularity and of-the-people campaign style. A video of Ms. Nixon declaring her support for legalizing marijuana has been viewed 3.7 million times. A subsequent Twitter post about the issue garnered more than 180,000 likes.\n\nCharles Tien, a professor of political science at Hunter College, said the schism in the W.F.P. showed less an ideological difference between unions and progressive activists \u2014 \u201cideological soul mates\u201d \u2014 than differing opinions on how those ideals had or had not been fulfilled.\n\nThe answer, Professor Tien said, would determine which group could drive higher turnout.\n\n\u201cTheir candidate is the status quo candidate,\u201d he said of the unions\u2019 support for Mr. Cuomo. \u201cAre people feeling that the status quo isn\u2019t working?

{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "The study doesn\u2019t explain why greater graduation requirements might reduce risky behavior, but the authors offer two hypotheses. First, greater demands at school take more time: longer hours doing homework and studying. Students who spend more time on schoolwork have less time to do other things. (They could also be reducing sleep or exercise, however.)\n\nSecond, a number of other studies have shown that increased high school math graduation requirements have been linked to higher future earnings. This increases the potential loss to students who jeopardize those future earnings through risky behavior. (This second theory requires teenagers to be forward-looking, something parents of teenagers might find implausible.)\n\nRates of alcohol, drug, and tobacco use among teenagers are high enough to provoke concern among their parents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one-third of high schoolers consumed alcohol in the last month, and 18 percent had five or more drinks when they did so. One in five had used marijuana in the past month, and more than 5 percent had used cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs. Just over 10 percent of high schoolers smoke cigarettes.\n\nNevertheless, by some measures, teenagers are engaging in less risky behavior than they used to. Their rates of alcohol and cigarette use have trended downward since the early 1990s, though use of other drugs is up.\n\nReducing risky behavior early in life is important because habits established in youth often persist into adulthood. Deterring those behaviors early has long-term benefits. A clever body of work takes advantage of school choice lotteries, in which families who win the lottery can place their children in their preferred \u2014 typically higher-quality \u2014 school. For example, one study of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., school district found that lottery-winning middle school and high school enrollees entered higher-quality schools and committed less crime seven years later.\n\nThere are other ways the education system can help children be and stay healthy. There are many evidence-based programs that schools can use to directly address the factors that drive or deter substance use. One study found that higher teacher wages are associated with lower mortality. A study of Southern states found that decreasing student-teacher ratios, increasing teachers\u2019 wages, and lengthening the school year are all associated with better future health of students, including reduced smoking, obesity and mortality.\n\nThere is variation in results of studies like these. Not all find a connection between education and health or behavioral outcomes.

{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "In the first three years of the expanded program, revenue growth for Maryland\u2019s hospitals stayed below the state-set cap of 3.58 percent, saving Medicare $586 million. Spending was lower on hospital outpatient services, including visits to the emergency department that do not lead to hospital admissions. In addition, preventable health conditions and mortality fell.\n\nAccording to a new report from RTI, a nonprofit research organization, Maryland\u2019s program did not reap savings for the privately insured population (even though inpatient admissions fell for that group). However, the study corroborated the impressive Medicare savings, driven by a drop in hospital admissions. In reaching these findings, the study compared Maryland\u2019s hospitals with analogous ones in other states, which served as stand-ins for what would have happened to Maryland hospitals had global budgeting not been introduced.\n\nBut a recent study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, was decidedly less encouraging.\n\nLed by Eric Roberts, a health economist with the University of Pittsburgh, the study examined how Maryland achieved its Medicare savings, using data from 2009-2015. Like RTI\u2019s report, it also compared Maryland hospitals\u2019 experience with that of comparable hospitals elsewhere.\n\nHowever, unlike the RTI report, Mr. Roberts\u2019s study did not find consistent evidence that changes in hospital use in Maryland could be attributed to global budgeting. His study also examined primary care use. Here, too, it did not find consistent evidence that Maryland differed from elsewhere. Because of the challenges of matching Maryland hospitals to others outside of the state for comparison, the authors took several statistical approaches in reaching their findings. With some approaches, the changes observed in Maryland were comparable to those in other states, raising uncertainty about their cause.\n\nA separate study by the same authors published in Health Affairs analyzed the earlier global budget program for Maryland\u2019s rural hospitals. They were able to use other Maryland hospitals as controls. Still, after three years, they did not find an impact of the program on hospital use or spending.\n\nChanges brought about by the Affordable Care Act, which also passed in 2010, coincide with Maryland\u2019s hospital payment reforms. The A.C.A. included many provisions aimed at reducing spending, and those changes could have led to hospital use and spending in other states on par with those seen in Maryland.\n\nA limitation of Maryland\u2019s approach is that payments to physicians are not included in its global budgets. \u201cMaryland didn\u2019t put the state\u2019s health system on a budget \u2014 it only put hospitals on a budget,\u201d said Ateev Mehrotra, the study\u2019s senior author and an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cSlowing health care spending and fostering better coordination requires including physicians who make the day-to-day decisions about how care is delivered.\u201d", "title": "Would Americans Accept Putting Health Care on a Budget?", "authors": []}

The Philippine president said he loves the man.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China took center stage at his country\u2019s annual Boao Forum for Asia this week to the welcoming arms of many in the global elite. He portrayed himself as a champion of free trade and world order, speaking to a group that included Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, and Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organization, and his words helped move markets around the world.\n\nThe forum, held every year on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, has long been a platform for China to portray itself as an economic powerhouse and regional leader.\n\nBut this year\u2019s meetings took on an elevated role, as a platform for Beijing, a result of a growing trade dispute between China and the United States. It was an opportunity for Mr. Xi to present himself as a foil to President Trump, who has rejected globalization and focused on an \u201cAmerica First policy,\u201d targeting China, in particular, with a series of protectionist moves.", "title": "Xi Jinping Promotes Openness at a China Forum Rife With Restrictions", "authors": []}

Chinese officials were also front and center at the most recent Davos gathering, in January, where they cited China\u2019s progress and called for more international cooperation on several fronts.\n\nThat call for unity could also help calm some unease resulting from Mr. Xi\u2019s recent power grab. Last month, China formally ended term limits for its top leader, which could make Mr. Xi the country\u2019s chief for life. That move has caused jitters among some in the United States and other countries.\n\nAt Boao, Chinese officials have promoted Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership as providing an opening to carry out ambitious plans to overhaul the country\u2019s economy and make it more open.\n\nOn trade, government leaders and Chinese corporate chiefs have sought to strike a delicate balance: playing down worries about the effect on China of a protracted trade fight, while warning that the global economic system could be disrupted by a trade war and that the United States risks falling behind.\n\n\u201cIf a trade conflict becomes a trade war, the U.S. is more likely to be hurt worse by this than China,\u201d Dai Xianglong, a former governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said on Monday at the opening of the forum.\n\nOther countries could be hit as well, said Fan Gang, director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute. China is just a piece of a complicated regional supply chain across Asia, he said, citing the example of the Apple iPhone. Any retaliation from the United States would have a ripple effect from South Korea to Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a big uncertainty with this trade conflict.

It is also a reflection of economic means and of disparities in construction quality.\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been strong building codes applied on St. Martin for many years, and there were certainly areas on the North Side where damage was extensive,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe cleanup also has been slower than on St. Barts, where the local government and its many affluent private property owners had the wherewithal to respond with alacrity, even before insurance payouts.\n\nIn many sections of the island, you need to look carefully to spot storm damage but the closer you get to some of the main beaches, it sadly gets easier. Many of the larger seafront hotels were hit hard by the storm surge and the high winds and have yet to reopen, although villa rental agencies and some smaller hotels are operating.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPeople coming for Les Voiles are having to be clever to find housing,\u201d Tolede said. \u201cWe have the advantage that some nearby islands, like Antigua, were not that impacted by the hurricane, so people are going to be able to rent catamarans or boats to be able to house themselves.

But Thornburg has owned a house on St. Barts for 10 years and is a regular participant in Les Voiles, which is lower-adrenaline fare than many of his salt-sprayed adventures.\n\n\u201cThe main appeal is it\u2019s a home regatta for me, but it\u2019s also one of the best because it\u2019s just so beautiful,\u201d he said over coffee at Le Bar de L\u2019Oubli in St. Barts last week. \u201cWhat makes it frustrating or interesting is that unlike traditional sort of buoy races or offshore races, they use a lot of these outlying rocks and islands as marks, and when you are coming around the island, there are a lot of wind shifts coming off of the rocks so local knowledge really helps.\u201d\n\nAt not quite 10 square miles, St. Barts is too small to host nearly any major sports event. But sailing presents an opportunity. It is after all how people first came to the island and how many still come to the island.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeyond Les Voiles, there is the Cata-Cup for multihulls in November; the Bucket Regatta for superyachts in March and the biennial Transat AG2R, which finishes in St. Barts and is the only two-handed trans-Atlantic race on identical boats.\n\n\u201cSailing is a big part of the life here,\u201d said Philip Trangmar, parish administrator for St. Bartholomew\u2019s Anglican Church. \u201cThe Bucket is a big party. Les Voiles is a much more egalitarian and bring-your-boat-and-fit-into-whatever-class sort of thing. The Transat, no matter what time that first boat arrives, whether it\u2019s the middle of the night, all the fishermen and all the boats gather to meet them. There\u2019s a real connection.\u201d\n\nThe Anglican Church, completed in 1855, is one of the few spots in central Gustavia where Irma\u2019s impact is still tangible.

Shocked and despairing at Mr. Trump\u2019s election, women on the left concluded they had been complacent and are now diving into politics, many for the first time. Democrats are hoping to capitalize on a growing Hispanic electorate; Republicans are testing whether their close embrace of the president helps or hurts.\n\nAmong the state\u2019s marquee races is an all-out fight for the Senate seat being vacated by Jeff Flake, with candidates including Representative Martha McSally, the Air Force\u2019s first female fighter pilot; Kelli Ward, a former state senator and hard-right politician known for her conspiracy theories; and Joe Arpaio, the sheriff whose anti-immigrant stances cost him his job in 2016 on the Republican side. Representative Kyrsten Sinema is running against another woman and several men on the Democratic side. On the state level, January Contreras, a Democrat, is the first Latina to run for state attorney general.\n\nThere\u2019s also a #MeToo-inflected special election to replace Representative Trent Franks, who resigned under pressure in a sexual harassment scandal. On April 24, Debbie Lesko, a former state senator who beat 11 Republican male primary challengers as a full-throated Trump supporter, will face off against Hiral Tipirneni, a doctor and political newcomer who trained with Emerge America, one of several groups that recruit Democratic women to run for office.\n\nStill, Arizona remains a state that has not had a Democratic senator since 1995 and where Republicans have the trifecta of governor and both houses of the legislature. Entrenched conservative values will clash this year with a liberal fervor that often plays out at the local level, in grinding, unglamorous work.\n\nThis surge of activism is engaging women of all ages and backgrounds, but tensions are already flaring between women on the left and the center about whom to endorse. Advice and training are pouring in from a bevy of national organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Indivisible, another of the \u201cresistance\u201d groups that published a widely downloaded organizing guide.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWomen make up a majority of Indivisible\u2019s ranks in Phoenix; they hold weekly protests, canvass for candidates and convene summit meetings, including a visit from the strategists who ran the ground game for the recent Democratic gains in the Virginia state legislature. Julie Golding, a financial analyst, maintains an \u201cAZ Resist\u201d calendar of activities across the state that logs between 30 and 60 events a day.\n\nDemocrats continue to hope that they can win votes by increasing turnout among Arizona\u2019s large and growing Hispanic population. Ana Maria Escobedo, an entrepreneur, joined Indivisible determined to rally more Hispanics to register; she is knocking on doors to enlist new voters, and proudly recounted how she and an avid Trump supporter spent all night talking at a wedding so she could rebut him point by point.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSustaining this momentum is far from assured. \u201cPeople are angry,\u201d said Kate Fisher, who corrals volunteers for Planned Parenthood. \u201cBut to translate that into activists who will be here in November \u2014 that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d On top of her day job as an engineer at Arizona State University, Ms. Fisher devotes nights and weekends to juggling schedules for voter registration, inviting volunteers to dinner and guiding them to political organizing tools like the Voter Action Network, a database that tracks voter records and assesses who\u2019s persuadable.\n\nOther women have geared up to run for local offices where Republicans have enjoyed considerable success, with the party controlling 32 state legislatures to Democrats\u2019 13. Jennifer Jermaine interrupted her maternity leave after the election to post a call on Facebook for a new group she christened Stronger Together Arizona to mobilize community action including voter registration. Within 10 days, she said she had 10,000 members and 1,000 women attended the first meeting on Nov. 20; they in turn spun off Save Our Schools Arizona, which capitalizes on growing anger about education cuts.\n\n\u201cThe moms of Arizona got pissed off and decided to do something,\u201d she said. Now she is collecting signatures to appear on the ballot to challenge a Republican state representative.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThis influx of newly involved women meshes and sometimes clashes with years of political action by a growing cadre of Hispanics enraged by anti-immigrant policies. Carmen Cornejo, chairwoman of Chicanos Por La Causa and a longtime advocate for the Dreamers, said an early example and playbook for many of today\u2019s mobilization efforts in the Latino community was the recall of the State Senate president, Russell Pearce, in 2011 and the defeat of Mr. Arpaio in 2016.\n\nSeveral longtime Hispanic advocates welcome the swell of activism, but say that some of the newcomers failed to defer to their experience, heed their strategic advice, or embrace their political priorities.\n\n\u201cThey need to trust that women of color can be strategists,\u201d said Alejandra Gomez, co-executive director of Lucha, a local advocacy group. \u201cWe know we\u2019re in it for the long haul.

She is a citizen, but her father was not until recently, and the family left California in 1999 as anti-immigrant sentiment swelled, only to encounter it again in Arizona. She, like some other Hispanic activists and progressive groups, has balked at what she sees as a lessening of commitment on immigration issues by Democrats like Ms. Sinema who are trying to woo independents and moderate Republicans. Ms. Cornejo says she hopes young activists will eventually accept a candidate like Ms. Sinema to stave off harsher measures that Republicans endorse; Ms. Gomez once admired her but now says she would not back her. Ms. Sinema\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nAs these tensions play out among Democrats, Republican women are also vying to claim an Arizona heritage that has embraced feisty women stretching back to the state\u2019s frontier and rancher roots.\n\nAs a former fighter pilot given to blunt pronouncements, Ms. McSally fits this mold and is most pundits\u2019 bet to oppose Ms. Sinema for Senate. According to a tally of statewide and congressional races kept by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, so far more Democratic women than Republican ones are running for state and congressional seats in Arizona, but Republican women remain formidable in the state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne early test of Republican strength may be the special election.\n\nMs. Tipirneni, in an echo of Democratic national strategy, is hoping to carve out support from independents and moderate Republicans through her embrace of health care and opposition to a school voucher plan Ms. Lesko backed.\n\nBut Ms. Lesko has several advantages: years in the state legislature; a district where far more Republicans voted in the primary than Democrats; and an electorate she says is majority pro-Trump, even as she has called on the president to address accusations of sexual improprieties. She also says her own history as an abused wife who mustered the courage to leave her first husband more than 25 years ago has resonated with other women.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Iyer is relishing her transition from suburban mother to legislative scourge. She posted her first newsletter on Facebook, reaching about 350 friends; now she posts it on a civic engagement site and estimates it reaches about 35,000 people. In the days after the presidential election, she discovered Arizona\u2019s Request to Speak program, which allows a verified voter to register an opinion on a bill and ask to appear before the legislature. At first, she said, she noticed a lawmaker rolling his eyes and others texting under the table as she spoke.\n\nBut after the successful Save Our Schools petition drive and her attendance at statewide protests calling for teachers\u2019 raises, she recounted a different attitude: \u201cThey know when we sit in their office that there are thousands more like us.\u201d", "title": "Year of the Woman?

All the creations are plated in real gold, some with antique finishes, and include thousands of handset Swarovski crystals. The custom tiaras range from $700 to $2,500, depending on the intricacy of the work.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWith the royal weddings they get to see both together, in real life,\u201d Ms. Spivak said, \u201cand many want to recreate it for themselves.\u201d\n\nAfter the April 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, she said, almost every bride who came into the shop was asking for a tiara.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "YouTube\u2019s distinction between its main product and YouTube Kids is significant because of the rules on disclosure and parental consent that kick in for sites with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that they are trafficking in the personal information of children under 13.\n\nThose rules were first detailed in the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, known as Coppa. The Federal Trade Commission expanded the act in 2012, noting that it needed to be updated for the age of mobile devices. The revised rules made clear that companies must obtain parental consent before collecting details that could be used to identify, contact or locate a child. These included photos, video, audio and the location of a child\u2019s mobile device.\n\nIn the complaint that will be filed on Monday with the commission, the advocacy groups say YouTube is able to collect data on children under 13 through its main site, where cartoons, nursery-rhyme videos and those ever-popular toy-unboxing clips garner millions of views.\n\nYouTube\u2019s terms of service hold that visitors to its main site are affirming that they are at least 13 and agree to Google\u2019s privacy policy, which outlines how the company collects information on individuals and then tailors ads and services to them. By watching a YouTube video, the policy says, viewers give Google permission to collect data tied to their device, location, browsing habits, phone number and more.\n\nThe groups say this kind of tracking requires parental notification and consent first. While companies can collect some of that information from children to deliver relevant ads, they are supposed to obtain parental consent to use it for more tailored purposes, like behavioral advertising or profiles of individuals. The YouTube Kids app, for example, specifies in its privacy policy that it \u201cdoes not allow interest-based advertising or re-marketing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t received the letter yet but look forward to reviewing it,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission said in an email. She added that the commission took enforcement of Coppa \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had brought more than two dozen cases tied to the rule.\n\nYouTube provided an emailed statement that said the platform had not yet received the complaint but that \u201cprotecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe will read the complaint thoroughly and evaluate if there are things we can do to improve,\u201d the company went on. \u201cBecause YouTube is not for children, we\u2019ve invested significantly in the creation of the YouTube Kids app to offer an alternative specifically designed for children.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They also pointed to a number of channels for toddlers and preschoolers within \u201cGoogle Preferred,\u201d a collection of top videos on the main YouTube site and app that are vetted and packaged for advertisers.\n\nAs YouTube\u2019s popularity has surged, it has faced a string of issues related to content geared to children, from inappropriate videos that have appeared on its YouTube Kids app to deceptive advertising.\n\nYouTube said this year that human beings working for the platform would screen all videos from creators whose work appeared on Google Preferred, which the consumer advocates cited as proof that Google employees \u201chave actual knowledge that the content is child-directed.\u201d YouTube has also brokered ad deals with toy companies like Mattel, and has noted how its video ads have helped children\u2019s channels attract specific audiences, like American parents with children under 5.\n\nMr. Golin said he believed that YouTube was aware it was collecting and monetizing the data of children with such videos, and that the company should simply shift all the videos aimed at children to the YouTube Kids app.\n\n\u201cWe know kids are primarily consuming this through iPads and mobile phones, which are not particularly conducive to group watching,\u201d Mr. Golin said.\n\nThe complaint comes during a public reckoning around the collection and use of personal data by technology companies after revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political data firm, improperly harvested the information of possibly more than 80 million Facebook users. It also strikes a warning note for Google and YouTube overseas as Europe prepares to roll out new data privacy rules. Mr. Chester said the groups will encourage consumer advocates in Europe to file similar complaints about Google and YouTube under those rules, where penalties for companies will be stiff.\n\nDylan Collins, chief executive of SuperAwesome, a privacy technology firm used by companies that market to children, said questions around data collection would only grow as children continued to flood huge tech platforms that were built for adults.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley now has a responsibility to figure out how to move from building adult tech into building kid tech,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any company, whether it\u2019s Facebook or YouTube or Snapchat, can hide from the fact that there are about 10 times more kids online today than there were six or seven years ago when their products were being designed or built.\u201d", "title": "YouTube Is Improperly Collecting Children\u2019s Data, Consumer Groups Say", "authors": ["Sapna Maheshwari"]}

And some videos slip through the cracks, with embarrassing results. Last year, parents complained that violent or provocative videos were finding their way to YouTube Kids, an app that is supposed to contain only child-friendly content that has automatically been filtered from the main YouTube site.\n\nYouTube has contended that the volume of videos uploaded to the site is too big of a challenge to rely only on human monitors.\n\nStill, in December, Google said it was hiring 10,000 people in 2018 to address policy violations across its platforms. In a blog post on Monday, YouTube said it had filled the majority of the jobs that had been allotted to it, including specialists with expertise in violent extremism, counterterrorism and human rights, as well as expanding regional teams. It was not clear what YouTube\u2019s final share of the total would be.\n\nStill, YouTube said three-quarters of all videos flagged by computers had been removed before anyone had a chance to watch them.\n\nThe company\u2019s machines can detect when a person tries to upload a video that has already been taken down and will prevent that video from reappearing on the site. And in some cases with videos containing nudity or misleading content, YouTube said its computer systems are adept enough to delete the video without requiring a human to review the decision.\n\nThe company said its machines are also getting better at spotting violent extremist videos, which tend to be harder to identify and have fairly small audiences.\n\nAt the start of 2017, before YouTube introduced so-called machine-learning technology to help computers identify videos associated with violent extremists, 8 percent of videos flagged and removed for that kind of content had fewer than 10 views. In the first quarter of 2018, the company said, more than half of the videos flagged and removed for violent extremism had fewer than 10 views.", "title": "YouTube Says Computers Are Catching Problem Videos", "authors": []}

Officials have said Mr. Skripal, a former Russian spy turned double agent who was living peacefully in southwestern England, was very likely targeted as an example to future defectors. Moscow has denied the accusations and has seized on the ambiguities surrounding the investigation in an aggressive campaign to discredit the British authorities.\n\nAt the United Nations on Thursday, the Russian ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, called an emergency session of the Security Council where he accused the British authorities of everything from planting false stories in the media to neglecting Mr. Skripal\u2019s pet cats and guinea pigs.

That\u2019s more than twice the amount of money that customers transferred with Venmo, a rival money-transfer app.\n\nBut the same features that make Zelle so useful for customers, its speed and ubiquity, have made it irresistible to thieves. Hackers and con artists have used the system to steal from victims \u2014 some of whom had never used Zelle or even heard of it until someone used it to clean out their bank accounts.\n\nInterviews with more than two dozen customers who had their money stolen through Zelle illustrate the weaknesses that criminals are using in targeting the network.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Perhaps \u2014 and here, too, there is some reason \u2014 it is because of the great cult of the individual, one individual in particular, that has enveloped this Real Madrid for most of the last decade. No matter who the manager is, this will always be Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s team: its triumphs are his triumphs, its trophies are his trophies, almost always achieved through his own, divine intervention. Ronaldo always takes center stage; at Real Madrid, the coach is relegated to the supporting cast.\n\nBut perhaps there is something else at play, too, a sense that Zidane can be overlooked because he does not fit the criteria we expect from a great 21st century coach.\n\nThis is an age of the manager as visionary and philosopher, there not simply to hone the skills, maintain the fitness and direct the energies of elite athletes but to deploy them in the service of some grand idea; not just to make them a team, but to make them a story, to give them a purpose, an identity.\n\nThat idea is appealing, of course, because it creates the illusion that someone is in control of the general chaos that defines even the most rarefied level of soccer. For fans and owners invested, emotionally and financially, in the sport, the idea that much of what happens on the field is down to random chance is deeply unsatisfactory; it is much more appealing to believe that one transcendent figure can master the mayhem. It is soccer\u2019s avowed belief that the manager alone has that agency, that power: less coach, more guru.\n\nIf that belief has plenty of historical antecedents \u2014 from Helenio Herrera of Inter Milan to Matt Busby of Manchester United \u2014 then it has found its greatest modern expression in Guardiola, designer of the first truly great team of the 21st century, the Barcelona of 2008-2012.\n\nFans, and clubs, see Guardiola as a managerial paradigm: consumed by prophetic zeal, purveyor of a distinct, unequivocal style.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe paces relentlessly on the touchline, trying to communicate his ideas to his players, to obtain his own inner peace through some sporting perfection. He talks at almost impossible speed, ideas forming and tumbling out of his brain almost too fast for him to verbalize them; he operates on a different level, sees the game more deeply, more clearly, than we can realize.\n\nZidane does not fit that mold at all. He speaks slowly, deliberately, as if he is fastidiously refusing to say anything noteworthy. He is by nature taciturn, bordering on shy. He does not pretend to be the standard-bearer for a school of thought, to have some higher purpose, to wish to transform the game.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In a culture that demands complication, he represents a simplicity bordering on asceticism.\n\nHis successes, of course, are the most powerful proof that he is more than he seems, but there are the small details, too, the way he fulfills the most basic, most important requirement of a manager: to influence the course of an individual game.\n\nWednesday\u2019s victory was a case in point. Real Madrid did not, by any measure, play well. Bayern Munich took the lead, through Joshua Kimmich, and only conceded out of the blue, a momentary lapse in concentration allowing Marcelo to shoot home from the edge of the box.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt halftime, Zidane discovered that he had to remove his playmaker and most impressive performer, Isco. He introduced Marco Asensio, instructing him to try to hold the ball, to relieve the insistent pressure on Real\u2019s defense, and to lead his team on the counterattack. Ten minutes later, Asensio, on the counterattack, scored the winner.\n\nMore impressive still was Zidane\u2019s reaction to seeing Dani Carvajal, his right back, forced from the game through injury. He eschewed logic: Leading 2-1, he introduced Karim Benzema, a striker. Asensio switched to the right wing; Lucas V\u00e1zquez, a forward-thinking wide player, dropped to right-back. He wanted the pair\u2019s pace to try to counteract Franck Ribery, Bayern\u2019s vastly experienced winger. It worked; Bayern struggled to create chances of any sort in the final half-hour.\n\nOnce might be dumb luck, but this is a pattern. In the first leg of the round of 16 game with Paris Saint-Germain, Zidane introduced V\u00e1zquez and Asensio; it was 1-1 when they came on, and 3-1 at the end. In the second leg of the quarterfinal against Juventus, he removed Casemiro and Gareth Bale at halftime, to try to limit the damage. V\u00e1zquez came on then, too, and won the penalty that saved Real.\n\nIt is a characteristic all great managers share: a sense, spoken or not, of how a game is going, of how the balance might be altered.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZidane has it, in spades. In last year\u2019s final, against Juventus, the game was finely poised at halftime. All he asked of his players, then, was to move five meters further forward. Real, tied 1-1 at the break, won 4-1.\n\nThat skill is not quite as enticing, quite as compelling, as listening to a preacher expound his great vision of what soccer can be; it does not fuel the belief that someone is in control of the chaos. Rather, it embraces it, proves that even the slightest change can have vast consequences.\n\nIt almost seems too easy to be worthy of comparison, too basic a task to be significant. Complexity, though, is not always importance. Zidane does the simple things well. He might, just might, know what he is doing.", "title": "Zinedine Zidane Has the Wins at Real Madrid.

Is it you or is it them?\u201d\n\nWith more contrition and promises to work harder to protect consumers, Mr. Zuckerberg stayed close to the prepared talking points he has used since the breach came to light. \u201cIt will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I\u2019m committed to getting it right,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg also revealed that his own personal data had been compromised by third-party actors, though he did not identify which company was responsible. He said Facebook was considering legal action against Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis testimony did little to mollify lawmakers, who called for new regulations that would limit Facebook\u2019s ability to collect data on users without permission and to make privacy policies clear to better empower consumers.\n\n\u201cThis incident demonstrates yet again that our laws are not working,\u201d said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House committee.\n\nDespite the consensus that legislation is needed, there is no clear path forward on any of the proposals. The regulation most likely to pass after the hearings is a Senate bill that would require social media companies to disclose funding of political ads on their sites.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have recently announced their support of the bill, called the Honest Ads Act, which is modeled after disclosure rules for broadcasters. Several internet companies, including Facebook, had lobbied aggressively to defeat any new rules for online political ads, but have since changed their positions.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor many lawmakers, even defining what Facebook is and how to place it within the regulatory ecosystem was a challenge.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecommunications, asking whether the company was a \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201d\n\nThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Facebook should be responsible for what it publishes, he said, but it was not a news media company. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\n\nBut the hearings helped create a foundation for new rules in the future, experts said. Congress showed an increasing ease \u2014 particularly from important Republicans in both chambers \u2014 to regulate Silicon Valley.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLonger term, we saw growing comfort on both sides of the aisle for privacy legislation,\u201d said Alan Davidson, a former internet policy official in the Obama administration and a former executive at Google. \u201cSo this is not the last we\u2019ve heard from Washington.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Zuckerberg, who has been warmly welcomed by world leaders in China and India, it was clear that Facebook had few friends in Washington, particularly in the House. The company has invested heavily in its lobbying of Congress and the administration. Lobbying expenditures in 2017 increased 32 percent to $11.5 million from the previous year. But it has struggled to shake impressions among some Republicans that the site and its employees have a liberal bias. Democrats who were once close to Silicon Valley have become vocal critics of social media platforms for allowing fake political news and foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, House lawmakers from both parties took an aggressive stance toward Mr. Zuckerberg, pointing fingers, interrupting and chastising him for repeated failures \u2014 and apologies \u2014 over privacy.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepresentative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, used a sizable chunk of her limited speaking time to list Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s past apologies.\n\nRepresentative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, repeatedly pointed a finger at Mr. Zuckerberg when asking, in a raised voice, \u201cWhy is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy and security settings?\u201d\n\nRepresentative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, cut off Mr. Zuckerberg several times as he tried to answer a question about Facebook employees who sit with political campaigns as \u201cembeds\u201d and seek to get the campaigns to use the site for advertising.\n\nThe second day of marathon hearings came after more subdued questioning from the Senate. But some key Republican senators also signaled a desire for regulations on Silicon Valley.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said after the hearing on Tuesday that Facebook was a \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d and that \u201ccontinued self-regulation is not the right answer when it comes to dealing with the abuses we have seen on Facebook.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe hearings also revealed lingering suspicion of Facebook among Republicans. Out in the hall during a break in the hearing, Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, expanded on his remarks about Facebook\u2019s treatment of Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump video personalities who have complained about being censored by the platform. The online personalities were brought up numerous times on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they take down a lot more conservative content than they do liberal,\u201d Mr. Long said.\n\nMr. Long said that he needed more answers about the particular situation, and that he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg could ensure that the company\u2019s thousands of moderators were not biased against conservatives.\n\n\u201cHe better hope he does it, not us,\u201d Mr. Long added. \u201cOr Congress is going to get involved, and regulate a private industry.\u201d", "title": "Zuckerberg Faces Hostile Congress as Calls for Regulation Mount", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang", "Kevin Roose"]}

Facebook has also set up mock hearings involving its communications team and outside advisers who role-play members of Congress. (Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s approachability and mannerisms were even lampooned by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this weekend.)\n\nInternal staff has pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions directly, and not to appear overly defensive. Their goal is to make Mr. Zuckerberg appear as humble, agreeable and as forthright as possible, the people close to the preparations said. Reginald J. Brown, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, is leading the WilmerHale group. A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment.\n\nAs questions about Facebook\u2019s role in the 2016 election and its privacy issues mounted, Mr. Zuckerberg initially tried to avoid the limelight, dodging requests for public testimony by lawmakers in the United States and Europe. He instead sent lieutenants, including Sheryl K. Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, to answer tough questions from lawmakers and reporters.\n\nBut last month, the latest Facebook scandal turned up the heat on Mr. Zuckerberg, when it was disclosed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of what Facebook now estimates to be up to 87 million of its users. The news made it nearly impossible for him to avoid a public appearance.\n\nFacebook is normally tight-lipped about its inner workings, but company officials have sharply shifted their tone in the past few weeks. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg held a rare conference call with reporters, in which he admitted that the company\u2019s failure to anticipate how its tools could be misused was a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d And on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that the company had started requiring advertisers to verify their identities and locations before running political ads on Facebook. He also said the company supported a bill in Congress that would require such disclosures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

In these hearings, Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe risk for Mr. Zuckerberg is appearing evasive or further angering government officials, which could lead them to attack the company even more aggressively. The company\u2019s stock has fallen about 15 percent in the three weeks since Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of data became public.\n\nFacebook\u2019s damage control efforts, which are being overseen by a policy and communications team of more than 500 employees as well as a handful of outside crisis communications firms, are unprecedented in the company\u2019s 14-year history.\n\nThe company is used to dealing with criticism, dating back to its early days, when Mr. Zuckerberg was forced to calm users who were angry about the introduction of the news feed, a feature that is now central to Facebook\u2019s design. But most of its scandals have been short-lived, with a few days of backlash followed by a quick return to normality.\n\nThe 2016 election, and revelations that Russians used the platform to spread misinformation, have proved to be more intractable problems. In the fall, when Mr. Stretch testified before a Senate subcommittee about why Facebook had failed to stop Russian interference, his remarks were not warmly received.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal seems to have unlocked even larger worries about the influence of social media, the power of Silicon Valley and the cavalier approach many tech companies have taken toward user privacy. While the vast majority of users and advertisers have not abandoned Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg has acknowledged that the company\u2019s reputation has taken a hit.\n\n\u201cSo far, they\u2019ve failed at every state of this, and at every level of the organization,\u201d said Ari Ratner, a former Barack Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm. \u201cThey have the potential to reset with Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before Congress.\u201d\n\nIn addition to mollifying lawmakers and investors, Mr. Zuckerberg needs to impress another important audience during next week\u2019s hearings: Facebook\u2019s rank-and-file employees, who have begun to question the company\u2019s leadership as the latest crisis has spiraled.\n\nThis past week, internal tension began to simmer after a 2016 internal memo from Andrew Bosworth, a high-ranking Facebook executive, was published by BuzzFeed News. The appearance of the memo, a strident defense of Facebook\u2019s growth-at-all-costs strategy, left some employees fearful of future leaks. Others argued that Facebook should use the episode to reflect on its responsibilities to protect user privacy.\n\nAs the scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s core product has risen, some unhappy engineers have tried to transfer to the company\u2019s Instagram and WhatsApp divisions.

When a masked figure in a wheelchair wearing a red smoking jacket like Teddy\u2019s wordlessly wheels himself over to Darius, it\u2019s reasonable to assume it is Teddy, and his games are getting increasingly warped. Using a chalkboard, the figure warns Darius that both their lives are in danger and tells him to find a gun in the attic.\n\nFed up at long last, Darius rolls his eyes and goes to leave with his piano, only to find his truck is now blocked in by a car. This is no longer just a creepy recluse toying with an unsuspecting guest.\n\nThe basement-dweller was right about the gun in the attic, only Teddy\u2019s now pointing it at Darius on the second floor. He turns away from obsessively watching home movies of his childhood trauma to explain his deranged plan. Teddy\u2019s going to frame Darius as a homicidal home invader, making him take the fall for Benny\u2019s death. This is full-on \u201cWhatever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d madness and we still don\u2019t even have hard proof that there truly is a Benny. Until we do. And then, the whole macabre affair ends in abrupt tragedy.\n\nMoments before the fraternal murder-suicide, Darius tried to soothe his deeply damaged captor. \u201cNot all great things come from great pain.

Despite being \u201callergic to girlfriends,\u201d as Darius put it, Al seems open to the possibilities with this one. In conversation, she gives as good as she gets and they\u2019re able to share a laugh together. She\u2019s even a good cheerleader when one of his songs starts playing on the car radio. You can see him starting to let his guard down, so much so that he\u2019s game for an itinerary that reeks of coupledom.\n\nFirst, they stop at a high-end boutique, where Sierra aims to give Al a fashion makeover. We know she\u2019s a former stripper, but her current gig hasn\u2019t yet been revealed. One thing is obvious: the woman is fame-savvy.\n\n\u201cNobody wants for somebody famous to look just like them,\u201d she says in an authoritative tone, advising him to scrap his usual sweaty polo shirts and cargo shorts.\n\nAs she commands the store\u2019s wary, dismissive employees to do her bidding, she makes it clear to Al that she\u2019s not bossy, she\u2019s a boss.\n\nShe urges him to \u201clevel up\u201d in terms of his management, too. Earn\u2019s free liquor connections are bush league; by her estimation, he should be procuring free shoes, clothes and more.\n\n\u201cYou need someone who\u2019s working for you,\u201d she tells Al. It\u2019s the third time (at least) that he\u2019s heard this counsel this season and, by the look on his face, he\u2019s finally ready to heed it.\n\nAfter this mini-intervention, he waits patiently while she poses for photos with a pair of excited fans, gallantly opens the nail salon door for her and joins in a his-and-hers pedicure. These glimpses of domestic bliss look good on Al, but they\u2019re short-lived.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs they\u2019re seated in the cushy salon chairs \u2014 Al giggling at the tickle of his first pumice scrub \u2014 Sierra\u2019s hustle comes to light. \u201cI\u2019m Instagram famous, boo!\u201d she says, happily scrolling through photos that the fans outside just posted on social media. She promotes her brand of diva wigs on social media and, unlike Al, she\u2019s unapologetic and proactive in her pursuit of fame. Of the two of them, she\u2019s the one who\u2019s actually all about that paper.\n\nShe pitches the idea of the two of them teaming up to form a power couple. \u201cWe can attach our brands. Boost each other,\u201d she explains.\n\nThis draws his ire, loath as he is to go in for any of the \u201cfake\u201d trappings of celebrity. He starts to see Sierra in a different light. The assertiveness he\u2019d admired earlier in the boutique now seemed more like rudeness. He\u2019s visibly embarrassed as she reprimands the nail technicians for not speaking English. The date is officially over once she snaps a candid shot of the two of them, planning to post it online. He realizes that her image-driven tactics don\u2019t jibe with his \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay real\u201d credo.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting over there whining, acting like you\u2019re better than me because I\u2019m trying to get paid,\u201d Sierra says angrily as Al rises to leave.\n\nHe pads off on his own, despite the fact that she\u2019s his ride. After a pitstop for a burger at Krystal, his fast-food chain of choice, Al heads home on foot. While walking, he encounters three teens who are discussing \u201cStar Wars\u201d (a not-at-all-subtle reference to Glover\u2019s next big project). They stop short when they notice a rapper in their midst and feign fandom.\n\nHere, Al gets his second rude awakening. While Sierra sought to benefit mutually from Al\u2019s fame, these three just want to take full advantage of it, Robbin\u2019 Season style.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After a brief, tense exchange of stares, one boy distracts him as another lands a suckerpunch and the third pulls out a gun. They take turns punching Al, then steal his watch and gold chain.\n\nHe takes off into the wooded area nearby, running from bullets. The gun-toting teen calls out to him, taunting him, as a badly-beaten Al grabs a stick for protection and lies low. After a while, he presses on, the air growing thick with the sounds of birds singing, crickets chirping and then flies buzzing \u2026 around a bloody deer carcass. Then comes an ominous humming, followed by chuckling. It\u2019s a chill-inducing \u201cDeliverance\u201d moment.\n\nThe thieving teens are no longer trailing Al; instead he comes face to face with a downtrodden old man. He\u2019s staggering amid the trees, incoherently offering Al money and Chapstick.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just high,\u201d he says, temporarily snapping back to his senses.\n\nIs this babbling old man real, or some sort of apparition? Al\u2019s already had a run-in with an ambitious Lady Macbeth-type; why not a full-on supernatural experience in the forest, to boot?\n\nAdding to this sense of David Lynchian suspense, the director, Hiro Murai, pans out slowly to reveal the vastness of the woods in which Al is now lost.\n\nNight falls and Al is still wandering aimlessly through the trees, his footsteps and heavy breathing keep time with the sounds of crickets, rustling leaves and creaking branches. Classic horror film elements like these keep the tension intact, as they\u2019ve done in nearly every episode this season.\n\nAfter another flash of the dead deer, the old man reappears. This time, he\u2019s got a new nickname for Al (\u201cBig Ol\u2019 Black Boy Deer Guts\u201d), as well as a heavy-handed warning.\n\n\u201cMake the decision,\u201d the man says, suddenly jutting a boxcutter toward Al\u2019s throat. \u201cKeep standing still, you\u2019re gone, boy. You\u2019re wastin\u2019 time. And the only people who got time are dead. And if you\u2019re dead, I\u2019m gonna take them shoes and your wallet \u2026 and that shirt.\u201d\n\nHe gives Al until the count of 30 to get out of his sight. It doesn\u2019t even take that long for Al to escape the trees and stumble into a gas station parking lot.\n\nPerhaps that wooded expanse only seemed sprawling because his battered psyche led him to believe it was so. By that logic, maybe the old man or the deer or both were just more manifestations of Al\u2019s (probably concussed) mind playing tricks on him.\n\nWhatever the true nature of this unsettling sylvan scene, it was enough to make Al see the light. All this time, he\u2019s been on the fence about whether or not he wants this fame of his. When a timid, preppy teen approaches him inside the gas station convenience store, he seems ready to step into his role. Despite being covered in blood, dirt and leaves, he gamely throws his arm around the young fan and poses for one photo after another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s a move signaling that Al is finally ready to be Paper Boi.

As Mr. Downey described them, Anthony is \u201ca bit more reflective, a yin guy,\u201d while Joe is the intense yang of the partnership: \u201cBitcoin was invented to keep Joe Russo from killing himself during the last 20 percent of the shoot,\u201d Mr. Downey said.\n\nWhen they\u2019re together, Mr. Downey added, \u201cIt\u2019s like the two of them make a third thing that\u2019s better than any one person could be.\u201d\n\nThe Russos grew up in Cleveland, where their father, Basil M. Russo, served as Democratic majority leader of the City Council. When the city went into an economic tailspin in the 1970s and \u201980s, the brothers immersed themselves in movies and learned to appreciate their creative isolation.\n\nAs Anthony Russo explained it, \u201cThe virtue of growing up in the industrial Midwest is you have nothing to rub up against you and no one to tell you that you can\u2019t do what you want to do, because nobody\u2019s doing anything.

But it flopped at its release in 2002.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the next several years, the Russos focused on directing television shows, including \u201cLucky,\u201d a short-lived FX series, and \u201cArrested Development,\u201d the rapid-fire satire that became a cult hit on Fox.\n\nDespite critical acclaim, \u201cArrested Development\u201d got notoriously low ratings. But the Russos said this lack of attention was a blessing in disguise, allowing them to experiment with narrative, tone and pacing, unencumbered by interfering network executives.\n\n\u201cThey so didn\u2019t get the show that they really didn\u2019t care what you did,\u201d Anthony Russo said, adding, \u201cIt was a huge creative upside.\u201d\n\nThe Russos used NBC\u2019s \u201cCommunity,\u201d another well-reviewed comedy with a meager viewership, to stage elaborate tributes to \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone. It was here that their work caught Marvel\u2019s attention.\n\nAt the time, the studio was generating hits with its earliest superhero offerings, made by established filmmakers \u2014 \u201cIron Man,\u201d directed by Jon Favreau; \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger,\u201d directed by Joe Johnston.

When the movie sold $714 million in tickets worldwide, Mr. Feige said the Russos \u201credefined the franchise \u2014 not just the Cap franchise but all the Marvel movies going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey found a way to keep the wonder, keep the spectacle, but ground it even more in realism,\u201d Mr. Feige said. \u201cWhich is a word I use lightly when it comes to our movies.\u201d\n\nThe Russos succeeded again with \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d an overstuffed 2016 sequel in which the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and a new incarnation of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) were introduced, and the adventurers took sides in a conflict between Cap and Iron Man.\n\nEven before \u201cCivil War\u201d became a $1.15 billion global smash, Marvel had already started putting the pieces in place for what Mr. Feige called \u201cthe big finale of the initial story line we were developing.\u201d\n\nThe plan was ambitious: Mr. Markus and Mr. McFeely would write two \u201cAvengers\u201d movies, generated from a 60-page manifesto they started working on in 2015. All the major Marvel heroes had to be accommodated, and still more characters would be introduced. \u201cNot every scene can be 25 people in a room,\u201d Mr. McFeely said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make kickball teams and then have a tournament.\u201d\n\nWith scripts in hand, the Russos would film these movies consecutively. In Mr. Feige\u2019s mind, there were no other directors who could handle the task of doing \u201cthree straight years of filmmaking.\u201d\n\nMr. Feige said, \u201cThere are two of them, which helps. But their individual stamina is unmatched.\u201d\n\nThe Russos moved from Los Angeles to Georgia for two years, where \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and its sequel were shot, principally at Pinewood Atlanta Studios. (They estimate that they took a break of about three weeks between filming the two movies.)\n\nThey said making the movies this way was an irresistible challenge \u2014 one that has been attempted by very few directors, including the Wachowskis (\u201cThe Matrix\u201d series) and Peter Jackson (the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cHobbit\u201d franchises) \u2014 and a test of their fortitude.\n\nPhoto\n\nDescribing the process, Anthony Russo said, \u201cYou\u2019re a really good marathon runner and you know how to train for it. All of a sudden, you\u2019re running a double marathon. You can\u2019t really understand it until you do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russos acknowledge that the films were made this way, in part, for economic reasons: it\u2019s cheaper for Marvel to hire actors \u2014 dozens of them, some of whom are very costly \u2014 for months at a time, rather than make individual deals for each movie.\n\nThough they must serve many corporate masters at Disney and Marvel, and Mr. Feige is known for having a strong hand in his films, the Russos say they were given the latitude to make the movies they want to make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no different than making any kind of narrative in a medium where capitalism thrives,\u201d Joe Russo said. \u201cYou have to have a Zen resilience about what it is that you want to do, and then do a really good job at it. And everybody stays out of your hair.\u201d\n\nMr. Downey, who first worked with the Russos on \u201cCivil War,\u201d said they were well served by their TV training, which has taught them to be quick and collaborative.\n\nAt any given moment on these films, Mr. Downey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got 80 things that are going to blow up, collide \u2014 story points that are all about to happen at once.\u201d When one of the Russos had a new idea, he said, they would approach him with a gentle query: \u201cLet me pitch you this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one takes it personally, and then the idea emerges,\u201d Mr. Downey said. \u201cIt ends up an amalgam of everything that didn\u2019t hit the floor.\u201d\n\nThe Russos aren\u2019t revealing much about how, exactly, their \u201cAvengers\u201d movies will bring closure to this phase of the Marvel cinematic saga. (They wouldn\u2019t even disclose the title of the movie that follows \u201cInfinity War,\u201d protesting that even this much information would be a spoiler.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d Joe Russo said, \u201cwhat you\u2019ll see by the end of the movies is, what does it cost to be a hero in a world where there are no easy answers? I think that\u2019s the world we live in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDeath is a staple of comic books. Beloved characters are killed off all the time, sometimes replaced by successors who inherit their costumes and identities: Bucky becomes the new Captain America; Jane Foster the new Thor. There\u2019s no reason to believe that their motion-picture counterparts aren\u2019t similarly mortal and similarly interchangeable.\n\nMr. Evans has made no secret of his desire to move beyond the \u201cCaptain America\u201d movies. Meanwhile, Mr. Downey \u2014 who introduced himself in a phone interview as \u201cRobert Downey Jr., retired film actor\u201d \u2014 is already working on his next prospective tentpole movie, \u201cThe Voyage of Dr. Dolittle.\u201d\n\nHe talked about his time with Marvel in retrospective tones, and reflected on an encounter with Keanu Reeves, who at the time had just finished making the first \u201cMatrix\u201d movie.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, dude, how\u2019d it go?\u2019\u201d Mr. Downey recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve been on another planet.\u2019 Right now, I\u2019ve been on the planet Dolittle for a while. Being detached from it has given me a lot of warmth, affection and objectivity about this past decade.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Marvel engine will keep chugging away. \u201cThere will be more movies with some of these characters,\u201d Mr. Feige said, \u201cand with lots of new characters.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s pending acquisition of Fox would add even more familiar heroes to Marvel\u2019s toy chest, including the X-Men and Fantastic Four.

Still, it\u2019s worth noting that the ascendance of Marvel (and of other, not quite as universal entities like it) has narrowed the parameters of criticism. I\u2019m supposed to tell you, in this review, how much fun you\u2019ll have at \u201cInfinity War.\u201d (Yes, you will have some. Will you have enough? Almost.) But I\u2019ve probably already gone too far in trying to think about what it means. The Marvel movies and others of their kind often produce an illusion of profundity, a slick, murky overlay of allegorical suggestiveness. This provides grist for the kind of think pieces that spar with one another \u2014 \u201cInfinity War\u201d is liberal; no, it\u2019s conservative; but don\u2019t you see that it\u2019s a protest against Trump; actually, it\u2019s an attack on the tyranny of political correctness \u2014 until they catalyze the inevitable anti-intellectual backlash. It\u2019s just a movie! Don\u2019t spoil the fun!\n\nAnd of course it is with respect to \u201cspoilers\u201d that the policing of discourse is most ruthlessly and effectively practiced. Reviewers who attend advance screenings take a vow of silence about plot details that will be widely known within a week and all but forgotten a week after that. Government secrets are guarded with less care, and requests from public officials to go off the record are addressed with more skepticism. But if I mention which superhero dies, or which one has an unexpected relationship with someone else \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t dream of it. Not because I\u2019m afraid of Disney executives. It\u2019s the wrath of their obedient, weaponized minions I fear. In other words: you.\n\nThis is not a healthy situation. The reasonable concern that major plot elements not be divulged has spawned a phobic, hypersensitive taboo against public discussion of anything that happens onscreen. If, for example, I were to share that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) mistakes Rocket (Bradley Cooper), who is a raccoon, for a rabbit \u2014 whoops, you already hit \u201csend,\u201d didn\u2019t you? The joke is repeated a half-dozen times, so it kind of ruins itself. And until the end, the whole thing is weirdly free of any but the most superficial, mechanical surprises.\n\nThe action is especially tedious and predictable. I mean both the scenes of fighting and flying and the overall rhythm of the first two hours or so. People talk for a while, sprinkling jokes and morsels of personality into the heavy dough of exposition. Then they fight in the usual way, by throwing giant objects (and one another) and shooting waves of color from their hands. The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination.", "title": "\u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019: It\u2019s Marvel\u2019s Universe.

It\u2019s a phrase that connotes wealth, luxury, excess, a life of unlimited possibility and security. How easy it is to let the sparkle of the crown jewels blind us to the dead enemies and discarded undesirables through which they were purchased. This week\u2019s episode of \u201cBillions\u201d reminds us, as bluntly as the show ever has, that the games played by Bobby Axelrod and his billionaire boys club in order to remain comfortable on their thrones can have as steep a cost to bystanders as to any player in the game.\n\nTake a close look at the title, \u201cThe Wrong Maria Gonzalez.\u201d The right Maria Gonzalez is a maid in the home of Victor, a former analyst at Axe\u2019s firm who led her to poisoning herself in order to tank the initial public offering of Ice Juice last season and thus get back in the good graces of his ex-employer. But to hear Maria tell it, she lived like a serf, bowing to the whims of her feudal lord and lady even before this act of industrial espionage landed her on an F.B.I. witness list. If she broke a glass, Victor\u2019s wife broke her taillight, putting her at risk of getting pulled over and, eventually, deported.\n\nWhich is exactly what Victor and Axe conspire to do to her once they get wind of her possible participation in the Ice Juice case. (Victor knew she was involved the moment she showed up slightly late for work; his oligarch-sense must have tingled.) To the horror of our hero Bryan Connerty and his F.B.I. ex-flame Terri McCue (Susan Misner), they arrive at the local immigration detention center only to discover that a different woman by the same name is being held captive there. Thanks to a record-keeping mishap, the \u201cright\u201d Maria Gonzalez is already on her way back to Guatemala \u2014 helped along, they correctly deduce, by Axe and his minions, in this case a comically sinister duo Axe has hired as his new skulduggery specialists.\n\nAnd if you thought that Attorney General Jock Jeffcoat would be sympathetic to the need to un-deport an \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d back to the United States so she can testify against an extremely wealthy white man, I\u2019ve got a building on Fifth Avenue to sell you.", "title": "\u2018Billions\u2019 Season 3, Episode 2 Recap: That Feeling in Your Stomach", "authors": []}

Bobby begins the episode by officially signing divorce papers with his now ex-wife Lara; the meeting is cordial, as is their private discussion of their finances and legal situation afterward. The thrust of that conversation, however, is completely infuriating. They treat the prospect of the court case leaving them with \u201conly\u201d $300 to $320 million as if they\u2019d just been bankrupted.\n\nLater, Axe approaches the disgraced investor Michael Panay (Hari Dhillon) to operate as a catspaw, making the trades that Bobby is barred from handling on his own. \u201cForty,\u201d Panay says of the amount of money left to him after his downfall. \u201cGuess I can live on that.\u201d To be clear, he is talking about 40 million, not 40 thousand, dollars. In order to save himself from the ignominy of living off an amount of money most Americans won\u2019t see in the course of their lifetimes, he effectively sells his soul to the redheaded devil.\n\nIt is a move that should further enrich him, Axe, the police pension fund they\u2019re handling and Raul Gomez, the ex-cop who runs the fund. All it requires is becoming a highly paid wage slave to an even richer man.

Contrary to longstanding policy at Axe Capital, Taylor wants to bring in quantitative analysts, or \u201cquants,\u201d who create complex computer algorithms that tell them what and when to trade instead of relying on the human insights and personal touches of Dollar Bill, Mafee, Kim, Rudy and the rest of the hotshots working the Axe Cap terminals. (Well, Dollar Bill is a hotshot, anyway; the others are nervous wrecks, as we see when Mafee\u2019s therapeutic session with Wendy Rhoades devolves, to his horror, into a slippery-slope monologue about whether or not he checks out her backside when she walks around the office.)\n\nA variety of entertaining candidates for the gig traipse in and out of the office. The final candidate is a real Goldilocks: He\u2019s older, wiser, calmer, kinder \u2014 a NASA data analyst with decades of experience who has become a quant because he sees the market as a way to learn what the whole world is thinking at any given moment. But as Taylor susses out, he is also working in cahoots with Wags to build a backdoor into his algorithm, allowing the firm\u2019s fully human traders to hastily recreate its analysis and reap the rewards themselves.\n\nTaylor winds up vowing to build Axe Cap a better quant of its own \u2014 perhaps the one time a boss actually acts on behalf of the underlings rather than against them. Like everything else on this end of the story, though, it\u2019s all in favor of filthy lucre in the end.\n\nTying together the episode\u2019s triangle of plotlines is a cynical sense of humor that\u2019s laugh-out-loud funny throughout, the way \u201cMad Men\u201d used to make you guffaw at its characters\u2019 avaricious awfulness. The episode opens with Ira\u2019s officially canceling his marriage proposal to his beautiful girlfriend on account of his financial woes; you can all but see his bank account draining with every sprinkle of $14-per-gram white truffles she has shaved onto her pasta. (She stops at 20 grams, which the waiter cheerfully says is the season\u2019s largest order. Hooray?)\n\nIra is also morbidly funny during an initial interview with Bryan over coffee, where he responds to the prospect of discussing Ice Juice\u2019s collapse by asking \u201cShall we relive my divorce, and the day the music died?\u201d As Ira, the actor Ben Shenkman makes for a terrifically sardonic patsy; this guy is not supposed to win, so when he does by accepting Axe\u2019s payout and the gift of a gigantic engagement ring, the applause of his fellow diners after his girlfriend accepts his proposal sounds like a mockery of the order of things.\n\nEven in their attempt to stop Jeffcoat from throwing the book at the abused prisoner, Rhoades and Sacher understand the need to properly angle the facts. \u201cLooks innocent, no?\u201d Chuck says as they pull up the photo that runs with the exonerating news story. \u201cHandsome, for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cEven better,\u201d he concludes. Bosses know how much perception matters. That\u2019s why, when you\u2019re used to billions like Axelrod and Panay are, no number of millions shy of that tenth digit will do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou want it darker, we kill the flame,\u201d Leonard Cohen croons on the soundtrack as Axe cashes in and Ira slides his ill-gotten ring onto his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s eager finger.

They have been since the last season of \u201cBillions,\u201d when son betrayed father as part of a plot by Chuck to ruin his nemesis, Bobby Axelrod. But the most powerful weapon wielded in the conflict so far hasn\u2019t been a legal threat or a stock swindle. It\u2019s the kiss that Charles plants square on Chuck\u2019s mouth, hands locked on his son\u2019s head to prevent him from pulling away.\n\nThat kiss is the climax of \u201cHell of a Ride,\u201d this week\u2019s aptly titled episode from the writer Randall Green and the director John Dahl. In a series that has made a study of the physicality of the rich and powerful, the scene is a graduate-level course.\n\nOn one level, and like so many of these characters\u2019 other words and actions, it is very likely a reference to a work of macho pop culture: the kiss of betrayal that Michael Corleone plants on his disloyal brother Fredo in \u201cThe Godfather Part II.\u201d (Bobby quoted the first \u201cGodfather\u201d film earlier in the episode when he instructed his philanthropy guru, Sean Ayles (Jack Gilpin), to \u201cuse all your powers and all your skills\u201d in support of his latest stealthy venture.) But like the best such moments on \u201cBillions,\u201d the context transforms the reference into something new and unique, and in this case uniquely disturbing.\n\nThe father-son dynamic creates a power imbalance absent in the brother-to-brother version, adding an overtone of Oedipal anxiety and parental abuse. That ugliness is compounded in turn by the creepy sexualization of the two men\u2019s relationship in this episode, from Charles\u2019s bawdy stories of his collegiate sexual exploits to the revelation that Chuck lost his virginity at age fourteen to a prostitute hand-selected by his father based on firsthand knowledge of her skills. Charles\u2019s presence also looms large over Chuck and Wendy\u2019s heart-to-heart regarding her one-night stand with the space entrepreneur Craig Heidecker during their separation \u2014 an act of infidelity Charles had taken it upon himself to uncover and parade before his son.", "title": "\u2018Billions\u2019 Season 3, Episode 4 Recap: Sealed With a Kiss", "authors": []}

Sex, sexuality, the rewards and compromises of long-term relationships, even the eroticized thrill of spectacular professional success \u2014 these themes are never in short supply on this show. But the pangs of infatuation that make your eyes widen, your heart quicken, and (with any luck) your clothes melt away to the tune of Echo and the Bunnymen? That\u2019s \u2026 unexpected.\n\nEven more unexpected? The young lovers involved. The casting of comedian Mike Birbiglia added an uncharacteristically mellow presence to this high-strung, hard-charging show. If you predicted that this addition was a prelude to an affair between Birbiglia\u2019s Silicon Valley \u201cventure philanthropist\u201d character, Oscar Langstraat, and Bobby Axelrod\u2019s handpicked successor, the tightly wound gender-nonbinary genius Taylor Mason, congratulations: Your powers of prognostication outstrip even those of Axe himself. Yet from the moment these two very different visionaries make a nerd-love connection in defense of a supposed \u201cStar Wars\u201d plot hole, it makes sense, retrospectively, that they would hook up. It just feels right. (Granted, I\u2019m slightly biased in that I agree with their reasoning \u2014 \u201cWhat material could withstand the heat expended from that mammoth sphere?\u201d \u201cPlus, it was fortified with gun turrets!\u201d \u2014 but only slightly.)\n\nPredicated on a trip to San Francisco designed to further the connections between Oscar and Axe Capital, the story line is successful mainly because of how exciting it feels to see Taylor, well, excited by something. Asia Kate Dillon\u2019s portrayal of this blue-eyed brainiac is rooted in a Spock-like blend of ironclad logic and an outsider\u2019s insight into the prevailing culture. To see the flush of a crush on Taylor\u2019s face, melting that resolve and reserve, is a beautiful thing. The subsequent sex scene between the two characters is sweet, hot and groundbreaking in equal measure.

In a play that was half pique and half shrewd financial management, she ordered an enormous short on the Ice Juice stock and made a killing.\n\nUnfortunately, she did so while within Chuck\u2019s offices, elevating mere insider trading into what looks for all the world like a criminal conspiracy with her husband. Now Bryan can use Wendy, much loved and respected by both Bobby and Chuck, as a leverage point against both men, either of whom would gladly go to prison to keep her out of it.\n\nThe fallout is a marvelous domino effect of reaction shots featuring talented actors. When Spyros reveals what he\u2019s done, Axe, Wags and the lawyer Orrin Bach, shoot Spyros looks that are withering enough to defoliate every plant in the office.

Instead she arranges a three-person summit at Bobby\u2019s apartment: just her, Axe, Chuck and, unbeknown to either of the other participants, the telltale slide that Chuck is carrying in his pocket.\n\nWhat follows is the show\u2019s subtlest and smartest reference to popular culture\u2019s macho milestones yet. After exchanging unpleasantries and seeming to calm down at Wendy\u2019s command (you can take the woman out of the dominatrix dungeon \u2026), Chuck and Axe sit staring at each other from across the table until Chuck asks if he can be excused to go to the bathroom, and Bobby acquiesces.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Godfather\u201d \u2014 and God knows Chuck and Bobby have the thing memorized \u2014 you\u2019ll recognize what\u2019s going on here. Sneakily proceeding through the apartment, Chuck arrives at the bathroom and starts rummaging around. He\u2019s not exactly Michael Corleone looking for the revolver Tessio planted behind the old-fashioned toilet tank so he can come out guns blazing. But if he goes through with his plan to plant the slide and have the feds raid the place the next morning, the results will be nearly as devastating to Bobby as Michael\u2019s trip to the restroom was to Sollozzo and McCluskey.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem, unspoken but obvious: If Chuck does this while under a flag of truce negotiated by Wendy, he\u2019ll likely shatter her trust, and their marriage, forever. You can\u2019t take a trip to the Sicilian countryside and wait out that kind of crime.\n\nWhen Chuck returns to the table, we in the audience have a few seconds to contemplate Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s slide: Did he or didn\u2019t he plant it, enabling the feds to proceed in their case against Bobby without needing Wendy as a bargaining chip? Then, boom! He lays his cards, and the slide, on the table.\n\nAxe is stunned. Wendy is first surprised, then visibly relieved. \u201cI think you used to have a moral compass,\u201d Bryan told him earlier in the episode, \u201cand it served you, got you where you are, made you great. Then it got warped, or broken.\u201d Granted, Chuck is currently colluding with his nemesis in order to spare the three of them from Connerty\u2019s wrath, but still, his sudden change of heart is unmistakably an effort to find his moral magnetic north once again.\n\nFrom writer Alice O\u2019Neill to director John Dahl to composer Eskmo (whose pulsating score has never sounded better) to the entire cast, \u201cBillions\u201d has served up a miniature masterpiece of ethical conundrums, shortcuts and sacrifices, exacting and enjoyable from start to finish.

His dances for the new revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \u201cCarousel,\u201d at the Imperial Theater on Broadway, are yet another feather in his cap. Though just 30 years old, he\u2019s already acquired such renown that, in Matthew Lopez\u2019s new play \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d (now at the Young Vic in London), \u201cthe latest Justin Peck\u201d is spoken of as a must-see New York artistic event.\n\nMr. Peck remains a dancer (soloist rank) at New York City Ballet, where he has been the resident choreographer since 2014. He makes at least two new ballets for the company (and others around the world) each year, often to new or modern music. His works, polished and contemporary, are energetic through each individual body and in striking ensembles; and they often ask gender questions, with both opposite-sex and same-sex pairings. His main dance language is ballet. But he has also set dancers moving with tap steps in sneakers; in \u201cCarousel,\u201d they\u2019re sometimes barefoot.\n\nIn almost every piece he tackles, he adds to his already impressive accomplishments. In \u201cCarousel,\u201d he and the director, Jack O\u2019Brien, handle dancers so that there\u2019s no clear division between them and other actors onstage. And yet he gives us real dance virtuosity and ensembles containing speed and elaborate geometry. Still, though exuberantly executed, the dances don\u2019t stay with me as most of this \u201cCarousel\u201d does.\n\nThe hardest part of \u201cCarousel\u201d for a choreographer to bring off is the Act II ballet, witnessed by the dead Billy Bigelow. He sees Louise, his teenage daughter, becoming an angry and bitter outsider, alienated from the social world of her upbringing. This psychodrama can easily seem the most dated part of \u201cCarousel.\u201d Film exists of the original choreography by Agnes de Mille. It looks creaky now, making its points all too obviously and clearly influenced by Martha Graham and Antony Tudor, the two masters of psychological choreography and social consciousness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even de Mille\u2019s tendency to overemphasize catches the dream quality that earns this ballet a special place in the overall drama of \u201cCarousel.\u201d Kenneth MacMillan \u2014 the master of sex, violence and acrobatic lifts in late 20th-century choreography \u2014 went further when he made the dances for Nicholas Hytner\u2019s 1992 production (which reached Broadway in 1994).

Now, nine years after his death, comes a movie about the event that, almost as much as the circumstances of his birth, established him in the tabloid pantheon: Chappaquiddick.\n\nThe film, by the same name, opened Friday and retells the story of an accident in July 1969, on the titular Massachusetts island near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, in which Mr. Kennedy drove off a bridge, killing his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, a campaign worker for his late brother Robert. It has been heavily promoted by conservative media outlets, and reviewers across the political spectrum have praised what they deem its damning but factual approach.

She also had a long history of depression, paranoia and delusion, they testified.\n\nIt is not uncommon for parents to make child care decisions based on feedback from their peers, and hire caretakers \u2014 nannies or babysitters \u2014 who are paid off the books, in cash, parents and experts in the industry said. In New York City, parents face soaring costs and challenges finding high-quality, affordable care for their children, and typically rely on recommendations from others.\n\nAgencies and licensed child care centers tend to be much more expensive, an issue that extends beyond New York. While there are local and federal programs that provide subsidies to low-income parents to assist with child care, the system in America lacks the robust infrastructure that exists in countries like Denmark and Switzerland, experts said, where such services are partially government funded.\n\n\u201cPlaces like Britain and Denmark combine paid family leave for parents with newborns, along with public preschool,\u201d said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.

The people are not really vetted until they are already in the home.\u201d\n\nThings had gone relatively smoothly for the first 18 months of Ms. Ortega\u2019s employment at the Krim household. She was only asked to work about 20 hours a week, usually in the afternoons, as Ms. Krim was a stay-at-home mother. She was rarely left with the children alone for very long. She earned at least $500 a week and helped pick up and drop off the children.\n\nIn April 2012 things began to change. Ms. Ortega had a bitter fight with her sister Miladys Garcia and was kicked out of the family apartment on Riverside Drive. She moved into an apartment in the Bronx belonging to other family members. In June, she brought her teenage son back from the Dominican Republic to live with her.\n\nIn that time, Ms. Ortega became more and more depressed, her family testified. She began to talk cryptically about feeling she was being followed by shadows, hearing voices and seeing a \u201cblack man,\u201d relatives testified. She told her sisters to pray for her and to take care of Jesus, as if she were going away.\n\nShe also had conflicts with Ms. Krim. She chafed at doing housework, even after asking for additional hours, and declined an offer from one of Ms. Krim\u2019s friends for a part-time job. After that refusal, Ms. Krim chastised Ms. Ortega in front of her children\u2019s school, an exchange prosecutors said infuriated the nanny.\n\nBy late October, Ms. Ortega moved back into the family apartment on Riverside Drive. Three days before the murders, Ms. Ortega sought help from a psychologist, but neither she nor her relatives ever informed the Krim family of her declining mental state.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2012, after taking her middle child, Nessie, to swim class, Ms. Krim returned to her Upper West Side apartment after 5 p.m. and found her two other children dead in a bathtub and Ms. Ortega shoving a large knife into her own neck.\n\nThe case shocked parents throughout the city who rely on others to help care for their children. Christa D. Nader, the president of Kith & Kin, a household staffing agency, said after the murders she recognized \u201ca noticeable level of distrust\u201d among some parents.\n\nMs. Nader said she was a nanny at the time of the murders and recounted being in a park . There were other nannies with children they were caring for.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "This picture is misleading when applied to today\u2019s populists like Mr. Orban. In Hungary, it is not just the rule of law that has been under threat. Rights essential for democracy itself \u2014 especially rights to free speech, free assembly and free association \u2014 have been systematically attacked. As media pluralism disappears, citizens cannot get critical information to make up their minds about their government\u2019s record. Unless one wants to say that a democracy remains a democracy as long as the government does not stuff the ballot boxes on Election Day, it is crucial to insist that democracy itself is being damaged.\n\nUnless this point is understood, Mr. Orban will continue the perfidious game he likes to play with international critics in particular: He does not mind being called \u201cilliberal\u201d; he relishes it. For liberalism is supposedly just a matter of subjective value choices: Liberals, he and his defenders will say, simply do not like his conservative family policies, his defense of strong nation-states inside the European Union and, most of all, his complete rejection of immigration. Of course, one can legitimately disagree about these issues in a democracy. But by focusing all attention on them, Mr. Orban has remade what should be a debate about democratic institutions into yet another culture war. (This is a strategy Trumpists are also discovering.) Once the conflict has been declared a matter of subjective values, it becomes easy to accuse the liberals of being the real illiberals. Even though they are supposed to be the defenders of diversity, they cannot tolerate an ethnic nationalist like Mr. Orban, who seeks to deviate from a supposed Western mainstream of multiculturalism.\n\nA number of observers are even willing to concede that \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d might be a somewhat legitimate reaction to undemocratic liberalism. The European Union appears as an obvious instance of a liberal technocracy against which \u201cthe will of the people\u201d needs to be asserted. But the European Union prescribes neither a uniform legislative stance on controversial questions like same-sex marriage nor a single model of democracy. Its members just have to be democratic enough.\n\nWhen European Union leaders have criticized Hungary and, more recently, Poland, those countries\u2019 governments have countered that they are defending national sovereignty against liberal diktats from Brussels. The Union has played into their hands by suggesting that it is only concerned about the liberal rule of law. The European Union thus gives the impression that democracy will always be taken care of by the nation-state; and the technocratic liberal repair crew from Brussels only makes a call in a European capital, if there is a malfunction with the rule of law (hence the undermining of political rights and independent institutions appears like a technical glitch, not as the conscious authoritarian project it actually is.)\n\nThe notion of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d has also made it easier for European elites to claim that the people themselves have unfortunately turned out to be illiberal and brought these authoritarian governments on themselves. Eastern Europeans, we are often told, are culturally different \u2014 code for thinking that they lag behind Western liberal enlightenment. But the citizens who brought Mr. Orban and the current Polish government to power actually did exactly what democratic theory would have counseled them to do: In two-party systems, they threw out the one major party that had a poor record and instead voted for politicians who, in both cases, presented themselves as moderate mainstream conservatives. The latter never revealed \u2014 or won an electoral mandate for \u2014 their real agenda, of perpetuating themselves in power by attacking the institutions that underpin democracy.\n\nIs all this just a matter of words? Thinkers like George Orwell and Hannah Arendt never tired of warning that the political catastrophes of the 20th century began with euphemisms and imprecise language. A democracy can have illiberal policies, but it cannot do without basic political liberties and protections. We are doing Mr. Orban a great favor by accepting him as any kind of democrat. The designation \u201cdemocracy\u201d still remains the most coveted political prize around the world. In what can only be called an unforced error, we are giving that prize to leaders who not only devalue it, but are also busy destroying the thing itself.", "title": "Opinion | \u2018Democracy\u2019 Still Matters", "authors": []}

Side effects can arise during treatment or after the treatment is finished.\n\nFor most patients, though, there are no side effects or only minor ones. That makes giving an immunotherapy drug to a dying patient different from trying a harsh experimental chemotherapy or a treatment like intense radiation.\n\nThe problem is deciding ahead of time if an immunotherapy drug will help. Doctors check biomarkers, chemical signals like proteins that arise when the immune system is trying to attack.

But there was little time to think of that as I was being escorted out of the auditorium by one of the black professors.

Perhaps it\u2019s a manifestation of all the anger on display earlier in the episode. Malcolm punches Ramon for throwing Hailey out of the treehouse. Duc finally unloads on Greg about the \u201cmoral crime\u201d of sleeping with an Asian prostitute when he knows Duc\u2019s mother was also an Asian prostitute. Greg calls out Duc for sleeping around in Vancouver when he professes to be celibate. (Did you find it likely that Greg would have heard gossip about his son picking up random Canadian women in bars? I did not.) When Navid tries to downgrade his relationship with Kristen back to a friendship, she blows up at him. On the air at a local morning show, Audrey dresses down Steve for using the Empathy Initiative to cover for his company\u2019s ties to child labor. Ashley is upset that her prospective employer sees her as a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d and exasperated when Malcolm tries to convince her to take the job anyway.\n\nIn the episode\u2019s most maudlin story line, the cause of Farid\u2019s repressed trauma finally comes into focus. Made to flog himself in a public square, as a child, for defacing a poster of the Ayatollah \u2014 and then beaten to a pulp by his mentally ill mother, a pious Muslim who believed Farid\u2019s irreverent act had gotten his father killed \u2014 he was rescued and taken to America by his uncle, Amir. Decades later, deep in the throes of his own mental illness, he tearfully flogs himself out of guilt over his father\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s decades-old unanswered telephone calls. He won\u2019t listen when his wife and son assure him that he\u2019s not responsible for what happened to his parents. Afraid for herself and their child, Layla takes Navid and leaves.\n\nFarid finds himself at Imam Chuck\u2019s door, the back of his white jacket stained with blood in the shape of angel wings. There\u2019s nothing subtle about the symbolism on \u201cHere and Now,\u201d and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. But not even an actor as talented as Peter Macdissi, who plays Farid and is an executive producer of the show, can pull off material this overwrought.\n\nIf Farid\u2019s bloody search for meaning in Islam is a figurative ascent to heaven, then there\u2019s something hellish about Ramon\u2019s pursuit of the man on fire. Because he\u2019s at the top of a nearby hill when the eruption happens, he has to descend to the foot of Mt. Hood (in a mask so flimsy he\u2019s surely inhaling all types of harmful gases) for his climactic encounter with the flaming figure. When they lock eyes, dozens of wispy humanoid shadows begin to float upward on the ashy ground behind Ramon. Then, the burning man walks away and Ramon strides toward the volcano. It\u2019s a cryptic final shot, made even more ambiguous by the deceptively upbeat but actually quite dark Brian Eno track \u201cBaby\u2019s on Fire,\u201d which plays over the closing credits.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a cathartic mood to this conclusion that mirrors many characters\u2019 journeys from anger to relative peacefulness late in the episode.

{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Season 1, Episode 8: \u2018Yes\u2019\n\nFinally, Duc Bayer-Boatwright gets his moment in the sun. Don\u2019t get too excited; it\u2019s not that he has a psychological breakthrough or stops being a jerk or even has a particularly substantial story line in this week\u2019s episode of \u201cHere and Now.\u201d For the second week in a row, he\u2019s gritting his teeth through a colitis flare-up \u2014 and Ramon\u2019s poop jokes aren\u2019t helping. Duc\u2019s big scene takes place during a hike with his love interest, Carmen. Doubled over in pain, he gets so frantic about finding a place to relieve himself that he falls down a hill and exits the date in an ambulance.\n\nDuc is, in other words, as hapless as ever in Episode 8. But that makes him the ideal avatar for this week\u2019s theme, as revealed in Greg\u2019s lecture. As an introduction to a lesson on \u201cThe Myth of Sisyphus,\u201d Albert Camus\u2019s essay on embracing the absurdity of a meaningless life over suicide, Professor Boatwright alarms his students by pressing a gun to his chin and demanding a reason not to pull the trigger. By persisting, he explains, \u201cWe become the absurdist hero, seeking meaning we know is not there, living life to its fullest in the face of a consistent and continuous struggle and inevitable failure.\u201d When the stunt ends in an involuntary six-month leave, the irony is that Greg\u2019s message to students was actually pretty life affirming, for once.\n\nSisyphus, a character from Greek mythology, was condemned to spend eternity pushing a boulder up a hill, only to watch it fall each time to the bottom. Grim as that fate may seem, Camus reframes Sisyphus as an absurdist hero, scrambling fruitlessly but nobly to make meaning for as long as he can keep the rock that is his life rolling. \u201cThe struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart,\u201d Camus writes in the essay\u2019s famous conclusion. \u201cOne must imagine Sisyphus happy.\u201d Considering that few afflictions scream absurdity like a benign yet incurable bout of diarrhea, I assume there\u2019s some symbolism in Duc\u2019s tumble down the hill.\n\nUsually, Ramon and Audrey are the show\u2019s great rock pushers, fighting tirelessly for empathy in a world that keeps knocking it down in favor of fear. But this week, both characters take some time off from their respective forms of martyrdom. Audrey, who is always there to comfort and nag her husband and children, skips a family dinner to consummate her flirtation with Steve. (She can thank Ashley for giving her the sexy heels that catch his eye.)

Although it didn\u2019t actually feature any coldblooded killings, the episode, which is the penultimate chapter of Season 1, was the show\u2019s darkest and best hour to date. It was also the first episode in which many of the characters were forced to think seriously about their futures.\n\nThat reflection gave us a bit of welcome, if overdue, insight into the two Bayer-Boatwright kids whose ham-handed arcs have frustrated me for most of the season. In her first story line since the series premiere that isn\u2019t primarily about her race, Ashley fields a larger company\u2019s seven-figure offer to buy her clothing business. They want to close her shop so that she\u2019s free to help them build \u201ca tool so that every shopper can create their own perfect store.\u201d She tells her brothers that she\u2019s worried that if she becomes someone else\u2019s employee, she\u2019ll lose control of her own life. Duc suggests that she may actually be scared of getting what she wants.\n\nRamon, whom we\u2019ll return to later, is facing a similar choice: Should he take a job with a company that might one day develop his game, even if that means starting at the bottom and working on other people\u2019s projects first?\n\nOne person Ashley doesn\u2019t consult about the offer is her husband, Malcolm. Tensions between the two of them have been mounting since the premiere. His lack of ambition clashes with her Type A personality and longing for a more exciting life than the one she has with him and their daughter, Hailey. Ashley\u2019s recent, tentative embrace of her black identity also has her questioning her marriage to a white man. So, when he finds out that she hasn\u2019t told him about an opportunity that could have huge implications for their family, the conflict between the spouses finally (but inconclusively) explodes.

{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "President Ronald Reagan established a limited pool of imports that it apportioned among foreign producers. The first President George Bush renewed it. Mr. Clinton deployed diplomacy and antidumping measures to protect American steel makers. And in 2002 President George W. Bush put a new ring of \u201csafeguards\u201d around steel that lasted 20 months, until the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal.\n\nThey mostly shrugged off the repercussions for the many manufacturing companies that relied on steel. But in 2003, the United States International Trade Commission surveyed manufacturers about the effects. Not only did the tariffs imposed by the Bush administration put many American companies at a competitive disadvantage, but companies also reacted in ways that did the American economy no good.\n\nAlmost 500 steel consumers responded to at least some of the questions asked by the commission. About half of respondents reported paying higher prices. And roughly half reported problems procuring steel of the quality and quantity they needed. Over a third reported delayed deliveries; 132 reported steel shortages. About one in six said these problems had reduced sales, and one in three said they had cut into its profitability. A total of 82 companies \u2014 including 11 makers of auto parts, nine welded-pipe producers and five makers of fasteners \u2014 said they had lost sales to foreign competitors because of the higher cost of steel.\n\nSome steel consumers shifted from importing steel to importing assembled steel parts that were not subject to the new tariffs. York International \u2014 which makes air-conditioning systems, furnaces and the like \u2014 reported importing steel assemblies and complete products from overseas. The auto-part maker Metaldyne simply moved some of its operations to South Korea, where it could obtain cheaper steel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Larsen is sympathetic to the plight of American steel companies. Though it is owned today by Everest Kanto Cylinder based in Mumbai, India, CP Industries emerged as an independent company in a 1989 spinoff from U.S. Steel. And still, whatever old loyalties persist, it makes little sense to force the company to obtain its steel domestically. For starters, no company in the United States produces pipes big enough to make its trademark six-ton containers.\n\nThe company estimated that it could get only a fifth of the steel pipe it needed domestically, from only one American firm. Domestic pipe is, moreover, delivered in random lengths and requires additional milling, cutting and testing, raising processing costs by about 16 percent. And Chinese pipes are much cheaper, the company added: Pipes from China delivered in Philadelphia cost $1,680 per metric ton, while U.S. Steel is charging $2,728 per metric ton at its works in Lorain, Ohio. A 25 percent tariff will not close the gap.\n\nPhoto\n\nCP Industries isn\u2019t simply going to let itself be pushed out of business. An option to consider is importing German steel \u2014 which so far has been exempted from the protectionist fusillade. But it will take time to shift suppliers. And German steel will be more expensive.\n\nOf course, there is lobbying. CP Industries has requested a waiver from the tariffs, and it is working to get Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional delegation on its side. Something else it could do is move part or all of the manufacturing process overseas to avoid the steel tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole list of ideas that we could execute,\u201d Mr. Larsen told me. \u201cBut nothing we do will be more efficient than what we are doing now. And it will mean less value added in the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Larsen is not, by the way, an evangelist for free trade at all costs. Six years ago, when he was at Taylor-Wharton International, a manufacturer of smaller vessels for high-pressure gas, he teamed up with Norris Cylinder to bring an antidumping case against Chinese rivals and won. The government imposed an antidumping duty on Chinese imports to level the playing field.\n\nHe would love to try that approach against his new Chinese competitors. But Mr. Trump nipped the strategy in the bud: Dumping \u2014 selling below cost in order to drive rivals out of business and gain market share \u2014 is not necessary when you are suddenly granted a 10 percent cost advantage. That\u2019s roughly the kind of edge that the steel tariffs gave the makers of high-pressure gas vessels in China.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today,\u201d Mr. Larsen lamented, \u201cthey cannot be overcome.\u201d", "title": "\u2018How Long Can We Last?\u2019 Trump\u2019s Tariffs Hit Home in the U.S.", "authors": ["Eduardo Porter", "Economic Scene"]}

There are vaping cloud contests, a line of hoodies and backpacks called VaprWear that make it easy to conceal the devices, and labels of vape \u201csauce\u201d that resemble the designs of well-known candy wrappers like those of Jolly Ranchers and Blow Pops.\n\nIn Millburn, N.J., one of the school districts that now require any student caught with a vaping device to be drug tested, teenagers said Juuls began showing up at parties last year, and by fall were at school and football games. Now, students post videos of themselves doing vapor tricks on social media.\n\nAt a local deli where seniors go for lunch, a dozen students interviewed said it was easy to buy a Juul online or at a gas station or convenience store, and to buy refill pods in the hallway at school.

The couples settled down just outside Mount Airy, N.C. \u2014 later the inspiration for the town of Mayberry in \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d \u2014 to make room for their sizable families.\n\nHuang devotes a short chapter titled \u201cFoursome\u201d to the question of sex. The couples had to deal with considerable physical and logistical challenges. (According to interviews with their widows, Chang and Eng would alternate weeks as the \u201ccomplete master\u201d who dictated how he wanted to go about business, with the other brother \u201cblanking out.\u201d) But the widespread social disapprobation that greeted their arrangement was beyond their control. The most vociferous indictments came from the abolitionist papers in the North, which declared \u201cso bestial a union as this\u201d yet another sign of how slavery had corrupted the Southern soul.\n\nAnd the twins did seem determined to be identified as Southern gentry. In addition to owning slaves, they supported the Whigs and became ardent supporters of the Confederacy, sending two of their sons to fight in the Civil War.\n\nHuang is right to point out the cruel irony in all of this, but when he characterizes his subjects as \u201ctwo brothers formerly sold into indentured servitude and treated no better than slaves,\u201d he inadvertently downplays the incomparable brutality of the slaveholding system in order to heighten the contradictions.\n\nAs Huang shows elsewhere, Chang and Eng were treated better than slaves; if anything, what really rankled them were instances when they compared themselves to white men and felt they weren\u2019t given the respect they were due \u2014 such as their first trans-Atlantic journey, when they were booked in steerage rather than first class. In the excellent 2014 study \u201cThe Lives of Chang and Eng,\u201d Joseph Andrew Orser argues that the twins deliberately \u201cmade claims to whiteness.\u201d\n\nBut their intentions were one thing and public perception another. They would always be known as the conjoined brothers from Siam, and after the Civil War rendered their slaveholding assets worthless, they went on tour again, this time with their children, to show the world that their union with two women \u201cwas able to produce normal offspring.\u201d\n\nHuang writes movingly about the twins\u2019 painful end in 1874, when Chang, a heavy drinker, died and the teetotaling Eng perished soon after. But it\u2019s in the epilogue that Huang unveils one of his most surprising turns.\n\nWhen Huang visited Mount Airy, or Mayberry U.S.A., he learned of a Chang and Eng exhibit kept in the basement of the Andy Griffith Museum. In other words, a shrine to an American myth of old-timey homogeneity was literally built on the more convoluted reality.

The men have met six times and spoken by phone 20 times, though not since March 8, the evening that Mr. Trump stunned Mr. Abe, as well as his own aides, by accepting Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to a meeting.\n\nMr. Trump, a senior administration official said, has a lot of respect for Mr. Abe\u2019s views on North Korea. In two days of meetings \u2014 alone and with their aides \u2014 the leaders are likely to discuss issues ranging from the demands Mr. Trump will make of Mr. Kim to the venue for the meeting.\n\nAmong the most politically salient issues for Mr. Abe is the status of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. He is expected to ask Mr. Trump to raise the matter with Mr. Kim in their meeting, and a person briefed on the White House\u2019s preparations said the president would probably assure Mr. Abe that he would do so.\n\nStill, for Mr. Abe, who has been a stalwart supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s sanctions against North Korea, the summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim raises other problems. The first is that it leaves Japan isolated in what has been a round robin of diplomacy involving North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea, China and the United States have all been in contact with the North about potential meetings. Japan has not. If anything, anti-Tokyo propaganda in North Korea has intensified as Mr. Kim has reached out to leaders in Seoul, Beijing and Washington.\n\nJapan, moreover, has different security concerns than those of the United States. While Mr. Trump is likely to press Mr. Kim to halt development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could theoretically strike American territory, Japan is much more concerned about the North\u2019s medium-range missiles, which have already landed in waters around Japan.\n\nAmerican officials declined to say whether Mr. Trump would raise the issue of intermediate-range missiles, repeating only his general demand that North Korea relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe coordination between the Japanese and the White House is excellent,\u201d said Michael J.

But Japan\u2019s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, ruled out that possibility in March, saying that such a negotiation would lead to unnecessary pain for Japan.\n\nInstead, Japan forged ahead with a deal among the accord\u2019s 11 remaining members, which they reached on March 8. Japan maintains that this agreement is still fragile, and that negotiating another pact with the United States could put its success at risk.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s about-face on the Trans-Pacific Partnership could breathe new life into trade talks. Japan has said that it would be willing to enter a one-on-one deal only if it would serve as a bridge to the United States\u2019 getting back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n\u201cIf you want to try to get the Japanese into talks,\u201d Mr. Reinsch said, \u201cI think the best way to do that is to tell them we\u2019re prepped for rejoining the T.P.P.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s statement about the trade pact with a mix of puzzlement and cautious optimism. American officials said they expected both the tariffs and the Trans-Pacific pact to come up during the meeting, and noted that Mr. Trump has indicated a willingness to grant further exemptions if he can come to agreeable terms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe trouble could flare if Mr. Trump tries to strike a tougher deal with Japan than his predecessor did.\n\nJapan is wary of the bullying approach the Trump administration has taken to revising global trade pacts.

A few months after Ms. Duckworth announced she was pregnant, she asked Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, to help her engineer a rule change, necessary because senators are required to vote in person.\n\nSo it was that on Wednesday, senators voted unanimously that, henceforth, both male and female senators will be permitted to bring infants up to age one into the chamber. In an institution where a fair number of members are in their 80s, this was a monumental change, hardly as simple as it might seem.\n\nFirst, Ms. Klobuchar said, there were the discussions over whether the Senate floor would turn into some kind of nursery.\n\n\u201cBut what if there are 10 babies on the floor of the Senate?\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, 84, Republican of Utah, asked, according to The Associated Press. Replied Ms. Klobuchar: \u201cThat would be wonderful and a delight.\u201d\n\nThen came the concerns about whether there would be diaper changes. Or breast-feeding.

I heard his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech and his \u201cMountaintop\u201d speech, but I feel like I need to get in more, see how he felt, what made him want to encourage more people.

(They involve a stepfather played by Ed Asner.)\n\nWhen Johnny resurrects the old Cobra Kai dojo, it triggers Daniel, a successful car dealer who misses the stabilizing influence of his late mentor, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). As the rivalry reignites and finds proxy in young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, multigenerational resentments, confrontations and hook-kicks ensue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a karate opera,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fun sort of Hatfields and McCoys vibe.\u201d\n\nNow in their 50s, Mr. Macchio and Mr. Zabka each have had periods of wanting to keep \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d at arm\u2019s length. (They\u2019ve heard enough \u201cwax on\u201d and \u201csweep the leg\u201d jokes for many lifetimes.) But they were lured back into their headbands by the update on the story and its themes, some of which, like bullying, are getting more attention now than they were in 1984.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Google-owned YouTube, which beat out more established outlets like Netflix and Hulu for the rights to \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d was enticed by the series\u2019s potential to expand the audience for YouTube Red, said Susanne Daniels, the global head of programming. The service has been making deals lately with established franchises (the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies) and filmmakers (Doug Liman) in an effort to move beyond its homegrown stable of viral stars toward more mainstream appeal.\n\nYouTube also knows from search metrics that \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d remains popular among its users, and it plans to use its multitude of clips from and inspired by the movies to promote \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d Anyone who wants to relive, say, the original\u2019s cheesily triumphant \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d montage, which has more than 15.5 million views, can expect to see in the adjacent \u201cup next\u201d queue the first two episodes of \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which will be available free. (The show\u2019s trailer, hyped in similar fashion, has been viewed nearly 13 million times.)\n\nThat plus the fact that Ms. Daniels offered a full series deal in the pitch meeting was enough to get the \u201cCobra Kai\u201d creators to overlook the relatively paltry subscriber base. YouTube declined to release figures, but it\u2019s safe to say they lag far behind the totals for streaming behemoths like Netflix (125 million) and Amazon (which has more than 100 million people paying for Amazon Prime, which also includes access to its programming).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe upside, the creators say, is that unlike at a place like Netflix, which plans to release hundreds of shows this year, there is little chance \u201cCobra Kai\u201d will get lost in the marketing shuffle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a big fish in a small pond,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said, \u201cwhen the small pond is Google.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

They are still on opposite sides of the tracks, but they\u2019ve switched sides: Daniel has a grand compound in affluent Encino, Johnny a dingy apartment in Reseda. (Aside from some exteriors, the series was shot in and around Atlanta.)\n\nWhen events conspire to bring the old foes back into both karate and one another\u2019s orbit, history repeats itself in melodramatic fashion. Johnny\u2019s student Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a), a bullied new kid in town, squares off with Daniel\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Robby (Tanner Buchanan), who happens to be Johnny\u2019s estranged son. Each pines for Daniel\u2019s daughter, Samantha (Mary Mouser), shades of the Ali-Daniel-Johnny triangle of the first film.\n\n\u201cThe good news is now I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines \u2014 I\u2019m not getting my ass kicked,\u201d Mr. Macchio said. \u201cAt 56, no matter how much hair and makeup help me, everything hurts more in the morning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven off camera, both he and Mr. Zabka, 52, are remarkably well-preserved.

In separate interviews, the actors struck similar notes of protectiveness about the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d legacy, about how important it was for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d to spin the story forward and include some of the film\u2019s heart along with the clever callbacks, fan Easter eggs and \u201chumor that comes from the fact that these two guys have not moved past it,\u201d Mr. Macchio said.\n\nThe actors long ago made peace with the fact that as far as the rest of the world is concerned, they\u2019ll never entirely move past \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201d\n\nMr. Macchio had other indelible roles in movies like \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cCrossroads\u201d and \u201cMy Cousin Vinny,\u201d and he has starred on Broadway. But he knows that any time he attends a sporting event, the arena will put him on the Jumbotron and play \u201cYou\u2019re the Best\u201d at some point.\n\nMr. Zabka moved on to other roles and was nominated for an Oscar for \u201cMost (The Bridge),\u201d a 2003 short he co-wrote and co-produced, about a father forced to make a tragic sacrifice, but he still gets asked to send up Johnny in sitcoms and music videos. \u201cThere\u2019s something alive about it \u2014 these characters have become real to people in a way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe actors have a hard time articulating precisely why \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d endures, chalking it up to some alchemy of the underdog story, the unforgettable characters (Mr. Miyagi, the aggro Cobra Kai sensei John Kreese) and a script that balanced the corniness and catchphrases with great pathos. (Even the villain got a moment of grace at the end, when Johnny handed Daniel the trophy.) The movie stuck with them, too \u2014 Mr. Zabka admitted that it was more than a decade before he was able to watch it with anything like objectivity.\n\n\u201cFor so long, I still felt that kick,\u201d he said.\n\nKept mostly apart during filming, Mr. Macchio and Mr. Zabka never really became friends until later, on the fan convention circuit. But while it\u2019s an odd thing, being randomly but inextricably linked to another person for your entire adult life, there\u2019s something transporting about it, too.\n\nMr. Macchio, for one, was stunned at how quickly the old fire came back once the actors finally faced off for the first time during filming for \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just had all that tension \u2014 you look into his eyes, and he\u2019s looking at mine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyelids had a couple more wrinkles, but it felt like yesterday.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Cobra Kai\u2019: This Rivalry Is Not Quite Ready for a Body Bag", "authors": ["Jeremy Egner"]}

James refused afterward to acknowledge that he had indeed been suffering from cramps \u2014 or even to use the word \u2014 admitting only that he had refused the team\u2019s suggestion to intake intravenous fluids during his locker-room visit.\n\n\u201cJust a little minor injury,\u201d James said.\n\nYet there was no denying the boost that the Cavaliers, most of all James, received at the beginning of the fourth quarter with a 10-2 spurt that Cleveland assembled without him. James had returned to the bench and was preparing to check back in when the struggling Love hit a huge 3-pointer for an 82-74 lead with 9 minutes 42 seconds to play, enabling James to keep sitting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time James did come back, for the game\u2019s final 8:25, he had benefited from a lengthy rest and the team had an 86-79 cushion, thanks to a unit featuring Love, Hill, Jeff Green, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr.\n\n\u201cIt was big,\u201d Cleveland Coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cThey bought \u2019Bron minutes.\u201d\n\nConcerns about James, at 33, being able to sustain this type of across-the-board production for three more rounds are inevitable after the effort he expended in this series. Then again, perhaps just a little help and good health are all James needs given the way he\u2019s playing \u2014 at least when it comes to getting out of the Eastern Conference and securing his eighth successive trip to the N.B.A. Finals.\n\nEntering this Game 7, James was leading the league in Player Efficiency Rating in the postseason, at 34.8. James\u2019s teammates, through the first six games of the series, had combined to post a P.E.R. of 9.0, which would represent the lowest combined P.E.R. for one of James\u2019s supporting casts in his 42 career playoff series.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rest of the Cavaliers not named James, furthermore, had shot a collective 12-for-49 from the floor Sunday before James made his temporary exit. But they emerged, for once, with multiple heroes.\n\nLove scored 8 crucial points in the first 5:25 of the fourth quarter. Hill, who had been out since Game 3 with back spasms and needed multiple painkilling injections just to be in uniform for Game 7, and wound up playing the final 19:12 without leaving the floor because Lue was desperate to get another ballhandler on the floor in the second half to ease the burden on James. And the out-of-favor Thompson, who had totaled just six rebounds in 24 minutes in the first six games of the series, grabbed seven rebounds in Sunday\u2019s first quarter and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nJames played a bit tentatively when he first returned, but he gradually got the legs back to make his share of clinching plays. Perhaps none was bigger than his layup with 30.2 seconds remaining for a 102-96 lead, cutting down the lane to capitalize on a gutsy Kyle Korver feed.\n\n\u201cBest receiver in the N.B.A.,\u201d Korver said of James.\n\nSaid the Indiana guard Victor Oladipo, who had 30 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in his effort to counter James: \u201cHe\u2019s the best in the world.

Indiana enjoyed a fairy-tale season after reluctantly trading the All-Star forward Paul George to Oklahoma City last June, but the Pacers will undoubtedly spend the summer lamenting their inability to capitalize on the 4 minutes and 35 seconds that James \u2014 who clearly intended to play a full 48 minutes \u2014 was forced into spectator status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very often where you\u2019re able to split the game ball in half, but G-Hill and Double T did that,\u201d James said, referring to Hill and Thompson.", "title": "\u2018King\u2019 James Briefly Sat, and His Subjects Carried the Load", "authors": ["Marc Stein", "On Pro Basketball"]}
{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "Polls show that Mr. da Silva still commands by far more support than any other Brazilian politician. His imprisonment, though, makes it most unlikely \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 that he will be able to run for president in October. His defense team hopes that the Supreme Court will rule that jailing him before he had exhausted his appeals was unconstitutional, but other investigations against him are underway.\n\nThat leaves the field, and the future, wide open. Without Mr. da Silva, the left has begun to fragment. His successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached for breaking budget rules; her successor, Michel Temer, the current president, has been charged with corruption and his popularity rating is near zero. Left to its own devices, the Congress is not likely to support any anti-corruption drive. About a third of the legislators face legal challenges but are effectively protected by a Constitution under which high officials and politicians can be tried only in the high courts, which move slowly and rarely convict. For all the successes of Operation Car Wash, nothing has been done to fix the judicial system.

Under the current government, a constitutional change enacted in 2014 let foreign companies invest in exploration, drilling, pipelines and even gas stations, and to team up on projects with the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex. The move allowed companies like Exxon Mobil to invest billions of dollars to develop vast fields offshore.\n\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s nationalistic policies are resonating in Mexico as the Trump administration vows to curtail Mexican immigration into the United States and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThe election outlook has caused concern among American oil executives.\n\n\u201cMexico is very critical as an energy partner of the United States, so a retreat from current policies would be a tragedy for both countries,\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil and gas producer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Mexico long term and the United States long term.\u201d\n\nMr. Sheffield and other Texas oil executives are particularly worried that Mexico could slow its importing of American gas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent years, Mexico has replaced coal and diesel with cleaner American natural gas to produce about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity. The shale-drilling revolution north of the Rio Grande has yielded an abundance of cheap natural gas for American and Mexican consumers, and Mexico announced a five-year plan in 2015 to increase imports.\n\nAbout 20 pipelines carry 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to Mexico, and more are being built or planned.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

California is switching from natural gas to renewable energy sources, while a shortage of pipelines and export terminals for liquefied natural gas means that if sales to Mexico dwindle, there will be excess gas with nowhere to go.\n\nThat gas will have to be flared, or oil drilling and production will need to decrease, a choice between increasing climate-warming carbon-dioxide emissions or decreasing profits.\n\nAmerican refineries also face problems. Before the boom in shale oil production, refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were designed to process heavy oil grades from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. Imports from Canada continue to increase, but they are limited by scarce pipeline capacity. Production in Venezuela is plummeting, and an expected ratcheting up of sanctions by the Trump administration could further hamper imports.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat makes Mexico, which accounts for about 8 percent of American crude-oil imports, an even more critical source. American refineries can process lighter grades of oil but much less efficiently, or they can undertake expensive overhauls of their equipment. Either way, profits would slump.\n\nMexico, for its part, has been importing higher-quality transportation fuels from the United States, in an effort to clean up its cities\u2019 air. Last year, Mexico bought more than one million barrels of American petroleum products a day, providing $23 billion in revenue to American energy companies.\n\nMs. Nahle, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s energy adviser, has said Mexico\u2019s own refineries can be retooled to handle a changeover from American gasoline and diesel.\n\nMexican oil officials, expecting at least a slowdown of their policies, are holding offshore auctions as fast as they can to lure investment before President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second term, leaves office in December. More than 100 development contracts have already been awarded. The nation\u2019s oil production remains in decline, but officials hope they can reverse the trend as international companies begin to produce large amounts of oil in the Gulf of Mexico over the next two years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndependent energy analysts have viewed Mexico\u2019s moves as a model for economic development, and some worry about a reversal. \u201cTo make a U-turn from the current reforms would be detrimental to the Mexican economy,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.\n\nSome oil executives and energy experts say they are not overly worried that the new contracts will be overturned. They note that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will almost certainly not have the congressional support to entirely rescind the constitutional energy change. Campaign oratory could give way to the realities of governing, especially when the oil industry offers financing for more social services. The government has earned signing bonuses of $525 million from investors so far this year as a result of its efforts.\n\n\u201cMexico needs this change more than anybody else,\u201d said Ali Moshiri, who retired last year as Chevron\u2019s top executive in Latin America and is forming his own oil company to seek international opportunities. \u201cPemex has been a disaster, so they have to continue with the reform, though they could slow things down.\u201d\n\nIf necessary, international companies could focus less on Mexico and more on other Latin American countries, like Brazil, which also has huge offshore potential, or Colombia, which has significant potential for shale drilling. Both countries also have elections this year in which major candidates have expressed either opposition to giving foreign companies control over natural resources or environmental concerns about developing fossil fuels at all.\n\n\u201cThat creates a lot of uncertainties for energy policy,\u201d said Lisa Viscidi, an energy expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank. \u201cAround Latin America, there are serious contenders who want to make big changes in the oil sector and want to reverse previous reforms.

A federal law pushed through by then U.S. Representative Guy V. Molinari, a Republican from Staten Island, converted two-way toll collections to one-way in 1986 to reduce commuting times and air pollution on the Staten Island end of the bridge.

Kennedy (formerly the Triborough) \u2014 all charge a top toll of $8.50 each way, for a total of $17 round-trip.\n\nThe Verrazano toll has long riled local residents on both sides of the bridge, many of whom subscribe to an enduring urban myth \u2014 repeatedly debunked \u2014 that the bridge was supposed to be free once it was all paid for. Instead, the toll has steadily crept upward, most recently by $1 last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because the bridge is getting more expensive,\u201d said Samuel I. Schwartz, a transportation consultant who has proposed reducing such tolls as part of a congestion pricing plan. \u201cIt\u2019s because we need more and more money to pay for the subways and trains coming into Manhattan.\u201d\n\nFrom the Verrazano alone, the M.T.A. collected $417 million in tolls in 2017, up from $393 million the year before. M.T.A. officials said the money paid for the bridge\u2019s maintenance, services and debt, with any remaining surplus going to support public transit.\n\nAbout 85 percent of vehicles crossing the Verrazano qualify for the E-ZPass rate, according to M.T.A. data. Of those, about 45 percent received an additional Staten Island resident discount, paying $5.50, or $3.20 for car pools.\n\nBut many drivers and their supporters complain that efforts to offset the high tolls do not go far enough.\n\nState Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn who has led rallies at the foot of the bridge for lower tolls, said many Brooklyn residents also relied heavily on the Verrazano yet do not receive the resident discount. \u201cTalk about gouging people,\u201d Mr. Golden said. \u201cMy community is very upset. It\u2019s a tremendous burden on them and it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the bridge, Linda Baran, president of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, said she recently heard from an architect struggling to find workers willing to commute because of the tolls \u201cand he\u2019s not the only business that has mentioned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople hesitate to visit Staten Island because the tolls are so high,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you see the East River bridges are free.

Long regarded by various teams he\u2019s played for as a headstrong handful, and by some members of the news media as chilly (or worse), Rondo has been a popular teammate almost everywhere he\u2019s played, reminiscent of the media-averse former All-Star forward Rasheed Wallace.\n\nIn New Orleans, though, Rondo is flat-out beloved by his teammates.\n\n\u201cSometimes they don\u2019t agree, coaches and him, because he likes to do what he thinks is best for the team,\u201d said Nikola Mirotic, the sharpshooting New Orleans forward. \u201cBut I always say, with Pau Gasol, he\u2019s the best teammate I ever had.\u201d\n\nSaid Gentry: \u201cYou can\u2019t go in that locker room and talk to one guy that doesn\u2019t believe in him.\u201d\n\nDespite Rondo\u2019s reputation for being, at the very least, relentlessly contrarian and challenging to coach, Gentry compares him to Nash often. He said that Rondo\u2019s former coach in Boston, Doc Rivers, dismissed his own ups and downs with a younger Rondo and strongly assured Gentry that their partnership would be prosperous.\n\nEven after everything that happened with the Mavericks, Rondo\u2019s former coach in Dallas, Rick Carlisle, insists he\u2019s not surprised by the success Rondo has found in New Orleans given \u201cthe assortment of shooters and finishers they have on that roster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you put the right pieces around Rondo, he is a proven champion,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the right personnel around him for things to work well in Dallas.

Among the hundreds of replies I got, some included words like \u201ccrybaby\u201d and \u201cbitch.\u201d One comment was simply three short words: \u201cSlant eye ____.\u201d For some reason, when that one appeared, I stared at it for a good 60 seconds (probably because my eyes are so slanted) trying to wrap my head around what had just happened.\n\nIn putting my thoughts to tweet, I was attempting to do a few things: question the creative motivation behind the joke, point out glaring industry double standards and shed some light on the systemic complacency that allows these things to happen.\n\nWhat I was definitely not attempting to do was presume knowledge of any sinister intentions of anyone at the show or at ABC. But the truth remains: They wrote a bad joke. It wasn\u2019t funny, it used broad racial generalizations for no ostensible reason, and it never should have made it to air.\n\nA show that shares its title with the name of its lead actress is already testing the \u201cfourth wall\u201d by design. By airing a joke by which that fictional character suddenly references other fictional characters from different TV shows on the same real network, the writers were basically begging the audience to blur this line even further. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t often see this happen \u2014 it takes the viewer out of the story. When was the last time you heard someone on \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d go: \u201cQuick! The killer\u2019s getting away with the serum! Maybe \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 \u2026 but we sure can\u2019t!\u201d In the case of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d this was especially jarring in light of Roseanne Barr\u2019s extensive right-wing political advocacy and the showrunner Bruce Helford\u2019s explicit request that viewers somehow separate that advocacy from the fictional world of the show.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat said, as a television writer myself, I can sympathize with the pressures and deadlines of network comedy. Not everything is going to be a winner. Not everything is vetted and picked apart. At the end of the day, it was a couple lines on a TV show. Let\u2019s all just move on. I kind of agree.\n\nKind of.\n\nBecause, to me, this isn\u2019t just about a couple lines on a TV show. This isn\u2019t just about Twitter or outrage or political correctness or even race, per se. To me, this is about attention. This is about the basic human need to have someone say: \u201cI see you. You matter.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Like so many of us, I was a huge fan of the show\u2019s original iteration in the \u201990s and the opening harmonica alone sends endorphins cascading down my spinal cord. The set, the tone, the music and the actors (including the national treasures Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman) all conspire to instantly bring me back to a simpler, more comforting time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, I sincerely believe the show is attempting to tell stories in an awkward, nuanced middle ground that makes it laudable. It is with this high standard that I am watching \u201cRoseanne,\u201d so when I sit down to take in an episode \u2014 I am paying attention. And what my attention reveals to me is a show about people who feel left behind.\n\nAfter a two-decade hiatus, \u201cRoseanne\u201d has suddenly returned in glorious HD for a reason. Its astronomical ratings \u2014 over 18 million viewers watched the series the night it had its premiere \u2014 proclaims not only the show\u2019s enduring resonance, but also a restitution of something lost (or at least something passed). In this era of capital-D Diversity, numbers like that indicate an unequivocal hunger (dare I say nostalgia) for stories about families like the Conners, who live blue-collar, paycheck-to-paycheck lives; fighting, laughing, and loving in the earnest heartland (read: white working class) of America. Not unlike the results of the 2016 presidential election, the #MakeAmericaWatchRoseanneAgain movement is a beacon in the night, illuminating a once-abandoned subsection of the country with a spotlight of validation. As if it were saying: \u201cI see you. You matter.\u201d\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s so galling that a show celebrating ostensibly marginalized Americans would consider shows about even more marginalized Americans a punch line, tossed off between two yawns and a meh, followed by a roomful of people laughing.\n\nAnd although, admittedly, I have no idea what it means to be white or working class, there are at least a half-dozen shows out there through which I can experience it vicariously. Meanwhile, white working-class people have one \u2014 and only one \u2014 current network show to help them understand the lives of Asian-Americans (hint: it rhymes with Shmesh Off the Shmoat).\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause here\u2019s where I agree that we are all the same: It\u2019s the invisibility that hurts. It\u2019s the passing over, the looking away, the casual flick of the hand. It\u2019s the denial of basic recognition. It\u2019s the reluctance to concede that your story deserves to be told. In some profound or perverse way, I see a subtle kinship between the watershed premiere of \u201cFresh Off the Boat\u201d in February 2015 and the recent revival of \u201cRoseanne\u201d in March 2018. In both instances, the shows were received with the same profound subtext: \u201cI see you. You matter.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a zero sum game. I refuse to believe that just because one group gets attention, another group gets dismissed. I don\u2019t understand how telling one kind of story requires a blas\u00e9 disregard for another. In fact, I think different stories can serve different purposes. I can watch one TV show as an uplifting reflection of my own experience, while watching another as a deep dive into \u201cOthersville.\u201d\n\nBut that requires effort and patience and curiosity and attention. As comfy and cozy as it might be, we can\u2019t fall asleep in front of our television sets like Roseanne and Dan. We have to somehow resist the safety of our heavy eyelids and the security of our warm couches. If we want others to respect our stories, we have to respect theirs.\n\nAt the very least, we have to stay awake and continually challenge ourselves to say: \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not all caught up.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019: When a Punch Line Feels Like a Gut Punch", "authors": ["Kelvin Yu"]}

Yuhua passive-aggressively refused to make herself as legitimately ugly as her role demanded \u2014 while her teammates gamely obscured their beauty with fake noses and rubber warts, she painted herself like a Florida dinner-theater Grizabella \u2014 and when called out for it, she let loose an acrid spray of defense.\n\nThe gorgeous Asia O\u2019Hara, made down to resemble \u201cLucy, the missing link,\u201d proved to be the found link of the challenge. She stole the show with her gnarled mugging, which was benevolently whipped up by team leader Mon\u00e9t, though she later regretted this X Change of power (\u201cFocus on meeee!\u201d).

She crabbed that Eureka\u2019s charismatic scene theft was somehow rigged, and yet, had she spent less time rolling her admittedly lovely eyes and just a few minutes making a distinctive choice and committing to it, she could have chewed that sandwich board and made a meal of her character.\n\nBack in the workroom, Blair popped the cork on a bottle of sparkling kiki and opened up about how much she missed her mother, and how close they are, despite her family\u2019s strong religious beliefs. The Vixen\u2019s attempt to derail the story by picking a fight with Aquaria about a borrowed wig (it should be mentioned that, for a millennial, Aquaria seems surprisingly resistant to the sharing economy) was blessedly concluded by a Deus ex arachnia (A spider was discovered crawling on a dress, sending into a squealing fever all of the queens save for the strapping Kameron, who calmly captured it and, hopefully, released it outdoors, far from where it could hear any more fighting.)\n\nThe heretofore under-heralded Dusty Ray Bottoms snatched the open kiki bottle and poured out the heartbreaking tale of her ostracism from her religious family. They were so hidebound that, after sucker punching her into coming out, they subjected her to an exorcism, claimed that she was \u201cpossessed by a gay demon\u201d and sent her to conversion therapy, where she was told that \u201cin a homosexual relationship, you\u2019ll never find success, you\u2019ll never find love.\u201d\n\nIn the kind of moment that is the apogee of this show, she wept and recounted that she then stopped the \u201ctherapist,\u201d packed her car and drove off to a \u201cbeautiful life,\u201d a hot fianc\u00e9e (a photo confirmed this as hard fact), and the revelation that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to compromise or change for someone\u2019s small-minded view.\u201d She then blew what was left of our minds by saying, \u201cI still believe in God, because I cried out, and I was heard.\u201d Thank you, Dusty, for reminding us that sometimes, you have to get away from Jesus in order to truly come to Jesus.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So, it\u2019s so great to see vulnerability.\u201d I raise my glass of sparkling kiki to that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Vixen, smelling blood in the bubbles, savaged the moment by dusting the cobweb off the Aquaria fight, barking, \u201cThe problem with Aquaria is, she likes to poke the bear and run. This bear will chase you.\u201d Under this bear\u2019s pointless pursuit, Aquaria exited the workroom, and the others chided The Vixen for her constant combativeness.\n\n\u201cYou knew I was a pit bull!\u201d she retorted. This demon just cannot stop vomiting soup \u2014 Dusty, do you still have that exorcist\u2019s number?\n\nRu ushered in the runway challenge, titled simply, \u201cFeathers,\u201d which released a flock of toothless avian puns from the judges that largely did not fly.\n\nThe guest judge Nico Tortorella, who is living proof that a polyamorous pansexual relationship can also bring you success and love, presided, along with Courtney Love, who is living proof that the end of a love relationship can bring you success.\n\nStandouts included Aquaria as a wounded bird pierced by two arrows (presumably slung by the outrageously fortunate The Vixen), and Asia O\u2019Hara, in a daring Tweety Bird raiment, who, owing to her equally brave and unique performance in the maxi-challenge, was deservedly named this week\u2019s winner.\n\nThe bottom two: Yuhua, whose look called to mind an ill-advised remake of the \u201cBirds\u201d featuring Carrie Bradshaw \u2014 on second thought, that is a \u201cSex and the City 3\u201d concept that I would actually watch \u2014 and the spiritually hogtied Mayhem Miller.\n\nMayhem was flogged for her failure to take control of her scene, and for her lack of discipline in her exchanges with those in power.

(\u201cFor a queen, it\u2019s a chance to entertain and inspire \u2026 and make a few coins on the side.\u201d) They were ordered to assemble panels, perform demos and discuss the building blocks of drag \u2014 body, face and wigs \u2014 in front of every artist\u2019s worst nightmare: a live audience with an invitation to ask questions.\n\nPrevious teammates Cracker, The Vixen and Blair ru-peated themselves and became Team Wigs; Asia, Monique and Aquaria snapped each other up for Team Face; and the ascending Miss Congeniality candidate Eureka took pity on the ostracized, \u201ctainted\u201d Mon\u00e9t and the silent-but-deadly Kameron Michaels, and warmly embraced them to form a delightfully diverse Team Body.\n\nAsia smugly speculated that, in a public speaking challenge, a body composed of the chatty Eureka, the quiet storm Kameron and the struggling Mon\u00e9t might not work. \u201cAll of them have issues that they\u2019re battling, so we\u2019ll see how that goes,\u201d she said.\n\nListen up, young ones: Drag, as well as most forms of art, is about battling issues, and Team Body got right down to operational-level strategy. Eureka\u2019s past experience at Drag Con led her to wisely appoint herself as panel moderator, and when she accidentally neologized \u201cproportionizing,\u201d the team\u2019s recent experience of assessing what was under their posteriors led them to wisely assent that they were sitting on a pot of gold. Merch first!\n\nTeam Wigs took a controlled-chaos approach, opting not to elect a moderator, with Cracker unwisely cracking that Drag Con is \u201creally just an excuse for queens to hang out.\u201d Drag Con President, CEO and Rear Admiral Ru looked as if he had been stabbed in the forehead with a knife. He gently pulled it out and sagely intoned, \u201cOver the years, I have branded every damn thing I can, and that\u2019s what you should be doing, too.\u201d Ladies, read your contracts and check your flanks!\n\nMonique and Asia expressed concerns that their teammate, the walking selfie Aquaria, would be too lo-fi to rise to the challenge of extemporaneous speaking. The ever-vescent (neologism is contagious) Monique went on to lament her underfunded wardrobe, which necessitated her to \u201cjimmy-rig\u201d (I love her so much) a \u201cdress-gown\u201d (I love her so much) from a raw slab of iridescent paillettes brought from home. She aptly described herself as \u201cthe MacGyver of drag,\u201d saying, \u201cI came to this competition with glitter and Jesus, and bitch, I am making it work, okaaaay?\u201d Okaaaay!\n\nDressed in a merch bag from the Paisley Park gift shop, Ru introduced the queens to the live \u201cDrag Con\u201d audience that ringed the runway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTeam Body lifted their competitors\u2019 embargo, fired \u201cProportionizing!\u201d into the crowd, and sold the heaven out of it.

We do drag to celebrate ourselves, our femininity \u2026 people celebrate drag with us because it\u2019s a way for them to escape and to feel like they belong, in a political climate where none of us feel like we belong, truly.\u201d Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between and beyond: This is what a drag superstar looks and sounds like. I\u2019m starting to have vivid visuals of a crown on her head.\n\nTeam Face made a fun showing, with the moderator Monique (\u201cthe Heart of Season 10!\u201d) and even the typically Mayfair-muted Aquaria leaning in with some choice quotes and dishing out useful tips, like blow-drying false eyelashes into place and using glue to anchor a \u201cred glitter lip,\u201d which, for some reason, was pink.\n\nIt actually causes me physical pain to write about Team Wigs. Blair\u2019s contrived charisma hung in the air like a child star\u2019s burp. Cracker\u2019s playful pitches of shade splatted onto the unoccupied home plate like globs of cigarette-butt-flavored Jell-O. And The Vixen, who up until this moment in the episode seemed refreshingly chastened, responded to the other queens\u2019 jovial jests with not only a complete lack of humor, but, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this, actual threats of physical violence. (Perhaps she should ask the Season 2 winner Tyra Sanchez how threatening violence at Drag Con works out.)\n\nThe judges all looked like they were sitting on dead fish, which, in a sense, they were. The crucial fourth building block of drag is the art of shade. If one cannot create in that medium, one has not earned the title of \u201cdrag queen,\u201d and should go back to school until they learn how to properly read.\n\nCouture chapeaus were celebrated in the runway challenge, titled \u201cHat\u2019s Incredible\u201d \u2014 a tip to a television show that ended two years before Blair was born. Mon\u00e9t redeemed herself with an impressive \u201cUber-Executive-to-church\u201d look that tithed her team into the top three, with Eureka named the overall winner for the second week in a row. Blair, in yet another \u201cold Broadway musicals\u201d inspired look, and The Vixen, in the sweepings from Philip Treacy\u2019s studio floor, were sent to the back of the parade.\n\nBlair tearfully confessed that her endless dessert menu of drag was in response to a college rape, and choked, \u201cI urge to find daintiness, because I feel dirty.\u201d Drag Oprah Ru empathetically responded that \u201cwe\u2019ve all had trauma \u2026, and the first response to that is to \u2026 put rainbows on everything. But we know that doesn\u2019t work, and you have to walk through that.\u201d\n\nBlair, you are dainty as heaven, and we are so grateful for your brave confession. But Ru is right: The integration of your trauma into your art is a process for which you are, I\u2019m so sorry to say, due. You have acres of potential, but in this, the springtime of your discontent, you are still a bit green. We love you, Blair. (Me, too.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlair and The Vixen were consigned to battle to that rugged hymn of the Ru-public, \u201cI\u2019m Coming Out\u201d by Diana Ross. Both performances were amateurish in polar opposite ways \u2014 The Vixen tumbled, jumped and thrashed sans POV, whilst Blair earnestly auditioned for the role of Eponine in a state-college production of \u201cLes Miz.\u201d Sadly, despite a heart full of love, Blair took the bullet, and was sent off on her own. (I can\u2019t wait to see her at her Fantine in Season 6 of All Stars.)\n\nPanel Man\u2019s question was actually quite prescient \u2014 why is drag so important in the current political climate? We are at a fascinating moment where the rebel forces are becoming war profiteers. And, unlike the other wars our generations have endured, this one will have an actual winner. That winner must ask not what her charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent can do for her, but what she can do for her charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent. Do we want to elect a community organizer, or a businesswoman? An experienced veteran, or an unpredictable outsider?

Sweet Mayhem soured as a pickle-phobe, while her partner Miz Cracker tickled as \u201cDr. Dill,\u201d a pickle who was also a psychotherapist who was also Jewish, and then was not.\n\nThe Vixen and Asia\u2019s \u201cSingle Black Female\u201d bit really threw the dog out of the window \u2014 their attempt to mock Cracker and Aquaria\u2019s copycat feud did not progress beyond their similar yellow dresses and, after swinging and missing at all of Ross\u2019s jokey pitches, The Vixen simply walked.

After a painful \u201cUntucked\u201d clip in which Eureka was legit bitchy and The Vixen threw water boiled with fission, the latter froze to ice as Mayhem amiably advocated for an armistice.\n\nEureka ceded the battleground to The Vixen, gently offering her space and conceding that, although she was sure she\u2019d said \u201cy\u2019all\u201d and not \u201cyou\u201d (this was important in a context that I have neither space nor energy to describe), if \u201cyou\u201d was what she\u2019d actually said (it was), she was sorry.\n\nEureka shared that, after a lifetime of antagonism and abuse, drag helped her \u201cfind her voice,\u201d and admitted that, now that her mouth has been opened, she can get \u201ca little out of hand.\u201d\n\nThis elicited the glimpse of The Vixen\u2019s inner workings that we have been longing to catch, as she confessed in turn that for most of her drag career, she would silently \u201cshow up, get my money and leave,\u201d but that the \u201ccurrent climate\u201d radicalized and uncorked her.\n\n\u201cI go from 0-100, because it is still new for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to get to 50.\u201d\n\nEureka extended an olive branch, a bowl of picholines, a dish for the pits and a cheese plate, and offered to shake Vixen\u2019s hand, but was rebuffed. The generous Eureka warmly said, \u201cJust know that my friendship\u2019s here. Whatever direction that goes in.\u201d The Vixen smiled, but only to apply her blush. Then she growled, \u201cI\u2019m tired of this mushy [expletive].\u201d\n\nFor the many experiences that have led her to this moment, and the many systems that have undoubtedly failed her, I am truly sorry. But, Vixen, it\u2019s been 18 months. I\u2019m afraid of getting to 50 in this climate too, but we must, and this is how we do it. The same softness which once made you a target now compels people to trust you with their stories. Take their hands.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWaving a white flag of a gown, Ru announced the fashion challenge, \u201cDenim and Diamonds.\u201d The girls answered the call of booty, as cutout backsides ruled the runway. The Vixen got her range of motion down to 50 in a killer denim mermaid dress; Asia destroyed in a distressed Tina Turner homage; and Miz Cracker delighted in a Pippi-esque long stocking with a hilarious buckteeth reveal. When will she win a challenge? She is qualified and without obvious flaw. Did her husband cheat or something?\n\nKameron surprised in a \u201cyoung Dolly Parton\u201d look, and in a lovely moment, Ru gave her the floor to express her lifelong adoration for the guest judge Shania Twain, who has gotten to 50 quite nicely. (Well, she is Canadian. Single-payer and poutine do a body good.) Eureka, in a funny-sexy Elvis-style jumpsuit, won the maxi-challenge, as well as two tickets to Cirque du Soleil in Vegas, for which she now has the perfect outfit.\n\nAspiring \u201cchocolate Judd\u201d Mayhem looked more like \u201cstrawberry LaToya Jackson,\u201d and Mon\u00e9t\u2019s cutout jumpsuit created the wrong kind of gap in the crotch. The two were sent to their stations for a lip sync battle to Ms. Twain\u2019s \u201cMan, I Feel Like A Woman.\u201d\n\nMayhem made a strong standard-issue showing, but Mon\u00e9t, a lip sync beast, twisted it out Vanjie-style, butching it up in a cropped wig and pantomiming smoking a joint whilst riding a motorcycle. In a coup de main, she sealed her style and her safety by pulling out not one, but two cans of Aqua Net, and spraying away the competition. (Is it cruel to hope that she\u2019s in the final two every week? Her lip syncs have been the highlight of the last two episodes.) She shant\u00e9-stayed, and our dream-diplomat Mayhem was dispensed, to bring her message of peace to a world that urgently needs it.\n\nReaders, I implore you: We\u2019re all terrified of World War III, so let\u2019s not start it with our sisters. Although this life is competitive, reach out to your fellow struggling women and offer them your hand. We can only get to 50 together, and these days, we\u2019re all just improvising.

{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "The would-be exorcists blamed the internet and atheism for what they see as a spike in evil, but the urgency evident in the course also seemed to have something to do with a growing conservative view that the church has gone astray under Pope Francis, and that end times had drawn nigh.\n\nThe pope recently had conservative heads spinning when he was quoted, incorrectly according to the Vatican, by an Italian reporter with credibility issues as not believing in hell. \u201cBeyond what is tolerable,\u201d the American cardinal Raymond Burke, a leader of the conservative resistance to Francis, said at the time.\n\nIn fact, the pope often speaks about the devil. In this month\u2019s apostolic exhortation, Rejoice and Be Glad, he wrote that while in biblical times, \u201cepilepsy, for example, could easily be confused with demonic possession,\u201d the faithful should not conclude \u201cthat all the cases related in the Gospel had to do with psychological disorders and hence that the devil does not exist or is not at work.\u201d\n\nFather C\u00e1rdenas had no doubts about the pope\u2019s belief in the devil. Neither did Cardinal Simoni, who has encountered evil firsthand, surviving decades in prisons and work camps for practicing his faith under the Albanian Communist regime of Enver Hoxha.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s keynote address, the cardinal answered the questions of Father C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 fellow priests, like one from a French priest who asked him to share his exorcising secrets. \u201cPray without interruption,\u201d the cardinal said, reminding the audience that \u201cmore than anything, chastity\u201d was key.\n\nAsked if he preferred the ancient ritual or the new Vatican norms introduced in 1999, Cardinal Simoni said, \u201cJesus knows all the languages.\u201d\n\nAnother priest asked how to tell the difference between bipolar and possessed personalities. \u201cIt\u2019s important to differentiate between psychopathic illnesses, neurasthenia, pathologies,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cSatan you can recognize.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis theme will be tackled on Tuesday afternoon,\u201d interjected Professor Giuseppe Ferrari, an organizer of the course, who runs a socio-religious research group.\n\nAt that, Father C\u00e1rdenas perused his blue program, illustrated with Raphael\u2019s Transfiguration. On Tuesday, he could listen to an exorcist lecture on \u201cThe Prayer of Liberation, a Theological and Pastoral Approach\u201d or \u201cThe Auxiliary Exorcist: Skills and Duties.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, there was \u201cMagical, Esoteric and Occult Links to Some Alternative and Energy-giving Therapies,\u201d followed by Friday\u2019s \u201cThe Exorcist: Life, Choices and Mistake.\u201d But he was especially interested in Wednesday\u2019s talk on \u201cWitchcraft in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican has had an uncomfortable relationship with some of its best-known African exorcists. Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, of Zambia, gained notoriety as a healer and exorcist in the 1990s, when he lived in Italy and where he was known as the \u201cwitch doctor bishop.\u201d He later married a Korean woman at a group wedding presided over by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, and was excommunicated for ordaining four married men as priests.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The death in 2016 of Father Gabriele Amorth, Italy\u2019s most famous demon remover, prompted a new national outcry for recruits.\n\nAn exorcism documentary, \u201cLibera Nos,\u201d won a prize at the Venice Film Festival in 2016. The film follows a rotund Sicilian priest in a friar\u2019s frock and wool hat; in one scene, he yanks on the bangs of a woman who grunts at his command that she love her neighbors.\n\nIn a separate cellphone conversation in the film with a possessed woman, the priest implores, \u201cI exorcise you, Satan.\u201d He then signs off with, \u201cO.K., talk soon,\u201d and \u201csay hello to your husband for me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n(\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to learn how not to do an exorcism,\u201d Professor Ferrari said.)\n\nIn the seminar on Monday, Cardinal Simoni reported dramatic successes. Asked by one priest how he knew if an exorcism had worked, he responded, \u201cAh, you can see it immediately,\u201d explaining that one possessed person went from jumping up and down and \u201ckeeping three or four men busy\u201d to rising with a \u201cjoyous smile.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour exorcisms are very effective, it seems,\u201d said Professor Ferrari, who then told the crowd, \u201cWe will meet back here after the coffee break.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe students headed for a long table with snacks and soda while reporters pressed Cardinal Simoni about conducting exorcisms by cellphone, which is technically banned by church law. (He had done them \u201c100, 1,000 times\u201d he said.)\n\nFather C\u00e1rdenas waited in the aisle, his cellphone out, hoping to get a picture of himself with the cardinal. But the elderly exorcist shuffled past, leaving the Colombian grumbling, though not demonically.\n\nTurning back to the topic at hand, Father C\u00e1rdenas warned that black magic can be transmitted through screens (\u201cAmerican films are also a problem\u201d), that demons enter the body \u201cthrough the back of the brain,\u201d and that early traumas, like sexual abuse, can make a person vulnerable to homosexuality and the demons who, in grave cases, cause suicidal or violent tendencies and need to be chased away.\n\nA few feet away, The Rev. Joseph Poggemeyer, from Toledo, Ohio, said exorcists needed to confront the evil spread on the internet. He said that every diocese should have an exorcist on hand, but that the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and its \u201cconfusion\u201d had eroded exorcism expertise and deprived seminarians of instruction in demonology.\n\n\u201cThat was simply lost,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of dioceses in the United States haven\u2019t had exorcists for a very long time.\u201d\n\nOrganizers called the priests back in for a lesson on a bishop\u2019s role in exorcism, after which they broke for lunch. While budding exorcists waited in line for pasta behind texting students, or discussed the manifestations of pure evil over yogurt, Mr. Ferrari said he hoped to invite the pope\u2019s preferred exorcist, a Lutheran, to next year\u2019s conference.\n\nReplenished, Father C\u00e1rdenas and the others returned to the basement hall for the afternoon session, \u201cExorcism as a Ministry of Mercy and Consolation Amid the Bewilderment of Contemporary Society.\u201d\n\nIt was led by Archbishop Luigi Negri, who made news in 2015, when he was overheard on a train wishing for the death of Pope Francis. The pontiff subsequently replaced him as the leader of the Ferrara archdiocese.\n\nOn Monday, Archbishop Negri warned the priests what dark forces they would be up against.\n\n\u201cThe actor of this evil \u2014 this diabolical and evil entity,\u201d he explained, \u201cis greater than any single man.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Shut Up, Satan\u2019: Rome Course Teaches Exorcism, Even by Cellphone", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz"]}

The reason is simple: \u201cPeople try restaurant shows every year, on network, on cable,\u201d the showrunner Stuart Zicherman explained. \u201cThey never work.\u201d\n\n(Mr. Zicherman exaggerated that frequency, but the network version of \u201cKitchen Confidential\u201d was canceled after four episodes and last year\u2019s \u201cFeed the Beast\u201d was nixed after a single season, so he has a point.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAudiences aren\u2019t interested in whether a restaurant can wrangle the best seafood supplier or whether the steak arrives on the table perfectly black and blue. \u201cIt\u2019s like, blah blah blah,\u201d Mr. Zicherman said, speaking at a latte shop near his home. Even a visit from a food critic isn\u2019t enough to drive an episode.\n\n\u201cSweetbitter\u201d isn\u2019t about that, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about someone who has never belonged to anything in her life wanting to belong.\u201d The day boat scallops, the chicken liver mousse \u2014 they are just the side dishes to a slow-burn coming-of-age story.\n\nSo come for the food. Stay for the existential journey.\n\nIt\u2019s a journey Ms. Danler, 34, has mapped herself. The book and the show aren\u2019t autobiography. Ms. Danler isn\u2019t Tess, a 22-year-old newcomer thirsty for experience and Beaujolais and bar-bathroom hookups. She was never that na\u00efve, never that reckless. When she moved to New York right in 2006, the same year as Tess \u2014 in those gritty, halcyon days just before smartphones \u2014 restaurants were a way to make money until she could sell a novel. But then they became her world. \u201cI fell absolutely head over heels in love,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018I found my people. This is it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Danler, briefly in town from Los Angeles where she now lives, was speaking at Via Carota, a West Village trattoria. Via Carota doesn\u2019t take reservations, but even on a seething Saturday night, with a line stretching out the door, a prime table had been conjured for her instantly. Blond and kittenish, she is so effortlessly charismatic that the couples on either side kept leaning over to suggest new delicacies for her to order.\n\nShe already knew the menu; she\u2019d worked at Buvette, a sister restaurant. So after a quick perusal, she asked for a few vegetable plates \u2014 leeks, carrots, the first ramps of the season \u2014 and a sunset-tinged Americano, garnished with a daredevil swoop of orange peel.\n\nFood matters to Ms. Danler, and even if \u201cSweetbitter\u201d is a restaurant-set show that\u2019s not about a restaurant, food matters there, too. The episodes don\u2019t try to compete with what Mr. Zicherman calls the \u201cfood porn\u201d of reality TV. But since taste is central to Tess\u2019s awakening, the camera lingers seductively on an oyster or a glass of wine and then shows how that bite or that sip affects Tess, played here by Ella Purnell, an expressive British ing\u00e9nue with the eyes-to-face ratio usually found in a giant squid and a seeming ability to soak up the whole world. Ms. Danler calls this quality a \u201creckless absorbency.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the show doesn\u2019t fake the food (the grape-juiced and food-colored drinks are obviously another story), and in terms of hospitality it doesn\u2019t fake much else. \u201cThat\u2019s for the restaurant people,\u201d Ms. Danler said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t show my face anywhere if I\u2019d cheated.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe producers hired a front-of-house consultant, Justine Slattery, the woman who trained Ms. Danler at Union Square Caf\u00e9, to give a crash course to the main actors on proper server etiquette \u2014 posture, place settings, the dreaded three-plate carry. The background actors playing the kitchen staff spent two weeks at the Institute of Culinary Education learning food prep.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think on our first day of waitress training we broke something like 15 bottle openers,\u201d said Caitlin FitzGerald, who plays Simone, the longtime server and Downtown sophisticate idolized by Tess. But now everyone is handy with a wine key. Ms. Purnell struggled, just as Tess does, with the three-plate carry and was surprised to discover how physically demanding the work is. \u201cCarrying heavy plates, three of them, all day and kicking the door open, everything hurts,\u201d she said.\n\nTess earns her own aches and bruises, some from her culinary education, some from her sentimental one. But what\u2019s maybe most radical about \u201cSweetbitter\u201d is that not much happens, not in each half-hour, not in the whole first season.\n\nThese first six episodes unfold over the two weeks of Tess\u2019s probationary period at the restaurant. Her desire for the brooding bartender Jake (played here by Tom Sturridge), her tentative friendship with Simone, her coaching by the restaurant\u2019s manager Howard (Paul Sparks) \u2014 the relationships that undergird the book \u2014 are only thinly outlined. This season is more or less a \u201cthree-hour-prologue,\u201d Ms. Danler said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Danler admitted that \u201cmanufactured drama\u201d is hard for her, and in her initial scripts, Tess was almost entirely passive. A first-time television writer who learned the form by locking herself indoors with a stack of pilot scripts, Ms. Danler had to push herself to provide action. The first six episodes build to what she calls \u201cour explosive moment,\u201d and that moment is a brief and silent look between two characters.\n\nSlowing down the story is a way to capture some of the imagism that made the book so distinctive, to give the viewer time to appreciate the sights and sounds that mark the world of the restaurant as a seductive space. It also acknowledges that while sometimes people grow up all at once, more often, like Tess, we become ourselves subtly, incrementally, taste by taste.\n\n\u201cSweetbitter\u201d Ms. Danler said, is about a moment when \u201cyou\u2019re waiting for your life to start and it has already started.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Sweetbitter\u2019 Is a Coming-of-Age Story, With Wine Pairings", "authors": ["Alexis Soloski"]}
{"date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "text": "And then there was the general. We\u2019d met him before, as Colonel Lyle Rennhull, back in Season 1. (The final episode of that season, \u201cThe Colonel,\u201d was named after him.) Back then, he was meeting Philip to tell him that America\u2019s Star Wars missile-defense system was a pipe dream, a meeting that initiated a sequence of events that ended with Elizabeth\u2019s being shot. He resurfaced because Moscow wanted Elizabeth to shake him down for a piece of American tech, a lithium-based radiation sensor. If he didn\u2019t obtain one, his past treason would be exposed.\n\nRennhull (still played by Victor Slezak) has not been the most admirable character \u2014 in Season 2 he killed the informant Sanford Prince in order to protect himself \u2014 but this time he decided to stand on principle, declaring that all he ever wanted to do was avoid war and that he wouldn\u2019t sell out his country now. So, an idealist, like Elizabeth. When they met in a park in Virginia, he pulled a gun, and she fell to her knees and played the I\u2019m-a-mother card, pretending to beg for her life. This was a distraction, of course, before she lunged, tackled him, wrestled for the gun and then slowly, purposefully forced it under his chin and pulled the trigger.\n\nPaige ran from her post in the parking lot to her mom\u2019s aid, but this being \u201cThe Americans,\u201d there was no hugging or crying. The emotion was packed into the moment when their eyes locked, as Elizabeth yelled at Paige to get back to the car. Paige, the good soldier, hesitated only briefly before turning and running back without a word. Then the credits rolled, the fallout put off until next week.\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Philip had further setbacks in his new capitalist existence. His employee Stavos (Anthony Arkin) lost one of the travel agency\u2019s valuable clients, and when Philip told the story to Henry, the son gently reprimanded the father: Maybe Stavos was right and Philip should have kept the client himself. The American-born Henry probably has better business instincts than his wannabe-bourgeois dad.\n\nHenry\u2019s brief appearance, by phone from New Hampshire, was one of two heartwarming cameos. The other: a walk-on by the mail robot, gliding through the back of a scene at F.B.I. headquarters. In a related subplot, we were given both some comic relief and some spy-story tension via the Gennadi-and-Sofia story. Tired of her once glamorous husband, Sofia let it slip to Stan that she had found a sympathetic ear at the Tass office, a co-worker named Bogdan.\n\nThe episode was time-stamped by the baseball game on Glenn Haskard\u2019s radio: Oct. 4, the last day of the 1987 season. Glenn listened as Chili Davis of the San Francisco Giants tied the game, 4-4, with a home run off the Atlanta Braves\u2019 Chuck Cary. (The Giants went on to win, 5-4, on Bob Brenly\u2019s walk-off homer in the 10th inning. They won the National League West that year but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the league championship series.)\n\nFinally, the episode\u2019s title referred to Claudia\u2019s favorite composer. She played a Tchaikovsky recording for Paige \u2014 I\u2019m sure one of you can tell us which piece it was \u2014 and the melancholy strains continued on the soundtrack as Paige and Elizabeth had their uncomfortable conversation about sex.

Paige was worried about her mother, of course, but Elizabeth was hearing no excuses and brooking no Philip-like softness: \u201cYou don\u2019t get to talk about what you thought or how you felt or anything else, not now.\u201d When Paige asked if she could spend the night at her parents\u2019 house, Philip said \u201cOf course\u201d but Elizabeth said no to the change in routine, and Paige, the good soldier, got up without protest and went home alone. It was more fuel for the Elizabeth haters out there \u2014 a group of which I am emphatically not part \u2014 but we all realize that her love of, and fear for, Paige are at the heart of her reactions, right?\n\nLater, without telling Paige the whole story, Elizabeth told her that Rennhull \u201cwas caught up in something and didn\u2019t see a way out,\u201d which of course was a pretty good description of Elizabeth\u2019s current situation. Elizabeth acknowledged that she mishandled the whole Rennhull situation, telling Philip that she moved too fast because of the pressure she\u2019s under from the \u201ctrouble back home.\u201d In a quiet, sad moment in the kitchen, they both kept secrets, though Elizabeth admitted that she was withholding her mission from Philip. Philip, guilty and grim, was just plain working her.\n\nThe mission took Elizabeth and the chastened (but increasingly self-assured) Paige to a stakeout of Haskard\u2019s team of American and Soviet arms negotiators. After some more baseball talk \u2014 Haskard is a fan of the Minnesota Twins, formerly the Washington Senators \u2014 there was finally some action involving the Soviet expert Elizabeth is staking out. When an American suggested a get-together at his house to watch a World Series game, two Soviets immediately begged off, but Elizabeth\u2019s target was suspiciously enthusiastic.\n\nThere was also the matter of the radiation sensor Rennhull was supposed to have obtained. (As Philip somewhat snippily pointed out, Rennhull no longer has access.) Shifting focus to a worker at a warehouse where the sensors are stored, she posed as an auditor to quiz him about security procedures. It looked like a benign operation until he mentioned that his girlfriend worked there, too \u2014 in security. Cue the chokehold strangulation, with Elizabeth subduing a considerably larger man for the second week in a row. (She killed the civilian to the melancholy strains of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cDance Me to the End of Love\u201d on the soundtrack.)\n\nElsewhere, it was a good episode for Stan Beeman fans. We got to see him in the kitchen with Renee, who appeared to upend a lot of fan speculation by announcing that she wanted to serve her country and join the F.B.I. Stan gently pointed out that she was over the cut-off age for new agents, 37. (Presumably the KGB would know that.)", "title": "\u2018The Americans\u2019 Season 6, Episode 3 Recap: Moscow Believes in Beef Stew", "authors": []}

He had a second meeting with Oleg (who assured him, correctly as we found out, that he hadn\u2019t been followed). After some preliminaries, Oleg got to the point \u2014 Elizabeth\u2019s extreme loyalty to the Soviet Union \u201ccan be used,\u201d and a downcast Philip grudgingly told him about Rennhull and the quest for the radiation sensor.\n\nSecond digression. Two questions for Elizabeth haters: Is she less admirable than the husband who stepped away from his duties, giving her the entire espionage workload, and is now informing on her? And if you watch a thriller in which a fictional American, most likely male, operative routinely murders Russians or Latin Americans or Arabs, do you react with the same kind of visceral moral repugnance?\n\nPhilip also paid a nostalgic visit to the Breland house, dressed up as hipster Jim and communing with his soul mate Kimmy, now a junior at Michigan. \u201cYou should have the job, the relationship, everything you want,\u201d she said, unaware that he has those things and they\u2019re not making him happy. The visit only contributed to his angst: When he had to report that Kimmy\u2019s holiday trip to Greece meant no more recordings of her father before the arms summit, Elizabeth was not happy.\n\nThe Jenningses\u2019 domestic war slowly heated up. First seen wearily eyeing each other from opposite sides of the kitchen, they later openly clashed in front of a highly uncomfortable Paige. Philip complained about the peril in which Paige is being placed, and Elizabeth reminded him that they had a deal \u2014 Paige is hers and Henry is his, with the private school and the hockey glory. But that\u2019s just another in Philip\u2019s own basket of worries, and in a painful scene he had to tell Henry that his senior year might not be at St. Edward\u2019s. (This was balanced by Stan\u2019s relatively carefree discussion of Matthew\u2019s post-college plans, and his financial insouciance. In the soulless capitalist snake pit, having a government job gives him security.)\n\nThe show gave us a moment of partial d\u00e9tente between Elizabeth and Philip, when she climbed into bed with him and his ever-present financial statements and asked, sympathetically, \u201cYou rich yet?\u201d She was sad at the idea of Henry not being able to finish at St. Edward\u2019s but not too sad. \u201cWell, he\u2019s your department,\u201d she told Philip. They looked into each other\u2019s eyes and kissed, but we know how this story ends \u2014 Elizabeth rolling over, Philip staring at the ceiling.\n\nI\u2019ve left for last what I suspect many will consider the episode\u2019s most unsettling development: the possible beginning of Paige\u2019s own career as a honey pot.", "title": "\u2018The Americans\u2019 Season 6, Episode 4 Recap: The Birth of a Honey Pot", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Sex was also an issue, indirectly, for Oleg, who encountered his former lover Tatiana. She tracked him down at his urban transport seminar and quizzed him about his reasons for being in America. When he wouldn\u2019t answer, her bitterness over his betrayal \u2014 after the failure of her germ-warfare project, her career has stalled out \u2014 led to a not-so-veiled warning to watch his back. Later at the Rezidentura, she suggests pressuring his father for information and recommends that a cable be sent to Moscow saying that he\u2019s not loyal. Nice knowing you, Oleg.\n\nAnd then there was Paige. Tired of being lectured, she lied to her mom by omission, saying she met up with the cute congressional intern but leaving out the part about sleeping with him. Later she confronted the ugly side of the bar scene: A jerk she (rightfully) insulted grabbed her and she put him on the floor, punching his friend in the nose for good measure. (At the same time, her father was in bed with Kimmy and her mother\u2019s first attempt to kill Gennadi was being interrupted by an F.B.I. agent, who got a good look at her.)\n\nWhen Paige \u2014 in the middle of an impromptu sparring match with Elizabeth \u2014 told her parents about the barroom incident, the real fireworks started. Paige can match her mom in outbursts, at least, including \u201cCould you just stop yourself for one second, please?\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me who I should and shouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d That last one made Philip snap to attention.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her education remains incomplete.\n\nThat led to what I\u2019d call the episode\u2019s emotional high point: a quiet, violent scene in which Philip dropped in on Paige at her apartment. He started out as the understanding dad, but when Paige undercut him \u2014 saying she was \u201cinto\u201d the work in a way that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he went very quiet and taught her a lesson.\n\n\u201cI want to see what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d he said, and proceeded to throw her around the room. He didn\u2019t need to point out that he could have killed her at any point. But Paige didn\u2019t back down \u2014 when her elbows and punches didn\u2019t work, she bit him, hard, in the arm. His murmured \u201cnot bad\u201d as he walked out could be taken ironically, but I think we were supposed to see that he was both worried for her (and a little contemptuous, in that way he has) and reluctantly impressed.\n\nDespite Paige\u2019s and Philip\u2019s workouts, though, Elizabeth got the week\u2019s big action scene, and it was a brutal one. Sneaking into Gennadi\u2019s apartment, she was surprised by Sofia\u2019s presence, and tried to sneak back out. But Gennadi came into the kitchen for a glass of water, and that was it \u2014 a knife in his throat, and then a knife in Sofia\u2019s ribs as she tried to run. Then the real tension: Elizabeth saw Ilya asleep in front of the television and had to leave quietly before she was forced to kill him, too. (As it was, his mother was done in by her sentimentality \u2014 she had told Stan, to his delight, that she was having second thoughts about divorcing Gennadi.)\n\nA couple scenes felt wedged in, just to remind us someone was there or make use of an actor who was already being paid. Stan suggested to Renee that she apply for a personnel job at the F.B.I. (no age limits), leaving open the continuing question of her function in the plot. And the bedridden Erica appeared briefly, furiously exhorting Elizabeth to draw. It\u2019s as if her concentration on Elizabeth\u2019s efforts is what\u2019s keeping her alive.\n\n\u201cYou have to put in the time,\u201d she exhorted. \u201cThat\u2019s what time is for. No one understands that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe episode\u2019s title came from Claudia, who spent an early scene educating Paige about the Great Patriotic War, taught in American schools as World War II. It was a lesson \u2014 for Paige and for us \u2014 in what drove cold warriors of Claudia\u2019s and Elizabeth\u2019s generations: their (quite supportable) belief that the Soviet Union, not the United States, was most responsible for Hitler\u2019s defeat; and their direct connection to the war\u2019s toll, which Claudia gave as 27 million Soviet deaths compared to 400,000 American. Those figures are in line with historians\u2019 estimates \u2014 in military deaths alone, the Soviet Union lost at least 21 times as many people as the United States.

And I wonder why you didn\u2019t have a choice? We talked a little earlier about power dynamics, but you are, at this point, the director of the F.B.I., you are a profoundly distinguished law man, you\u2019re an independent operator, and you are, by your own description, stubborn and prideful. So why do you have to stay? Why do you have no choice in the matter to be alone with the president in the Oval Office?\n\nCOMEY: I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s literally no choice. I mean, I was not handcuffed to a chair. But given that I am the director of the F.B.I., and the president of the United States has, in essence, issued an order for the room to be cleared and me to stay, it never entered my mind to walk out. Just because of my respect for the office, the literal physical office in which I stood, and the office of the president of the United States, I, I can\u2019t imagine \u2014 many things people can second-guess, but walking out at that moment I don\u2019t think is one that could be fairly second-guessed.\n\nBARBARO: But I guess what I\u2019m getting at is why, at this point, as F.B.I. director, aren\u2019t you doing anything more meaningful about these encounters than memorializing them in a memo? If they\u2019re becoming troubling to you, as I think you\u2019re suggesting they very much are, why are you just writing these stories down and locking them away \u2014 even if there are two copies, one at the F.B.I., one at home \u2014 and hoping, as you said, that they never end up having to be seen?\n\nCOMEY: Well, I\u2019m doing more than that, I think, including, in the course of the dinner with the president on the 27th, trying to interject, to explain to him why it\u2019s important for there to be distance between the president and the Justice Department, and why I was there a week earlier, about a week earlier, February the 8th, talking to his chief of staff, and part of that conversation was about the appropriate channels for communicating with the F.B.I.\n\nBARBARO: But, as I recall, that meeting with Reince Priebus ends with him, in your mind, inappropriately guiding you over to the president once more, to have a conversation you didn\u2019t even really want to have, but you had it.\n\nCOMEY: Yup. And then the day after the Valentine\u2019s Day conversation, I spoke to the attorney general, my direct boss, and told him, it can\u2019t happen that you\u2019re kicked out of a room and the president meets with me.

Emily bristles at being asked to hide her family life, but before she knows it, the bigots\u2019 prejudices have become law. Even June and Luke\u2019s conversation about trying for another child has sinister undertones: If Luke wanted another child, he could force the situation by simply withholding his signature from the birth control form (echoes of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby). It\u2019s already his decision, not June\u2019s, which hardly seems to bother Luke \u2014 their home is already a smaller version of Gilead. Those red cloaks didn\u2019t happen overnight. Everyone, in increments, had to agree to them.\n\nGiven how hard \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d can be to watch, it\u2019s amazing how beautiful it is. While it doesn\u2019t avoid some truly gruesome and upsetting images, the show is stunning even in its most horrifying moments. The rich visual aesthetic established by Reed Morano, who directed the first three episodes of Season 1, is still felt, as in the stark, terrifying, Francis Bacon-like surreality of the scene at Fenway Park, where Aunt Lydia takes the handmaids for their mock execution. In contrast, we later get a first look at the Colonies, where Gilead sends its female transgressors \u2014 called Unwomen by their oppressors \u2014 to do punishing environmental cleanup until the radiation kills them. The women there, almost too exhausted for despair, are like drab dots in an Andrew Wyeth landscape, bathed in a dusky light that further deadens everything it touches.\n\nBut this show\u2019s greatest strength is still its cast, and the best thing the series does is give them all room to breathe, even in the smaller moments. Yvonne Strahovski is consistently gripping as Serena, who stews in the very pot she filled to boil other women in, but never becomes two-dimensional. Alexis Bledel is a revelation as Emily, and being part of the makeshift community inside the Colonies has only made her brittleness more interesting.\n\nMarisa Tomei, a guest star in Episode 2, is likewise incredible as a Gilead mistress who\u2019s sent the Colonies for adultery, a true believer who suddenly finds herself surrounded by the women she helped oppress. (\u201cI had an M.F.A. before the law changed, in interior design,\u201d she tells Emily in a tone-deaf attempt to relate, one of the funniest beats this show has ever had.) She\u2019s so earnestly faithful, and yet so deeply poisonable, that it\u2019s both surprising and cathartic when Emily slips her a deadly dose.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her Aunt Lydia is a fascinating amalgam of contradictions \u2014 glimpses of sympathy and true belief amid blatant hypocrisy, sadism and condescension. (\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to be my very good girl,\u201d she coos at June while forcing her to eat under threat of solitary confinement.) But what makes Dowd\u2019s standoff with Elisabeth Moss in the premiere so electric is the sincerity of Lydia\u2019s anger.\n\nNo doubt some of that rage is just frustrated power \u2014 now that June is pregnant and can\u2019t be harmed too badly, Lydia has been robbed of an object lesson. But there\u2019s something genuine when she sneers to June: \u201cSuch a brave girl, aren\u2019t you? Standing in defiance but risking nothing.\u201d I both wonder and dread what more we have to learn about Aunt Lydia, in the same way that I can only imagine what June will do if she ever has Aunt Lydia even momentarily in her power.\n\nThe decisive moment of the Season 1 finale was the handmaids\u2019 refusal to stone Janine: an act of mercy and a passive exercise of power. Episode 1 focuses on the emotional and physical torture Lydia puts the handmaids through in order to discourage any more rebellion, although her sadism at the gallows and her smugness as she handcuffs Alma (Nina Kiri) to a burning stovetop underscore how little the handmaids have to lose by fighting back \u2014 if it\u2019s pain either way, you might as well fight. This montage of agony is a reminder that violent revolution will be the only way out of Gilead, and that we can expect a lot of blood if it comes. Crucial to this season, it seems, will be the question: What are the limits of mercy?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the novel, Offred was an observer of a world that stripped her of humanity and largely directed her narrative. Her complexity drew you inward, while the story carried her forward in its wake. Moss, a riveting screen presence, answered every call the character made of her in the first season. Her monologues grounded Offred\u2019s periods of hopeless stasis, her gaze pierced the camera, and her despair and determination were the center of the series.\n\nBut the core of her performance is her ability to make silence staggeringly important \u2014 observation as an action rather than as a passive state. Her quiet, incandescent anger powers the bulk of Episode 1 this season. And that rage is so powerful that, once June is removed from immediate danger in Episode 2 and left to her own devices, the uncertainty of her situation consumes her. While sitting helplessly in the Commander\u2019s house last season, she dreamed of doing something, and this new limbo begins to make her desperate.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder she considers a suicide mission to rescue her daughter and drive for the Canadian border.

Knopf. $27.95.\n\nThe setup for \u201cThe Sandman\u201d is a bit of a stop-me-if-you\u2019ve-heard-this-one-before joke, a familiar recipe: A serial killer, so intelligent and seductive he seems able to murder people from beyond his maximum-security cell, matches wits with a world-weary, brilliant cop. Add ice and snow; serve warm-blooded for a \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d-goes-Nordic noir thriller. Good genre writing, however, is all about creating a comfy amity whose expectations are overthrown, and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d \u2014 written by Lars Kepler, the pen name for the Swedish husband-and-wife team of Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril and Alexander Ahndoril \u2014 is a dandy exercise in surprise.\n\nThe novel commences with the return of Mikael Kohler-Frost, a young man missing and thought dead for the past 13 years. He staggers, malnourished and dazed, out of the Stockholm countryside, babbling that he\u2019s escaped from a sadist he calls the Sandman, and that his sister, Felicia, also missing for the same period, is alive but still being held captive. The man who interrogates him, a police detective named Joona Linna, is stumped: A sadistic criminal, Jurek Walter, is locked away in a heavily guarded psychiatric ward, convicted of the presumed deaths of Mikael and Felicia as well as other murders. So who is the Sandman? Linna enlists a colleague, Saga Bauer, to enter the hospital undercover. She is to pose as a patient and befriend Jurek, getting him to reveal what he knows about the Sandman so Joona can find and rescue Felicia before it\u2019s too late.\n\nPhoto\n\nAll this is told via 181 short chapters, many less than two pages long. The desired effect is to keep things moving; it\u2019s as though the authors were editing each other as they wrote. (\u201cWho needs that adjective? Delete!\u201d) \u201cThe Sandman\u201d is the fourth in the Joona Linna series \u2014 is their method a formula? I read the first, \u201cThe Hypnotist,\u201d and skimmed the second, \u201cThe Nightmare.\u201d Yup: same structure, same quick-chapter pacing. But \u201cThe Sandman\u201d has a fresher crackle than these predecessors, a more vigorous snap to its hard-boiled frost. (I intuit that some credit should go to the Ahndorils\u2019 new English translator, Neil Smith.) The phrasing is rudely blunt. (\u201cHe walked down to the beautiful beach where his boys used to swim, took out his service pistol, fed a bullet into the chamber and shot himself in the head.\u201d) The scenes cut back and forth between hero and villain with brutal efficiency. Basically, a Lars Kepler thriller stops only to fixate on Joona\u2019s eyes, which distractingly transfix any number of characters who take in this tall hunk of melancholia. At various times, his peepers are described as \u201can intense gray,\u201d \u201cas gray as a rainy sky,\u201d \u201cas dark as lead\u201d and just downright \u201cvery unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sandman\u201d makes Saga Bauer \u2014 faced with an increasingly violent Jurek in the psychiatric ward \u2014 as crucial to the crime-solving as Joona. Indeed, with her fierce athleticism and stoic grace under pressure, Saga is more of an action figure than Joona, who must do the heavy narrative lifting, pondering the metaphysical implications of a universe in which someone as evil as Jurek \u2014 and the Sandman \u2014 can exist. It\u2019s easy to identify with Joona: He feels gloomy and guilty about his work and its value. And, on occasion, who among us does not? A character like this makes us feel more optimistic about the world precisely because he fights his own pessimistic approach to that same world. With this as its subtext, \u201cThe Sandman\u201d sends us off to dreamland with a nightmare that can make us happy.", "title": "\u2018The Silence of the Lambs\u2019 Goes Nordic Noir", "authors": ["Ken Tucker", "Lars Kepler"]}

In its eighth season finale, \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d brings Negan\u2019s yearslong arc to a conclusion following the show\u2019s lowest-rated season since its humble beginnings, and perhaps for that precise reason, the writers gave every viewer everything one could possibly want.\n\nThis week\u2019s episode attempts to have it both ways, and very nearly succeeds. The faction of fans braying for Negan\u2019s bloody demise and those loyalists holding fast to the show\u2019s founding principles of humanity and mercy both get their way in the multiphase battle that fills out this episode\u2019s back half.

They each recognize too much of themselves in the other to completely abandon pity, and so when the two of them break off from the main battlefield for a mano-a-mano showdown by a solitary tree, there can be no definitive resolution.\n\nFor Rick to take Negan\u2019s life would be a betrayal to Carl\u2019s memory, his final request being for peace. Rick\u2019s turning his back on his own son\u2019s dream would have been the cruelest, most cynical turn in a show that has frequently drawn criticism for those very traits.

Last week\u2019s installment did not include a title card emblazoned with the words \u201cNow, Henry is dead,\u201d but it did show young Henry getting trampled, characters looking for him and a somber aerial shot of a graveyard.

If the ultimate objective in this episode was to return hope to Morgan, Carol and Ezekiel, the more satisfying route would have been to force these characters to accept the difficult realization that the only way to honor the dead is to continue living.

Dwight has more use to him as a conduit through which he can knowingly feed the coalition faction false intelligence, such as the phony battle plan map that Negan tricks him into delivering.

Flanked by the council speaker, Roseline Zwane, known as Topsy \u2014 who happened to be his wife \u2014 and by his longtime ally, Mayor Tlokotsi John Motaung, Mr. Zwane told the crowd about a dairy farm that would empower black farmers and create 150 jobs.\n\nShortly afterward, his department signed the first of its two dairy farm agreements with a company called Estina.\n\nThis was a peculiar choice. Estina was to buy cows for local farmers and process milk at the farm. But the company was headed by a businessman from India who had a background in information technology \u2014 not in farming. Yet, importantly, he had long worked for the Guptas.\n\nDespite the project\u2019s sketchy details, Mr. Zwane signed off on it and asked the provincial treasury to start paying Estina, according to an investigation by the National Treasury. Initially, he was overruled by lawyers in Mr. Magashule\u2019s office, who deemed the contract invalid because procurement rules, like a competitive bid, had not been followed.\n\nBut that was only a hiccup. The province signed another contract with Estina the following month \u2014 this time with the lawyers\u2019 blessing. That agreement stated that Estina would invest just under $20 million in the project and the province would contribute about $30 million over three years. Local farmers, the so-called beneficiaries, would retain 51 percent of the shares.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was \u201csomething fishy\u201d from the start, said Doctor Radebe, who was a councilor for the opposition Democratic Alliance in Vrede. Mr. Zwane and the agricultural officials presented no business plan or budget for the project, but they and the mayor insisted on pressing ahead, Mr. Radebe said.\n\nThe local municipality quickly decided to hand over 3,400 hectares, or about 8,400 acres, of land for the dairy farm.\n\nIn fact, the municipality was so determined to get the project underway that it compensated four white commercial farmers, who had been leasing the land for about $80,000 a year, in order to prematurely break their leases. Later that year, just before Mr. Zwane and his local choir left for India, on a trip sponsored by a Gupta company, the province leased the farm to Estina \u2014 rent-free, for 99 years.\n\nIn an interview, Mayor Motaung said, \u201cWe had no doubt that the plan will work.\u201d\n\nBut the mayor acknowledged that Mr. Zwane presented no detailed plan or document about the proposed dairy farm. Even basic details \u2014 like the criteria for selecting the beneficiaries \u2014 were missing, the mayor said, acknowledging that his role in the project was now under scrutiny.\n\nThe payments to Estina began months later. Court documents show that the province deposited just under $21 million in two Estina bank accounts over three years. Days after every payment, the company transferred the entire sum to other accounts. From there, prosecutors say, the money was withdrawn by individuals and other Gupta-linked companies that had little to do with the farm.\n\nIn fact, prosecutors say that only about 1 percent of the money invested by the province actually went into dairy farming. Beyond that, the National Treasury found no evidence that Estina ever invested its own money in the project, despite its obligation to do so.\n\nEmails leaked from a Gupta company server indicate that some of the money was sent to the United Arab Emirates and put into accounts registered to the Guptas. The money then made its way back to South Africa through a maze of bank transfers, according to spreadsheets, logs and an invoice in the email trove.\n\nThe emails, amounting to thousands of exchanges, were leaked last year to South African news organizations and an anti-corruption group. It is not known who leaked them, though they soon fanned national outrage at the Gupta family and at Mr. Zuma. The Guptas denied the authenticity of the emails, but some A.N.C. officials included in the correspondence confirmed that they were real.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one of the emails, Gupta companies paid one another for expenses at a relative\u2019s lavish four-day wedding in 2013, including fireworks, dancers, chocolates and scarves.\n\nIn another exchange, KPMG, then an auditor of the Gupta companies, ignored a junior employee\u2019s protest and allowed the Gupta family to write off some of the expenses at the wedding as business costs.\n\n\u201cI have never been to an event like that,\u201d Moses Kgosana, a KPMG executive who attended the wedding, gushed to a Gupta brother in one of the emails, calling it \u201can event of the millennium.\u201d\n\nThe accounting firm has since acknowledged that its actions \u201cfell well short of the quality expected.\u201d\n\nMany of the problems surrounding the dairy farm could have been ignored had the province not tried to tap into a national fund for struggling farmers. The national government initially agreed to give about $4 million to the project on the condition that the province submit, among other things, a list of 100 poor farmers who would benefit from the farm.\n\nWhen the government found no evidence that local farmers were involved, it sent National Treasury auditors to investigate in 2013.

And if she had somehow done all of that, there would still be some essential quality she lacked, in many people\u2019s minds, because we simply had no template for a female president.

In the final moments of Episode 1, it seemed very possible that the kidnapping was a hoax. (Paul places a sack over his own head as the men behind him wait, almost patiently.) The central line of inquiry in Episode 2 is whether the ploy was Paul\u2019s or he was really taken against his will.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Through a tip from a bellboy \u2014 whom Chace has a humorous relationship with, and plies with immense bribes \u2014 Chace finds his way to a man we see in the very first scene, in Paul\u2019s squat, watching porn and trying to have Paul\u2019s girlfriend and her twin sister raped. He turns out to run a restaurant, where Paul\u2019s paintings hang all over the walls \u2014 payment for meals when Paul didn\u2019t have money, the man tells Chace.\n\n\u201cHe owed a lot of people money around here,\u201d says the man. \u201cI tell you one thing, Mr. Texas, if I saw him now, I\u2019d kidnap the little bastard.\u201d But when Chace offers him the briefcase stuffed with money in exchange for Paul\u2019s return, the man\u2019s cronies ultimately refuse it, telling Chace they\u2019re out of \u201cstock\u201d (Paul). Chace is back to Square 1. The situation appears to be a little more complicated than a mafia kidnapping.\n\nChace eventually arrives at the same conclusion we\u2019ve seen hinted at by the abduction scene in Episode 1: He discovers that Paul has been writing a movie involving a faked kidnapping, likely inspired by a scene in the 1972 movie \u201cTravels With My Aunt,\u201d which Paul had recently watched. He combines this clue with some further fishy details (the ransom note was plopped directly on Paul\u2019s bed, not delivered to the police; the timeline between the ransom note\u2019s appearance and Paul\u2019s last sighting don\u2019t line up; Paul\u2019s girlfriend and her sister show a surprising lack of concern) and becomes convinced that Paul has fixed the whole thing.\n\nGail begs to differ. Her idealist son would not be capable of something like this. In a moment of desperation, before Chace leaves, she asks him what to do. \u201cWell, the good lord preaches forgiveness,\u201d he begins. \u201cBut what that boy done to his mama? I\u2019d whoop his ass.\u201d This is peak Chace: Very Texan, Christian, straight to the point, and hard not to like. For the time being, Gail has to continue the investigation on her own.\n\nIn the end, Chace morphs back into the omniscient narrator to close things out, reminding us what\u2019s at the root of this whole mess: money. \u201cTurns out a rich life is just as messed up as a poor life, just a different kind of messed up,\u201d he tells the camera.

Therein lies the value of this week\u2019s episode of \u201cTrust.\u201d\n\nUntil now, a lot of mystery surrounded the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty\u2019s grandson, John Paul Getty III. Did Paul orchestrate all of it, or some of it, in order to get his grandpa to cough up some money and to finagle his way out of trouble with the Italian mob? Or was it more complicated than that \u2014 so as to have placed Paul in real danger? This week\u2019s episode, titled \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d (mockingly, it will turn out), serves mostly as a pragmatic answer to these questions. And unlikely as it might seem, the answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nBut the episode\u2019s writer, Simon Beaufoy, and its director, Danny Boyle, make us work a little to figure that out. As they\u2019ve done from the first moments of the series \u2014 when we see an unexplained image of Paul\u2019s being chased through a field of sunflowers, his pursuer unknown \u2014 this episode hops and skips from one timeline to the next, retracing moments we\u2019ve already seen but from a different perspective, filling in bits of previously missing information along the way. So much of the sequencing is not chronological that it isn\u2019t until the very end that the full narrative picture coheres. Once we get there, the image of Paul among the sunflowers has context, and the reality behind it is more terrifying than one might have guessed.\n\nBecause so much of this episode is about looking back to give us answers to outstanding questions, here, in brief, are the CliffsNotes to the most important ones.\n\nWhy did Paul plan his own kidnapping?\n\nShort answer: Drugs and a woman.\n\nIn this episode, Paul says he never wanted, asked for, nor has any Getty money. Nonetheless, to everyone else in Rome, his name equals colossal sums of accessible cash. It turns out that Paul\u2019s girlfriend, her twin sister and their friend Marcello were using the Getty name (unbeknown to Paul, oddly) in order to purchase cocaine on credit and continue their freewheeling, squat-living existence. We know, however, that Paul has no money, and the cocaine dealers \u2014 who run their operation in the back of the restaurant where Paul often exchanged his paintings for a bite to eat \u2014 are getting antsy for the $6,000 they\u2019re owed.

To that end, Primo threatens his lawyer cousin (Niccol\u00f2 Senni) into becoming the negotiator. (For official business purposes, Primo gives him the code name Fifty.) Like most people, Fifty quakes in the mere presence of Primo.\n\nAgainst his will, Fifty takes Primo\u2019s marching orders and gets in touch with Paul\u2019s mom, Gail.

That image will prove to be enough to convince Getty Sr. that this might not be a hoax after all. But it is James Fletcher Chace \u2014 sharp and rational as ever \u2014 who gets him all the way there: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that, when people start getting killed, whatever it is, it\u2019s not a hoax anymore,\u201d he tells Getty (who had just been shown saying he would pay untold amounts of money to buy land from Native Americans for his oil endeavors).\n\nGetty lets out a sigh; he seems genuinely concerned. He sends Chace back to Rome and instructs him to open ransom negations \u2014 \u201cwith the right people this time,\u201d he adds, letting out a muted chuckle. (He is apparently not that concerned.)\n\nAs Primo awaits Getty\u2019s counteroffer, he buys the local bar a round of expensive drinks, anticipating his future riches. But then, Fifty shares Getty\u2019s official response: $600, plus expenses. It\u2019s the most money Getty can pay before it turns into extortion under Italian law. Getty is still the consummate business man, and as he points out to one of his girlfriends, he can load the expenses side of the ledger \u201clike a packhorse.\u201d That amount should be enough to privately satisfy the kidnappers and ensure that the Gettys are seen publicly not to pay ransoms, and thus stay invulnerable to future kidnappings. (To his credit, Getty at least thinks he has figured out a way not to get his grandson killed.)\n\nPrimo, meanwhile \u2014 perhaps because he doesn\u2019t know the law \u2014 can only fixate on the $600, not fully grasping how lucrative those expenses could be. He\u2019s done with this affair, he decides, and immediately reverts back to his psychopathic killer personality. He orders his translator, Angelo (Andrea Arcangeli), and his henchman to shoot and bury Paul, who, he says, better be dead by the time he returns with gas \u2014 presumably to burn the evidence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut at the very end, a twist: Throughout the episode, Primo\u2019s translator, Angelo, is shown having empathy for Paul \u2014 asking if he has a girlfriend, wondering what his life was like in California \u2014 and Paul opens up to him. Paul would introduce him to Mick Jagger, if he could; he\u2019d even have him in his wedding. So when Angelo is sent to fetch Paul for the execution, he decides to save Paul\u2019s life instead. \u201cHippy,\u201d he says to him, while his partner waits outside with a gun, \u201cwe need to get out of here.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the stage for another escape is set.\n\nSpare change:\n\nThere were some atypical, emotionally rich surprises in this episode. They\u2019re a little distracting from the main story, but they are entertaining, almost like Getty fan fiction:\n\n\u2022 Getty\u2019s Sutton Place gardener, Dennis (Jo Stone-Fewings), and Bullimore, Getty\u2019s dedicated servant, may be on the verge of an affair. Bullimore checks in on Dennis after Getty heartlessly releases his attack dogs on him, wondering if Dennis is gay. Dennis greets Bullimore at his door and invites him inside. Bullimore \u2014 a man who loves things arranged just so \u2014 is blown away by Dennis\u2019s plant-filled hide out. He relents to having a beer with him, and the chemistry ignites between them.\n\n\u2022 Getty\u2019s primarily girlfriend, Penelope (Anna Chancellor), is having an affair of her own, and Getty senses it. He makes mention, time and again throughout the episode, of how often she has been leaving Sutton Place for reasons she does not disclose. Again, we may be seeing real emotion from Getty (even if it takes the unimpressive form of jealousy) tucked somewhere beneath those cold layers.\n\n\u2022 Finally \u2014 the greatest shock of all \u2014 we learn Primo is scared of something: his uncle. When he shares news of his gift (Paul), he gets cocky about it. \u201cIf we\u2019re asking for peanuts,\u201d says Primo, \u201cI\u2019d rather do it alone.\u201d His uncle is outraged and slaps him, hard. \u201cYou dare to come here with a gift and take it away again?\u201d he asks. \u201cYour pardon, uncle,\u201d Primo says, twice.

In the final moments of the previous episode, we don\u2019t know if little Paul has survived Primo\u2019s raid at the peaceful farmhouse, when Primo shoots Angelo in the face, and we hear a second shot go off before the episode cuts to black. For about half of this episode, the Gettys believe that Paul Sr.\u2019s paltry counteroffer to the kidnappers\u2019 $17 million demand was a tragic miscalculation \u2014 that, for once, Getty\u2019s outsized confidence in his \u201cbusiness\u201d acumen has misled him, only this time the cost was not a barrel of oil but his grandson\u2019s life.\n\nBut then Gail confirms that she initially misidentified Angelo\u2019s half-charred corpse as her son\u2019s (the kidnappers had intentionally placed Paul\u2019s Converse sneakers onto Angelo\u2019s feet as a twisted negotiating tactic), and news reaches Sutton Place: Little Paul is still alive.\n\nUntil then, Getty had been uncharacteristically shaken. The one thing he had faith in \u2014 his instinct for business, more than he ever had for any person in his life \u2014 had been proven fallible. And for just a moment, we see how being wrong might have been good for him. He is visibly downtrodden and seems self-reflective. He even becomes vulnerable in front of his secretary, Robina (Charlotte Riley), revealing tearfully that his own mother never loved or accepted him as a replacement for his older sister, who died of typhoid fever. Deep inside, he, too, is just an underappreciated child.\n\nAnd little Paul had always made him laugh. \u201cNo one does that,\u201d he says to Robina, who offers him her hand in comfort. He accepts it and holds it to his face as he experiences a feeling of actual emotional loss. Maybe he has to rethink everything.", "title": "\u2018Trust\u2019 Season 1, Episode 6 Recap: A Dead Body Focuses the Mind", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "When Sara and Sadiq Juma arrived in Norway, Ayan was six and Leila three (the family also had three sons). Sara and Sadiq saw their daughters \u201cdabble in fundamentalism,\u201d as Seierstad puts it. They were taking Quran classes with a militant new teacher and begged to be allowed to wear niqabs. (\u201cYou both look like devils,\u201d their father said, forbidding them.) But they were otherwise tractable, polite \u2014 never in danger of becoming too Norwegian, Sara thought with satisfaction. Not that there was ever much risk of Norway embracing the girls that closely; their classmates either ignored or taunted them. Leila passed through school without making a single friend.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis is Seierstad\u2019s second investigation into radicalization. \u201cOne of Us\u201d (2015) told the story of Anders Behring Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, most of them teenage members of a left-wing political youth organization. He said he was protesting Muslim immigration and Norway\u2019s embrace of feminism. \u201cOne of Us\u201d is a masterpiece of reportage, design and empathy \u2014 it shivers with feeling. By so scrupulously showing us what happened \u2014 to Breivik, to Norway \u2014 Seierstad enables us to understand why, how the seeds of grotesque political violence can so often be traced to decidedly apolitical, deeply private personal humiliations.\n\nSeierstad seems to set herself the same task in \u201cTwo Sisters.\u201d \u201cFor me, the most important question was: How could this happen?,\u201d she writes. But then, she demurs: \u201cI offer no explanation, neither of what attracted them to Islamic radicalism nor what propelled them out of Norway. I relate my findings. It is up to each reader to draw his or her own conclusions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s a puzzling disclaimer, not least because any organization of facts, however simple, always requires \u2014 and reveals \u2014 an argument. And what we receive is, in fact, an elaborate narrative, full of explicit heroes and villains, written, she tells us, at the behest of the girls\u2019 father, Sadiq. \u201cI want people to recognize the danger signs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were blind. We thought it would pass. Now we know better.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

It explains the prickling feeling you might have while reading the book that information is being withheld, that Seierstad knows more than she\u2019s telling. Sadiq\u2019s influence over the text also explains why he is such an outsize figure in the narrative, and perhaps why his account is not subject to more scrutiny, given what an unreliable narrator he is \u2014 particularly, Seierstad shows us, where journalists are concerned.\n\nAt one point, Sadiq interested documentary filmmakers in his story, telling them his daughters had begged him to rescue them (untrue). When the man he hired to kidnap them back refused the job, Sadiq concocted a fantastic story \u2014 that the hired man was caught, crucified and beheaded. It was easier than admitting to the filmmakers that he had lost control of his daughters, that \u201che had failed as a father and as a man.\u201d This sort of thing \u2014 these lies to save face \u2014 occur with troubling frequency, and it\u2019s strange that Seierstad refrains from commenting on them, especially since her own book is built on Sadiq\u2019s testimony.\n\nSeierstad is at her best when she pans out to consider the variety of reasons Western women join ISIS (by 2013, there were 3,000 Westerners in Syria, several hundred of them women), drawn by a hunger for sisterhood, adventure and membership in a society they felt was colorblind \u2014 where shared allegiances were more important than race. She evokes the life they find in ISIS-controlled territory in Syria \u2014 where boys are taken from their parents at 10 and placed in camps to be trained in combat, their final test being an execution. She quotes message boards where women wrote about their new lives: the houses given to fighters for free; groceries and stipends delivered monthly; free medical care. The sisters boasted to their brother about their large house and garden, their pet rabbits. As Sadiq survived imprisonment in a fetid latrine, the daughters he was risking everything to save were making pancakes in Raqqa, with sugar topping.\n\nBut in general, the sisters and their transformations remain hazy, especially the strong-willed Ayan. At one point, her school essays sound like outtakes from \u201cSCUM Manifesto,\u201d by the radical feminist Valerie Solanas. In a piece entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Liberation,\u201d Ayan wrote: \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, we have to give birth to little rat males who we look after and hold dear, right up until they turn from boys into men who in turn go on to oppress yet another woman.\u201d And, yet, a few years later she defended the rape of Yazidi and Kurdish women by ISIS fighters: \u201cThey\u2019re not women,\u201d she told a friend. \u201cThey\u2019re spoils of war.\u201d\n\nIn her book \u201cThe Brothers,\u201d about the Boston bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Masha Gessen points out that religiosity has little to do with radicalization. Extremism more often follows crises in identity and in community, when other narratives of making sense of the self have fallen away. This is what becomes obvious every time the sisters in Seierstad\u2019s book flicker into focus, when their voices can be heard, unmediated. This story of theirs has yet to be told \u2014 despite the resonant clues they left along the way \u2014 and even as it promises to be repeated by others.\n\nAyan once wrote a fairy tale in school about \u201ctwo young girls who wanted to go out into the world and find themselves.\u201d \u201cAt home they had always got everything they wanted, attended the best school, worn the newest clothes, but had never been given the opportunity to decide anything for themselves, something young women strongly desire,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLate one summer evening, when their parents were not at home, they wrote a text message: \u2018Mom, Dad, we\u2019re going out for a while, don\u2019t wait up.\u2019\u201d", "title": "\u2018Two Sisters,\u2019 About Teenage Girls Who Left Norway to Fight With ISIS", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal", "Books Of The Times"]}

She walked into one of YouTube\u2019s parking garages, and then emerged into an outdoor courtyard where employees were eating lunch.\n\nEmergency officials arrived at YouTube\u2019s offices two minutes after the police received 911 calls about shots being fired. When they arrived, they found Ms. Aghdam dead. A 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, registered in her name, was found at the scene.\n\nBy Tuesday night, YouTube, as well as Instagram and Facebook, had taken down her pages and videos.\n\nEd Barberini, the chief of the San Bruno Police Department, said: \u201cAt this point in the investigation, it is believed that the suspect was upset at the policies and practices of YouTube.

{"date": "2018-04-22 00:00:00", "text": "They said Il Club dei 27 charges 350 euros a year in dues, about $430. That is far less than the Metropolitan Opera Club, whose subscribing members pay dues of $2,450 a year along with a \u201cseat charge\u201d of $2,950 for places in its block of box seats.\n\nBut there are opera fans who consider Il Club dei 27 more exclusive. Il Club dei 27 is limited to 27 people, 27 being the number of operas that members say Verdi wrote. Mr. Ventura compared getting into Il Club dei 27 to being elected pope: \u201cA member has to die before the next one gets in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last time that happened was in 2016, when the club got a new Il Trovatore. With quotation marks, that is the name of one of Verdi\u2019s best-known operas.\n\nFalstaff said the club\u2019s Don Carlo had the longest tenure, 44 years. Outside the club, he is known as Alberto Michelotti, a retired soccer star and referee. I Vespri Siciliani, without quotation marks, is a retired automobile mechanic, and I Masnadieri is a lawyer. Mr. Ventura, chuckling sardonically but saying not a word about lawyers or the legal system, noted that in English, the rarely performed \u201cI Masnadieri\u201d is \u201cThe Robbers.\u201d\n\nMr. Ventura also said that, as with so much else in opera, the number 27 is open to debate. Some Verdi fans, counting revisions, put the number in the low 30s.\n\nAnd the 27 includes a Verdi work that it seems safe to say most people would not count as an opera. The club\u2019s Messa da Requiem, a lawyer named Antonio Giovati, said he gets that all the time.\n\nHe stood next to Falstaff and Un Giorno di Regno at a rose ceremony at Verdi Square, at 73rd Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. Calling it a rose ceremony sounds like something from \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d What happened will never happen on that show.\n\nPhoto\n\nFirst the trio from the club placed roses \u2014 27, of course \u2014 on the statue of Verdi. Then they joined a crowd of about 50 people (alerted by emails from Mr. Ventura) in a shaky but emotional rendition of \u201cVa, pensiero\u201d from \u201cNabucco,\u201d the opera that made Verdi famous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike the members of Il Club dei 27, Mr. Ventura, 61, has had a long love affair with opera. It began when he was an architecture student at Cooper Union in the 1970s. \u201cI\u2019d see classmates stumbling in at 9 in the morning because they\u2019d seen the Ramones at CBGB,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stumbling in because I had seen Jon Vickers and Leonie Rysanek at the Met.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Ventura found his calling during \u201cRigoletto\u201d in Parma in 2009. \u201cParma takes its opera so seriously that singers are reluctant to sing there,\u201d Mr. Ventura said. \u201cIf you get one thing wrong, they boo you. But the reverse is true. If you get it right, they embrace you.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAt that performance of \u201cRigoletto,\u201d the baritone was booed and cheered at the same time \u2014 his fans cried \u201cbravo\u201d to drown out the hecklers, who booed all the louder. (Mr. Ventura said he had since become friends with the baritone who sang, whom he would not name: \u201cHe remembers he had a tough time.\u201d)\n\nSince then, Mr. Ventura\u2019s passion for Verdi has deepened. He said he was paraphrasing a book called \u201cVerdi With a Vengeance\u201d when he described Verdi\u2019s music as \u201cthe subtext of life.\u201d He said the author, William Berger, heard Verdi \u201cin every situation that life presents. I hear it in a co-op board meeting, I hear it when I\u2019m at a sale at Macy\u2019s, I heard the monk\u2019s chorus from \u2018Don Carlo\u2019 when I went to argue a parking ticket.\u201d\n\nThe usual urban soundtrack \u2014 car horns in the distance, rushed footsteps up close \u2014 was playing when Il Club dei 27 arrived at the Met for \u201cLuisa Miller.\u201d They were welcomed at the Metropolitan Opera Club by J. E. Raymond, a board member of the club and a co-chairman of its program committee. He spoke in English. \u201cMy Italian consists of menu Italian and a little opera Italian \u2014 \u2018maledizione\u2019 and \u2018vendetta,\u2019\u201d he said later.\n\nThe matter of the assigned names came up. Messa da Requiem wished he could have been Aida, and Un Giorno di Regno said he would not have chosen that name on his own. The opera \u201cUn Giorno di Regno,\u201d Verdi\u2019s second, bombed: It opened and closed on the same night in 1840. Un Giorno said that when he was finally admitted to the club and assigned the name, he had never seen \u201cUn Giorno.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very seldom performed,\u201d Mr. Ventura explained, translating for Un Giorno, who was saying that he would have preferred to be Rigoletto in the club, even though his favorite opera is \u201cLa Forza del Destino.\u201d The club\u2019s Forza is a dentist.\n\nMr. Ventura had cautioned that the club members can be tough critics before he summarized the reviews of \u201cLuisa Miller\u201d from Falstaff, Messa da Requiem and Un Giorno de Regno. \u201cWhen they say \u2018very, very good,\u2019 that\u2019s equivalent to us jumping up and down,\u201d Mr. Ventura said. \u201cI was wondering if they don\u2019t get performances that good in their own opera houses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next night, Mr. Ventura arranged an evening screening of an all-but-forgotten documentary from 1963. It followed a staging of \u201cLuisa Miller\u201d at the opera house in Parma.\n\nFalstaff and Messa da Requiem ducked out during Act I. Falstaff said they had tickets to the New York Philharmonic and did not want to be late. The Philharmonic was playing Bruckner and Mozart.\n\nWhat? They listen to music by other composers?\n\nOh, yes, Falstaff said. They have been to Salzburg for \u201cDie Frau ohne Schatten\u201d by Richard Strauss and to London and Munich for \u201cAndrea Ch\u00e9nier\u201d by Umberto Giordano.\n\nWell, then: Why the passion for Verdi?

Operation Dignity, as it was called, marked the start of Libya\u2019s civil war, inviting intervention by competing regional powers and spawning fissures that have yet to close.\n\nThough Washington kept him at a distance, some welcomed his campaign. After all, he\u2019d pitched it as a war on terrorists who killed Americans. That was true to an extent. When American special operations forces grabbed Ahmed Abu Khatala, the principal suspect in the attack, outside of Benghazi in June 2014, he was fleeing General Haftar\u2019s forces. But the battle lines were not as clear as they seemed. His operation forced more moderate Islamists who\u2019d supported the Libyan state to close ranks with radicals \u2014 a process that was already underway. He targeted some of the very militiamen who\u2019d helped the Americans the night of the attack.\n\nOne of them was Mr. Obeidi. His militia, Libya Shield, was among those attacked by General Haftar, and it ended up on the front lines with more extreme groups. As weapons and funds from outside the country tilted the war in General Haftar\u2019s favor, Mr. Obeidi fled Benghazi.\n\nWhen he met me for coffee one evening last summer he was dressed in a white prayer gown and wearing tinted wire glasses. He seemed to me then an emissary of Libya\u2019s morass and an emblem of the tangled loyalties that had confounded America\u2019s policy. Critics have accused the Americans of misplacing their trust in militiamen the night of the attack. But given the absence of any real police or army that night, militiamen like Mr. Obeidi were the only option. There was no black and white; only shades of gray.\n\nAmerican policy in Libya today is again confronted by shades of gray and a counterterrorism narrative that tends to flatten and obscure complexities. That narrative continues to be pushed by the aspiring strongman General Haftar, in his dealings with the Trump administration. It suffered a blow when General Haftar was hospitalized in France last week. In truth, his value as a counterterrorism partner was always limited: His military coalition has been weakened by tribal and factional fissures and his political ambitions made him a deeply polarizing. His disappearance from the scene would herald a new chapter of uncertainty in Libya \u2014 but also opportunities for renewed American diplomacy.\n\nThe diminished American engagement is felt across Libya, but especially in Benghazi, where people lament the tarring of their city\u2019s image with negative portrayals of violence and terrorism. They long for the return of the Americans and for the outreach that was the hallmark of Chris Stevens, the American ambassador killed that night.\n\nElsewhere across the country, Libyans who fled Benghazi have similar views. When I saw Mr. Obeidi, he pleaded with me for help. \u201cWe helped you and now you\u2019ve abandoned us,\u201d he said. And then, to underscore his point, he showed me a scan of a certificate that the Americans had given him shortly after the 2012 attack, signed by American diplomats:\n\n\u201cFathi went above and beyond in order to provide security and facilitate movement for the American Rescue forces sent to evacuate all U.S. personnel in Benghazi. Fathi was committed and professional in every way, he continually risked his life and the life of his men. \u2026\u201d", "title": "Opinion | \u2018We Helped You and Now You\u2019ve Abandoned Us\u2019", "authors": []}

By extending an olive branch, American officials said, North Korea is putting pressure on the United States to accept a deal before Mr. Kim agrees to give up North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\nMr. Kim could also be trying to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, since President Moon has put great emphasis on ending more than six decades of conflict on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Moon said Mr. Kim had made a similar gesture, saying the North no longer insisted on the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean Peninsula. But White House officials privately dismissed the remarks, saying removal of the troops was never on the table.\n\nCaution toward Mr. Kim\u2019s peace overtures also punctuated the reaction of officials from Japan, which North Korea has long threatened with missile strikes. The defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, who was visiting Washington when Mr. Kim announced the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, said the move was \u201cnot sufficient\u201d because it did not clearly state whether the suspension included the short and midrange missiles that could hit Japan.\n\nMr. Onodera also emphasized that a suspension was far short of denuclearization. \u201cWhat the international community expects is that North Korea abandon all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in a complete verifiable and irreversible manner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a time to relax pressure by the international community, but we must keep applying pressure with an aim that they abandon their nuclear weapons and missiles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a statement after a meeting of the Central Committee of his ruling Workers\u2019 Party, Mr. Kim said his country required no further nuclear and long-range missile tests because it had already achieved a nuclear deterrent. It was now time to focus on rebuilding the economy, he said.\n\n\u201cFrom April 21, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u201d the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Mr. Kim.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt also said the North would \u201cshut down a nuclear test site in the country\u2019s northern side to guarantee transparency in suspending nuclear tests.\u201d\n\nTo officials and analysts in South Korea, Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to shut down his country\u2019s only known nuclear test site, in Punggye-ri in northeastern North Korea, and his moratorium on long-range missile tests, are some of the \u201ctrust-building steps\u201d that they have hoped Mr. Kim would take to help improve the mood for dialogue in Washington.\n\nMr. Kim spent last year conducting a series of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, raising tensions and a risk of war with the United States. But he has initiated a dramatic about-face since January with a sequence of diplomatic maneuvers, including a summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing last month in his first trip abroad as leader, and his invitations to Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump for summit talks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some argue that Mr. Kim just wanted to use negotiations to buy time and ease international sanctions, never intending to abandon his nuclear weapons. But others say that Mr. Kim would eventually give up his nuclear arsenal if he were provided with the right incentives, such as security guarantees, like a peace treaty and normalized ties with Washington, and the economic aid he needs to rebuild his economy.\n\nHis latest announcement came one day after North and South Korea installed what officials said was the first-ever hotline between their top leaders, another sign of improving relations on the divided Korean Peninsula.\n\nMr. Moon was expected to use the hotline, which was installed in his office, to talk with Mr. Kim before the two leaders hold their summit meeting on the Korean border next Friday. But no date has been set for their first call.\n\nThe two Koreas have run a telephone hotline at the so-called truce village of Panmunjom \u2014 the site for the inter-Korean meeting \u2014 for years. Duty officers from both sides man their telephones at Panmunjom daily in case one side calls the other. The line has been cut off at times when bilateral relations have soured, but communications there have been restored.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the two countries have never run a direct hotline linking their top leaders\u2019 offices, officials said.\n\nThe hotline telephones were installed on Mr. Moon\u2019s desk in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, and in the State Affairs Commission in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital.\n\nWhen Mr. Moon\u2019s special envoys met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang last month, the two Koreas agreed to install the hotline and arrange for Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon to use the phone before their summit meeting. In the same meeting, Mr. Kim said he was willing to negotiate with the United States on abandoning his country\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\nPresident Trump recently dispatched the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, to meet with Mr. Kim to lay the groundwork for their meeting, which will be the first-ever summit meeting between the two nations.\n\nSouth Korean officials hope the hotline will improve communications between the top leaders and pave the way for improved ties between the two Koreas. The hotline could also be used to avert unintended armed clashes between the sides, they said.\n\n\u201cNow, if working-level talks are deadlocked and if our officials act like arrogant blockheads, President Moon can just call me directly and the problem will be promptly solved,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as telling the visiting South Korean envoys last month.\n\nOn Friday, aides to Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim officially opened the line and checked the connection for about four minutes, said Youn Kun-young, director for the government situation room at Mr. Moon\u2019s presidential Blue House.\n\nDuring the line check, a South Korean and a North Korean caller briefly discussed the weather, according to Mr. Moon\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe connection was very good,\u201d Mr. Youn said. \u201cIt was as if talking to a neighbor right next door.\u201d", "title": "\u2018We No Longer Need\u2019 Nuclear or Missile Tests, North Korean Leader Says", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun"]}

Even when \u201cthe reveries\u201d were causing hosts to deviate from their routines, we at least had those routines as a point of comparison, like the control group in an experiment.\n\nNow that Dolores, Maeve and the others are busting out into the open, the possibilities are exciting for them and for the show, but everyone has to live with uncertainty, too. Dolores expresses herself with tremendous confidence (\u201cI have one last role to play: myself\u201d), but even she contains a continuum of competing influences, with the optimistic Sweetwater prairie gal on one end and the mass-murdering \u201cWyatt\u201d on the other.

Now that they\u2019re awake, they\u2019re going to carry the weight of consequential decisions, on consciences that are still works in progress.

Delos appears to have some experience in corporate catastrophe: The funniest line of the episode has one company man calling it \u201cthe single biggest loss of life on a Delos property,\u201d suggesting that such massacres are part of doing business. Delos has dispatched its own mercenary army to quell the uprising, and it appears to have contingency plans in place for securing their valuable intellectual property in the event that something like this happens. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Delos\u2019s endgame for the hosts has nothing to do with theme parks, so this situation could be less devastating to the company\u2019s plans than it seems.\n\nFor a show as orderly and worked-out as \u201cWestworld,\u201d the \u201cNow what?\u201d feeling that pervades the Season 2 premiere feels invigorating, as if the show itself had wriggled free of its own narrative patterns. Dolores doesn\u2019t know what the role of \u201cherself\u201d really is at this point, and Maeve (Thandie Newton), fiendishly clever and deadly as she is, has lost herself in a quest to find a \u201cdaughter\u201d who is real only to her. The hosts have the capacity to learn quickly, but there\u2019s so much they don\u2019t know about their own world, much less the wider world that exists beyond Westworld\u2019s borders. They may find new limits in place of the old ones.\n\nParanoid Androids:\n\n\u2022 Maeve and Lee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman) are an inspired pairing.

{"date": "2018-04-29 00:00:00", "text": "The other key takeaway from the episode: Dolores has seen everything. There was reason to believe, as the season started, that the host revolt would be short-lived. Not only are the hosts hugely outnumbered, but we assume they don\u2019t know anything about the world outside the park, much less how they\u2019ll carve out a place for themselves in it. Over the multiple timelines in \u201cReunion,\u201d however, we see that Dolores has been absorbing information through multiple builds and an array of different experiences, some of them outside the park. In the opening scenes, as Bernard and (an offscreen) Ford are readying the androids for a demonstration for Delos, Dolores gets a clear view of the city. She even has some canned dialogue about how the city lights looks like \u201cthe stars have been scattered across the ground.\u201d\n\nThe pattern continues as the episode unfolds. Dolores witnesses the postcoital scene outside Logan\u2019s bedroom on the night of the demo, as Angela (Talulah Riley), the host who will later welcome William to the park, seals the deal. Dolores is frozen in her loop as William sells his father-in-law on the investment in Sweetwater, but the episode\u2019s director, Vincenzo Natali, makes certain to note her presence at the end of the conversation, unmoving but eyes open, listening. Dolores also appears in yet another timeline as the pianist at the father-in-law\u2019s retirement party, which doubles as William\u2019s \u201ccoronation\u201d as the head of the company. She listens to a drunk Logan bitterly predict the end of the species. And she turns up again behind the scenes with William, who unwittingly reveals the \u201cweapon\u201d she later intends to use against humanity.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of timelines. The William/Man in Black timelines in the first season now seem like training wheels that have been taken off. In \u201cReunion,\u201d only two story lines \u2014 one following Dolores, Teddy and company as they assemble an army and have a run-in with Maeve, the other following the Man in Black and Lorenzo as they start their search for the Door \u2014 take place in what we might call \u201cthe present,\u201d unfolding in continuity with the revolt that began at the end of last season.\n\nAll other story lines, meanwhile, exist somewhere along a continuum of staggered flashbacks: We see Arnold with an early version of Dolores. We see William before and after he convinces his father-in-law to invest. We see Logan as the confident master-of-the-universe type who\u2019s wowed by the demonstration and then later at the retirement party, as the broken man who anticipates human extinction. Some of these story lines do or might already overlap, and some or all of their respective timelines may converge or disappear. But it may be wise to invest in graph paper in order to follow along at home.\n\nParanoid Androids:\n\n\u2022 The first two episodes have been filled with callbacks in the dialogue, which could be defended as a reminder of the host\u2019s loops or derided as indulgent self-reference. But Bernard\u2019s line about getting used to the city lights (\u201cAfter a while, it doesn\u2019t look like anything at all\u201d) cleverly brings us back to Dolores\u2019s father glitching over a picture of the outside world. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anything at all\u201d is what hosts say when they don\u2019t understand something.

For starters, is fair to call it a reunion when it happens in flashbacks? More important: What, exactly, was their deal again?\n\nWe know that Dolores and William have history \u2014 a lot of history. But because the evolution of their relationship is presented out of sequence and across several timelines, it\u2019s hard sometimes to remember all the details: How did they fall in love? How did it sour? And why does it matter now? Let\u2019s backtrack.\n\nWhat was their story when they met?\n\nWestworld - Before He is \"The Man in Black\" Via YouTube\n\nWhen William first met Dolores, some thirty years before what we might loosely call the show\u2019s \u201cpresent,\u201d he was engaged to marry Juliet Delos. That\u2019s her photograph he lost in the park \u2014 taken in Times Square \u2014 which we\u2019ll come back to. And that\u2019s why William initially resisted the advances of both the greeter robot Angela and the prostitute host Clementine. (\u201cI have somebody, somebody real, waiting for me at home,\u201d William protested.)\n\nAnd Juliet was more than just his fianc\u00e9e: He worked for her father-in-law and her brother Logan. He\u2019s chivalrous to Dolores when they first meet in the Westworld town of Sweetwater \u2014 she drops a can, he helps by picking it up \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t smitten until she joined his first park adventure and he began to sense that she was different than the other hosts.\n\n0\n\nDolores at that time was struggling to remember her conversations with the rogue programmer Arnold, who had planted in her the now-germinating seeds of something like true human consciousness. What\u2019s more, alterations in her programming allowed her to recognize \u2014 if not completely understand \u2014 mentions of the real world, which the other hosts were programmed to ignore.\n\n\u201cI feel like she understands,\u201d William told Logan in one episode. \u201cShe remembers things,\u201d he also insisted later on. \u201cShe has her own thoughts and desires.\u201d\n\nThen what happened?\n\nWestworld Season 1 Episode 7 Dolores & William Kissing Train Scene Via YouTube\n\nWilliam began choosing to protect Dolores over Logan \u2014 and to prefer her company. (Granted, Logan was kind of a jerk). He wasn\u2019t so immersed in the park fantasy that he forgot the real world, or forgot that Dolores was a machine. Rather, when it seemed that she was able to circumvent her programming \u2014 \u201cI imagined a story where I didn\u2019t have to be the damsel\u201d \u2014 he was sold. He considered the ramifications of what it meant for a sentient being to be used as a plaything, or as a slave: \u201cTo keep her in a place like this, it isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThe first time they kissed, she took him by surprise. He told Dolores about his fianc\u00e9e \u2014 \u201cI have a life waiting for me\u201d \u2014 but he soon succumbed to his feelings for Dolores after she seemed hurt by this news. In the real world, he decided, he had been pretending; with Dolores, he was finally himself. Even when Logan forced him to confront her mechanical insides, William didn\u2019t want to let go of her. \u201cRun,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nWestWorld What Happened To William | William's True Identity Part 2 Via YouTube\n\nWilliam\u2019s search for Dolores took him to the outer fringes of the park, all the way to the edge, and he became increasingly violent in his methods along the way. He had imagined a story where he didn\u2019t have to be the hero \u2014 where he could be the intimidating figure no one thought he could be in real life. Eventually, he gave up his search and went back to Sweetwater, where he finally found Dolores, her memory seemingly wiped, back on her story loop, dropping her can in the street all over again. This shattered William, although he recognized that she was being \u201ctrue\u201d to her programming.\n\nWhen we see him again in Episode 2 of Season 2, William convinces James Delos to bail out and take over the park. In one scene, we see William and Juliet together at his father-in-law\u2019s retirement party, married, with an adorable daughter, Emily. Dolores is there as a glorified party prop, beautifully dressed, hair down, playing piano to entertain the guests. She seems to register \u2026 something. Does she remember? William certainly does.\n\nIn yet another scene, on yet another timeline, William seems to take a bitter satisfaction in assessing a stripped-naked Dolores as she sits in the diagnostics lab, and in showing her an area of the park that is under construction \u2014 pulling back the curtain on her reality, as it were.\n\nWhere does the Man in Black come into play?\n\nWestWorld What Happened To William | Man In Black True Identity Via YouTube\n\nA jaded William, eventually the majority shareholder, continued to visit the park for decades, using it to take out his frustrations, trying to complete the game somehow by uncovering every secret and every level its creators, Arnold and Dr. Ford, had built into it. Over time, William becomes the \u201cMan in Black\u201d; they are the same man on different timelines.\n\nAs we know from a story told by the Man in Black in Season 1, Williams relationship with his wife deteriorated over time. Juliet became afraid of him, and she died after swallowing some pills in the bath \u2014 an apparent suicide. On the trip he began in Season 1 when we first meet him as the Man in Black \u2014 the trip he began in order to find the \u201cnext level\u201d of the game; the trip he\u2019s still on in this week\u2019s episode \u2014 he raped Dolores, perhaps trying to punish her for disappointing him, for killing a part of him. (Who knows if it\u2019s the first or one of many rapes? She doesn\u2019t.)\n\n0\n\nSoon after, she starts reliving their very first encounter, when they fell in love. Dr. Ford helped kick-start the process by leaving the gun for her to find, and other events fall into place that help trigger her self-awareness. Peter Abernathy shows her the photo of Juliet in Times Square. He utters the code phrase, \u201cThese violent delights have violent ends\u201d (a quote from \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d as well as Arnold\u2019s last words). And then there\u2019s the rape. (Past suffering and trauma helps awaken the hosts.) She embarks on a journey to retrace her earlier trip through the Maze \u2014 in a sense, a search to find William again, or what he unlocked in her, just as he once searched for her, or what she unlocked in him.\n\nWho is Wyatt in all this?\n\nWestWorld Delores Goes Ozymandias On Man in Black Season Finale 1x10 Via YouTube\n\nWhen William encounters her the second time on that same visit, he\u2019s shocked that she has any memory of his younger self at all: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned, Dolores. You do remember some things after all.\u201d But just as William\u2019s disappointment back then helped him evolve (devolve?) into the Man in Black, her disappointment in the new black-hatted William \u2014 \u201cI thought you were different, you\u2019re just like all the rest\u201d \u2014 helps her recover her inner Wyatt, a murderous character Arnold fused with hers before he died, who grasps that she needs to destroy the way things are.\n\nNow, with clear eyes, and a fully-accessible memory bank, she\u2019s able to look back and call William \u201can old friend,\u201d a phrase he once used to refer to her.

Putin during his annual call-in show about the \u201cunbearable\u201d situation in their neighborhood, which stands 650 feet away from Kuchino, one of the largest landfill dumps in the region.\n\nMr. Putin, showing off his trademark Mr. Fix-It role, ordered the landfill closed. The government wanted to do so in 2021, allowing time to find and develop new locations to distribute Moscow\u2019s waste, but Mr. Putin was relentless.\n\n\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d Mr. Putin told Environment Minister Sergei Donskoy during a televised government meeting. \u201cClose this landfill within a month.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe landfill was closed, but the 1,000 or so truckloads of waste produced daily in Moscow had to go somewhere. The regional government distributed the extra waste among the few remaining landfills around Moscow, in some cases overwhelming their capacity. The one near Volokolamsk, in Yadrovo, has seen the lines of trucks in front of its gates increase by at least a quarter.\n\n\u201cIn the first half of 2017, I received 80,000 tons of waste; in the second half I had twice as much,\u201d said Maksim O. Konopko, one of the Yadrovo landfill\u2019s owners. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Kuchino, we would stay within our normal limits.\u201d\n\nIn a landfill dump, the incoming waste \u2014 most of it consisting of rotting food \u2014 is buried with soil. The waste then brews inside, producing biogas, a combination of methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other components. In the absence of a collection system, the accumulated gas eventually bursts through the soil and vents in large quantities into the surrounding area. The Yadrovo landfill does not have such a system, though the owner plans to install one with the help of a Dutch company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Konopko said that he wanted to restrict the volume of waste he was receiving, but that he was getting angry phone calls, pressuring him to take more.\n\n\u201cDo you know what country we live in?\u201d Mr. Konopko said, implying that these were orders he could not refuse.\n\nMr. Konopko denied accusations that he had a financial interest in handling as much garbage as he could, since he is paid about $2 per cubic meter, saying that the added revenues would be more than offset by the cost of the new gas reclamation system. Over all, the landfill representatives said they were just as much victims of this situation as anybody else.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He takes testosterone to compensate for the loss of his testes, and is being treated with another drug, Cialis, to encourage erectile function.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow many men might need this type of transplant is not known. Data from the Defense Department show that more than 1,300 men sustained so-called genitourinary injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that 31 percent of those injuries involved the penis.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the penile injuries were considered severe \u2014 but how many might warrant a transplant is not clear. Women in the military have also suffered genitourinary and reproductive injuries, but they are less common.\n\nTeams at Johns Hopkins and at the Massachusetts General Hospital are both evaluating more candidates for the surgery \u2014 some hurt in the military, others affected by accidents or illness. But it can take a long time to find a matching donor \u2014 the Johns Hopkins patient waited more than a year on the transplant list \u2014 so no rush of operations is expected.\n\nThe Department of Defense has funded some of the research, but Johns Hopkins is paying for the first operation, which Dr. Lee estimated would cost from $300,000 to $400,000. The surgeons \u2014 nine plastic and reconstructive surgeons, and two urologists \u2014 worked for free.\n\nDr. Lee said he hoped for grants from the Pentagon to help pay for future operations, and also for insurance coverage, which is not available now for this type of transplant.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the explosion that injured the soldier, he remained conscious, he remembered, but knew he was sinking into shock.

Redett, the director of pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins, about a procedure to create a penis from his own tissue, possibly the skin on the inside of the forearm.\n\nThat operation makes urination possible, but requires an implant to achieve an erection.

We are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you. As a family, we are very supportive of all the men and women who serve our country and grateful for the job you did for this nation.

Part of his role was to remove nine vertebrae from the donor, to provide stem cells that the Johns Hopkins team would infuse into the recipient to help prevent rejection and minimize the amount of anti-rejection medicine needed.\n\nThe patient said that before the surgery, he wondered if he would accept the new body parts, mentally and emotionally.\n\n\u201cWhat tripped me out at first is sometimes I would get a thought like, \u2018Am I going to be able to see it as my own?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat thought would creep in. But once I had it done, that\u2019s the only way I see it. It\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, he sketched out his hopes.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, to do well in school, to go to medical school and follow my career as a doctor, find my niche in the field and just excel at it.

And it ignored how many of those who did intend to come here would probably go through the legal process of requesting asylum at a border checkpoint \u2014 something miles of new wall and battalions of additional border patrol would not have stopped.\n\n\u201cThey end up in schools on Long Island, some of which are MS-13!\u201d declared Brian Kilmeade on the president\u2019s preferred morning news program, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d referring to the predominantly Central American gang.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe coverage became so distorted that it prompted a reporter for Breitbart News who covers border migration, Brandon Darby, to push back. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of right media cover this as \u2018people coming illegally\u2019 or as \u2018illegal aliens.\u2019 That is incorrect,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey are coming to a port of entry and requesting refugee status. That is legal.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Darby said it was regrettable that the relatively routine occurrence of migrant caravans \u2014 which organizers rely on as a safety-in-numbers precaution against the violence that can happen along the trek \u2014 was being politicized. \u201cThe caravan isn\u2019t something that\u2019s a unique event,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think people are looking at it wrong. If you\u2019re upset at the situation, it\u2019s easier to be mad at the migrant than it is to be mad at the political leaders on both sides who won\u2019t change the laws.\u201d\n\nAs tends to be the case in these stories, the humanitarian aspects get glossed over as migrants are collapsed into one maligned category: hostile foreign invaders.\n\nIn November, Mr. Trump touched off an international furor when he posted a series of videos on Twitter that purported to show the effects of mass Muslim migration in Europe. Initially circulated by a fringe ultranationalist in Britain who has railed against Islam, the videos included titles like \u201cMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\u201d \u201cMuslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!\u201d and \u201cIslamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe assailant in one video the president shared, however, was not a \u201cMuslim migrant.\u201d And the other two videos depicted four-year-old events with no explanation.\n\nThese items tend to metastasize irrespective of the facts, but contain powerful visual elements to which Mr. Trump is known to viscerally respond.\n\nLast February, Mr. Trump insinuated that some kind of terror-related episode involving Muslim immigrants had taken place in Sweden. \u201cWho would believe this? Sweden,\u201d he said at a rally in Florida, leaving Swedes and Americans baffled because nothing out of the ordinary had happened at all. \u201cThey took in large numbers. They\u2019re having problems like they never thought possible.\u201d\n\nLike the caravan story, which apparently came to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention as he watched \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the president was referring to something he had seen on cable news. And he later had to clarify that he was referring to a Fox News segment on issues Sweden was having with migrants generally, not any particular event.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Last year, the White House joined a pile-on by the conservative news media after it called attention to the account of a high school student in Montgomery County, Md., who said she was raped at school by two classmates, one of whom is an undocumented immigrant. The case became a national rallying cry on the right against permissive border policies and so-called sanctuary cities that treat undocumented immigrants more leniently. Fox News broadcast live outside the high school for days.\n\nProsecutors later dropped the charges after they said the evidence did not substantiate the girl\u2019s claims.\n\nThe story of the caravan has been similarly exaggerated. And the emotional outpouring from the right has been raw \u2014 that was the case on Fox this week when the TV host Tucker Carlson shouted \u201cYou hate America!\u201d at an immigrants rights activist after he defended the people marching through Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe facts of the caravan are not as straightforward as Mr. Trump or many conservative pundits have portrayed them. The story initially gained widespread attention after BuzzFeed News reported last week that more than 1,000 Central American migrants, mostly from Honduras, were making their way north toward the United States border. Yet the BuzzFeed article and other coverage pointed out that many in the group were planning to stay in Mexico.\n\nThat did not stop Mr. Trump from expressing dismay on Tuesday with a situation \u201cwhere you have thousands of people that decide to just walk into our country, and we don\u2019t have any laws that can protect it.\u201d\n\nThe use of disinformation in immigration debates is hardly unique to the United States. Misleading crime statistics, speculation about sinister plots to undermine national sovereignty and Russian propaganda have all played a role in stirring up anti-immigrant sentiment in places like Britain, Germany and Hungary. Some of the more fantastical theories have involved a socialist conspiracy to import left-leaning voters and a scheme by the Hungarian-born Jewish philanthropist George Soros to create a borderless Europe.\n\nAnyone watching Fox News this week would have heard about similar forces at work inside \u201cthe caravan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an organized plan and deliberate attack on the sovereignty of the United States by a special interest group,\u201d said David Ward, whom the network identified as a former agent for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cThey rallied a bunch of foreign nationals to come north into the United States to test our resolve.\u201d", "title": "\u2018You Hate America!\u2019: How the \u2018Caravan\u2019 Story Exploded on the Right", "authors": ["Jeremy W.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "The Trump presidency has sparked a debate about which voices are \u2014 and aren\u2019t \u2014 reflected in the national media. Many publications have been criticized for publishing too narrow a range of opinions. And several publications, including The Times, The Atlantic and The Washington Post, have recently made high-profile conservative hires.\n\nI recently asked Times readers for their thoughts on the issue: Which opinions are underrepresented in the national media? And which if any should remain underrepresented because they\u2019re beyond the pale of productive discourse?\n\nWe have received almost 1,000 responses, via email and social media. Here, we describe some common themes from those replies:\n\nThe national media should expand the boundaries of the debate \u2014 to both the right and left, among other ways.\n\nThis was perhaps the most common response. There should be more writing from both pro-Trump conservatives and Jacobin-level socialists, as one reader, Andrew Ross, put it \u2014 \u201ceven though\u201d (or maybe especially because) \u201celite readers may find their arguments objectionable.\u201d Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab, called for a better airing of the \u201cviews of people whose politics are more than one standard deviation from the national mean.\u201d A Twitter user named Rust Belt Jacobin summarized the missing as: \u201cLeftists; Trump supporters; Latinos; working-class people.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 Democratic primaries, for example, Bernie Sanders excited millions of people and won about 43 percent of the popular vote. Yet most national publications employed few if any opinion writers who preferred him over Hillary Clinton. Only a smattering of editorial boards endorsed Sanders: The San Francisco Examiner, The Seattle Times, The Daily Iowan and several alternative weeklies.", "title": "Opinion | \u2018You never see that point of view in mainstream press.\u2019", "authors": []}
