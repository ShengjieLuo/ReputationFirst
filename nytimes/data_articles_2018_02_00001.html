Lack of funding and technical expertise, poor governance, and corruption often hobble big infrastructure projects in developing countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd though geothermal is considered renewable energy, it does have pitfalls.

It is slowly splitting the African continent apart at the rate of several millimeters each year.\n\n\u201cRift settings have very high potential for geothermal,\u201d Mr. Suemnicht said. \u201cMost geothermal development occurs in tectonically active areas on Earth.\u201d\n\nKenya is by far Africa\u2019s geothermal leader, but nations such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Comoros have done preliminary exploration and Ethiopia generates about 7 megawatts of geothermal power.\n\nTapping geothermal energy is a long and expensive process that requires special expertise. From start to finish, it can take years from site-scouting to construction to connection to actually generating electricity \u2014 and revenue.\n\nTo find suitable spots for drilling steam wells, scientists do geological, geochemical and geophysical surveillance, a process that can take three months, said Xavier Musouye, a geologist with KenGen. When suitable spots are found and assessed, drilling begins using the kind of tall rigs commonly seen at oil wells. Except for periodic maintenance breaks, these drills pound into the earth 24 hours a day for nearly two months.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a new well site in Hell\u2019s Gate, the noise was deafening as gargantuan machinery pummeled the ground. The well will eventually reach a depth of almost two miles, joining the nearly 300 others already in place in the park.\n\nIt can cost about $6 million for a single well, and even with all the planning and testing there is still a risk of drilling an empty well. Two geothermal wells were explored in neighboring Rwanda but were unsuccessful, noted Dr. Meseret Zemedkun, energy program manager for the United Nations Environment Program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough it is a time-consuming process, there have been advancements to speed things along. KenGen recently started using a new kind of small power plant directly on the well head that can get up and running more quickly. These generate 7.5 megawatts compared with the large power stations that each generate 45, 105 and 140 megawatts.\n\nKenya, the first African country to tap geothermal power, began its programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s through funding primarily from the World Bank and guidance from the United Nations Development Program. But funders pulled out in the early 1990s amid government instability before returning toward the end of that decade.\n\nThe growth since then has been dramatic, and continues. KenGen is in the process of building a new 140-megawatt plant, financed by a $400 million loan from JICA, Japan\u2019s development agency, that is expected to start running by 2018.\n\nAlthough geothermal power has led to rapid expansion of electrical service here, there are environmental trade-offs. There is the conundrum of drilling in Hell\u2019s Gate, a 26-square-mile area that is one of the country\u2019s smaller parks but has been designated a Unesco world heritage site. Some environmentalists are critical of extracting geothermal energy here. They complain that pipes and power plants are environmentally disruptive and an eyesore.\n\nElizabeth Mwangi-Gachau, chief environmental officer for KenGen, said the company conducts environmental assessments and tries to mitigate impact. It considers wildlife migration and behavior in its development plans. Ms. Mwangi-Gachau added that KenGen has refrained from drilling in parts of Hell\u2019s Gate that would compromise the flora and fauna, even where there is major geothermal potential.\n\nMs. Zemedkun of U.N.E.P. pointed out that environmentally friendly geothermal projects have been developed around the world \u2014 even within national park areas, including in the United States, Italy, Iceland, New Zealand and Japan.\n\nAt Hell\u2019s Gate, the otherworldly network of geothermal pipes can be an attraction for some tourists. KenGen has even opened a geothermal spa, following the lead of an Icelandic power company that opened the Blue Lagoon spa, a signature attraction that uses water harnessed by a nearby geothermal power plant to warm its pools.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, groups of Kenyans basked in the spa\u2019s azure water. They weren\u2019t fazed by the sight of steel pipes at a nearby geothermal wellhead.

In some instances, cities found that the only way to ensure those standards were met involved banning certain vehicles \u2014 mostly older diesel models \u2014 from city streets.\n\nMr. Resch said he expected the first bans to be enacted in the fall in German cities where pollution levels are highest. Those cities include Stuttgart, home to Porsche and Mercedes, as well as D\u00fcsseldorf, both of which were directly involved in the case.\n\n\u201cLimited bans for certain diesel cars are within the law,\u201d the court said in its ruling, as one way to allow cities to meet the limits on the emissions of nitrogen oxide established by the European Union in 2010.\n\nThe court further found that when emissions exceeded the allowed limits, banning all vehicles with diesel motors older than those approved in 2014 and gasoline-burning engines older than those approved in 2001 was the only way for the municipal authorities to ensure air quality.\n\nIn 2016, a lower court in Stuttgart ruled in favor of Deutsche Umwelthilfe\u2019s argument that the only way to effectively reduce nitrogen oxide levels in urban areas was to keep off the streets those vehicles responsible for the pollution, most of them diesels.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg challenged the lower court\u2019s ruling, and a court in North Rhine-Westphalia urged a higher court to weigh in, arguing that only the federal government had the right to enforce the European Union standards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ruling allowing such bans \u2014 already popular among Germany\u2019s European neighbors \u2014 could open the floodgates, allowing for a raft of new measures in other cities across the country.

But environmental groups have argued that these have failed to sufficiently reduce pollution.\n\nAn alternative would be to retrofit some older vehicles, at a cost of 1,400 to 3,300 euros ($1,725 to $4,060), cutting diesel pollution by as much as 70 percent, according to Germany\u2019s auto safety group, ADAC.\n\nCustomers are already turning away from diesel technology. The latest figures show a drop of more than 17 percent in the number of diesel-burning cars registered in January compared with December. The figures reflect a trend established in the previous year, and the authorities fear they indicate a threat to the industry.\n\nLike Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich is also considering a ban.

For the past few months, The Times has published a series of stories about the increasing delays and malfunctions in the system, and the three decades of political decisions that have allowed for them. Brian Rosenthal, an investigative reporter, discovered tight relationships between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority labor unions and the governor and examined how bond issuance fees were funneling money to the state government even as budgetary constraints prompted routine maintenance cuts. Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter, dove deep into a signal system that dates to World War II and was never meant to handle 2018 traffic.\n\nThe Times\u2019s Enterprise video team, where I am a producer, works on narrative-driven, in-depth video projects tied to the paper\u2019s top news priorities.

The duplex space at 2 Spring Street is light-filled during the day. Bloody Marys are dark and tangy with Worcestershire sauce. Burnished French toast is crunchy and sweetly irresistible. Cacio e pepe, a nest of linguine dense with black pepper and Parmesan, is topped with a quivering egg cooked sous vide to be broken up and swirled around for a golden, richer note.

He will remain head of the Communist Party and the unofficial head of the military, the country\u2019s two most important institutions. When former authoritarian rulers retain control of key parts of the state, they are able to veto any potential democratic openings.\n\nMr. Castro\u2019s son and daughter will remain in powerful positions, as well. His son, Alejandro, is influential at the Ministry of the Interior, and his daughter, Mariela, is a member of the National Assembly and the head of Cuba\u2019s most important gender think tank, Cenesex. Alejandro is known for his love for efficiency, and Mariela for her love for L.G.B.T. causes. But neither is known for a love of liberal politics. The two devote a significant part of their time repressing (in the case of Alejandro) and belittling (in the case of Mariela) dissenters.\n\nBeyond the family itself is the fact that Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s most important policy legacy \u2014 military control of the economy \u2014 is hard to dislodge. The Cuban military, through its conglomerate Gaesa, owns the vast majority of firms that operate engaged in trade, from hotels to foreign exchange houses to ports, which gives it control of up to 60 percent of incoming hard currency. Any economic reformer knows that breaking a monopoly is difficult, even more so if the monopolist also holds power over arms and intelligence. Cuba\u2019s military is committed to not just one-party rule, but also, it seems, to one-firm economics.\n\nAnd because Cuba\u2019s economy is so closed, the private sector is small and weak. We know that transitions to democracy require actors with wealth to lobby the state for change \u2014 and perhaps bankroll the opposition. Under Fidel Castro, Cuba enforced one of the world\u2019s most draconian bans on private property, essentially foreclosing the possibility of this occurring. His brother did expand the number of allowable self-employed activities, but only professions requiring low skills were liberalized; huge restrictions on hiring and financing remain in place, and taxation is onerous. The private sector exists, but it is severely hampered.\n\nFinally, the triad of policies that have kept the regime afloat since the end of the Cold War \u2014 migration, repression and remittances \u2014 remain in place. Migration has long operated as a safety valve by moving the most disaffected dissenters off the island, and it has become easier now that the government no longer requires exit visas. Repression continues to be applied to the remaining dissenters with as much force as was the case before President Barack Obama restored diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nAnd remittances, averaging perhaps as much as $3 billion annually, are a vital lifeline for the Cuban economy. One would think that remittances could help democracy in Cuba by financing civil society. But because poverty is rampant and financing scarce, most remittances get used for household consumption or self-employment activities, with very little left over for the sorts of civic groups that are indispensable for democracy to emerge.\n\nAfter the succession, Cuba\u2019s regime will remain cornered by the Castro family, the military and by a regulatory system designed to restrict the growth of business and political organizations, minimizing the pressure to democratize.", "title": "Opinion | Goodbye Castros, Hello Communist Party", "authors": []}

It was a strangely warm February day, snow lingered amid the shoreline grasses and the bird peeked in and out of a drifting, intermittent fog. I was an excited young bird-watcher, and any bird was worth looking up in one of the three field guides I carried with me.\n\nI had been watching the duck as it joined a group of three or four others when it began behaving as if it were gagging. As he plunged his neck and chest into the water, he cocked his gaping, narrow bill up to the sky. This may or may not have impressed a mate, but it certainly impressed me. I was watching an ancient dance; a rite of spring. Unlike the chubby bufflehead ducks nearby, the mergansers were low-slung and long, and far more colorful. Turning to the page in the field guide where mergansers were illustrated, there was no mistaking that this was a male red-breasted.\n\nI was amused by its punk hairdo. With a dark green head of shimmering, ragged feathers, the male\u2019s profile reminded me of the artfully arranged mop of hair Robert Smith was popularizing a few years after I had become a duck enthusiast. Even the females sported this ragged look, but in warm brown. Back in the \u201980s, when there was no such thing as too much hair gel, this seemed like a salute to pop culture. In addition to their mod coifs, the males had blood-red eyes, which were visible even without binoculars. The overall impression was that of a shameless Lothario, dressed to kill.\n\nMergansers are long and lean for good reason: they are expert fish hunters. As a group, they propel themselves through the water using powerful legs with their webbed feet, generally making little or no use of their wings once underwater. Mergansers also have long, thin, specially adapted bills; these are sharp-edged and serrated, the better to capture and hold slippery, wriggling prey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith pointed wings, mergansers are equally adept in the air. There is some debate about whether this species is the fastest flying bird in level, powered, flight. With a peak speed estimated at about 80 miles per hour, perhaps it is sufficient to say, red-breasted mergansers are fast. There are few places to hide while flying over open expanses of water though, so good views of the bird in flight or at rest are not uncommon.\n\nOf the three species of merganser common to our area, the red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) makes the most use of saltwater environs and can frequently be found in the open ocean as well as in bays and inlets.", "title": "Goth of the Bay", "authors": ["Dave Taft"]}

For example, the state said that instead of passing five Regents exams, students could graduate by passing four of them and earning a credential that demonstrates they are qualified for entry-level employment.

Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I\u2019ve ever seen.

Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating.\n\nNeither is the Aviary, although it\u2019s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here.\n\nSunk a few steps below the hotel lobby and dominated by a view of the Central Park skyline, the space is an awkward combination of destination and waiting room. Achatz devotees who paid for their spots weeks earlier through Mr. Kokonas\u2019s reservations and guest-tracking service, Tock, may find themselves at curved leather lounge chairs next to hotel guests taking phone calls between meetings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere\u2019s no sense of arrival, nothing to suggest you\u2019re entering the domain of a restaurant group that has always refused to do things the usual way.\n\nYou do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary\u2019s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques.\n\nThe two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls \u201cdusty bottle cocktails.\u201d\n\nAs a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn\u2019t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It\u2019s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.)\n\nThe short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye.\n\nSteamed mussels in cream with leeks and bacon are $35. If any pot of mussels is worth that much money, this is it. Vegetable crudit\u00e9s may sound like nothing. They\u2019re very much something, a miniature forest of fruits and vegetables treated this way and that, then set on chipped ice with a dip \u2014 a harmonious, understated vadouvan-squash cream the last time I went.\n\nThe contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it?\n\nThe answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant. The cocktails at the Office are more like close-up card tricks. My favorite is: Mix me a drink and I\u2019ll make it disappear.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

It helps if the book is bursting with rich art and nuanced story lines, like these three new ones \u2014 all gems of the genre.\n\n\n\nIn BABY MONKEY, PRIVATE EYE (Scholastic, $16.99, ages 4 to 8), Brian Selznick and David Serlin explore a format similar to Selznick\u2019s groundbreaking novels like \u201cThe Invention of Hugo Cabret\u201d and \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which played with the interaction of words and pictures. \u201cBaby Monkey\u201d is heavily illustrated and has minimal text that is simple and repetitive, perfect for new readers ready for a \u201cbig kid\u201d book. It\u2019s small in dimension but hefty at 192 pages, with chapters, a hilarious index and a faux bibliography.\n\nThe story begins in cinematic fashion, almost like a movie trailer: \u201cWho is Baby Monkey? He is a baby. He is a monkey. He has a job.\u201d It\u2019s a nice setup for the lighthearted story and (pardon the pun) monkeyshines to follow. Selznick\u2019s black-and-white illustrations lend a gritty film noir feel \u2014 a delightful contrast with the adorableness of Baby Monkey. Over five chapters, Baby Monkey solves five different mysteries, after taking care of necessities like napping, snacking, note-taking and something really tough \u2014 like putting his pants on. The final mystery is sweet and satisfying, and as in Selznick\u2019s previous books, the illustrations are a marvel. The details in Baby Monkey\u2019s office change with each mystery; a key at the end invites you to go back and study the illustrations.\n\nSara Varon (\u201cRobot Dreams,\u201d \u201cBake Sale\u201d) is a master at creating endearing, uncommon narratives, and her latest, NEW SHOES (First Second, $17.99, ages 6 to 10) is no exception. The story is told simply, with clean lines, a gentle palette and straightforward language. But the reader is also asked to confront surprisingly sophisticated topics, and the result is a book as charming as it is unexpected.\n\nFrancis, a calypso-music loving donkey, is a shoemaker in a South American village. Francis receives the assignment of a lifetime: making a pair of shoes for his favorite singer, Miss Manatee. When his supplier fails to bring the necessary tiger grass, Francis must venture into the jungle. There, he encounters ethical challenges like the finite resources of tropical jungles and the need to see beyond our own experiences when meeting someone unlike ourselves. Ultimately Francis must rethink everything about making shoes \u2014 a veritable existential crisis, but Varon is never heavy-handed or didactic, keeping the narrative at the fore.\n\nMo Willems\u2019s Elephant & Piggie books are heavy hitters of the early reader genre, and in the new Elephant & Piggie Like Reading! series, the two stars show up in books by other authors. The latest is IT\u2019S SHOE TIME (Disney-Hyperion, $9.99, ages 4 to 8) by Bryan Collier (\u201cHey Black Child,\u201d \u201cBetween the Lines\u201d), an exuberantly funny and surprisingly touching tale about what it means to be a pair.\n\nIt\u2019s Daddy-and-Me Day, and our young protagonist must pick the right shoes for the big occasion. Her shoes clamor for attention with ridiculous puns, but the closet is thrown into a frenzy when she picks out two shoes that are not a matching set. The shoes left behind by their mates set off to convince the girl that the pairing is wrong. When the shoes catch up, they see the girl\u2019s father, too, wearing mismatched shoes.

It will examine whether the politicians took kickbacks from the pharmaceutical company Novartis, or were aware of illicit payments.\n\nThe list of people to be investigated is dominated by the Greek political elite: It includes two former prime ministers, Antonis Samaras and Panagiotis Pikramenos; the current central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras; and the European Union commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos.\n\nA report sent to Parliament this month by Greek prosecutors said there was evidence to suggest that Novartis had made payments to Greek doctors and politicians in exchange for fixing the prices of its medicines at artificially high levels and increasing its access to the Greek market.", "title": "Greece Approves Bribery Investigation Involving Political Elite", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "The historical region of Macedonia was carved up after the Balkan wars early last century, after decades of fighting among Turks, Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians. Just over half of the territory became part of Greece, while the rest went mainly to Serbia and Bulgaria.\n\nThe ancient Macedonians \u2014 of whom Alexander the Great was the most famous \u2014 were a Greek tribe. Alexander lived in the fourth century B.C., some 900 years before Slavic tribes settled in the region. In the nationalistic fervor of the 19th and 20th centuries, Slavs who identified themselves as ethnic Macedonians pressed for a separate state, with Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, as its capital. Greek anger at their appropriation of the name, history and symbols of the ancient kingdom and fears of a renewed threat to its territory resurfaced as Yugoslavia disintegrated in the early 1990s.\n\nThese fears may seem absurd, but they are not irrational. From 1941 to 1944, Bulgaria, allied with the Nazis, occupied part of northern Greece, including part of Macedonia. In the civil war that followed World War II, Greek Communists fought for an autonomous Macedonia that would have included the Greek province.\n\nMore recently, the previous government in Skopje carried out acts of cultural appropriation, erecting statues of Alexander (but called, coyly, \u201cEquestrian Warrior\u201d) and his father, Philip. In 2006, the capital\u2019s airport was named Alexander the Great \u2014 a decision that the present government just decided to rescind officially.\n\nStill, both countries seemed content with the stalemate, as long as Skopje was gaining international recognition and Athens did not have to sell a compromise to voters. But the new government in Skopje is renewing the country\u2019s push to join the European Union and NATO, and both organizations believe that this will help stabilize the western Balkans. A European Union summit meeting in June and a NATO summit meeting in July of next year had been seen in both Skopje and Athens as deadlines for a deal, and last week the United Nations mediator Matthew Nimetz was shuttling between the two capitals.\n\nAny notion that quiet diplomacy would lead to a compromise, however, was dispelled by noisy declarations from the junior partner of Greece\u2019s government: Panos Kammenos, the leader of the Independent Greeks, said he would reject any deal that included the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d in any form. He has recently said that while he will not bring down the government, he will not back down on rejecting a compromise \u2014 raising the question of whether Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will dare to back a compromise.\n\nThe odd coupling of the radical left-wing Syriza party and the nationalist right-wing Independent Greeks was based on their common opposition to the bailout agreements, despite their incompatible views on other issues. Syriza is the heir of a tradition of leftist parties that did not have a problem with recognizing a neighboring \u201cMacedonia.\u201d Mr. Kammenos, though, will lose all legitimacy if he compromised.\n\nDrawing from a similar deep well of populism and suspicion of foreigners\u2019 intentions as the one that brought this coalition government to power, groups opposed to any compromise organized the mass rallies in Thessaloniki on Jan. 21 and in Athens last Sunday. These brought together hard-line nationalists, Orthodox Church faithful and various factions opposed to the current government and its policies.", "title": "Opinion | Greece\u2019s Macedonian Touchstone", "authors": []}

Enormous supply creates enormous abuse.\n\nThat\u2019s the lesson we should take from our gun scourge as well.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that each gunman procured these weapons legally, but that our supply is so immense that finding a gun \u2014 legally or not \u2014 is easy.

Yet when guns, or opioids, are accessible in plentiful supply to everyone, without much monitoring of consumers\u2019 backgrounds, and are then mixed with the isolation and disconnection in American culture today, havoc results.\n\nThe end to our opioid addiction epidemic, I believe, will come from a symphony of small solutions, many of them unsexy: expanding treatment options, using jails as recovery centers, creating syringe exchanges, broadening the use of Narcan and widening the curriculums in medical schools to include pain and addiction studies. Law enforcement\u2019s role is crucial. Recovering addicts need supply reduced. The supply of opioids on our streets is so vast and potent that when a recovering addict relapses, the result is often death. Insurance companies, meanwhile, need to reimburse for non-opioid pain treatment, as they once did. Up to now, we\u2019ve lowered pain pill prescribing but without raising the numbers of pain strategies available for chronic-pain patients, and for which doctors are trained. Those patients thus turn to the black market for pills, but also for heroin and fentanyl, the supply of which is booming.\n\nAll this, in other words, is a community approach to a plague feeding on our isolation.\n\nMass murder calls for the same.\n\nRestoring the ban on assault rifles is essential, as is banning gun ownership among people convicted of domestic abuse, those with domestic abuse restraining orders, and the mentally ill.

Those who do seem to pick up microbes in childhood, where they simply become part of the diverse mass of bacteria in the intestinal tract \u2014 the so-called microbiome.\n\nFor most who carry them, it is not clear the bacteria would ever be a problem, said Dr. Eric Pamer, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\nThe bacteria seem to be able to induce colon cancer, or to take precancerous cells and drive them faster toward cancer, said Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of Johns Hopkins\u2019s Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and an author of the new paper.\n\n\u201cBacteria are there at the very earliest stages,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Meyerson, director of cancer genomics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \u201cThis is a big step forward in understanding what is the role of the microbiome in colon cancer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Dr. Cynthia Sears, an infectious disease specialist at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute, did not expect to be investigating colon cancer.\n\nShe and her colleagues were looking at a toxin that is produced by B. fragilis. It was a familiar poison, a common cause of diarrhea.\n\nIn petri dishes, however, the toxin damages DNA and triggers cancerous changes in the epithelial cells that give rise to colon cancer. When the investigators put these toxin-secreting bacteria into mice, the animals\u2019 colons became spotted with tumors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Most of the time, however, the polyps never progress and remain harmless.\n\nBut if a polyp develops a few more mutations, cancer can begin to develop. So to protect patients, doctors remove any polyps they find during a colonoscopy.\n\nPeople with F.A.P. can have hundreds of polyps, their colons lined with growths. It is impossible for doctors to take them all out; instead, they may remove the patient\u2019s entire colon.\n\nDr. Sears and her group examined six whole colons lined with polyps that had been removed from people with F.A.P. The researchers discovered biofilms \u2014 sheets of bacteria that had invaded the mucus covering the colons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the biofilms were made up of just two species of bacteria, B. fragilis and a strain of E. coli. In samples of colon tissue from healthy people, only a few had these bacteria.\n\nThe researcher also examined 25 tumor samples taken from people with F.A.P. \u2014 and found the two bacterial species again.\n\nThen the team tried a mouse experiment, giving the animals a cancer-causing agent to elicit changes in the DNA of colon cells and then infecting them with one or the other of the bacteria. There were few or no tumors.\n\nBut when the researchers infected the animals with both types of bacteria, tumor growth took off.\n\nThe results might help explain why people with F.A.P., even individuals in the same family, can develop colon cancer at very different ages: patients who get the disease early may be carrying these two bacterial species.\n\nNow Dr. Sears is trying to find out whether the bacteria always, or sometimes, are drivers of colon cancer in the general population.\n\nWorking with nearby community medical practices, she is examining colon tissue from every patient having a colonoscopy. She hopes to review 2,000 pathology samples.\n\nBut, she and others warn, it is premature to think of using the current results to protect people from cancer. \u201cYou could try to eliminate the bugs,\u201d Dr. Jobin said. \u201cThat is easy to say, but hard to do. Antibiotics will probably do more damage than good.\u201d\n\nThe drugs kill a wide variety of bacteria in gut, he added, many of which are needed for health.\n\nThe bacteria described in the new study are not the first implicated in colon cancer. Researchers have discovered a different type, fusobacteria, in more advanced colon cancer. In a recent study they reported that fusobacteria had burrowed into tumors and stayed with them as they spread throughout the body.", "title": "Gut Microbes Combine to Cause Colon Cancer, Study Suggests", "authors": ["Gina Kolata"]}
{"date": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "text": "Driven to find underlying causes of diseases that were being treated for symptoms, and funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, he successively developed five models of his original \u201cbeautiful idea.\u201d Along the way he won many prestigious awards, some for essentially the same insights recognized later by the Nobel committee.\n\nIt was all terribly complicated. As Dr. Blobel liked to tell ordinary people, \u201cTo greatly simplify \u2026\u201d\n\nTo greatly simplify, Dr. Blobel built on the work of his Rockefeller University mentor, Dr. George E. Palade, a pioneer in using electron microscopes; Dr. Palade shared the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as the award is formally called.\n\nDr. Palade\u2019s discoveries about cells\u2019 inner workings, and the functions of cell structures, laid the foundations of modern cell biology, the basis of the biotechnology industry.\n\nDr. Blobel, who joined Dr. Palade\u2019s laboratory in 1967, inherited from his scientific forebears the knowledge that each living cell \u2014 about one quadrillion of them in an adult human body \u2014 contains a billion protein molecules that are constantly being created inside tiny bladder-like cavities called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is encased in a protective membrane.\n\nThe mystery Dr. Blobel confronted was how cells control their internal traffic, so that large proteins can get through tightly sealed membranes surrounding their birthplace and then travel to sites within the cell, or even through cell walls on intercellular trips through the body, where they can find specific worksites, called organelles (little organs) and penetrate them to perform assigned tasks.\n\nIn 1971, Dr. Blobel and a colleague, Dr. David D. Sabatini, who later headed cell biology studies at the New York University School of Medicine, proposed a bold idea known as the \u201csignal hypothesis.\u201d It suggested that each protein carries in its structure a sequence of signals comparable to address tags on airport luggage or ZIP codes on mail to ensure that it all arrives safely.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe signals, Dr. Blobel found, are chains of amino acids created by protein-making machines that read distinctive RNA codes and then fix them on each new batch.\n\nLike transmitters, these signals order receptors in membranes to open up watery holes so that proteins can pass through. They then act as GPS devices to cross the crowded terrain of a cell or a human body and, like finding a mailbox across the universe, penetrate precisely the right worksite organelle for each protein\u2019s assigned task.\n\nProteins have many tasks: rebuilding or replacing constantly dying cells, protecting against viruses and bacteria, regulating body chemistry, reading DNA to make new molecules, releasing hormones to signal and repair tissues and organs, carrying and binding atoms throughout the body, and many other functions.\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite proteins\u2019 variety and complexity, however, Dr. Blobel demonstrated that their signaling system for getting through barriers and finding their worksites is universal, operating similarly in all animals, plants and even common yeasts.\n\nMoreover, he found, this signaling system has evidently been working quite smoothly for millions of years, since the evolution of the first cell. Mistakes can be catastrophic to an organism, but they are relatively rare.\n\n\u201cG\u00fcnter Blobel\u2019s discovery has had an immense impact on modern cell biological research,\u201d the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said in announcing the prize on Oct. 11, 1999. \u201cFurthermore, knowledge about the topogenic signals has increased our understanding of many medically important mechanisms.\u201d\n\nG\u00fcnter Blobel was born on May 21, 1936, in the Silesian village of Waltersdorf, then in eastern Germany and later part of Poland. He was one of eight children of Bruno and Margaret Blobel. His father was a veterinarian. The boy and his siblings attended local schools, and in their remote village the family, by his account, was bypassed by World War II until its closing months.\n\n\u201cUntil then my childhood was a perfect 19th-century idyll,\u201d he wrote in an autobiographical sketch for \u201cLes Prix Nobel\u201d (2000). \u201cIn the cold and snow-rich Silesian winters there were hourlong rides on Sundays in horse-drawn sleighs to my maternal grandparents\u2019 farm to have lunch and spend the afternoons. The house was a magnificent 18th-century manor with a great hall that was decorated with hunting trophies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late January 1945, the family fled in a car from the advancing Red Army, heading west to seek refuge with relatives in Saxony. Passing through Dresden, G\u00fcnter, 8, was struck by indelible impressions of the city\u2019s \u201cmany spires and the magnificent cupola of the Frauenkirche\u201d (an 18th-century Lutheran church with one of the largest domes in Europe) and \u201cthe many palaces, happily decorated with cherubs and other symbols of the Baroque era.\u201d\n\nDays later, on Feb. 13, Dr. Blobel recalled: \u201cWe saw from a distance of about 30 kilometers a fire-lit, red night sky reflecting the raging firestorm that destroyed this great jewel of a city in one of the most catastrophic bombing attacks of World War II. It was a very sad and unforgettable day for me.\u201d\n\nAs chaos engulfed the crumbling Third Reich, the family was split up among relatives in various villages. After the war, the Blobels settled in Freiberg, in Soviet-occupied East Germany. G\u00fcnter graduated from high school there in 1954, but, refusing to join a Communist youth group, he was labeled \u201ca member of the capitalist classes\u201d and barred from universities.\n\nCrossing to West Germany, he studied medicine in Frankfurt, Kiel and Munich and earned his medical degree at the University of Tubingen in 1960. After two years as a hospital intern in Germany, he decided that medicine was merely treating symptoms and that to get at underlying causes he must devote himself to research.\n\nAt the time, his brother Hans was on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin on a Fulbright Scholarship. Hans urged him to move to Madison for advanced courses to enhance his chances for a career in medical research. Dr. Blobel did so, and earned a doctorate in oncology at Wisconsin in 1967.\n\nHe then joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Palade. He moved steadily up the ladder of Rockefeller University, as assistant professor of cell biology in 1969, associate professor in 1973 and full professor in 1976. Since 1992, he had held the John D. Rockefeller Jr. professorship. He wrote many scientific articles and never retired.\n\nIn 1976, he married Laura Maioglio, the owner of Barbetta, a Manhattan theater-district restaurant founded by her family in 1906. The couple, who had no children, kept homes in Manhattan and Fubine, Italy.\n\nHe is survived by his wife; three brothers, Hans, Reiner and Albrecht; and two sisters, Sigrid Mack and Ingeborg Cosack.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTall, gentle and white-haired, Dr. Blobel, who became a naturalized American around 1980, won a score of awards, including the 1987 Horwitz Prize for biochemistry from Columbia University and the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1993. Both cited his work on cellular proteins, and explicitly noted the ZIP code analogy mentioned in his later Nobel citation.\n\nAfter winning the prize, he told Medical Tribune, a publication for doctors, that his work would lead to medical and pharmaceutical innovations in treating leukemia, schizophrenia, AIDS, cystic fibrosis and many other conditions. \u201cIt will impact on every disease, essentially, because all diseases have a molecular-cellular basis,\u201d he said.\n\nHe donated the Nobel\u2019s $960,000 stipend to Friends of Dresden, a group he founded in 1994 to help restore the city\u2019s architectural legacy, particularly the Frauenkirche, which was lost in the Allied bombing, and a synagogue to replace one destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.\n\nThe gifts were made in memory of his sister, Ruth, who at 19 was killed in an air raid near the end of the war.", "title": "G\u00fcnter Blobel, Nobel Laureate Who Found Cell \u2018ZIP Codes,\u2019 Dies at 81", "authors": ["Robert D.

Social media played a part in the ripple effect, continuing to spread the message and to shift the conversation away from those famous women to the rest of us. And the rest of us are key to this. The #MeToo movement has sustained because sexual assault and harassment is a universal experience.\n\nWhile debating sexual harassment legislation in Parliament this week, some of the legislators expressed concern that the #MeToo movement might flame out as rapidly as it rose up.

He said the department was not currently negotiating with any private citizen for a donation, and that a new embassy building would take seven to 10 years to construct.\n\nIt was not clear whether private donors had ever helped with the financial costs to build an American embassy.

He has financed the newspaper Israel Hayom in an apparent attempt to help Mr. Netanyahu come to power and remain there.\n\nIsrael Hayom began publishing in 2007, when Mr. Netanyahu was still the leader of the opposition, and has deeply cut into the advertising base and readership of its main competitor, Yedioth Ahronoth, which has often been sharply critical of Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Adelson\u2019s offer to help fund a new embassy may have more to do with his staunchly pro-Israel stance and his relationship with Mr. Trump than his ties with Mr. Netanyahu. Those relations may have cooled as a result of the Israeli police\u2019s corruption investigations into Mr. Netanyahu, one of which directly involves his actions in the newspaper rivalry.\n\nMr. Netanyahu was recorded in meetings negotiating mutual benefits with an old foe, Arnon Mozes, who is the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth. The prime minister is accused of offering to help Yedioth Ahronoth financially in return for more positive coverage \u2014 including by curtailing the circulation of Israel Hayom, and limiting its weekend supplement.\n\nMr. Adelson has been questioned at least once by the Israeli authorities in connection with the case. The police have recommended charging Mr. Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nWhile Israelis warmly welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, analysts said the embassy move in May was unlikely to improve Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fortunes in the long term. In interviews, many Israelis said they had not even realized that the Americans did not consider Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Klein, of the Zionist Organization of America, described Mr. Adelson as \u201cvery excited\u201d when he was first told by Mr. Trump that the embassy would be moved to Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cIt is a critically important issue to Sheldon Adelson,\u201d Mr. Klein said in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe Arnona building where the temporary American Embassy will be housed, and the land adjacent to it, roughly straddles the seam between West Jerusalem, where mostly Israelis live, and East Jerusalem, which is a largely Arab community. That would make it ideal for serving both Israeli and Palestinian populations, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nThe United States has an option to purchase land adjacent to the Arnona building, a parcel that is big enough to handle an embassy, Mr. Kennedy said. Leases now in effect are likely to delay the transfer of the property until at least 2020, he said.\n\nEmbassies can cost anywhere from $150 million to nearly $1 billion to build. The one in Jerusalem is likely to cost somewhere in the middle of that range \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 because it does not need the housing, warehouse or security functions of some of the most expensive buildings, such as those in Baghdad and Kabul, Mr. Kennedy said.\n\nSome staff members at the American Embassy could remain in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s business center.", "title": "Hard-Line Supporter of Israel Offers to Pay for U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem", "authors": ["Gardiner Harris", "Isabel Kershner"]}

Louis, Whitaker writes, \u201cdrilled a right into the German\u2019s jaw and a second into his midsection.

And no reporter was more significant in this respect than Wendell Smith.\n\nAll during the grueling period when Robinson was breaking the color barrier in the major leagues, Smith was his companion, helping him deal with the daily slights and indignities.

Third, the stock market is not the economy.\n\nSo the market plunge of the past few days might mean nothing at all.\n\nOn one side, don\u2019t assume that there was a good reason for the slide (although the fact that the Dow fell 666 points on Friday hints either at satanic forces or at some mystical link with the Kushner family\u2019s bum investment at 666 Fifth Avenue). When stocks crashed in 1987, the economist Robert Shiller carried out a real-time survey of investor motivations; it turned out that the crash was essentially a pure self-fulfilling panic.

The science had to be rigged, he thought; those who believed in it were just tree-huggers. But in 2002, a friend convinced Mr. Cizik to go to a conference about climate change, and there, he said, \u201cthe scales came off my eyes.\u201d Nearly 70 percent of Americans now say that climate change is caused mainly by human activity, the highest percentage since Gallup began tracking it two decades ago. The number of Americans who say they worry \u201ca great deal\u201d about climate change has risen by about 20 percentage points. But people don\u2019t change their minds easily about controversial issues. So what is behind this trend? Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said Americans\u2019 opinions about global warming have fluctuated over the years, shifting along with partisan fissures, extreme weather events and messages from political and religious figures. But the overall upward trend in opinion, he said, was strongly tied to the fact that more people are beginning to relate to climate change as a personal issue. There are certainly many Americans who remain undecided or doubtful. Toby Wilder, a salesman from Seattle, said he found it hard to imagine that human-caused climate change was anything but a hoax propagated by elites who fly private jets. \u201cIf they are wasting more fuel in a month than I do in my lifetime, then how can I believe it?\u201d he asked. Greg Sandmeyer, a social studies teacher at Timberline High School in Boise, Idaho, is also unconvinced. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s another to make laws that will affect me,\u201d he said.

Belief in statistics.\u2019\u201d And if anyone enjoys a statistic, it\u2019s men.\n\nBut as intrigued as I am by philosophical and woo-woo causes of disease, my own theories about the Man Flu have always tended toward the biological. (I\u2019m not technically a doctor, but I\u2019ve spent enough time in quiet study on WebMD\u2019s Symptom Checker website to have developed as sophisticated an understanding of immunology as the medical elitists who demand \u201cdegrees\u201d and \u201ccredentials\u201d and \u201cempirical evidence.\u201d) Until I started researching the question, my theory went something like this: Men are, on average, physically stronger than women; as a man, my immune system must also be stronger. The colds and flu strains strong enough to defeat my ripped-as-hell-six-pack of an immune system must be real doozies (to use the medical term). If my body is Rome, it\u2019s going to take a Visigoth army of a flu to sack it, and it\u2019s going to be looted and pillaged for days.\n\nBut as it turns out, my body is less like a fortified imperial city and more like an oddly shaped and somewhat muddy field, easily entered and occupied by armies of basically any size. Several recent studies indicate that women\u2019s immune systems are generally stronger than men\u2019s, thanks (it\u2019s theorized) to differences in how estrogen and testosterone regulate inflammation and the production of antibodies. A recent survey of related literature in the British Medical Journal notes that some data indicates that men are more likely to be hospitalized from the flu \u2014 and more likely to die.", "title": "Have You Heard?

With his magnetically reticent personality, he moved with ease through the overlapping countercultural spheres that comprised the downtown avant-garde, from Judson Dance Theater to the Warhol Factory and the nascent gay movement. He was around for the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. And when, in its wake, his then-lover, Jim Fouratt, became a founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Hujar contributed to the cause the only way he knew how, with a photograph \u2014 of GLF members staging a protest march for his camera. It remains one of the signature images of the time.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Hujar himself had no interest in activist politics. By this point, he was 35 years old, struggling professionally, cash-poor, but rich in downtown connections. The world he cared about was the one he could view, edit, speak to and shade through his camera. And in the \u201970s and early \u201980s, that\u2019s what he did by initiating his own personal golden age of portraiture.\n\nA few of his portraits of famous figures \u2014 the singer Peggy Lee, for example \u2014 may have been a product of freelance assignments. Most others were self-assigned. Some were of high-profile personalities like Susan Sontag. But the fame of most of his sitters extended little farther than a few blocks downtown. Occasionally he would shoot \u201con location,\u201d as he did in the case of the Warhol transgender superstar Candy Darling (born James Lawrence Slattery), who, dying of cancer at 29, vamped for him in her hospital bed. But generally, people came to his Second Avenue studio.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey included such protean theater figures as Charles Ludlam and Robert Wilson; the poets John Ashbery and Anne Waldman; critics like Vince Aletti and Fran Lebowitz, who were also close personal friends; and drag performers like Jackie Curtis and later \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 the endlessly versatile Ethyl Eichelberger. Hujar referred to his favored sitters as people who were \u201cchic, but in a dark kind of way.\u201d Whatever their darkness, he made them glow with sumptuous black-and-white chiaroscuro. And he made even the edgiest figures \u2014 a man tying his limbs into knots, a woman locked in a body cast \u2014 look relax and softened.\n\nTo create this effect, he used a technique that could easily have been lifted from therapy. He asked many of his 1970s portrait subjects, male and female, clothed and nude, to pose lying down on his bed, where they seem to be drifting toward asleep, or just waking up, or lost in post-coital trance. And nowhere is a sense of tenderness and vulnerability more evident than in Hujar\u2019s photographs of animals that he encountered in the wild or on farms belonging to friends.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe would slowly approach cows or sheep or birds, talking softly, conversationally, calming them into stillness. He seems to have regarded the animal portraits \u2014 along with his several portraits, early and late, of children \u2014 as, in some sense, self-portraits. They certainly feel like images understood from the inside: emblems of innocence threatened. Yet more than even the most composed of his human subjects, Hujar\u2019s animals seem self-controlled and self-contained. They have the inviolate dignity of bodhisattvas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA few of these photographs, along with several of the prone human portraits, appeared side by side in the only book Hujar published in his lifetime, \u201cPortraits in Life and Death,\u201d which arrived, with an introduction by Sontag, in 1976. And intermingled with those pictures were some of his shots of corpses from the Palermo catacombs. The book got a mixed reception. Some people hated it. They thought the combination of living and dead, human and animal, was perverse and grotesque. I loved it, still do.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt demonstrates that each of Hujar\u2019s photographs is a stand-alone object, masterfully conceived and printed, complete in itself. Yet the work overall is the product of a single complex, difficult sensibility. It shares a pervasive and insistent atmosphere of otherness, and \u2014 this comes through only gradually \u2014 a spirit of level-eyed fortitude in the face of damage. (The same point is made in the show, organized by the Morgan\u2019s curator of photographs, Joel Smith, which replicates the book-like, edge-to-edge hanging of 70 disparate pictures in vertical pairs that Hujar created for his 1986 solo show at Gracie Mansion Gallery.)\n\nAnd damage did come, with the emergence of AIDS. Many of the people in Hujar\u2019s photographs \u2014 Eichelberger, Ludlam and Wojnarowicz lead a long list \u2014 died as a result of the disease, which makes the show itself a portrait in life and death. Hujar, who remained little known to the art world at large while the reputations of near-contemporaries like Robert Mapplethorpe soared \u2014 received his diagnosis in 1986. He put down his camera in despair and never worked again. He died a year later, at 53.\n\nIn a way, the Morgan has picked up the thread of his art for him. Its exhibition catalog, with essays by Philip Gefter, Steve Turtell and Mr. Smith, gives the first full account of his life. And the museum itself has acquired a substantial chunk of his work \u2014 more than 100 lifetime prints and thousands of contact sheets \u2014 for its permanent collection. In the process, a venerable institution has refreshed itself, and a resistantly singular artist has become the Classic he always was and will always be.", "title": "He Made Them Glow: A Maverick\u2019s Portraits Live On", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "One of the biggest challenges is helping patients access quality mental-health services and counseling both for the addiction issues and the almost always present untreated mental-health issues. The opioid addiction is never the only problem. But mental-health care, especially for those on Medicaid, is challenging to access. Hours are too often limited to days, when people are at work (and many of my patients can\u2019t afford the unpaid time off that may lead to job termination). The other challenge is funding. Mental-health care and medical care for addiction is expensive. Medications that prevent withdrawal symptoms and block the high (or do one or the other) are excellent for tools for reducing the chance of relapse, but at an out-of-pocket cost of $500 to $700 per month, it is too expensive for many patients. Patients can end up buried under mountains of debt simply because they were responsible and sought treatment for their addiction. Medicaid does a bit better, but when patients bounce off of Medicaid because of a slight increase in income, it can put patients\u2019 sobriety in peril because their benefits for counseling, doctor visits and medication suddenly vanish until, again, that deductible is met. And access to mental-health care can be a serious challenge for Medicaid patients. Sarah Butler, Physician Assistant (Certified), Livonia, Mich.\n\nOur system perpetuates the problem. Patients expect that they will get prescribed opioids because in large part they will. If they don\u2019t, they might respond poorly to the question, \u201cWas your pain well-managed in the hospital?\u201d on patient satisfaction surveys. Reimbursement is in part based on the results of these surveys. They dominate our every interaction with patients. I recently broke a bone and both in the E.R. and in the M.D. office, was offered opioids as a first-line pain medication. I declined, aware that alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and icing and elevating were better, evidence-based options for acute pain like a broken bone.

As many publications have noted, when the addiction epidemic was concentrated in brown and black communities, it was a law enforcement problem. Now that addiction has moved to the suburbs, it is a public health issue, as it always should have been. Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disease. Many have done bad things as a consequence of their addiction, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are irredeemable. We have known for quite some time now that addiction changes the brains of those who fall to its prey. We need to do a better job at using pharmacotherapies to treat addiction. Diabetics take medicines to address the changes of their disease process, yet in some treatment centers want addicts to go \u201ccold turkey\u201d or accuse them of \u201cswitching one addiction for another.\u201d Shannon Dingle, Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, Bronx\n\nThe misconception about opioid use is the belief that it\u2019s a choice. There has been so much research that links opioid addiction with attachment disorder. So you have people who have suffered from poor parental bonding getting hooked on opioids often at the hands of the medical community; they go to jail, lose their jobs, children, freedom, and when they get out they can\u2019t get jobs, they have no emotional support and they blame themselves for their vulnerability. Why wouldn\u2019t they? The rest of the world blames them. No wonder they go back to using drugs. Addicts need love, support, connection. That\u2019s why they got addicted in the first place \u2014 not having these things. We need to have compassion. And, we need to understand and respect addiction more generally. Dr. Rebecca Jones, Dermatologist, Brattleboro, Vt.\n\nBurning Out\n\nThe emotional tollf required to take care of certain patients has overwhelmed some health care workers.\n\nI started as a therapist treating women in a major city, and over the course of a 10-year career wound up running multiple state-funded women\u2019s residential addiction programs there, with the purest of intentions to provide help for what I know to be mostly traumatized women. I got burned out and left my job about a year and a half ago because I couldn\u2019t deal with addicts anymore. They turn treatment on its head \u2014 it becomes a sort of \u201cgame on\u201d when they enter programs and proceed to break every rule, in a giant game of distraction, which invariably leads back to relapse. It\u2019s an exhausting and grim business treating addicts because one can\u2019t help but conclude in the end that most of them don\u2019t really want to change. It\u2019s been heart-wrenching for me to become so disillusioned with the whole thing. Name Withheld, Licensed Mental Health Counselor, Brooklyn\n\nI am a doctor, with a brother who was a heroin addict for 10 years. With my help, he got clean twice, both times by leaving the country for a while and getting out of his environment. However, he never admitted that he was an addict, never went to rehab and never changed his addictlike sociopathic behavior. We have not had a relationship for a very long time, and we never will again. I know it is not politically correct to say this, but opioids, narcotics, meth and all these drugs change people in very substantial ways, and it\u2019s a minority who are ever truly rehabilitated. I think we should put our medical efforts into the patients we may truly be able to help. Being an addict can be a choice, and they will get better only if they are really ready to. Meanwhile, I, personally, will not allow them to waste my time. Name Withheld, OB-GYN, New York\n\nRecovery Is Possible\n\nBut as rampant as opioid addiction has become, there have been stories of hope too.\n\nThe biggest misconception about opioid abuse is that folks cannot get better. I saw with intensive outpatient treatment over a year with Suboxone that miracles do happen. I saw folks get better and become productive members of society. I saw them turn around and give back to other addicts. I saw their families heal with them. But the investment of resources is significant. They also need continuing care for many years \u2014 less frequent treatment but they still need to attend groups at least once a week sometimes for years and continue on their Suboxone.

Now we\u2019re down to less than one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. \u201cThe estate tax is hanging on by a thread.\u201d\n\nAccording to IRS figures, 12,411 estates filed Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, for 2016. Of those filers, fewer than half \u2014 5,219 estates \u2014 owed anything, paying $18.3 billion on assets of $108 billion, for an effective tax rate of 17 percent. Even among estates valued at more than $50 million, 133 managed to avoid paying any estate tax.\n\nIf the new exemption had been in place that year, it would have trimmed those estate-tax bills by an amount between $2.3 billion and $6.2 billion. No more than 2,204 estates would have exceeded the individual $10 million baseline exemption in 2016. And under the new $20 million baseline exclusion for married filers, the tax would have hit just 911 estates.\n\nBesides the generous exemption, the estate tax always has provided another big benefit to inheritors: Those assets are passed on at their market value at the time of death. This allows stocks, real estate and other holdings that may have appreciated to be sold with no tax ever paid on those gains.\n\nThat\u2019s the prime reason that anyone with an estate valued between the old and new exemption limits needs to consider rewriting his or her plans to bring the maximum amount of assets back into the estate. The problem is that one vehicle that\u2019s often used is an irrevocable trust, which, as the name implies, isn\u2019t easily reversed.\n\n\u201cEvery estate planner has a handful of files where we now want to bring those assets back into the estate to get that step-up in basis, but it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Mr. Jenney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to petition the probate court, show that circumstances have changed, go to court and terminate the trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother time bomb in older estate plans could lurk in trusts that move assets out of the estate to future generations, called generation-skipping transfers. These transfers are taxed in coordination with the estate tax and gift tax and count toward the estate tax exemption amount. Often, those trusts use a formula that automatically removes the maximum exemption amount from the estate and places that money in the trust, said Melissa Langa, managing partner of Bove & Langa in Boston.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The new tax law eliminated the allowance for tax preparation fees.\n\nBut it\u2019s the sunset provision of the new law that creates the most potential problems, according to estate planners, many of whom are unimpressed with the hasty, late-December tax-law rewrite.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky it\u2019s as tame as it is, because the legislation is just idiotic,\u201d said James Spica, an estate tax specialist with Dickinson Wright in Detroit. \u201cI don\u2019t think there even was a handful of people working on it who understand how it works.\u201d\n\nMr. Spica pointed out that the estate of a spouse who died under the older, lower exemption would benefit if the surviving spouse died between now and the end of 2025. Estates of any amount pass untaxed to a spouse and are taxed only after the surviving spouse dies. So even if the first spouse died when the estate exemption was $11 million for a couple, that estate enjoys a $22 million exemption \u2014 but only if the surviving spouse dies before Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, someone who dies today under the $22 million exemption could see that allowance cut in half if the surviving spouse passes away in 2026, when the exemption drops back to the earlier limit.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get half the benefit if the second spouse dies outside this new regime,\u201d Mr. Spica said.\n\nAnother issue Congress left hanging concerns how to handle gift taxes after the higher exemption expires. Because the tax on large gifts works in concert with the estate tax, the estate of someone who gives away more than the lower exemption could be hit with a \u201cclaw back\u201d tax bill for several million dollars when the law reverts to the lower limit, said James Blase of Blase & Associates in St. Louis.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you make a very large gift before 2026 and die afterward, there\u2019s absolutely no law,\u201d Mr. Blase said. \u201cCongress left it totally up to the I.R.S. to issue regulations, and that\u2019s a big deal. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe one place where estate-tax certainty does exist is within the very wealthiest families, who continue to face a 40 percent maximum tax rate on their estates.\n\n\u201cFor the uber-wealthy, a $5 million change in the exemption doesn\u2019t really make a difference,\u201d Ms. Langa said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing for people in the $10 million to $20 million range, but if you\u2019re in the $200 million range, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\u201d", "title": "Heirs Inherit Uncertainty With New Estate Tax", "authors": ["Brian J.

It was one way of staying connected to Israel. My mom had been a folk dancer, semiprofessionally. We went to weekly gatherings at the JCC [Jewish Community Center], and when we moved to Hawaii, joined another gathering there.\n\nVideo\n\nWhat inspired this piece?\n\nBefore this piece I made a solo that was returning to the dances in a more emotional way; it was more about my relationship to them. I talked at the time about making these dances and songs face the Nakba, which is what Palestinians call the founding of the state of Israel. [Nakba is the Arabic word for \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d] How could I hold onto my heritage and also this other reality? I wasn\u2019t really looking at how the dances were constructed. This piece came out of wanting to investigate that more deeply.\n\nI knew the dances were an integral part of this Zionist enterprise, and you could see that in a liberatory way or see some of the colonial mechanisms in it. I was looking for a way to communicate that.\n\nOne issue you explore is cultural appropriation, how the pioneers of Israeli folk dance, mostly Eastern European women, drew from social dance forms like Palestinian dabke.\n\nIt\u2019s well-documented that these women went to Palestinian villages and watched them dancing and felt they held the steps for what new Israeli dances could be. And so they borrowed steps and wrote new music and created dances that were directly synchronous to the new music, and in this way it becomes a new Israeli dance.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis was their way of participating in the nation-building and what for them was this revolutionary moment. I don\u2019t think that cultural exchange is bad, but I think it\u2019s about the context of whose narratives get told and seen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou also look at the popularity of Israeli folk dance among Christian Zionists. Did you know about this phenomenon before starting your research?\n\nOur family friends are Christian Zionists, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise. But I figured out it was much larger in scope than I realized. I was looking for videos of basic steps being taught, and the first websites to pop up were almost always Christian.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "It started years earlier, the older woman told her. Almost every night, she would get these crazy fevers. First came bone-rattling, shaking chills; she couldn\u2019t get warm even under a pile of quilts. Then suddenly she would be roasting hot, with sweat pouring off her. Her temperature would spike to 102 or 103. And her whole body would hurt, right down to her bones. She popped Tylenol constantly just to keep her fever down.\n\nThen an hour after the fever hit, she would start to feel sick and throw up until she had nothing left in her. This happened almost every night.\n\nDuring the day, she felt weak and tired, and her bones hurt. It made any movement painful. Her doctors called it fibromyalgia. She also had a rash. Hives, the doctors told her. It didn\u2019t itch, but no one could figure out why she had it. And, her daughters added, she had no appetite. The very thought of food made her want to vomit, the older woman told May. She\u2019d lost over 80 pounds this past year.\n\nA Deep Dive Into the Records\n\nMay could see how the patient\u2019s clothes, eyes and even skin looked a couple of sizes too large. Otherwise her exam was uninformative. She didn\u2019t have a fever, and she didn\u2019t have a rash. May told the patient she would go through the stack of records and come up with a plan.\n\nReviewing them, May saw that the patient had a persistently elevated white-blood-cell count. Normal is under 10; the patient\u2019s was at nearly 20 \u2014 and had been for a couple of years. CT scans showed enlarged lymph nodes throughout her body. These findings could be from a chronic infection. Or from a cancer. But her hometown doctors found neither.\n\nPhoto\n\nOverlooked Possibilities\n\nMay decided to think about illnesses that her first doctors hadn\u2019t tested for. The woman needed to be checked for H.I.V.; patients over 55 are thought to make up a quarter of all cases \u2014 diagnosed and undiagnosed \u2014 and they are much less likely to be tested for it. Another possibility was syphilis, called the great imitator for its variable presentation. And given her persistent gastrointestinal problems, May would look for celiac disease. She also sent off a test to look for a type of blood cancer called multiple myeloma, which attacks the blood and bones and is seen in patients over 50.\n\nMay waited anxiously as the results came back. It wasn\u2019t H.I.V. It wasn\u2019t syphilis or celiac disease. The patient didn\u2019t have multiple myeloma either, though that test, which measures levels of one part of the immune system known as antibodies, was abnormal; one antibody, known as IgM, was high. May referred the patient to an infectious-disease specialist, who found no infection. The oncologist found no cancer. And the dermatologist merely confirmed what May already knew \u2014 the patient had hives, and it wasn\u2019t clear why. She presented her puzzling patient to every smart doctor she knew when she walked down the hospital hallway and at educational conferences. Yet after seven months of testing and referring and discussing, May was no closer to a diagnosis than she was on Day 1.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One afternoon she was surprised to see an 11-page note from a pathology resident who, as far as she knew, was not involved in the case. It was a meticulous summary of all the patient\u2019s symptoms as well as the many tests performed so far. He went on to suggest that she had a disease May had never heard of \u2014 Schnitzler syndrome. It was, as the resident described it, a rare and poorly understood immune disorder.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Schnitzler syndrome, according to current thinking, the most primitive part of the immune system \u2014 a type of white blood cell known as the macrophage \u2014 goes wild and instructs the body to act as if it is infected. The body responds with fever and chills, a loss of appetite, flulike body aches, hives and high levels of one specific type of antibody: IgM. Exactly why and how this occurs is still unknown.\n\nThe disorder was first described in 1972 by the French dermatologist Liliane Schnitzler, who subsequently identified five patients with hives, episodes of prolonged fever, bone pain and enlarged lymph nodes. These symptoms, plus an elevated level of IgM, Schnitzler proposed, defined a new disease.\n\nCurious About Unsolved Cases\n\nMay didn\u2019t know the resident who proposed the diagnosis, Dr. Forest Huls, but she\u2019d heard of him. Huls, although still in training, had a reputation for finding cases that stumped others and figuring out the diagnosis. \u201cWhen I see people suffering and I know that if I took the time and effort, I could figure it out,\u201d he told me, \u201cthen I have to do something.\u201d He looks for unexplained pathological findings \u2014 in this case, the high level of IgM.\n\nHuls hadn\u2019t heard of Schnitzler syndrome, either. He came upon it by using the database PubMed to look for a disease that matched the patient\u2019s symptoms. He made a list of her symptoms and abnormalities. To get the full picture, he combed through her earlier electronic medical records, now archived in an old electronic warehouse, and found that her symptoms had started maybe a decade earlier. Then he looked for a disease that fit. It took hours before articles on this strange disorder began to appear. As he read, he suspected that she had it.\n\nMaking the Case\n\nAfter reading Huls\u2019s note, May looked up Schnitzler syndrome. Doctors\u2019 descriptions of patients with the disorder matched her patient exactly.\n\nIt was an important diagnosis to make, in part because there is now a very effective treatment. When the woman\u2019s insurance company refused to pay for the new and very expensive drug, May appealed to the manufacturer, which agreed, after several months, to provide it. Once she started taking it, the shaking chills and fever disappeared. So did the nausea and vomiting, the hives and bone pain.\n\nLooking back at her life with this illness, the patient can barely recognize herself. Before her illness, she\u2019d prided herself on her get-up-and-go and her disinclination to sit still. All those years stuck on the sofa and ultimately in bed, too sick, too weak and in too much pain to move, seemed like a chapter in someone else\u2019s life.\n\nAs for Huls, he is finishing up his fellowship at the hospital this summer. Wherever he ends up, he is certain he will find new cases to challenge his curiosity, cases he hopes to solve.", "title": "Her Various Symptoms Seemed Unrelated.

Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied the challenges facing small and rural water utilities.\n\nHe noted that this research suggests one possible strategy for improving water quality in rural areas: States might provide aid to help smaller water utilities merge and consolidate into larger systems that are better able to comply with complex safety rules. California has been exploring such an approach.\n\nDr. Allaire and her co-authors also found that water systems that serve minority and low-income communities were more likely to violate federal standards around coliform bacteria, which frequently accompany disease-causing pathogens. Their research also showed that privately owned utilities had fewer violations than publicly owned utilities, and that larger water systems tended to have fewer violations than smaller systems.\n\nThe whole point of tracing these patterns, Dr. Allaire said, was to help policymakers understand which parts of the United States might require additional scrutiny or assistance in meeting national water quality standards. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have no systematic way to identify problems and set priorities.\u201d\n\nThis new study may understate the full extent of problems with the nation\u2019s drinking water systems, said Kristi Pullen Fedinick, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that conducted its own nationwide survey of Safe Drinking Water Act violations last year.\n\nState governments are largely responsible for implementing federal water-quality standards, and the quality of monitoring and enforcement can vary significantly. Some states have cut back on budgets for their drinking water programs, and many communities focus on tracking just a handful of key contaminants like coliform or disinfectant byproducts. That means potential violations involving other contaminants, like lead, may go underreported.\n\n\u201cOn a national scale, we know that there\u2019s a huge amount of underreporting,\u201d Dr. Fedinick said.\n\nIn recent years, the E.P.A. and Justice Department have often been reluctant to penalize states or municipalities that fall behind on enforcement or reporting.

Recent efforts to quantify the inequality among Bitcoin holders have found that it is significantly higher than in even the most stratified countries, which may sting many people who recently rushed into virtual currencies and are now sitting on losses.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor early virtual currency adopters like the people on the Forbes list, the recent price declines are not catastrophic. The price of Bitcoin is still up 600 percent from a year ago, and up 70,000 percent from when the Winklevoss twins began buying in 2012.\n\nIdentifying the richest people in the secretive and paranoid virtual currency realm is far from easy; some of it is guesswork. Mr. Lubin, whom Forbes pegged as the second-wealthiest person in the virtual currency universe, illustrates the difficulties. He told the magazine that he had begun selling his Ethereum tokens, known as Ether, last year to fund his business, ConsenSys. Because Forbes could not verify his holdings, the magazine put his wealth at between $1 billion and $5 billion before the most recent price declines.\n\nThe New York Times Explains...\n\nThe normal Forbes billionaires list is easier to compile because the richest people in the world generally have most of their wealth tied up in stock holdings, which usually have to be disclosed for big public companies. With virtual currencies, it is not necessary to disclose your identity, and the system was created by people who were interested in protecting financial privacy.\n\nMany large holders of virtual currencies are loath to acknowledge their holdings for privacy and security reasons, and many people who are rumored to have giant Bitcoin stockpiles are not on the Forbes list.\n\nPerhaps the most notable omission is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, whose identity has been guessed at many times but never confirmed. Researchers have guessed that Satoshi, as the creator is known, most likely amassed about one million Bitcoins during the network\u2019s first year, when few other people were mining new tokens. Those Bitcoins would now be worth around $7 billion.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers have publicly claimed to have large holdings without verifying those holdings.

(The finger-prick blood test, in contrast, gives a reading only at a given moment in time.) They followed the group for up to 10 years, tracking blood glucose levels and periodically testing cognitive ability.

But consistently over time, scores on the tests of memory and executive function declined as HbA1c levels increased, even in people without diabetes.

But Mr. Yang\u2019s doomsday prophecy echoes the concerns of a growing number of labor economists and tech experts who are worried about the coming economic consequences of automation. A 2017 report by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, concluded that by 2030 \u2014 three presidential terms from now \u2014 as many as one-third of American jobs may disappear because of automation. (Other studies have given cheerier forecasts, predicting that new jobs will replace most of the lost ones.)\n\nPerhaps it was inevitable that a tech-skeptic candidate would try to seize the moment. Scrutiny of tech companies like Facebook and Google has increased in recent years, and worries about monopolistic behavior, malicious exploitation of social media and the addictive effects of smartphones have made a once-bulletproof industry politically vulnerable. Even industry insiders have begun to join the backlash.\n\nTo fend off the coming robots, Mr. Yang is pushing what he calls a \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d a monthly check for $1,000 that would be sent to every American from age 18 to 64, regardless of income or employment status. These payments, he says, would bring everyone in America up to approximately the poverty line, even if they were directly hit by automation. Medicare and Medicaid would be unaffected under Mr. Yang\u2019s plan, but people receiving government benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could choose to continue receiving those benefits, or take the $1,000 monthly payments instead.\n\nThe Freedom Dividend isn\u2019t a new idea. It\u2019s a rebranding of universal basic income, a policy that has been popular in academic and think-tank circles for decades, was favored by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the economist Milton Friedman, and has more recently caught the eye of Silicon Valley technologists. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have all expressed support for the idea of a universal basic income. Y Combinator, the influential start-up incubator, is running a basic income experiment with 3,000 participants in two states.\n\nDespite its popularity among left-leaning academics and executives, universal basic income is still a leaderless movement that has yet to break into mainstream politics.

The bus was operated by Kowloon Motor Bus, one of the main bus operators in Hong Kong.\n\nAt least 62 others were injured in the crash, including 15 people hospitalized in serious condition and 10 who were critical, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said.\n\nThe cause of the crash was not immediately known, the police said.

In September, a bus driven by a man who had worked several consecutive 13-hour days crashed, killing three people.\n\nThe latest crash is likely to revive concerns about the long working hours of bus drivers in Hong Kong. Drivers have complained that they receive low base salaries, $1,700 to $2,100 a month, and are compelled to drive long hours to earn more. More than three-quarters of bus drivers work 50 to 60 hours a week, according to a 2016 survey conducted by the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.\n\nGuidelines put in place in 2010 limit drivers to 14 working hours a day and a maximum of 11 driving hours.

Other Arab Gulf countries followed, with the Saudi, Emirati and Qatari foreign ministers announcing investment and loan deals.\n\nAll told, the conference participants pledged a total of $30 billion in loans and investments, Kuwait officials said, a figure Mr. Guterres described as an \u201cenormous success.\u201d", "title": "Hoping for $100 Billion to Rebuild, Iraq Got Less Than a Third", "authors": []}

And home prices that are lower on average than in neighboring C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur also appeal to some buyers, brokers said.\n\nBut Provence is a vast region, so prices can fluctuate, sometimes rivaling those in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Mr. Swannie said. And buyers in Provence, he added, are usually seeking a different kind of property than those looking in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. \u201cThe majority of clients search for older, more authentic properties in Provence, particularly stone-built properties,\u201d he said, \u201cwhereas there is more demand for more modern villas on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur.\u201d\n\nA typical mas, or Proven\u00e7al farmhouse, of about 2,150 square feet could sell for 450,000 euros to 900,000 euros (or about $558,000 to $1.1 million), Mr. Louis said.

Prices have gone up nearly 500 percent since 2003, he said, making Hong Kong \u201cthe most unaffordable market in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCooling measures that have been implemented by the Hong Kong government since 2009, Mr. Fisher said, have focused on \u201cmortgage lending restrictions and special taxes or stamp duties, aimed to reduce demand from investors and reduce demand from foreign buyers, particularly mainland Chinese, who many believe have been driving up the price for locals.\u201d\n\nBut following a brief housing market slowdown that lasted from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, \u201camidst Hong Kong\u2019s economic slowdown and decline in tourist arrivals,\u201d Ms. Chan said, \u201chouse prices recovered rapidly by the end of 2016.\u201d\n\nThe number of buyers from mainland China has dropped, said Koh Keng Shing, founder and chief executive of Landscope Christies, which is also marketing the listing. But \u201cdespite government measures, the prices are still rising,\u201d Mr. Koh said, and last year they increased by 15 to 20 percent. Inventory, he added, is merely \u201ctrickling in, not enough to fill the demand.\u201d\n\nMr. Fisher said about 20,000 units are being built every year.\n\nThe strongest segment of the market, Ms. Chan said, is \u201crare and prime luxurious property,\u201d particularly new development or single-lot houses in the Peak and South Side areas of Hong Kong Island. In November, a new home on Mount Nicholson sold for 132,000 Hong Kong dollars (or about $16,885) a square foot, breaking the previous record.\n\nWHO BUYS IN HONG KONG\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over 95 percent of the foreign buyers are mainland Chinese,\u201d Mr. Koh said. \u201cThe non-Chinese foreign buyers find it too high to buy here.\u201d\n\nMainland Chinese often buy Hong Kong residential properties \u201cas a hedge against currency and political risk that they are facing elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Chan said.\n\nThere are a few British buyers who settled in Hong Kong long ago, Mr. Koh said, and some buyers from the United States who are ultra-wealthy business owners.\n\nBesides longtime British expats, who are regarded as locals, Ms. Chan said, she has also had buyers from Sweden and elsewhere who own businesses in Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nReal estate commissions are negotiable, but the buyer and seller each typically pay about 1 percent of the sale price.\n\nBuyers and sellers have their own lawyers; the seller\u2019s lawyer provides the formal agreement. Legal fees are about 0.1 percent of the sale price, Ms. Chan said.\n\nMortgages require a 50 percent down payment on transactions over 10 million Hong Kong dollars (or $1.3 million) for a first home and are difficult for foreigners to obtain, Mr. Fisher said. Second homes require 60 percent down. Chinese government regulations require financial institutions to disclose the assets of foreign buyers, including mainland Chinese and global investors.\n\nWEBSITES\n\nHong Kong official tourism site: discoverhongkong.com\n\nHong Kong Estate Agents Authority: eaa.org.hk\n\nLANGUAGES AND CURRENCY\n\nChinese, English; Hong Kong dollar (1 Hong Kong dollar = $0.13)\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nRegardless of whether they are purchasing a first or second home, foreign buyers pay a stamp duty of 30 percent (an additional 15 percent stamp duty on top of the 15 percent paid by local buyers on a second or third home), said Chris Liem, owner and principal of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Hong Kong.

Now, \u201cit\u2019s a supply shortage.\u201d\n\nIn County Tipperary, a primarily agricultural region in the country\u2019s heartland, natural attractions and historic monuments draw vacationers and second-home buyers, agents said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ashmore described it as \u201cmixed-profile\u201d market, with both primary and second homes.

Today, she said, they are 35 to 40 percent off the 2006 peak.\n\nMr. Ashmore put that number slightly higher, at just 25 to 30 percent below the peak. But in County Tipperary, he said, while luxury homes might start at around 500,000 euros (or about $615,000), there are more affordable exceptions: \u201cI think there\u2019s still value within our market.\u201d\n\nWHO BUYS IN COUNTY TIPPERARY\n\nWhile the number of British buyers in Ireland dropped after the Brexit referendum, agents said, there are still many remaining.\n\nLast year, British buyers made up 12 percent of the luxury country homes market, Ms. De Vere Hunt said. Chinese buyers represented about the same percentage, she said, and there was an influx of buyers from the United States that made up for the drop in buyers from Britain.\n\nLast year, she said, about a third of Sherry FitzGerald\u2019s high-end country homes and estates in Ireland were bought by foreigners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn County Tipperary, as in Dublin and the rest of Ireland, most of the luxury buyers are foreign, said Mr. Ashmore, who put the number at about 65 to 70 percent. And of those foreign buyers, he added, most are from the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the last couple of years, foreign buyers of second homes around Lough Derg have also come from Dubai, Germany and the Netherlands, Mr. Talbot said.\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Ireland. But foreigners who want a mortgage may need to make a larger down payment than Irish citizens do \u2014 possibly as much as 50 percent, said Niamh O\u2019Grady, a lawyer with Mason, Hayes & Curran, in Dublin.\n\nClosing costs paid by a residential buyer include stamp duty, calculated as 1 percent on the first million euros of the purchase price and 2 percent on anything above that; other types of property sales, including agricultural land, are subject to a 6 percent fee.\n\nBuyers also pay land and title registration fees of 400 to 800 euros (roughly $500 to $1,000), records search fees of up to around 200 euros ($250) and, when applicable, a 175 euro ($215) mortgage registration fee.\n\nTransactions are handled by a lawyer, but there is no typical fee, Ms. O\u2019Grady said. She estimated that it might cost anywhere from around 1,000 euros (about $1,225) for lower-priced properties to between .5 and 1 percent of the purchase price for more expensive properties.\n\nAnyone buying real estate in Ireland must register for a tax ID number, a straightforward process that can take several weeks, she said. And before making a purchase, buyers should hire an Irish tax consultant for advice about taxes related to capital gains and rental income, among other issues, Ms. O\u2019Grady said.\n\nWEBSITES\n\nCounty Tipperary tourism: tipperary.com\n\nRock of Cashel: cashel.ie\n\nLough Derg: discoverloughderg.ie/\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLough Derg Yacht Club: loughdergyachtclub.wildapricot.org/\n\nLANGUAGES AND CURRENCY\n\nEnglish, Irish; euro (1 euro = $1.23)\n\nTAXES AND FEES\n\nAnnual property taxes on this property are around 1,000 euros ($1,225), Mr. Ashmore said, noting that the taxes are based on a self-assessed valuation of the property.\n\nCONTACT\n\nDavid Ashmore, Ireland Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, 011-353-87-251-2909; sothebysrealty.com", "title": "House Hunting in \u2026 Ireland", "authors": ["Roxana Popescu", "International Real Estate"]}

Now another stopgap measure is needed. Adding to the tight timeline facing lawmakers, House Democrats are scheduled to hold a retreat in Maryland beginning Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHere we are again,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on the Senate floor on Monday, before complaining about the use of one stopgap bill after another. \u201cGoverning is not a merry-go-round,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stopgap bills have been needed because congressional leaders have yet to reach a deal to raise the caps on military and domestic spending, an impasse that has kept them from negotiating a long-term spending bill. There were signs of hope on Monday that an agreement could be within reach.\n\nOnce a deal on those spending levels has been reached, lawmakers can put together a long-term funding bill that would stretch for the rest of the fiscal year. In the near future, lawmakers also need to raise the debt limit.\n\nAnother big question mark is the issue of immigration, which has helped make a deal on the spending caps elusive and played a central role in last month\u2019s shutdown. Lawmakers are looking to take action following Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that shields from deportation young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nOn Monday, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has been absent from the Senate while he battles brain cancer, teamed up with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to offer a narrow immigration bill that would protect the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation, while also seeking to strengthen border security.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has promised an open debate on immigration legislation in the Senate if lawmakers do not reach a deal on that subject by Thursday. Mr. Coons told reporters that his bill could serve as the underlying measure to form the foundation of that debate, calling it a \u201cstrong starting point.\u201d\n\nBut the McCain-Coons bill, intended as the Senate counterpart to a bipartisan bill in the House, is slimmer than the framework proposed by Mr. Trump. Notably, it does not include the $25 billion Mr. Trump requested for border security, including for a wall along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, the measure does not address the diversity visa lottery, which fosters immigration from countries that are underrepresented and which Mr. Trump wants to abolish, or family-based migration, which would be severely limited under the White House proposal.\n\nOn Monday, the White House rejected the McCain-Coons plan, just as it turned away a different bipartisan proposal put forth last month by a group of senators led by Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.\n\nMr. Trump, without mentioning Mr. McCain or Mr. Coons by name, wrote on Twitter on Monday that any DACA deal that does not include a border wall was \u201ca total waste of time.\u201d", "title": "House Pushes Another Stopgap Bill as Government Shutdown Looms", "authors": ["Thomas Kaplan"]}
{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "The memo was outlined in news reports in recent days as Republicans pushed for its release. Several details show that it reflects a line of attack circulating for weeks in conservative news media outlets, which have been amplifying a narrative that the Russia investigation is the illegitimate handiwork of a cabal of senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials who were biased against Mr. Trump and set out to sabotage him.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, portrayed the memo as recounting an \u201calarming series of events\u201d in which intelligence and law enforcement agencies were \u201cexploited to target one group on behalf of another.\u201d\n\nOne of its chief accusations centers on the inclusion in the warrant application of material from a former British spy, Christopher Steele. Mr. Steele was researching possible connections between Russia\u2019s election interference and Trump associates, but the application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge did not explain that he was partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the memo says.\n\n\u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the D.N.C., Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele\u2019s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior D.O.J. and F.B.I. officials,\u201d said the memo, which was written by committee staff members.\n\nBut a 10-page Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican document says that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than the Republicans say. The F.B.I. told the court that the information it received from Mr. Steele was politically motivated, though the agency did not say it was financed by Democrats, according to two people familiar with the Democratic memo.\n\nNotably, the Republican memo does not assert that Mr. Steele\u2019s information was the fountainhead of the broader Russia investigation as many Republicans and conservative media commentators have insinuated.\n\nBy a party-line vote, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to release their memo this week and rejected Democrats\u2019 appeal to make public their own still-classified memo at the same time. Democrats have accused Republicans of suppressing evidence that would correct what they say are mischaracterizations.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe sole purpose of the Republican document is to circle the wagons around the White House and insulate the president,\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Republican memo does not provide the full scope of evidence the F.B.I. and Justice Department used to obtain the warrant to surveil Mr. Page, and it is not clear to what extent the application hinges on the material provided by Mr. Steele. In December 2017, the Republican memo said, Andrew G. McCabe, then the deputy director of the F.B.I., told the House Intelligence Committee that no surveillance would have been sought without Mr. Steele\u2019s information.\n\nBut the people familiar with the Democratic memo said that Republicans had distorted what Mr. McCabe told the Intelligence Committee about the importance of the information from Mr. Steele. Mr. McCabe presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, the two people said. The evidence included contacts Mr. Page had in 2013 with a Russian intelligence operative.\n\nMr. Page\u2019s contacts with the Russian operative led to an investigation of Mr. Page that year, including a wiretap on him, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. McCabe told the committee that the decision to seek a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, was also prompted by Russia\u2019s attempts to target Mr. Papadopoulos, by a trip Mr. Page took to Moscow in July 2016 and by the Russian hacking of Democratic emails that appeared to be aimed at harming the Clinton campaign, the two people familiar with the Democratic memo said.\n\nAmong the handful of other details in the memo was that the application also cited a September 2016 article published by Yahoo News. It cited unnamed sources saying that government investigators were scrutinizing Mr. Page\u2019s links to Russia.\n\nMr. Steele was later revealed to be a source for the article, and the memo suggests that law enforcement officials\u2019 inclusion of it in their warrant application means they were using the same source twice but presenting him as separate sources.\n\n\u201cThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News,\u201d the memo said, underlining the assertion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schiff deemed this claim to be one of several serious mischaracterizations, saying the article was not used to corroborate Mr. Steele\u2019s material.\n\nIt was more likely to have been included \u201cto show that the investigation had become public, and that the target therefore might take steps to destroy evidence or cover his tracks,\u201d said David Kris, a FISA expert and former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division in the first term of the Obama administration.\n\nThe Republican memo said the initial FISA warrant for surveillance of Mr. Page was approved by James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, and Sally Q. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, both of whom Mr. Trump later fired.\n\nThe warrant was renewed three times, which was required every 90 days, meaning Mr. Page was under surveillance for about a year. At various points in the renewals, other law enforcement officials who signed off included Dana J. Boente, now the general counsel of the F.B.I.; Mr. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director who resigned under pressure this week; and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel and has been a target of the president\u2019s displeasure over the Russia inquiry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Get the latest on the special counsel investigation \u2014 and other major news \u2014 delivered to your email inbox.

Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly said he would refuse any order to fire the special counsel without such a finding, and that he has seen no sign of misconduct.\n\nAsked at the White House on Friday whether he would fire Mr. Rosenstein in light of the Republican memo \u2014 a move that would enable him to put someone else in charge of Mr. Mueller \u2014 Mr. Trump cocked his head suggestively and said, \u201cYou figure that one out.\u201d\n\nPressed on whether he had confidence in Mr. Rosenstein, the president would not answer.\n\nThe Republican memo also highlights Bruce Ohr, then an associate deputy attorney general, who has been attacked in conservative news media outlets in recent weeks because his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked as a contractor with FusionGPS, the opposition research firm that hired Mr. Steele. Mr. Ohr also met with Mr. Steele himself. The memo says the Ohrs\u2019 relationship with them \u201cwas inexplicably concealed\u201d from the intelligence court.\n\nThe memo does not mention that Mr. Ohr worked on counternarcotics, not counterintelligence. It does not allege that he played any role in the Russia investigation or the wiretap application.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe document also notes that the FISA application mentions Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with people connected to the Russian government. The memo said there is no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos conspired with Mr. Page.\n\nBut Mr. Schiff said that the Justice Department was instead providing the court \u201cwith a comprehensive explanation of Russia\u2019s election interference, including evidence that Russian agents courted another Trump campaign finance adviser\u201d as \u201cthe context in which to evaluate Russian approaches to Page.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Friday that he would evaluate the Republicans\u2019 criticism of the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cI am determined that we will fully and fairly ascertain the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a message to F.B.I. employees on Friday, Christopher A. Wray, the bureau\u2019s director, said he stood behind the agency\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot in the past nine months, and I know it\u2019s often been unsettling, to say the least,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the past few days haven\u2019t done much to calm those waters.\u201d", "title": "House Republicans Release Secret Memo Accusing Russia Investigators of Bias", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Adam Goldman", "Charlie Savage"]}

Bush administration. \u201cEverybody breathes the same air, Democrats or Republicans. It does not matter. This is about keeping people healthy.\u201d\n\nBut the Fitzgerald family has had influential allies. In addition to Mr. Pruitt, they include Representative Diane Black, a Republican who is a candidate for Tennessee governor, and Tennessee Technological University, a state university that produced a study minimizing pollution problems associated with the trucks.\n\nMs. Black introduced legislation in 2015 to protect the loophole when it was first in line to be eliminated by a stricter diesel emissions rule under the Obama administration. That bill failed, but after the election of Mr. Trump, she turned to Mr. Pruitt to carve out an exemption to the new rule \u2014 scheduled to take effect last month \u2014 and presented him with the study from Tennessee Tech.\n\nFitzgerald had not only paid for the study, which has roiled the faculty at Tennessee Tech and is the subject of an internal investigation, but it had also offered to build a new research center for the university on land owned by the company. And in the six weeks before Mr. Pruitt announced in November that he would grant the exemption, Fitzgerald business entities, executives and family members contributed at least $225,000 to Ms. Black\u2019s campaign for governor, campaign disclosure records show.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe multiple donors allowed the company to circumvent a Tennessee state law intended to limit the size of campaign contributions by corporations and political action committees. The donations \u2014 many of which came through a series of limited liability companies tied to the family \u2014 represented 12 percent of the money Ms. Black had raised from outside sources through last month, the records show.\n\nTommy Fitzgerald, an owner of Fitzgerald, said the actions by Ms. Black and Mr. Pruitt were good public policy and not special favors to his company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would want to kill all these jobs,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said, referring to the several hundred people he said he employs at his dealerships, many of them in rural areas. \u201cIt does not make any sense.\u201d\n\nChris Hartline, a spokesman for Ms. Black, said the congresswoman had stood up for a constituent and was not influenced by the campaign donations, which he said complied with state law. \u201cThere are very few companies willing to try and keep manufacturing jobs in rural Tennessee today, and Diane fights hard to support the few that do,\u201d Mr. Hartline said.\n\nAn E.P.A. spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, said that Mr. Pruitt remained committed to protecting clean air. But, she said, he agreed with a legal argument made by Ms. Black and Fitzgerald that the agency did not have the authority to limit sales.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cE.P.A. is acting on behalf of anyone who sees merit in upholding and perhaps even bolstering the credibility of our laws and the role of Congress,\u201d Ms. Bowman said.\n\nShe said that the money donated to Ms. Black had no impact on the decision by Mr. Pruitt.\n\nNew Trucks, Old Engines\n\nThe trucks sold by Fitzgerald are known as \u201cgliders\u201d because they are manufactured without engines and are later retrofitted with the rebuilt ones. Gliders are popular among small trucking companies and individual truck owners, who say they cannot afford to buy or operate vehicles with new engines and modern emissions controls.\n\nThe trucks, which Fitzgerald claims burn less fuel per mile and are cheaper to repair, have been on the market since at least the 1970s. But after the federal government moved to force improvements in truck emissions, with standards that were first enacted during the Clinton administration and took full effect by 2010, gliders became a way for trucking companies to legally skirt the rules.\n\nDealers like Fitzgerald buy truck bodies from Peterbilt, Freightliner and other manufacturers and typically install 1990s-era engines, recovered from salvage yards, that its employees rebuild down to their cores. The used engines and other remanufactured parts allow dealers to claim that the new trucks predate emissions requirements, and therefore should be exempt.\n\nNationally, an estimated 10,000 glider trucks were sold in 2015 \u2014 or about 4 percent of all new heavy-duty truck sales \u2014 the last full year for which data is available, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2010. Fitzgerald is the industry\u2019s largest dealer in retrofitting the trucks by selling so-called glider kit trucks, for about $130,000. Modern trucks, which also include collision avoidance equipment, cost between $145,000 and $170,000, dealers said.\n\n\u201cI hate government mandates,\u201d said Paul Bailey, a state senator and the operations manager at CB Trucking in Cookeville, Tenn., which hauls everything from building supplies to mustard in its fleet of 60 glider trucks, two-thirds of which were purchased from Fitzgerald.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe glider trucks take advantage of other regulatory loopholes. Since most of the engines were manufactured before 1999, the trucks are exempt from a federal law that went into effect in December intended to prevent accidents caused by fatigued drivers. The law requires commercial truck drivers to use an electronic logging system to track how many hours they spend behind the wheel, and to take mandatory breaks. The law covers truck engines manufactured after 1999.\n\nThe glider trucks, in some cases, also are not subject to a 12 percent federal excise tax imposed on truck sales, because they are not considered new trucks. Ms. Black intervened with the Internal Revenue Service last year, along with three other members of Congress, to protect that tax break.\n\nA Fitzgerald salesman boasted last week that all 150 trucks on the company\u2019s Crossville lot had been sold as trucking companies rushed to avoid the Obama-era emissions standards and the electronic tracking rule.\n\n\u201cWe cannot build them quick enough,\u201d said the salesman, Cody Poston. A second Fitzgerald salesman said the company had pending customer orders for 300 more and had about 2,000 glider trucks on the way to his sales lot.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatt Moorehead, who helps maintain trucks at the CB Trucking garage in Cookeville, said glider trucks allow small companies and individual drivers to compete with big trucking companies.\n\nHe said the trucks are easier to repair and, by some accounts, burn less diesel fuel per mile. And by avoiding the electronic tracking system, drivers can continue to use paper logs, which can be more easily manipulated to allow flexibility in driving and rest times.\n\n\u201cWhen you got a load of eggs and milk to deliver, these rules can force you to stop driving when you are just a few miles short of your destination,\u201d he said of the electronic tracking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter E.P.A. officials, during the Obama administration, saw a surge in the number of glider trucks being sold, the agency moved to prohibit any company from manufacturing more than 300 of them per year, effectively killing the industry that had emerged to help sidestep the rules.\n\nFitzgerald, with Ms. Black\u2019s help, submitted a petition in July asking Mr. Pruitt to suspend the cap and declare that all gliders made by Fitzgerald and at least two other dealers \u2014 Iowa-based Harrison Truck Centers and Indiana Phoenix of Avilla, Ind. \u2014 be exempted because the new emissions requirements applied only to \u201cnew motor vehicle engines.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo bolster their argument, Fitzgerald submitted the study conducted by Tennessee Tech in late 2016. The study, which Mr. Pruitt cited in the E.P.A.\u2019s November announcement of the rollback, concluded that emissions from the company\u2019s trucks were as clean as those with modern systems.\n\nThe push by Fitzgerald had started by May, according to a calendar of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s visitors, when Mr. Pruitt and his chief of staff met with executives from Fitzgerald and Donald Shandy, an Oklahoma lawyer who knows Mr. Pruitt from his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general.\n\nBy September, to keep the momentum going, Fitzgerald had hired its first full-time federal lobbyist \u2014 a former aide to Ms. Black.\n\n\u2018Super-Polluting Trucks\u2019\n\nTerry Dotson, president of Worldwide Equipment Enterprises, a Kentucky-based chain of truck dealerships that sells vehicles with modern emissions controls, said he remembered going into repair garages years ago when it was hard to breathe because of soot.\n\nMr. Dotson says he voted for President Trump and is a strong backer of the coal industry, which relies on his trucks for mining operations. But he does not agree with the administration\u2019s carve-out for glider trucks.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI want Mr. Fitzgerald to make a fortune and be a happy man,\u201d Mr. Dotson said outside one of his Knoxville, Tenn., dealerships. \u201cBut everybody ought to play by the same set of rules.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTruck manufacturers, as well as shipping companies like UPS, fear that a permanent loophole would encourage other truck dealers to enter the glider business, further undermining efforts to reduce health hazards associated with diesel exhaust and creating unfair competition for them. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies, representing state regulators, and the attorneys general from 12 states have joined in protesting the rollback.\n\nChet France, former director of assessment and standards at the E.P.A. Office of Transportation and Air Quality, says there are enough truck engines in salvage yards to support the glider market for decades.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about super-polluting trucks that are going to put the health of thousands of people at risk,\u201d said Mr. France, who worked at the E.P.A. for 30 years under Democratic and Republican administrations and is a consultant to the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cAnd for what?\u201d\n\nThe E.P.A. estimates that over the life of every 10,000 trucks without modern emissions systems, up to 1,600 Americans would die prematurely, and thousands more would suffer a variety of ailments including bronchitis and heart attacks, particularly in cities with air pollution associated with diesel-powered trains, ships and power plants.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe health threats are caused by nitrogen oxide and tiny particles of dust and soot that create haze in the air.\n\nIn November, just days after Mr. Pruitt said he would eliminate the glider cap, staff members at the E.P.A. submitted an analysis to the agency\u2019s rule-making docket that contradicted the conclusions from Fitzgerald and Tennessee Tech that glider trucks created no more pollution than trucks with updated emissions systems.\n\nThe analysis said E.P.A. tests found that the Fitzgerald trucks emitted nitrogen oxide levels during highway operations that were 43 times as high as those from trucks with modern emissions control systems. The air pollution from these glider trucks was so bad that one year\u2019s worth of truck sales was estimated to release 13 times as much nitrogen oxide as all of the Volkswagen diesel cars with fraudulent emissions controls, a scheme that resulted in a criminal case against the company and more than $4 billion in fines.\n\nWhen testing the glider trucks in stop-and-go traffic, the E.P.A. report said, the testing equipment shut down because of the extreme level of particulates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe filters were overloaded with particulate matter,\u201d said the report, which included a photograph of the white filter that had turned pitch black.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent weeks, other questions have been raised about the accuracy of the Tennessee Tech study, the role engineering experts at the university played in it, and the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university.\n\nThe signature of Tennessee Tech\u2019s president, Philip B. Oldham, appeared on the study, which was included in the petition Fitzgerald submitted in July to eliminate the cap. In April, Mr. Oldham was photographed with Mr. Fitzgerald at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, where Fitzgerald sponsors the Fitzgerald Glider Kits 300, a Nascar Xfinity Series stock car race. Mr. Oldham presided over an event at the university in August, where Fitzgerald announced it would build a new academic research center for the university.\n\nSome faculty members say the university appears to have been used by Fitzgerald as part of its lobbying campaign.\n\n\u201cOur reputation has recently been damaged because of a study funded by Fitzgerald Glider Kits and used to influence federal policy,\u201d said a faculty senate resolution passed late last month. Christy Killman, president of the faculty senate, said the results of the study \u201craised a red flag.\u201d\n\nMr. Oldham did not respond to a request for comment, but he sent a letter to Ms. Killman this month confirming that a \u201cmisconduct in research\u201d investigation had been started, at the faculty\u2019s request, adding that he wanted to ensure the university\u2019s reputation as an \u201chonest broker of knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe public comment period on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s intention to repeal the annual cap on glider trucks has passed. Ms. Bowman, the E.P.A. spokeswoman, says the agency is now reviewing the comments before Mr. Pruitt announces a final decision.\n\n\u201cContinuing to improve air quality is a stated priority of Administrator Pruitt\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Bowman said. \u201cAny comments received that raise concerns with the ability to maintain that goal are closely considered and analyzed.\u201d\n\nAt Fitzgerald\u2019s sales lot, employees said last week that there was no need to worry about pollution from the trucks, adding that they had emissions test results to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are just as clean,\u201d Mr. Poston said of the gliders, compared with modern trucks, \u201cif not cleaner.\u201d", "title": "How $225,000 Can Help Secure a Pollution Loophole at Trump\u2019s E.P.A.", "authors": ["Eric Lipton"]}

And when it comes to some of Facebook\u2019s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.\n\n\u201cWhenever you are debating what your policy is, you\u2019re unlikely to build an A.I. that works well for that,\u201d he said. \u2014 Kevin Roose\n\nA call for regulators to stand down\n\nMichael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.\n\nHe cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,\u201d said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are \u201cputting us at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nUnlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn\u2019t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a \u201c30-year head start\u201d in A.I. development.\n\nAnd despite the White House\u2019s reputation for chaos and tumult, he maintained that it was \u201ca great place to work.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Roose\n\nPhoto\n\nTech giants face a \u2018crisis of trust\u2019\n\nMarc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?\u201d Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is any different now. They\u2019re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a \u201cstrong hand of ethics,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is a \u201ccrisis of trust,\u201d he added, that will become a \u201ctidal wave\u201d among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect our industry,\u201d said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. \u201cIf companies aren\u2019t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.\u201d\n\nOne of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook\u2019s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.\n\n\u201cFacebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they\u2019re in today,\u201d Mr. Benioff said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.\n\n\u201cI view alcohol as a drug,\u201d he said. \u201cThe keg is not there anymore \u2014 well, actually who knows, but I hope it\u2019s not.

At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.\n\nBut she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.\n\nIn particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.\n\n\u201cA.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI really believe there are no borders for science,\u201d she said. \u2014 Cade Metz\n\nWhy American tech companies struggle in China\n\nTuesday\u2019s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world\u2019s largest internet market?\n\n\u201cThe American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.\n\n\u201cMessenger is a much worse product than WeChat,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s messaging app and Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAmazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,\u201d he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, \u201cApple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.\u201d\n\nMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned about winning in the local market,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, young Chinese these days would rather work for national champions like Alibaba or Tencent. Pitted against Chinese start-ups and big companies, where the hours tend to be long and the work culture cutthroat, the leading lights of American tech would get \u201cget eaten for lunch.\u201d \u2014 Raymond Zhong\n\nTrump administration silent on A.I.\n\nLast year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.\n\nBut as China pushes ahead in this area, many experts are concerned that the Trump administration is not doing enough to keep the United States ahead in the future. Although the big United States internet giants are leading the A.I. race, these experts believe the country as a whole could fall behind if does not do more to nurture research inside universities and government labs. \u2014 Cade Metz\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWaymo C.E.O. \u2018really happy\u2019 with Uber settlement\n\nJohn Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cWe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn\u2019t using any of our software.\u201d\n\nHe called the software Waymo\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nWaymo and Uber spent only four days at trial last week before settling, with Uber agreeing to provide Waymo 0.34 percent of its stock, worth about $245 million. The dispute between the companies started in 2016 when Uber bought Otto, a start-up founded by Anthony Levandowski, an early member of Google\u2019s self-driving car program. Waymo, which was spun out of Google, accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing technology before leaving and accused Uber of using the misappropriated knowledge.\n\n\u201cThis was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cFor us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn\u2019t using our trade secrets.\u201d He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.\n\nMr. Krafcik also discussed how Waymo was looking to start a ride-hailing service, which it is testing in Phoenix with thousands of driverless Pacifica minivans.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan to move from city to city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be launching with a 25 mile-per-hour product. We\u2019re talking about a full-speed service that will serve a very large geographic area with essentially unlimited pickup and drop-off points.\u201d \u2014 Nellie Bowles\n\nNo, Amazon isn\u2019t using A.I. to cut jobs\n\nJeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn\u2019t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer\u2019s move into artificial intelligence.\n\nHis key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will take our jobs.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn\u2019t eliminate work; it changes work,\u201d Mr. Wilke said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe said that over the last five years, since Amazon bought a robot maker called Kiva Systems, it had built 100,000 of the robots \u2014 and also hired 300,000 people. \u201cWe still need human judgment,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.\n\nAs to how Amazon might use A.I. at Whole Foods, the grocery store chain that it said it would acquire last year, Mr. Wilke said little. When asked whether Amazon would integrate its cashier-less and A.I.-driven convenience store concept, called Amazon Go, with Whole Foods, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t foresee the format of Whole Foods changing very much.\u201d \u2014 Pui-Wing Tam\n\nA.I. has become a campaign issue\n\nAs A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.\n\nOver the weekend, I wrote about Andrew Yang, a former tech executive who has decided to run for president in 2020 as a Democrat on a \u201cbeware the robots\u201d platform. He thinks that with innovations like self-driving cars and grocery stores without cashiers just around the corner, we\u2019re about to move into a frightening new era of mass unemployment and social unrest.\n\nSo he\u2019s proposing a universal basic income plan called the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.\n\nMr. Yang\u2019s campaign is a long shot, and there are significant hurdles to making universal basic income politically feasible. But the conversation about automation\u2019s social and economic consequences is long overdue. Even if he doesn\u2019t win the election, Mr. Yang may have hit on the next big political wedge issue. \u2014 Kevin Roose\n\nArtificial intelligence may be biased\n\nIn modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it, as Steve Lohr recently wrote, and that means that some of the biases in the real world can seep into A.I.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.\n\nJoy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, found that the software can now tell if a white man in a photograph is male or female 99 percent of the time. But for darker skinned women, it is wrong nearly 35 percent of the time. \u2014 Joseph Plambeck", "title": "How Artificial Intelligence Is Edging Its Way Into Our Lives", "authors": ["The New York Times"]}

In an uncanny masterstroke, the female corps de ballet returns to the stage in a single diagonal line heading straight for the lovers, making them separate (again and again) even as they kneel.\n\nThe corps de ballet re-forms, becoming an avenue or forest through which hero and heroine walk slowly on separate paths, looking for each other in vain. But the ballet has already implied that the forces that part them come from within themselves \u2014 from their own sense of tragic destiny.\n\nBalanchine added this finale in 1974. Its music comes not from the \u201cDivertimento\u201d but from Stravinsky\u2019s complete \u201cLe Baiser de la F\u00e9e\u201d (1928), a narrative work in four scenes. Stravinsky used elements from multiple Tchaikovsky scores; this finale dwells on the desolate melody of the song \u201cNone but the lonely heart.\u201d The ballet\u2019s hero is implicitly an artist \u2014 singled out from birth by the inexorable fairy (or muse) \u2014 who can never enjoy the ordinary life and loves of other men.\n\nAnd in that final scene, the fairy lures him deeper into her realm while his fianc\u00e9e is left alone in anguish. Balanchine, who first staged the complete \u201cBaiser\u201d in 1937, found it was close to his heart. He staged it for several companies up to 1950, but he seems never to have been satisfied with his solution to that finale.\n\nJust as Shakespeare has Cassius say to Brutus \u201cThe fault \u2026 is not in our stars/But in our selves,\u201d so Balanchine, in 1974, here eliminates the fairy \u2014 the supernatural \u2014 and shows the lovers parting because of their own natures. As the ballet ends, man and woman are both walking backward, slowly, in separate zones of the stage, facing up to the heavens with arms stretched out \u2014 both pleading and resigned.", "title": "How Balanchine Turns a Fairy Story Into Tragedy", "authors": []}

When Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, was asked at a conference about his former company\u2019s decision to not do business with firearms merchants, he made his displeasure clear. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t be doing that if I was still running it,\u201d said Mr. Thiel, who left the company years ago and is a supporter of President Trump.\n\nPerhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells.\n\nCritics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision.\n\nAnother critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks\u2019 actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy.\n\nThe most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That\u2019s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns.\n\nThere are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd\u2019s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out.\n\nNone of this is a panacea. But it\u2019s a start. It takes leadership and courage \u2014 exactly what these executives say they have. If they don\u2019t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there\u2019s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.", "title": "How Banks Could Control Gun Sales if Washington Won\u2019t", "authors": []}

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country.

Reading Neil Irwin on the effects of the GOP\u2019s new what-me-worry approach to deficits, I found myself thinking back to that discussion, and what it implies for the short-run economic impact. Specifically: what kind of multiplier effect should we expect to see here?\n\nThe most convincing evidence on multipliers, in my view, has always come from natural experiments: cases in which we know from the historical political record that governments were imposing large changes in taxes and/or spending, and we can see the effects of these fiscal shocks on growth relative to what was previously expected. (Attempts to use fancy statistical techniques to extract fiscal shocks have worked much less well.)\n\nA lot of this work came from the IMF. In 2010 the Fund produced a report on austerity policies (Chapter 3) that was in effect a response to the \u201cexpansionary austerity\u201d literature, using the historical record to assess past austerity policies. That analysis suggested a multiplier of about 0.5 \u2013 that is, a 1 point cut in government spending as a percentage of GDP would reduce output by half a percent.\n\nHowever, past austerity took place under normal monetary conditions \u2013 that is, central banks could and did offset fiscal contraction by cutting interest rates. By contrast, austerity after 2009 took place in countries where interest rates were already zero and could not be cut further. You would expect the multiplier to be larger under these conditions, and sure enough, a variety of studies \u2013 most influentially Blanchard and Leigh \u2013 found a multiplier of around 1.5, three times as large. (Nakamura and Steinsson\u2019s clever use of regional data on defense spending within the U.S. as a measure of the multiplier came up with a similar number.)", "title": "Opinion | How Big a Bang for Trump\u2019s Buck?

Ed Freni, the director of aviation for Massport, leads the meetings. Each of the four terminals at Logan has its own manager who reports to Mr. Freni.\n\n\u201cAsk anyone at the airport who\u2019s in charge, they\u2019ll say Ed Freni,\u201d said Thomas P. Glynn, the chief executive of Massport.\n\nThe daily meetings also foster a spirit of cooperation among airlines that are typically the fiercest of rivals, said Norbert P. Strissel, director of airport operations at Logan for JetBlue Airways. An airline will make one of its gates available to a competitor in a pinch, especially if it is in danger of violating the time limit for keeping passengers in a plane on the ground, Mr. Strissel said at a recent meeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in that situation in years past, as well as other carriers here at Logan,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-nine percent of the time, we\u2019re saying go ahead and get that plane to a gate and at least get the customers off of it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThat is not what happened at Kennedy on the first weekend in January.\n\nSome passengers on a flight from France that landed late on Jan. 5 said they were still aboard when dawn broke the next morning, more than a full day after the storm had swept through the New York area. It was one of several international flights that landed and could not find a gate for hours.\n\nThe storm, which had been described as a bomb cyclone, dropped several inches of snow at Kennedy, but the runways had been cleared by Friday morning. Removing the snow was the Port Authority\u2019s business. But sorting out the growing chaos in Terminal 1 was not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder Kennedy\u2019s operating model, management of just about everything that happens inside the six terminals is left to the tenants, either airlines that have their own terminals or companies that manage terminals occupied by several airlines. Terminal 1 at Kennedy handles 21 foreign airlines but is operated by a consortium consisting of four of them: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa.\n\nAfter the airport reopened on that Friday, the airlines, eager to deliver their delayed and detoured passengers to New York, started sending flights to Kennedy. It was up to the terminal\u2019s managers to schedule access to its 11 gates, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the influx of jets.\n\nThe experience of Aeroflot, the Russian airline and a tenant at Terminal 1, illustrates how dysfunctional the situation became. At about 5:30 p.m. on Friday, an Aeroflot flight from Moscow arrived at Kennedy. But passengers said they were held on the plane for nearly three hours, and then had to wait an additional three hours to retrieve their luggage.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat Saturday afternoon, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took the unusual step of ordering the terminal closed to inbound flights. That move forced Aeroflot to have a plane that was headed there from Moscow turn back.\n\nThe problem had not been solved by the next day, so the Port Authority barred arrivals at Terminal 1 again on Sunday. Aeroflot had to cancel two flights that day from Moscow and one from Kennedy to Moscow.\n\nAeroflot blamed the cancellations on \u201cthe complicated infrastructure situation at the J.F.K. Airport and the lack of parking lots for aircraft,\u201d according to Tass, the Russian news agency.\n\nAdding misfortune to misery, on Sunday afternoon, a pipe burst in the ceiling of the arrivals section of Kennedy\u2019s Terminal 4, flooding an area that had been crowded with stranded travelers and baggage. That mess, too, was not the Port Authority\u2019s responsibility, but quickly became its problem. The agency sent workers to help the operator of Terminal 4, a company known as JFKIAT, and had to bar it from accepting international flights for hours that evening.\n\nWhat became of the passengers whose flights were blocked from landing at Kennedy that weekend? Six planeloads of them wound up at Logan, Mr. Freni said. Without gates for all of them, airport officials had to close off the end of one of Logan\u2019s runways and park them there, said Todd Smith, Massport\u2019s director of aviation operations. Passengers were then taken by shuttle buses to the international terminal.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe six planes that were diverted to Logan from Kennedy on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Smith said, included an Air Europa flight from Madrid and a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo. Boston was the second of two unscheduled stops the Japanese plane made. It had nearly reached Kennedy when it was diverted to Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport. After leaving O\u2019Hare for Kennedy, it was rerouted to Boston, where it stayed overnight while some of the passengers made it to New York by bus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the weekend, while thousands of suitcases were piling up at Kennedy, all was calm at Logan. Massport\u2019s fleet of snow-removal equipment, which includes 14 plows with 27-foot blades and a rubber-tracked snow-groomer designed for a ski resort, had quickly cleared the airport\u2019s six runways.\n\n\u201cTop-down management is sort of out of fashion these days,\u201d Mr. Glynn said. But, he added, \u201ctop-down management works here and it works because people have respect for those at the top.\u201d\n\nLogan, of course, is smaller than Kennedy, and handles only a fraction of the international passengers that Kennedy does. But the responses from officials of the Port Authority in the last several weeks imply that the different management structures of the two airports explain much of the gap in performance.\n\nRick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, has repeatedly apologized and vowed that there would not be a repeat. The agency appointed the former transportation secretary Ray H. LaHood to investigate what happened at Kennedy and said it would immediately make several changes in procedures. Among those changes would be to require airlines to notify the Port Authority whenever a plane is not assigned to a gate within 90 minutes of landing.\n\nSpeaking to an air-travel industry group in Manhattan recently, the Port Authority\u2019s director of aviation, Huntley Lawrence, admitted that the agency had paid too little attention to passengers. Reflecting back to the 1960s, when the Port Authority first turned management of terminals over to private companies, he said: \u201cNo one ever dreamed that meant we would abdicate control of the customer experience at our airports. But we did.\u201d\n\nNow, Mr. Lawrence added, according to the text of his speech, \u201cthose days are over.\u201d\n\nMr. Cotton said that Port Authority officials would await Mr. LaHood\u2019s report, which is expected this spring. But, he added, \u201cif his recommendation is that the Port Authority needs to take a more aggressive role, the Port Authority will take a more aggressive role.\u201d", "title": "How Boston\u2019s Airport Bounced Back From the Storm That Crippled J.F.K.", "authors": ["Patrick Mcgeehan"]}

That special treatment comes on top of generous subsidies from local communities eager to bring business to their struggling industrial districts.\n\nThe Northeast, Midwest and West still represent much of the industry, but 36 states doubled their production of craft beer from 2011 to 2016, according to Mr. Barnett, who last year wrote \u201cThe Craft Beer Guidebook to Real Estate,\u201d a JLL report. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore an industry that has grown this much,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nIn searching for places to make specialty beverages like sour beers and stouts, breweries seemed to adhere to a formula. They like early-20th-century buildings with up to 10,000 square feet and lofty ceilings, said Sandy A. Barin, a vice president with the commercial real estate firm CBRE based in Minneapolis who counts brewers among his clients.\n\nUsually renters instead of owners, breweries in Minneapolis typically sign five-year leases and pay $4.50 a square foot annually, Mr. Barin said, although tenants are usually on the hook for renovations, even if landlords offer credits for finishes like paint and carpeting. \u201cThe setup is usually pretty expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nBreweries also seek up-and-coming locations that are within walking distance of houses and apartments, according to Mr. Barin, who added that the popular neighborhood in his city is North Loop, a former manufacturing district that churned out plows and threshers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver all, breweries, usually with tap rooms, occupy about 624,000 square feet in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro region, up from 507,000 square feet in 2016. And in 2017, 11 new breweries opened in that area, according to CBRE, with 11 more expected this year.\n\nOffering food broadens breweries\u2019 appeal, making a visit to them into \u201cmore of an all-inclusive night out,\u201d Mr. Barin said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

Modist Brewing, which opened in 2016 in a former North Loop salt factory, has several food trucks to serve hungry customers.\n\nBreweries have boomed nationally in the last few years. The industry was on track to post a growth rate of 5 percent in 2017, based on midyear calculations, said Bart Watson, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of a slowdown,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in many places, the industry remains highly subsidized, raising questions about whether breweries can make it on their own, and how long that might take.\n\nThe building that houses Equilibrium, for instance, was sold to the brewery for $260,000, with $225,000 of that forgivable if the brewery remained in business for at least five years, said Mr. Petroni, who along with his partner, Peter Oates, invested $1.4 million to upgrade the property. Ten people work there today.\n\nIn addition, Equilibrium benefited from a sales-tax exemption on construction materials and a short-term reduction in property taxes, among other local incentives. The nearby three-year-old Clemson Brewing Company, a tall brick former saw-blade factory also seized for back taxes before its current incarnation, received similar breaks, which Middletown officials called necessary.\n\n\u201cWe realized in the 1980s and 1990s that industry wasn\u2019t really coming back to any of these cities,\u201d said Maria Bruni, the economic development director of Middletown. \u201cOur community is very supportive because we\u2019ve been staring at these buildings for 20 years and doing nothing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinancing from New York State, which under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has become a major backer of the brewing industry, seems to also be a key. Equilibrium, for example, has so far received $204,000 in state grants.\n\nMr. Cuomo, who took office in 2011 and is now in his second term, has also relaxed industry laws over the years. Brewers can now sell beer by the glass at their plants if their recipes partly use locally grown products, which many credit for the explosive growth of breweries in New York.\n\nIn February, there were 390 craft breweries in New York, according to the state\u2019s Liquor Authority, up from 97 in 2012. From densely settled Brooklyn to small towns by the Canadian border, the breweries include the Newburgh Brewing Company, which occupies an 1850s former box factory; Battle Street Brewery, in a former train station in Dansville, near the Finger Lakes; and Pressure Drop Brewing in Buffalo, in a former barrel factory. The Binghamton area has also become a hot spot.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nIf residents support incentives, they do not always agree that alcohol will improve a community, said Chris Andrus, a co-founder of Mitten Brewing Company in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\nThough breweries are plentiful, none were on the city\u2019s west side, a blue-collar former furniture-making center, when Mr. Andrus and his partner, Max Trierweiler, sought to open one in a dormant 1891 firehouse. Neighbors who were worried that another bar would hurt the struggling area spoke out at zoning meetings, he said.\n\nBut opponents may have come around since the brewery opened in 2012. Mitten closes earlier than bars in the area, Mr. Andrus said, \u201cand we attract a lot of families.\u201d The brewery, which is profitable, seems to have also attracted investment in the neighborhood. Across the street is a gin distillery, in a former clothing store, and another corner has a barbecue joint, in a former hamburger stand. Other breweries have also arrived in the area.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, property values are also on the rise. Mitten\u2019s 6,000-square-foot firehouse, which cost $220,000, is worth about $600,000, Mr. Andrus said, which is \u201clargely because of us.\u201d\n\nWhether craft breweries are a fad or will endure may come down to drinkers\u2019 tastes, but evidence suggests passion for the product is high.\n\nOn that January day in Middletown, Bob Helligrass and Jaime Loughridge, friends from the Albany area, sat eating lunch at Tapped, a bistro next to Equilibrium that opened around the same time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore buying India pale ales at Equilibrium, the pair had also hit up the two-year-old Hudson Valley Brewery in Beacon, N.Y., to buy some of its beverages, while also snagging a meal along the way. \u201cBreweries,\u201d Mr. Helligrass said, \u201chave benefits all down the line.\u201d", "title": "How Craft Breweries Are Helping to Revive Local Economies", "authors": ["C.

When I crossed it was to see something I couldn\u2019t find in Brownsville, maybe it was the restaurants and bars, but maybe also because when you grow up here, on the border, at least part of your life and memories exist on that other side. You remember your dad taking you across for your first haircut, buying a case of Joyas and hearing the soda bottles clinking all the way home inside the trunk of the Oldsmobile, attending a wedding in Brownsville and then crossing over for the reception in Matamoros, eating at places like Los Norte\u00f1os with the cabrito aflame in the front window, and your last night in town at Los Portales with its rustic interior and enormous glass case with the embroidered saddle and sheathed sword, your grilled fajitas and costillas sizzling on the hibachi set atop a rickety orange side table.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the first to warn me.\n\n\u201cDepending on which way the wind is blowing you can hear the balazos,\u201d Dr. Juliet Garc\u00eda had told me of the rapid-fire sound of the gun battles taking place across the border. Until 2015, she was president of the University of Texas at Brownsville, now renamed the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, which stands close enough to the river that police once found a stray bullet that had been fired in Matamoros and lodged itself into the exterior of a campus building. Which is another way of saying that what happens on the Matamoros side of the river, good or bad, tends to wash ashore on the Brownsville side.\n\nPhoto\n\nPart of what\u2019s always made Brownsville an attractive destination is its proximity to Matamoros and South Padre Island, only 30 minutes away. But the sound of the balazos has scared some tourists away, especially Winter Texans, those retirees from the Midwest who drive their motor homes south to spend part of the year in Brownsville and other cities north of here, all close enough to the bridges connecting them to Matamoros and Nuevo Progresso and Reynosa, where the drug war is even more intense.\n\nNow a few of the restaurants that tourists and locals might have crossed over for can be found in Brownsville. Some, like Mi Pueblito and Bigo\u2019s, still have their original locations across the bridge, but Mariscos De La Rosa, a seafood restaurant, left for good after 22 years and reopened in Brownsville in 2010.", "title": "How Crossing the Bridge to Matamoros Got Complicated", "authors": ["Oscar C\u00e1sares"]}

But on certain measures, stocks are still expensive.\n\nOne way to value companies on the stock market is to compare their share prices with their earnings. If, say, a company made a dollar per share last year and its stock trades at $20, it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 20. As the market kept rising in recent months, investors were willing to pay a high price for companies\u2019 earnings. And even after Monday\u2019s plunge, stock valuations still look demanding. At its peak in January, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index traded at 23 times the 2017 profits of the companies in the benchmark. That multiple was well above the average of 19 times for the past five years. If the S.&P. 500 traded at 19 times 2017 earnings, it would be 10 percent lower than Monday\u2019s closing level of 2,649.\n\nBut there is a more optimistic approach that looks at what companies will make in the future. Now, earnings expectations are bullish, with Wall Street analysts expecting companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase their profits by more than 20 percent. Applying a valuation of 19 times expected 2018 earnings suggests that the market has already sold off too much. But the danger with that approach is that it depends on companies actually delivering those stellar profits. And any sign of a widespread earnings disappointment could set off more selling.\n\nCan the damage stay contained?\n\nSteep and prolonged stock market sell-offs become particularly dangerous when they spread fear through other markets and weigh on the financial system and the wider economy. On that front, it is worth noting that a closely watched index of the S.&P. 500\u2019s volatility, a gauge of fear known on Wall Street as the Vix, more than doubled on Monday. Bond markets have also been hit by selling. At times like this, professional investors, especially those using borrowed money to make their bets, can report shock losses, adding to the climate of fear. And consumers, long buoyed by the rising value of their stock investments, may cut back spending.\n\nBut there are some grounds for optimism. The financial system has far more protection against losses than it had in 2008, which means it can withstand hits itself and should have the strength to keep serving clients through a rocky period.", "title": "How Deep Is the Hole the Stock Market Just Stepped In?", "authors": []}

In that study, investigators showed one of two images to people responsible for hiring: pictures either of a person without dental problems or with uncorrected dental problems. Those with dental problems were more likely to be judged as less intelligent and were less likely to be considered suitable for hiring.\n\nThe relationship between oral health and work has gained new salience in light of Kentucky\u2019s recently approved Medicaid waiver, which permits the state to impose work requirements on some able-bodied Medicaid enrollees. It\u2019s a step that some other states are also considering.\n\nMedicaid takes different forms in different states, and even within states, different populations are entitled to different benefits. Though all states must cover dental benefits for children in low-income families, they aren\u2019t required to do so for adults.\n\nAs of January 2018, only 17 state Medicaid programs offered comprehensive adult dental benefits, and only 14 of those did so for the population eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. More typically, states offer only limited dental benefits or none.\n\nDental coverage under most private health care plans isn\u2019t comprehensive, either \u2014 people who want it have to buy separate dental plans. But compared with those enrolled in private coverage through an employer or on their own, the population eligible for Medicaid is much more likely to need dental care and much less likely to be able to afford it or coverage for it. People with incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid are twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay, relative to their higher-income counterparts.\n\nKentucky offers limited dental benefits to Medicaid enrollees, including those on whom work requirements would be imposed. Those benefits exclude coverage for dentures, root canals and crowns, which could challenge some enrollees\u2019 ability to maintain good oral health and lead to greater emergency department use.\n\nOne study found that after Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid expansion in 2014, the rate of use of the emergency department for oral health conditions tripled. Another study found that about $1 billion in annual emergency department spending was attributed to dental conditions, and 30 percent of emergency department visits for dental problems were made by people enrolled in Medicaid.", "title": "How Dental Inequality Hurts Americans", "authors": []}

I\u2019d been so driven by the instant gratification of a byline. Now I slaved away on something that quite possibly no one (except my mom) would read.\n\nIn those early weeks, I only allowed myself to read books that would help with my \u201cday job\u201d: cranking out the 100,000 words I was contractually obligated to deliver to HarperCollins by the fall. That meant mostly sticking to memoirs, studying the structure and voice that other \u2014 real \u2014 memoirists used. I read Richard Ford\u2019s \u201cBetween Them,\u201d a slim volume about his parents; \u201cStop-Time\u201d by Frank Conroy; \u201cDispatches\u201d by Michael Herr; all of Mary Karr\u2019s books (including rereading \u201cThe Liars\u2019 Club\u201d and \u201cCherry\u201d).

But it didn\u2019t take an editor to tell me that there was nothing staggering or genius about my attempts at Mr. Eggers\u2019s stream of consciousness.\n\nFrom there, I drifted into fiction, still studying voice and structure as I thought about how to craft my own book, \u201cChasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass Ceiling\u201d (due out April 24, just in case you want to join my mom and pre-order). I became wrought with insecurity that these masters could do what I (the yeoman newspaper reporter) could never do.

But only a few past animal studies have closely tracked changes to synapses after exercise and none looked simultaneously at stress, leaving the results unrepresentative of actual life, which always contains some amount of stress.\n\nSo, for the new study, which was published this month in Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, gathered healthy, male mice. (They plan similar future studies with female mice.)\n\nThey divided the animals into groups. Some, as a control, continued with their normal rodent lives. Others began running at will on wheels in their cages; mice seem to enjoy running and these eagerly covered about three miles a day.\n\nAfter a month, some of the sedentary animals were exposed to three days of stressful experiences. These mostly involved some type of mild restraint, which makes prey animals like mice understandably anxious.\n\nThe researchers were trying to simulate relatively chronic stress with the animals, somewhat like what most of us might feel with ongoing work pressures or other anxieties.\n\nSome of the runners were also restrained and stressed.\n\nThen, to see if any changes to the animals\u2019 synapses would be reflected in their lived experience, the researchers had some mice from each group learn a maze with a treat in one hidden corner.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By electrically stimulating some of the isolated cells, they could see how many and what types of messages jumped between them.\n\nIt was immediately clear that three days of chronic stress had reduced the effectiveness of the synapses in the stressed-out, sedentary animals, compared to those from the control mice. Their intracellular connections were much weaker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe unstressed runners, on the other hand, now had the strongest, busiest synapses, suggesting that their ability to learn and remember would be higher than in the other animals.\n\nPerhaps most interesting, the animals that had run and also experienced chronic stress had synapses that resembled those from the normal, unstressed control group. They were not as strong as those from the never-stressed runners but much stronger than those from the animals that had been stressed but not exercised.\n\nBehaviorally, the runners, stressed or not, also learned the location of the treats in the maze more quickly than the sedentary animals did, and remembered it more rapidly and accurately several weeks later.\n\nOver all, it seems that exercise had improved the animals\u2019 memories, even in the face of stress, by bulking up their synapses and buffering the negative effects that stress otherwise would have had on those neural connections, says Roxanne Miller, who led the study as part of her doctoral research at B.Y.U.\n\nIt is not yet clear, though, she says, how exercise changed the animals\u2019 synapses at a molecular level. She and her colleagues did find increases in the activity of certain genes and the levels of some proteins in the brains of the runners that could have contributed to the changes in their synapses, she says.\n\nBut far more research is needed into that issue, as well as into whether other forms of exercise, such as resistance training or gentle walking, would have comparable effects, she says.\n\nAnd of course, mice are not people, and it is impossible to know if the same changes occur in our synapses when we exercise.\n\nBut even so, the results do seem to offer one more reason being physically active \u201cis a very good idea,\u201d Dr. Miller says.", "title": "How Exercise May Help the Memory Grow Stronger", "authors": ["Gretchen Reynolds", "Phys Ed"]}

But Mr. Mounk\u2019s words came readily to mind this past week as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, announced that her center-right Christian Democrats had entered into yet another grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats.\n\nThough it was nominally a victory for centrist stability, one look at the grim expressions of Ms. Merkel and her new cabinet members revealed the truth: Few believe this type of politics is sustainable any more.\n\nA political era is ending in Europe. What comes next may not be the populist takeover some feared. Rather, it will be a subtler, if no less consequential, form of political hollowing out, with serious consequences for democracy.\n\nIn the 2017 election in Germany that set off coalition negotiations, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats suffered their worst losses ever in the postwar era, losing more than 100 seats in the Bundestag, the German federal legislature. This has been the story across Europe, as establishment parties plummet in popularity.\n\nMost analysts attributed the German mainstream parties\u2019 losses to voters\u2019 anger at the years of grand-coalition government, which many said had rendered the parties distant and indistinguishable. And so this new coalition, offering more of the same, seems like a rejection of the public will.\n\nIt is just the latest sign that Europe may be entering an ominous new political phase. Agreements between the center-left and center-right have long been seen as a fundamental building block of European stability. But now, as such agreements falter, the popularity of mainstream parties is falling fast, with the center-left\u2019s support collapsing particularly quickly.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the far-right Freedom Party\u2019s 2017 election gains grabbed headlines, but mainstream party losses were even bigger. The Dutch Labour Party, which had been the junior partner in a coalition government before the election, was nearly wiped out, losing 29 of its 38 seats. Its erstwhile coalition partner, the center-right People\u2019s Party, lost eight seats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn France, none of the traditional political parties made it past the first round of the presidential election. In legislative elections that followed a few months later, results for the mainstream parties were even worse.

And as politics, and perhaps European societies themselves, become more polarized, that will make it even more difficult for political systems to address major challenges, such as European Union-wide financial strain or the immigration crisis.\n\nThose issues require politicians to balance national or Europe-wide interests against partisan pressures.\n\nPolitical parties are fundamental institutions of democracy. And as mainstream parties decline, and politics fractures among newer and smaller parties, those institutions become weaker. If Europe\u2019s most important parties crumble or become unstable, to be replaced by new parties that lack institutional memory and resources, that leaves the system as a whole less stable, regardless of what kind of politics its leaders embrace.\n\nAnd even parties that have managed to remain popular with voters are still at risk of being divided or hollowed out by anti-establishment sentiment.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Conservative party leadership agreed to the 2016 Brexit referendum in order to stave off defections from the right wing of its base. The results were catastrophically destabilizing. The Labour Party, unlike most of its center-left brethren across Europe, managed to gain in voting share in the most recent election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has himself embraced anti-system politics in many ways, and his allies have clashed with the party mainstream from within.\n\nPhoto\n\nLosing the gatekeepers of democracy\n\nThe \u201cessential test\u201d for democratic resilience, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, both political scientists at Harvard, write in their new book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d is whether political leaders, and especially political parties, will work together to prevent extremists from gaining power.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are democracy\u2019s gatekeepers,\u201d they write. \u201cAlthough mass responses to extremist appeals matter, what matters more is whether political elites, and especially parties, serve as filters.\u201d\n\nAnd so to protect democracy, parties and other political elites need to keep would-be authoritarians off ballots at election time, root out extremists within their own party\u2019s ranks, refuse alliances with anti-democratic candidates or parties and work to isolate extremists rather than legitimizing them.\n\nWhen that does not happen, they warn, countries risk following in the footsteps of Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and other nations where elected leaders have chipped away at democracy from within.\n\nBut that kind of gatekeeping requires that parties have the strength to enforce discipline within their own ranks and the popularity to maintain voter good will. And as Europe\u2019s mainstream parties crumble, their gatekeeping capacity has, too.\n\nWorrying about the stability of some of the world\u2019s oldest and wealthiest democracies can seem like paranoia. But in an article in Foreign Affairs, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Erica Frantz, a professor at Michigan State University, warn that citizens in Europe \u201cshould hesitate before assuming that they are invulnerable to a populist-driven backslide.\u201d\n\nEurope, they write, is experiencing many of the factors that have led other established democracies to erode: rising populism, social polarization, weakening institutions, economic insecurity and public distrust of government. That does not mean Western Europe will turn into Venezuela, but its cherished democracies could grow less effective and more prone to extremism and demagoguery.\n\nThe incremental steps of democratic backsliding, they wrote, can mean that \u201cthere is no single moment that triggers widespread resistance or creates a focal point around which an opposition can coalesce.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, they warn, \u201cif left untamed, they will lead to grave consequences for global democracy.\u201d", "title": "How Germany\u2019s New Coalition Explains Europe\u2019s Uncertain Future", "authors": ["Amanda Taub", "The Interpreter"]}

Mr. Corbat had just 33 percent.\n\nBank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank.

But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.\n\nInvestors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week.

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Sure, I had had bouts with depression before, especially in winter. Seasonal affective disorder was first given a name in 1984 by Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal and his colleagues. I was a toddler then, but even when I was in grade school I knew what it was. My father always called it \u201cbaseball\u2019s off-season,\u201d saying the worst part of the year was the stretch from the final World Series game to the first day of spring training, a time when most of our six-member family would be folded into a long, black mood.\n\nI had gone to college in Tampa, which sidestepped the issue for a little while, but as an adult, in winter, I would fold again. So I set up a double-edged solution: I would sign up for a long spring race (from 10 miles to a marathon), which meant that I was exercising (always a useful tool against depression). It also meant that I would run long miles in the middle of the day, and soak up as much sun as I could in New Jersey in January, February and March.\n\nBut this year was different. I knew that I would never get my head above water if I stuck it out through another New Jersey winter. That\u2019s why, with no pet to care for, no house to pay for and a transportable job as a freelance writer, I opted out of the season and headed south.\n\nRunning still played a part in my treatment. I chose an easy running schedule to train for the Daytona Beach Half Marathon: no speed work, no hills, just plain old miles four days a week. On cooler \u2014 for Florida \u2014 days, I\u2019d run in the late morning, my skin tanning and highlights streaking through my hair two weeks in. For long Saturday morning runs, I would start before dawn and watch the sunrise along with drinkers and smokers and tourists. I\u2019m sure I ended up in the background of a lot of their photos.\n\nEvery day, I drove my newly adopted dog to a dog park one town over, where she would run around sniffing other dogs while I turned my face to a warm, welcoming sun, then drive home humming to whatever Top 40 hit was on the radio. I felt like I was a flower unfurling its petals at dawn. I started smiling again. I started flirting again.", "title": "How I Became a 37-Year-Old Snowbird", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "I told myself I would never fall down the \u201cwife trap rabbit hole.\u201d\n\nMy mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.\n\nLike so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.\n\nAnd so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.\n\nThen, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He\u2019s fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed.", "title": "How I Solved the Gender Labor Imbalance", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "It would have been possible to just write a story about this clumsy attempt to salvage diesel\u2019s declining reputation. But Jim Yardley, the editor on the story, pushed me to broaden the scope and use the monkey experiments as a window into the ways in which automakers have tried to influence the scientific debate about diesel, as well as the methods they use to exert political influence in Berlin and Brussels.\n\nThat broader story took a lot more reporting. Pinning down how the automakers used the studies to influence public policy was difficult. Environmental groups and lobbyist watchdog organizations told me that when corporations sponsor research, they rarely wave the studies around publicly. Rather, their front organizations manage to get the studies published in scientific journals, obscuring who paid for the research. The findings enter the bloodstream of the body politic, subtly influencing the debate.\n\nThe front organization that commissioned the monkey experiments and others related to diesel is the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T. To assess the group\u2019s impact on the debate, I obtained a list of its other studies.\n\nI discovered that some of the research had been cited by reputable organizations, including an arm of the British government. One study commissioned by the E.U.G.T., which cast doubt on whether traffic restrictions in cities led to cleaner air, influenced the judges in a court case in Austria to reject a suit by citizens of Graz who were pushing for the creation of a low-emissions zone in the city.\n\nI\u2019ve certainly had some tense conversations with auto companies and their representatives during the last couple of years. But they reacted fairly calmly when I asked them about the monkey research. Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW all distanced themselves from the experiments. After the article was published, all three companies took action against midlevel employees who had been responsible for overseeing the work of the front organization, relieving them of their duties pending internal investigations.\n\nThe carmakers\u2019 low-key response to my questions about the monkeys indicates that they may have underestimated what the article\u2019s repercussions would be. I know I did. I thought the story would make a splash, but I didn\u2019t expect it to become the top story in German media for several days; for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to weigh in with an expression of condemnation; and for the German Parliament to hold a debate on the issue.\n\nWhy the outrage over the fate of 10 macaque monkeys when Volkswagen had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the United States Clean Air Act and other charges? After all, we already knew that diesel exhaust has caused hundreds of thousands of people to die prematurely, and that Volkswagen and other European carmakers took advantage of weak enforcement to mislead the public about how much pollution their vehicles produced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI think the explanation is this: Until the 10 monkeys became part of the story, Volkswagen\u2019s fraud had no identifiable victims. When people die from lung cancer or heart attacks after breathing air polluted by diesel cars, it\u2019s impossible to point the finger at any one carmaker. The ill effects are cumulative and may take years to manifest themselves.\n\nThe 10 unfortunate monkeys, forced to breathe exhaust so that Volkswagen and the others could sell more cars, provided the scandal with its first specific casualties. They crystallized public frustration with the auto companies\u2019 behavior.\n\nAs the magazine Der Spiegel wrote in an editorial, \u201cThe faces of our animal relatives opened our eyes to the unscrupulousness of this industry.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, the monkey experiments may prompt action that watchdog groups have been seeking for years. Political leaders, fearful that their longtime acquiescence to the auto industry has become a liability, are talking about forcing all lobbyists to register and disclose their contributions to politicians, as they must already do in the United States. There are increasing calls for car companies to retrofit old diesels with better emissions equipment. And during the debate in Parliament, several representatives spoke of a need for \u201cculture change\u201d in the industry, a hint that they may push automakers to change their management.\n\nIn the days following the publication of my article, the No. 1 question readers asked was what happened to the monkeys \u2014 the answer to which I can now at least partly provide.\n\nAccording to the Albuquerque lab, the 2014 experiments did not kill them, and they were returned to the general population of primates kept by the lab. Their fate since then is unclear \u2014 a spokeswoman for the lab said it shares information about the medical conditions of its animals only with government regulators. But it is safe to say they are among the most influential nonhuman primates in German history.", "title": "How I Uncovered Volkswagen\u2019s Rigged Monkey Experiments", "authors": ["Jack Ewing"]}

I\u2019ve got such patchy knowledge of so much other music. It\u2019s a childish way of looking at things, but I will listen to Penderecki and think about how that kind of thing can be done with modern music, or how Messiaen\u2019s modes can work in the structure of Bach chorales. It feels like a really ugly cross-pollination.\n\nUgly?\n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got a bunch of beautiful animals in a room, crossbreeding into something revolting. But that\u2019s partly because there is so much in between that I don\u2019t understand or have never studied or don\u2019t know enough about.

I was so scared of it being pastiche. In a way it goes back to my first audition for a youth orchestra. I\u2019d never heard the real thing. I\u2019d been in small orchestras that couldn\u2019t play. Suddenly here\u2019s this room of 17- and 18-year-olds, and I\u2019d never heard this noise, and I\u2019ve never forgotten it. I still feel like, when I\u2019m doing film stuff, I\u2019m chasing that same fix. I know that eventually, after these months of work on paper, I know that eventually there will be a day, or if I\u2019m lucky two days, with an orchestra to record it all.\n\nPhoto\n\nHaving said that, the first stuff I sent to Paul he said was all too dark.

Then this alluring theme starts, and a hint of what could be a Bach chorale prelude filters through. Was that Bach-like element conscious?\n\nThat started with trying to work out what music could be used to describe the character of Reynolds [the designer]. I said to Paul, we should think about what music he would have listened to. I sold Paul the idea of Reynolds being into Glenn Gould, that Reynolds listened intensely to all those recordings. It was a good excuse to work on a slightly neurotic Bach-piano-style piano music, which seemed to fit him. And then Paul asked for it to be bigger and bigger and bigger. So eventually we did it with a full orchestra.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Are you a Britten fan at all?\n\nLots of it was coming from Paul as well as from Daniel [Day-Lewis, who plays Reynolds]. We talked about music in Britain in the \u201950s, and did lots of research, and among all this slightly twee, pastoral, folksy stuff, Britten really stood out for having the darkness to it.\n\nSo Daniel Day-Lewis gave input for the music?\n\nHe talked about Thomas Tallis a lot. How can music sound English and still be Romantic? One piece, \u201cAlma,\u201d for string quartet and piano, is the most English of everything. I\u2019m not sure why. It just has that kind of harmony to it. I feel like it\u2019s the closest we got.

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "For most of his 67 years, Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who projects the weary asceticism of a TV cop perpetually two weeks from retirement, might have been out of place among Mar-a-Lago\u2019s bronzed faces and gilded trimmings. But by mid-February, this was one of the few rooms where he could still expect such a warm reception. Back in Washington, the scandal surrounding his handling of abuse claims against a top aide, Rob Porter, hummed through its second week \u2014 an unusual longevity in a White House where news of a Trump lawyer\u2019s pre-election hush payment to a porn star had come and gone without great consequence. More surprising still was how quickly, and unshakably, the crisis attached itself to Kelly, whose sins \u2014 praising the aide too forcefully before his departure, purportedly sitting on the allegations for months without acting \u2014 felt airlifted from an era of more traditional Washington cover-ups. Kelly held onto his job through the weekend, which did not initially seem like a given. But Trump had already been musing privately about possible replacements.\n\nEven among Trump critics, Kelly once inspired uncommon sympathy. While other high-level officials, like Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, had invited doubts about how long they could possibly tolerate working in the administration, Kelly\u2019s responsibilities seemed uniquely masochistic: He was the chief disciplinarian in a famously undisciplined White House. \u201cYou never run into somebody like Trump in the military,\u201d Panetta told me. \u201cThey\u2019d usually get kicked out.\u201d The job itself was premised on a paradox: If Trump weren\u2019t Trump, Kelly\u2019s position would be bearable. And if Trump weren\u2019t Trump, you would not need a John Kelly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, Kelly\u2019s struggle has grown lonelier \u2014 informed, even before the Porter affair, by yawning cracks in his once-broad base of support. Some of Trump\u2019s deepest skeptics had convinced themselves, despite a career\u2019s worth of counterevidence, that a well-traveled military man might temper the president\u2019s instincts, particularly on immigration. Then there were Kelly\u2019s friends, who had already worried that the job was bending Kelly to its will, and not the other way around.\n\nShortly after Election Day, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, went to Trump Tower to see the president-elect. Trump was preparing to staff his cabinet, and he asked Cotton, an Iraq war veteran, to name the best general of this generation. Cotton chose Kelly. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t know about General Kelly and asked me to tell him more,\u201d Cotton told me. In December, Trump nominated Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nUnlike many prospective additions to the administration, Kelly had stayed out of the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Foreign Policy that July, he said he would be willing to serve in either a Trump or a Clinton administration but made plain his distaste for the \u201ccesspool of domestic politics.\u201d \u201cTo join in the political fray, I don\u2019t think it convinces anyone,\u201d he said, chiding fellow military leaders who had lined up behind candidates. \u201cIt just becomes a talking point on CNN.\u201d\n\nHis confirmation process was mostly incident-free, specked with the kind of John Wayne dialogue that had dazzled Trump from the start. Before Kelly\u2019s Senate hearing, an aide who helped him prepare, Blain Rethmeier, noticed the general had neglected to attach a flag pin to his lapel. \u201cBlain,\u201d Kelly told him, declining the pin, \u201cI am an American flag.\u201d He was confirmed on Inauguration Day, 88 votes to 11. \u201cA great choice,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said at the time.\n\nKelly grew up in Boston\u2019s Brighton section, the Catholic-school-educated son of a postal worker; fellow Marines later joked that his accent required a Boston-to-English translator. In his own telling, he was shaped by two forces in the neighborhood: men who had worn the military uniform \u2014 his father, his uncles, everyone on the block \u2014 and the ubiquitous drug use among his peers. \u201cHe would claim that growing up in South Boston, he lost most of everybody he grew up with to drugs,\u201d Adam Isacson, the director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told me, recalling meetings with Kelly when he led the United States Southern Command. \u201cIt was part of his persona.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Iraq war began, Kelly, by then a three-decade veteran of the corps, had become the first Marine promoted to brigadier general in an active combat zone in over half a century, according to the Marines. On Barack Obama\u2019s first trip to Iraq as the presumed Democratic nominee in July 2008, Kelly rode with him in an armored truck across Anbar Province. His career advanced rapidly during Obama\u2019s first term, and in 2012, he was named to head the Southern Command (\u201cSouthcom\u201d), charged with overseeing United States military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnder Obama, Kelly \u2014 a typically conservative Marine, friends say \u2014 was nominally tasked with steering the country toward policies he often abhorred. After officials pushed the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d Kelly seethed. \u201cMarines will die from this,\u201d he told colleagues at the Pentagon. (The Trump White House disputes this.) He was also a fierce defender of the status quo at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, which fell under his command, publicly criticizing efforts to close the facility and chafing at media accounts that humanized those being held there. When some detainees began a hunger strike during Obama\u2019s second term, Kelly feared that the issue was being framed too sympathetically. His charges were instructed to call the act \u201clong-term nonreligious fasting\u201d instead.\n\nBut perhaps Kelly\u2019s most instructive experiences at Southcom involved the scourge of trafficking \u2014 drugs, weapons, people. From command headquarters, just outside Miami, he tracked narcotics production in Colombia and Guatemala. At a forum in 2015, Kelly recalled meeting an official from Customs and Border Protection who oversaw some 200 miles of the Mexico-Texas line. \u201cI asked her how much cocaine she got last year. She said, proud as she could be, \u2018642 pounds,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s pocket litter to me. I got 191 metric tons last year.\u201d He also charted the rise of MS-13, an international criminal gang that had become a security threat across Central America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly seemed to see immigration almost entirely through the prism of security \u2014 paralleling Trump\u2019s campaign, which nodded to the zero-sum economic view of immigration prominent on the right for years, but dwelled far more on blood-and-guts anecdotes of violent crime by immigrants. Although Southcom\u2019s area of responsibility does not include Mexico, this did not discourage Kelly from holding forth on the country, making claims that, according to Obama-administration officials, sometimes contradicted the intelligence of Northcom, the Pentagon command covering Mexico. At the height of the Ebola scare of 2014, he suggested publicly that the disease would spark a stampede across the border, incensing White House staff members who thought he was stoking panic. \u201cIf it breaks out, it\u2019s literally, \u2018Katie, bar the door,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd there will be mass migration into the United States.\u201d\n\nAs he assumed control at Homeland Security, Kelly implied that his views on immigration were more nuanced than Trump\u2019s, infused with compassion for a region whose leaders he had come to know personally. In preconfirmation testimony, Kelly accused the United States of \u201cignoring what our drug demand does to the people of Central and South America,\u201d whose countries had devolved at times into \u201cnearly failed narco-states.\u201d He positioned himself as a moderate voice in sessions with lawmakers, casting doubt on the wisdom of a massive border wall. Speaking to a group of Democrats last year, he suggested that undocumented immigrants without a serious criminal footprint would not be enforcement priorities. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m the best thing to happen to DACA recipients,\u2019 \u201d Representative Nanette Diaz Barrag\u00e1n, a California Democrat, told me.\n\nThe benefit of the doubt lasted nine days. On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order barring entry to the United States by residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries, inciting large protests at airports across the country \u2014 and a backlash against Democrats who had voted to confirm Kelly, whose department was left to carry out the order. Kelly told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the chaos was \u201call on me.\u201d In reality, according to an exhaustive Inspector General\u2019s report released early this year, Kelly and his team were caught almost entirely off-guard. He told investigators that \u201che had assumed that White House staff had proactively engaged Congress and other stakeholders\u201d before the order was signed, according to the report. Publicly, Kelly cheered the spirit of the measure, arguing that a federal court order blocking the ban was preventing the nation from doing \u201call that we can to weed out potential wrongdoers from these locations.\u201d Privately, he faulted the execution. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again,\u201d he told the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Kelly was making good on a signature Trump campaign promise. Immigration officers arrested more than 140,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick. \u201cWe questioned the fact that many of these arrests were taking place when parents were dropping off their children to go to school,\u201d Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, a Democrat from New York who met with Kelly at the time, told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nBy then, most Democrats had seen enough. \u201cHe\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Schumer decided by February of last year, suggesting in an interview that Kelly was probably \u201cregretting going in.\u201d\n\nKelly betrayed no second thoughts in public. He also began taking on duties that appeared to be outside his jurisdiction. When news broke that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, worked to establish a secret communications channel with Russian diplomats during the transition, it was Kelly who defended the effort on television as \u201ca good thing.\u201d In May, addressing a private breakfast with former diplomats and foreign-policy experts, Kelly said he had suggested to Tillerson, the ever-beleaguered secretary of state, that he could \u201ctake care of Central America\u201d while Tillerson confronted first-order headaches like North Korea, according to a person in the room. (A White House spokesman disputes this account.)\n\nIt was no secret, by then, that Trump had grown disenchanted with his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who presided over a team consumed by squabbling factions, endless leaks and overbroad walk-in privileges for presidential face time. (During one Oval Office meeting Trump had with New York Times reporters in April, no fewer than 20 people came and went.) In an interview with The Times last December, Kelly said that he told Trump around this time that he did not believe the president \u201cwas being well served by the staff\u201d in some respects. A month and a half later, Kelly recalled, Trump called and said, \u201cI need you to be chief.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once, Vice President Mike Pence showed up for one unexpectedly. \u201cYou guys have the meeting,\u201d Kelly grumbled, walking off, according to a White House official who witnessed the exchange.\n\nFor decades, the White House chief of staff\u2019s mandate has been a kind of tough love \u2014 the capacity to close the door to the Oval Office and tell the president what he does not want to hear. \u201cAbove all, you are the honest broker of information,\u201d Chris Whipple, the author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a history of White House chiefs, told me. True to this template, Kelly clamped down on the free flow of information to Trump, who once rifled through Breitbart articles and conspiracy-stuffed printouts with impunity. Some executive riffraff was expelled altogether. \u201cHe fired me like a gentleman,\u201d says Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 11 days as communications director and scolds anyone who suggests it was 10. Those who dared attempt an unsanctioned chat with the president could expect a Kelly follow-up: \u201cYou want to be chief of staff?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe early purges, which included the exits of the advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, restored a measure of good will toward Kelly among Democrats. But again, Kelly\u2019s kinship with Trump on immigration was underestimated. \u201cPart of that is the Marine in him, part of that is the Irish guy in Boston who believes that in the end, you really do have to abide by the laws,\u201d Panetta, a friend of Kelly\u2019s, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s coming out now.\u201d\n\nIn November, as Homeland Security was set to extend residency permits for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States, Kelly made an 11th-hour plea to the department\u2019s acting secretary to reconsider the move. When the administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees \u2014 should it stay at 110,000? Fall to 50,000, the minimum recommended by Defense and State Department officials? Land somewhere in between? \u2014 Kelly offered his take: If it were his call, he said, the number would be between zero and one. The administration settled on 45,000.\n\nEven as Kelly has driven out the most flamboyant West Wing agitators \u2014 Scaramucci, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Bannon, Gorka \u2014 it has not gone unnoticed that Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old senior policy adviser and Trump\u2019s nativist id on immigration policy since the campaign, has thrived on Kelly\u2019s watch. \u201cHe turns out to have been more hawkish than I might have expected,\u201d Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the hard-line Center for Immigration Studies, told me of Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nIn January, several Senate moderates believed they were close to securing Trump\u2019s support for a compromise measure protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, in exchange for border-security funding and other policy adjustments. Trump invited some of them to a televised summit at the White House, where he told them he would approve any legislation they brought him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, gee, I want this, or I want that,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be signing it.\u201d He even assured Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that he welcomed a stand-alone bill protecting the Dreamers from deportation \u2014 anathema to the negotiating position of Republicans in Congress, some of whom rushed to dissuade him at the table.\n\nKelly sat silently through the televised session. But after about an hour, when the cameras were dismissed and the meeting began in earnest, he unburdened himself in what four attendees described as a caustic scolding. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fiddling around for years on immigration,\u201d he told lawmakers. The time had come, he said before leaving in a huff, to \u201cdo your job.\u201d Attendees were handed a document labeled \u201cMUST HAVE\u2019S,\u201d outlining the administration\u2019s demands: billions in border-wall funding, an end to \u201cextended chain migration\u201d and a move toward a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. These were requirements long pushed by Kelly and Miller and likely to sink any deal with Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Trump asked, according to three people present, eyeballing the list of what were ostensibly his own policy directives. He suggested the papers were unhelpful and could be disregarded. Lawmakers left the meeting unsure if the president knew his own administration\u2019s position, or if he was even responsible for it.\n\nDays later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Dick Durbin of Illinois and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina thought again that they could sell Trump on their plans, only to be thwarted anew. This time, they did not conceal their frustrations with Kelly in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was well served by his staff,\u201d Graham said of the president to reporters at the Capitol. And Kelly, he said, was \u201cpart of the staff.\u201d\n\nIn another meeting with Hispanic congressional Democrats later in January, Kelly made the case once more for a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. Members reminded him what he was asking of them. \u201cHe\u2019s saying this to 25 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus!\u201d Representative Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, an Illinois Democrat, told me. \u201cMy mom came with a fifth-grade education. Someone stood up and said to him, \u2018So you don\u2019t think we should even be here?\u2019 We\u2019re the children of those parents. And we\u2019re members of Congress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly\u2019s active role in immigration policy, Whipple told me, was highly unusual for a chief of staff, setting Kelly apart from even otherwise partisan warriors like Dick Cheney, who served as chief to Gerald Ford, and Rahm Emanuel, the first to hold the position under Obama. \u201cThis is abnormal,\u201d Whipple said. \u201cHe\u2019s been more partisan than almost any chief of staff I can think of.\u201d\n\nIt took a mass shooting and another round of Russia intrigue to elbow speculation about Kelly\u2019s job status, post-Porter scandal, temporarily out of the news. \u201cTrying to keep below the radar particularly after the Porter issue and my involvement was so inaccurately covered,\u201d Kelly told me in an email, declining an interview. But his standing has not necessarily rebounded. This fate seems to flow, in part, from the heightened initial expectations of him. But it also speaks to his shortage of allies in Trump\u2019s inner circle. Rivals, sensing a power vacuum, are wasting no time, spawning a succession of leaks and counterleaks that evoke the Priebus-era West Wing.\n\nToday Kelly holds the support of two incongruous constituencies: those who cheer him on immigration and those who assume, despite the strikes against him, that he is preventing catastrophes no one can see. But this base is shrinking. \u201cOne Donald is bad enough,\u201d Reines, one of the last Democratic holdouts, tweeted as Kelly cycled through conflicting explanations of the Porter timeline in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t need two.\u201d\n\nOlder friends have greeted recent events with a deeper despair. Some war buddies, eager to publicly support Kelly when he took the job, have begged off entirely. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to talk anymore about him,\u201d Mark Hertling, a retired three-star general who served with Kelly in Iraq, told me, \u201cgiven what I\u2019ve seen lately.\u201d\n\nFor John Allen, a retired four-star general who has known Kelly since the late 1970s and endorsed Clinton in 2016, the first distress signal seemed to come in October. Trump had upset the widow of La David T. Johnson, an Army sergeant who was killed in an ambush in Niger, by telling her that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d Defending himself afterward, Trump falsely accused Obama of not contacting the families of fallen troops at all, adding (truthfully) that Obama did not call Kelly when his son First Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nKelly, who had long avoided discussing his loss in detail, confirmed as much from the lectern of the White House briefing room. \u201cIt must have been enormously painful for him,\u201d Allen told me. \u201cJohn is very private in his grief.\u201d But Kelly went on to accuse Frederica Wilson, a Florida congresswoman who knew the widow and listened to Trump\u2019s phone call with her, of making self-aggrandizing remarks years earlier. A video from the time quickly proved him wrong, but Kelly never apologized. To friends who had winced often at Trump\u2019s conduct, but never Kelly\u2019s, it was agonizing to watch.\n\nIn the months since, Trump and Kelly have found new reasons to grow sick of each other. Even before the Porter maelstrom began dominating Trump\u2019s cable-news diet, the president had been smarting for weeks over Kelly\u2019s suggestion to Fox News that the president had \u201cevolved\u201d on his wall demands. Both episodes stirred latent frustrations with Kelly\u2019s imperious style, which had grated on Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a free spirit,\u201d Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser, said of the president. \u201cNobody handles Donald Trump. Nobody manages him. He resents those who try.\u201d Trump has been floating Gary Cohn, his economic adviser, as a possible replacement.\n\nBut on immigration, Kelly\u2019s legacy, such as it is, may already be secure. His tumble has coincided with what was supposed to be a period of congressional progress on the issue \u2014 testing the priorities of a president who would still like a wall but thrills at the prospect of any signing ceremony. After appearing inclined at times toward an agreement with Democrats before Kelly helped reel him back, Trump has by now wholly convinced them that he is not to be trusted to cut a deal. Once held up as the administration\u2019s most credible cross-aisle emissary, Kelly has instead become the figure \u2014 even more than Miller, from whom Democrats expected nothing less \u2014 most closely associated with White House intransigence. \u201cHe\u2019s not a martyr, and he\u2019s not a hostage,\u201d Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at Homeland Security under Obama who has worked with Kelly and who initially cheered his addition to the administration, told me. \u201cJohn Kelly is not saving us.\u201d\n\nThere is a favorite book of Kelly\u2019s that he has said he rereads at key moments of his career. It is \u201cThe General,\u201d a 1936 novel by C.S. Forester, set among British forces around World War I. Principally, it is about a commander unable to meet the moment. \u201cHe is a brave guy, a dedicated guy, a noble guy,\u201d Kelly said of the protagonist, Herbert Curzon, in a collection of book recommendations by military leaders published last year, \u201cbut a guy who in the end has become a corps commander \u2014 a three-star general \u2014 and when presented with an overwhelming German attack couldn\u2019t figure out how to deal with it because he\u2019d never developed himself intellectually.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOutmatched by his circumstances, Curzon resolves, at least, to fall on his terms. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the great lessons of the great master, if you will,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cand then he just decided one day to go down to his horse, grab his sword, and attack \u2014 with the intent of dying.\u201d", "title": "How Long Can John Kelly Hang On?", "authors": ["Matt Flegenheimer"]}

You don\u2019t need to know it to two decimal places, but within a reasonable range. If your range is 2.5 to 7, that doesn\u2019t tell you anything.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-1990s, when Mr. Blinder was at the Fed, he and Janet Yellen, then a Fed governor, tried to persuade the chairman Alan Greenspan that interest rate increases were needed because the unemployment rate was quickly falling below estimates of Nairu in the 6 percent and higher range.\n\nMr. Greenspan won the argument, as he almost always did at the Fed in that era. And with hindsight it seems he was correct. Unemployment kept falling through the late 1990s, and reached as low as 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000, without evident flares of inflation pressure.\n\nIndeed, the jobless rate in the United States has now fallen below 4.5 percent just three times since 1970 \u2014 the late 1990s, 2006-2007, and in the last year. In none of those times did inflation flare up (and in the current expansion, it hasn\u2019t flared up yet).\n\nLooking abroad is instructive, too. Each country has a distinct labor market that probably implies a different natural rate of unemployment. But it is striking that in Germany and Japan, joblessness levels have fallen in the last couple of years below estimates that officials in those countries have generally considered their Nairu \u2014 without inflation taking hold.\n\nThat tells some officials here, charged with making policy in 2018, that the sensible strategy is to see just how low joblessness can go without causing problems.\n\n\u201cWe have to have humility\u201d about where the natural rate of unemployment really is, said Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \u201cUltimately we\u2019re trying to assess supply and demand in the market for labor, and we can start by looking at the price. The price of labor has not been growing very quickly, and we\u2019ve been seeing job creation far in excess of what we need to keep up with labor force growth.\u201d", "title": "How Low Can Unemployment Really Go?

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "With billions of dollars in commercial time at stake, content providers, and especially media companies that own expensive sports rights, have raced to keep up. Scripted programming can have a long shelf life and be sold over time in a variety of ways, but the vast majority of sports is watched live, which means broadcasters need to capture every viewer possible and figure out how to count them.\n\nThe catch is that they aren\u2019t yet in agreement on how to do that.\n\n\u201cIn order for the industry to move forward, we have to coalesce around a single-source approach,\u201d said Cary Meyers, head of ESPN\u2019s consumer-research division, where the network is working directly with Nielsen on a live audience metric that would be a different version of TAD.\n\nNBC appears unwilling to take any chances with the Winter Games, particularly after facing an unexpected decline in traditional, or \u201clinear,\u201d TV ratings in Rio, when it had to offer free commercial time to advertisers to meet its ratings guarantees. Streaming surged during that period.\n\nLinda Yaccarino, NBC Universal\u2019s head of ad sales, has been a vocal critic of Nielsen in recent years, saying that the measurement company\u2019s methods don\u2019t accurately count all the new ways people are watching its shows. Network complaints have grown louder as the legacy media companies battle falling ratings and new competition for ad dollars from the likes of Facebook and YouTube, which is owned by Google.\n\nNielsen ratings for traditional television are based upon averaging every minute of viewing by a representative panel. NBC combines Nielsen\u2019s measures for its television channels with Adobe\u2019s measurement of streaming data to form TAD.\n\nAdvertising technology is changing constantly, and Nielsen has to carefully decide when a metric is ready for mainstream adoption. Megan Clarken, Nielsen\u2019s president of United States media (and at one time an Olympic-qualifying long jumper), said that a decade ago the company faced pressure to enter mobile measurement. If it had done so, Nielsen would have been pushing ultimately useless metrics to measure viewing on BlackBerry phones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat we do as a company is we watch for that activity, that evolution,\u201d she said, \u201cand what we aim to do is not be ahead of it, but be with it, and certainly not behind it.\u201d\n\nWhile analysts said it was smart of NBC to push its own metric for the Games, it is also the right move for Nielsen to proceed carefully as it develops an industry standard for tracking viewers across a \u201cdizzying array\u201d of consumer devices in the digital world, said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the digital video industry is pretty much in agreement that 30 to 40 percent of the ad impressions that are delivered out there don\u2019t really exist,\u201d said Mr. Morgan, whose firm works with brands on targeted TV ads. \u201cYet nobody would say 30 to 40 percent of TV\u2019s viewing audience doesn\u2019t exist. So I think Nielsen is very, very afraid of going into a Wild West environment where it is wide open to fraud and bots.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nielsen, while measuring authentic digital viewing is difficult, it is no more difficult than doing so for television. But despite the ambiguity of the measuring sticks, advertisers don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to impress a mass audience over 17 days.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to sit on the sidelines because, \u2018Hey \u2014 funky measurement,\u2019\u201d said Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media-buying arm of WPP. \u201cThat sort of defeats the point of what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

The Olympics are a unique property, with thousands of hours of programming playing out on broadcast and cable channels, unlike a hit drama like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which would never be shown across a broadcast and cable channel simultaneously.\n\nThe Olympics is the perfect petri dish for audience measurement,\u201d said Mr. Lovinger of NBC. The network\u2019s traditional television ratings during the Rio Games were down 15 percent compared with the London Games four years earlier, and since the network had made separate linear and digital ratings guarantees for Rio, it was left \u201cwithout the ability to manage delivery across the Games,\u201d Mr. Lovinger said.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Olympics in Rio and you look at the kind of decline in linear television viewing and the supplement of digital viewing, either simultaneous or delayed, and it is obviously a material difference,\u201d said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, TAD seems to be doing its job. Across the first four nights of the Olympics, ratings for NBC only were down 15 percent from the comparable nights in Sochi four years ago. But the total audience was down just 7 percent.

Call it solidarity in partisanship \u2014 a longing for clear lines that cut across policy issues, rather than a wet blanket of consensus that covers over sociopolitical fractures.\n\nBut is it what voters want, too?\n\nIt is conventional wisdom that the consensus politics of Ms. Merkel, Mr. Schulz and their generational peers strengthened the political fringes, especially the far right.

So she looked to the 2014 Sochi Games as another chance for the podium.\n\nBut Nagasu \u2014 famously, and heartbreakingly for her \u2014 was passed up for the United States team that year, even though she finished third at the United States nationals. Three Americans not named Mirai Nagasu went to Sochi instead, chosen by a committee considered the skaters\u2019 body of work that season, not merely their performance at nationals.\n\nNagasu cried almost nonstop in the weeks and months after being passed over. She blamed herself for being lazy. She felt as if her chance at an Olympic medal had vanished. She considered hanging up her skates, wondering if her very public journey as a skater who was brilliant but erratic was worth it. At 14, she was the second-youngest skater ever to win a United States championship, and then things grew complicated when her body started changing.\n\nWhat pulled her back into skating was an April 2014 trip to Colorado Springs to visit a friend, Agnes Zawadzki. Zawadzki was training with Tom Zakrajsek, a coach who once worked with one of Nagasu\u2019s biggest competitors, the 2010 Olympian Rachael Flatt.\n\nNagasu had always admired Flatt\u2019s consistency, because it had always been Nagasu\u2019s weakness. She took a few sessions with Zakrajsek and decided that the 2018 Olympics could be within her reach. She asked Zakrajsek to coach her, and packed up her Honda Civic for her new life in Colorado.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe daughter of Japanese immigrants, Nagasu had wanted to move out of her parents\u2019 house in Arcadia, Calif., when she was a rebellious 17-year-old.

After many failed attempts, she mastered meatloaf and baked desserts for her friends at the rink. She adopted her first of three dogs, took college classes and began dating Darian Weiss, an actor, and their relationship grew serious. She eventually moved into her own house.\n\nTo help pay the bills, she got a job that was far different from when she worked at her family\u2019s restaurant, where as a little girl she was paid in quarters for washing dishes. She became an \u201cice girl\u201d for the Colorado Avalanche during the 2015-16 hockey season, and her task was to clean the ice with a shovel while wearing a tiny skirt and crop top.\n\nLiving a real life, an adult\u2019s life, outside of the rink has helped her focus inside the rink even more. In her sport, that\u2019s usually a foreign concept.\n\nPhoto\n\nNagasu was rejuvenated by Zakrajsek\u2019s technical help but also by his pep talks. On Saturdays, he brings his skaters in for sports concepts classes, where he plays clips from inspirational movies or gives motivational lessons.\n\nAs for Nagasu\u2019s experience with missing the 2014 Games, Zakrajsek said they had spent about five minutes on it in the past four years. There was too much ahead of them, they decided, to look back and wallow.\n\nAhead of them was something bigger: a triple axel. It\u2019s a jump that only two female skaters \u2014 Mao Asada and Midori Ito of Japan \u2014 had landed at the Olympics.\n\nAt Nagasu\u2019s age, though, learning a new jump was virtually unheard-of. The conventional wisdom in skating is that young girls learn to jump, and that women only refine what they learned as young girls. But the jump garners a tremendous number of points because of its difficulty.

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "The way we use \u201centitled\u201d feels less strange when you consider that its two meanings have slightly different origins. Once upon a time, \u201centitlement\u201d was, quite literally, something granted by a higher authority: A \u201cnoble\u201d person pleased the sovereign, perhaps by acquiring land or fighting bravely, and in return the sovereign bestowed upon him special rights and privileges, perks not afforded to a commoner, including the right not to have their estate expropriated by the crown. \u201cEntitlement\u201d was a recognition of service, a promise of specific legal benefits. In some cases it came with an actual title, like the feudal \u201cbaron.\u201d\n\nSomething similar has been true in the United States, where \u201centitlements\u201d refers to government benefit programs not subject to budgetary discretion \u2014 assistance that the state was obligated, on levels both legal and societal, to provide to all eligible citizens. According to the linguist Geoff Nunberg, it was sometime after the publication of \u201cThe Culture of Narcissism,\u201d an influential 1979 book by Christopher Lasch, that a certain negative connotation began to spread. Legitimate \u201centitlement\u201d and an illegitimate sense of entitlement merged. You might now be an entitled person: someone whose privilege leads to arrogance, snobbery and rudeness, someone who expects to be waited on, provided for, deferred to.\n\nThis was an unfortunate development for those who depended on entitlement programs, who were increasingly cast as undeserving \u2014 people who \u201cchose\u201d to be poor, via laziness and lack of responsibility, and yet felt \u201centitled\u201d to governmental support. Even before Lasch\u2019s book, Ronald Reagan, during his first run for president, held up an actual career criminal \u2014 a con woman, identity thief and suspected kidnapper believed to have bilked the government of untold thousands of dollars \u2014 as a symbol of excess, conjuring around her a world of fantastical \u201cwelfare queens\u201d: enemies of the bootstrapping individualist spirit of America, coddled and demanding and overly dependent on programs they were, in fact, legally entitled to use. The apotheosis of this concept was laid out by Mitt Romney in 2012, when he declared that 47 percent of voters were dependent on the government, saw themselves as victims and believed \u201cthat they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that\u2019s an entitlement.\u201d It was not his job, he argued, to care about such people, whom he\u2019d \u201cnever convince\u201d that they should \u201ctake personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d\n\nOf course, it did not escape American voters that as the very wealthy scion of a very powerful family, Romney was the epitome of an \u201centitled\u201d man in the original, feudal sense; his entitlement was hereditary.

They zoned in on how much they needed, saved aggressively and invested smartly and early; now, Ms. Robin lives off the income she earns from those investments. And she is working with the Millennial Money blogger Grant Sabatier (the millionaire whose story originally piqued my interest in the book) to create an online community for \u201cYour Money\u201d devotees.

I also witnessed firsthand the sustainable way my family and others lived there. Most had fruit trees bearing coconuts, star fruit or mangoes growing on the land surrounding their houses, and my grandmother and aunts owned hogs and chickens that they\u2019d eventually sell or eat. Family gatherings happened in my aunt\u2019s living room, with one cousin contributing a few jumbo-size Brahma or Presidente bottles of beer and an uncle or aunt, a portion of the meal. When one of the wealthier neighbors in our countryside built a well, he installed a spout outside his home so anyone could fill their buckets with clean water. It was nothing like the drinks-after-work, brunch-every-weekend, treat-yourself life I lived in New York, and yet it was no less joyful.\n\nI know much of what I witnessed in the Dominican Republic isn\u2019t replicable here (it\u2019s much harder to raise goats or pigs in my concrete yard in Queens), and that frugality as a choice is a privilege that does not solve the real issues of inequality that force many to live paycheck-to-paycheck.

{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "The secret to a narrower waistline and a longer life span might be found in the corridors of our minds as much as in the cardio rooms of our gyms. A recent epidemiological study suggests that our beliefs about how much we exercise may substantially influence our health and longevity, even if those beliefs are objectively inaccurate \u2014 which hints that upending our thinking about exercise might help us whittle away pounds, whether we work out more or not.\n\nThe study, published in Health Psychology, grew out of research by one of its authors, Alia Crum, the head of the Mind & Body Lab at Stanford University. Crum and her co-author studied 84 female hotel-room attendants, who told the researchers that they felt they completed little or no daily exercise, although their work consisted mostly of physical labor. Crum and her colleague explained to half of them that, in fact, they were meeting or exceeding national recommendations for 30 minutes of daily exercise; a month later, when the researchers checked back, the women said they believed they were getting more exercise than before. They had lost weight and body fat and developed lower blood pressure. But in fact, their daily exertions were the same.\n\nFor the new study, Crum and a different co-author, Octavia Zahrt, turned to two federal databases, the National Health Interview Survey and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which contain health data about representative samples of Americans. The scientists homed in on information from 61,141 participants who answered questions about whether they felt they were getting more, less or about the same amount of exercise as most people their age. Many had also worn accelerometers to objectively track their physical activity. Their records also included general health measures.\n\nThe researchers then linked their samples to data from the National Death Index to determine whether and when participants died. They found a strong correlation between people\u2019s dying early and their believing that they were relatively inactive, even if their accelerometer data indicated that they were getting as much exercise as others their age in this group. Risk of early death was up to 71 percent higher than for the group that, correctly or not, felt confident that they exercised more than their peers. This correlation held true when the researchers controlled for chronic diseases, socioeconomic status, smoking and other factors.\n\nThis type of study cannot prove that exercise beliefs directly cause life spans to shorten or grow; it can show only that the two issues are related. But a perception that other people your age out-exercise you \u201ccould have physiological costs,\u201d Zahrt says \u2014 by, for example, increasing levels of stress hormones, which are known to have deleterious health effects.\n\nSelf-comparisons might also dampen exercise motivation, leading to declining health. But already, this study intimates that \u201cour mind-sets color our experience of the world,\u201d Zahrt says.

But when I asked him to elaborate, he waved off the question. \u201cIt was boring.\u201d\n\nBoring? I had heard soldiers say they experienced periods of boredom on deployment, but I had never heard anyone sum up time in a war zone that way. I emailed the Army to verify details of his service. While I waited to hear back from them, my colleagues and I combed through alt-right podcasts in which he talked about his life.\n\nImage Emma Cott and Eli Mosley before an on-camera interview. Credit Andrew Michael Ellis for The New York Times\n\nThe podcasts were laced with the most abhorrent racist vulgarities I had ever heard. Not only did they reveal more about Eli\u2019s war story, but they also gave me insight into how he talked before he became media conscious and sanitized his message. With me, he insisted that the media unfairly applies labels like white supremacist and neo-Nazi to members of the alt-right \u201cto browbeat white people out of identity politics.\u201d But in the podcasts, recorded less than a year ago, he and his friends were unabashedly racist and anti-Semitic. He also spun tales of being embedded with the Iraqi Army, of being on the lookout for Chechen snipers, and of killing \u201cmuds,\u201d a racial slur for Arabs.\n\nWhen I got paperwork back from the Army and the National Guard confirming that he had never deployed, I was not surprised. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t believe he would lie so boldly, first to his fellow members of the alt-right and then to a Times reporter, on camera.\n\nHis parents declined to speak with me, but I called some of his former friends and fellow soldiers, who told me Eli had wanted to deploy but his timing was off: He graduated from high school in 2010 and went straight on to a couple of semesters of college; by the end of 2011, the last troops had left Iraq. They also confirmed that Eli\u2019s unit in the Pennsylvania National Guard did not deploy anywhere else during the roughly six years he served, and neither did he.", "title": "How Our Reporter Uncovered a Lie That Propelled an Alt-Right Extremist\u2019s Rise", "authors": []}

In December, it sent a letter to island senators, predicting tourism losses in the wake of same-sex marriage restriction. It cited the case of the transgender bathroom bill, rescinded last year, that cost North Carolina an estimated $3.76 billion in business and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed in 2016 by then-governor Mike Pence in Indiana, which allowed business owners to deny services to patrons based on their sexual orientation.

The elevation, the rotations and the landings were there, and he scored a 94.25. But with the rise of his younger contenders and the increasing dazzle and danger of the sport, the feeling was there that it was not quite good enough for a gold.\n\nSure enough, young Hirano surpassed him on his second run, popping back-to-back 1440s.

Founded by Brian Ballard, a lobbyist based in Tallahassee, Fla., who was a leading fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, transition and inauguration, Ballard Partners has signed contracts with government entities or political parties in Albania, the Dominican Republic, Kosovo and Turkey, all since the inauguration.\n\nThose firms, which have not been accused of impropriety, disclosed the foreign contracts to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires anyone who lobbies or does public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work and payments for it. The act is intended to prevent foreign actors from surreptitiously influencing American public policy.\n\nBut for years, many American consultants have skirted the law\u2019s requirements. Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry has focused on such undisclosed lobbying among some of its leading practitioners, including Mr. Manafort, who helped pioneer the model for international consulting three decades ago. The investigation has left other firms rushing to ensure their own compliance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is creating concern in the Washington lobbying community about not only complying with FARA, but also a new emphasis on enforcement that perhaps folks didn\u2019t think was happening or would happen,\u201d said Thomas J. Spulak, a lawyer in the Washington office of King & Spalding who specializes in lobbying compliance.\n\nMr. Mueller has scrutinized Skadden on two fronts \u2014 its own work for Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, and its role advising to two other powerhouse Washington lobbying firms paid to bolster his government, Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group.\n\nMr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates of orchestrating a complicated scheme through which Mercury and Podesta were paid about $1 million each through a nonprofit front group to advocate on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Mr. Gates admitted that he knowingly misled Skadden \u2014 though the firm is not named in court filings \u2014 in a scheme to avoid FARA registration by indicating incorrectly that the nonprofit was not supervised or controlled by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government. Relying on that information, Skadden prepared a legal opinion in 2012 that the lobbying firms used in opting not to register under FARA.\n\nSkadden\u2019s opinion, which was written by a partner, Kenneth A. Gross, and an associate, and was reviewed by The New York Times, asserted that the firms were not required to register because their client, the Brussels-based European Center for a Modern Ukraine, \u201cis a private nongovernmental organization\u201d not controlled or funded by a foreign government or political party.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Justice Department, which enforces FARA, began investigating the arrangement in 2016, and Mercury and Podesta registered, belatedly, under the act last year. The special counsel has continued looking into the matter, subpoenaing the firms for testimony about their Ukraine work.\n\nDespite Mr. Gates\u2019s admission that he misled Skadden, people who worked with Podesta and Mercury privately blame the law firm for the faulty guidance.\n\nMercury, which relied on Skadden for years for FARA advice and for assistance last year in responding to subpoenas from the special counsel, is no longer working with Skadden, according to three people in the lobbying industry who were briefed on the change.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lawrence S. Spiegel, a partner who specializes in government enforcement and white-collar crime, has been assigned to handle interactions with the special counsel, and Ms. Porter noted that the firm dismissed Mr. van der Zwaan and said that the lying charges he pleaded guilty to are \u201ccontrary to our values, policies and expectations.\u201d\n\nBut Skadden may not be able to limit its legal exposure by distancing itself from Mr. van der Zwaan if the special counsel can implicate the firm in wrongdoing in the work or payments on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics.\n\n\u201cWhy he was lying is a big question, and did anyone else at the law firm know he was lying?\u201d Ms. Roiphe said. \u201cIf he was lying for his own purposes, I don\u2019t think that knowledge would be imputed to other lawyers at the firm.\u201d\n\nThe answers to those questions are not entirely clear.\n\nMr. van der Zwaan admitted misleading prosecutors about two conversations in September 2016 with Mr. Gates and an unidentified business associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort. They discussed their belief that Skadden\u2019s work for Mr. Yanukovych exposed the firm to possible criminal charges in Ukraine. No such charges have been filed.\n\nAfter the conversation with the business associate, prosecutors said, Mr. van der Zwaan called the senior Skadden lawyer on the Ukrainian project, Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Court filings do not reveal what was discussed, and Mr. Craig was not identified by name by prosecutors.\n\nSkadden worked for the Ukrainian government on a 2012 report analyzing the prosecution of one of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s leading political rivals, the former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates used an offshore account to \u201cfunnel $4 million to pay for the report,\u201d according to court papers, which note that the financial arrangement \u201cwas not disclosed.\u201d It is not clear how much of the $4 million went to Skadden.\n\nAdding a layer of intrigue, a consultant who worked on the report said that it was facilitated in part by Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a former Russian Army linguist and longtime associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort who is \u201cassessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Kilimnik did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study was used by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s allies to rebut international criticism that the prosecution and jailing of Ms. Tymoshenko was politically motivated and lacked sufficient evidence. But it was widely dismissed as a flawed attempt to paper over concerns about Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s abuses, and other lobbyists promoting Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government said they declined to promote the report for lack of credibility.\n\nSkadden did not respond to questions about the financing of its Ukraine work, but it said in a statement that the report was independent and noted that it found that Ms. Tymoshenko \u201cwas denied basic rights under Western legal standards.\u201d\n\nThe Washington lobbyists who worked on the issue with Mercury and Podesta said that Mr. Craig himself was involved in promoting the report to journalists and members of Congress \u2014 activity that experts said should have prompted FARA registration requirements.\n\nSkadden internally reviewed the FARA implications of its Ukraine work before deciding not to register, according to the consultant who worked with the firm on the report.\n\nMs. Porter, the Skadden spokeswoman, said that neither Mr. Craig nor any of the firm\u2019s other lawyers \u201cengaged in any activity that required them or the firm to register under FARA.\u201d Mr. Craig did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLess than a year and a half after the release of the Skadden report, Mr. Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia amid street protests over his government\u2019s corruption and its pivot toward Moscow.

They channeled their newfound energy into a series of broad-based umbrella groups, including the National Social Democratic Front and the National Salvation Front (or the \u201cLi\u00ean Minh,\u201d \u201cThe League\u201d). This unprecedented outburst of collective action was propelled by a dawning awareness that the South\u2019s arcane factions were no match for the Communist political machine.\n\nBeyond these uncharacteristic expressions of camaraderie, the post-Tet groundswell also breathed life into the South\u2019s new constitutional system, hitherto scorned or dismissed after the previous year\u2019s rigged presidential election. With the country reeling from the bloodshed, fledgling institutions like the revived National Assembly provided a blueprint for political cooperation, and a forum for republican constitutionalists who, whatever their reservations about the military regime, saw no future for themselves under one-party Communist rule.\n\nInfuriated by the violence, longtime government critics hastened to denounce the Communist attacks. Even the An Quang Buddhist group, whose 1963 and 1966 rebellions had brought the state to its knees, now cast its lot with the new constitutional system. Shaken by the ferocity of the onslaught in central Vietnam, An Quang ruled out accommodation with the Communists. Though there was little love for the South Vietnamese military, the group\u2019s lay leaders opted to take their chances under Saigon\u2019s uneven authority, which they judged far less capable than Hanoi of fulfilling its authoritarian aspirations.\n\nTo that end, An Quang raised eyebrows in 1970 by embracing and prevailing in the Senate elections, securing a third of the contested seats. More remarkably, as the political situation deteriorated in subsequent years, An Quang refrained from actively challenging the state, even as traditionally loyal parties took to the streets in anger. An Quang\u2019s unexpected restraint was a critical if overlooked factor in prolonging South Vietnam\u2019s survival, and a symbol of the constitutional system\u2019s squandered potential.\n\nMeanwhile, heartened by the post-Tet spirit of determination and solidarity, the South\u2019s urban civil society implored the state to capitalize on that spirit by carrying out much-needed reforms.\n\nPhan Quang Dan, an opposition leader admired for bravely enduring torture by government henchmen, was one of many who leapt at the newfound possibilities. Dan proclaimed Tet to be \u201ca tremendous opportunity to turn a temporary military success into a decisive political victory \u2014 if it is seized upon by the South Vietnamese government to move forward fast, reorganize the military and the administration, wipe out corruption, carry out sweeping land reforms, mobilize active popular participation and achieve national unity.\u201d\n\nThis was, to be sure, a tall order. Still, as the military\u2019s cocksure vice president, Nguyen Cao Ky, observed during a March 1968 radio interview, \u201cI know that they\u201d \u2014 Saigon residents \u2014 \u201cstill don\u2019t like us very much, but on the other hand, at least I\u2019m now sure they also detest Communists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithin Ky\u2019s characteristically glib remarks, however, lay an uncomfortable truth for Saigon\u2019s ruling generals: Waves of anti-Communist anger after Tet were no assurance of loyalty to the much-reviled military regime.\n\nConsider, for instance, events in the city of Hue, where the gradual revelation of a brutal Communist massacre enraged and galvanized informed Southerners. But while the city\u2019s plight remains a symbol of Communist ruthlessness, reactions at the time were often nuanced, and multifaceted. Penned in the wake of the massacre, Trinh Cong Son\u2019s \u201cSong for Human Corpses\u201d emphasized collective sorrow rather than assigning blame, while the novelist Nha Ca\u2019s \u201cMourning Headband for Hue\u201d controversially tasked the entire nation with responsibility for ending the bloodshed.\n\nHue residents, meanwhile, were incensed by Communist kidnappings and executions \u2014 but also by indiscriminate American firepower. They reserved special contempt for the South Vietnamese military, which had fled at the first sign of trouble only to pillage the city\u2019s remains once the dust settled.\n\nIn this regard, Hue\u2019s experience was not atypical. Flight followed by looting was a recurring pattern for the South Vietnamese military, which repeated its Hue performance in Soc Trang, Da Lat and Vinh Long, among other provincial towns. The garrison at Tuy Hoa, the capital of Phu Yen province, vanished before a shot was fired. Reinforcements eventually arrived, but only after the Communists left of their own accord. The troops, nonetheless, staged an elaborate victory procession followed by a comprehensive sacking of the town. \u201cThe army didn\u2019t defeat the Communists, it defeated us,\u201d a local civilian lamented.\n\nAmerican responses were likewise roundly condemned. Hoping to dislodge Communist resistance, American air and artillery strikes leveled the city of Nha Trang, while over 3,000 houses were destroyed in Saigon\u2019s District 8 alone. Nearby Gia Dinh province, meanwhile, saw an estimated 20,000 residents left homeless during the first few weeks of the campaign.\n\nThe nationwide barrage fueled a spiraling anti-American backlash. By the early 1970s, United States personnel were subject to routine street confrontations, and increasingly confined to remote bases. All the while, conspiracy-minded Vietnamese devoured rumors of C.I.A. collusion in the Communist attacks, an apparent pretext for accelerating American withdrawal. Responding to the outcry, the Lower House of the National Assembly issued a formal complaint, and government mouthpieces like the newspaper Cong Chung (The Public) charged the United States with destroying Hue.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Having witnessed the military\u2019s cowardice, exploitation of civilian misery and inability to resist the initial attacks, rural constituents lost faith in the state\u2019s ability or desire to protect them.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the notion that Tet marked an irrevocable defeat for the southern communists, the aftermath was a fluid and protracted affair. Through much of 1968, the Communists strengthened their position in large swathes of the countryside, pinning American and South Vietnamese ground troops in bases and cities. Initial losses were balanced by ramped-up infiltration from the North, albeit at the cost of mounting regional tensions within the ranks. Only the following year, after an American counterattack characterized by indiscriminate firepower and heavy civilian casualties, did the military balance gradually turn \u2014 and even then, the Communist retreat was tactical as much as imposed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResponding to waning civilian morale after their promises of imminent victory proved hollow, Communist partisans ruthlessly applied the stick, intensifying conscription and assassinating those who dared side with the Saigon regime. But they also took care to dangle carrots. In Phuoc Tuy province, for instance, cadres went door-to-door collecting lists of required medications, which they procured on the black market and distributed to grateful villagers.\n\nIn part through such efforts, the Communists\u2019 political network stayed intact even as the military laid low. Income taken in by the South covered barely 30 percent of expenses, but Communist tax collection continued apace. After Tet, the C.I.A. reported, the Communists remained able to \u201cmobilize from within South Vietnam most of the funds and nonmilitary supplies needed to support the Communist insurgency.\u201d The Viet Cong \u201cexercise considerable control over the production, processing and movement of many commodities essential to South Vietnam\u2019s economy,\u201d while its \u201ctax system draws revenues from virtually every segment of the\u201d South\u2019s economy. Even France\u2019s Michelin rubber plantations, clustered in the nearest province west of Saigon, made regular payments to Communist coffers.\n\nYears after the attacks, the Communist presence around the capital remained formidable. In Long An province, immediately south of Saigon, American intelligence conceded that nearly half of the Communists\u2019 village-level revolutionary committees were as effective as the South Vietnamese state in supplying goods and services. The Viet Cong, it went on, \u201chave been able to organize regular schools in certain areas and have even staged public spectacles.\u201d\n\nFighting a losing political battle, the South Vietnamese government acknowledged that sweeping reforms were required if it was to stand any chance of wooing the disaffected rural majority. But as usual, progress was delayed for years by perennial political infighting.\n\nPresident Thieu\u2019s archrival, the flamboyant Vice President Ky, seized on Tet as a chance to turn the tables on his nemesis. Ky charged Thieu with inaction, promising dramatic responses of his own, including the liberation of the North by force. Behind the scenes, he worked to assemble backing for a military coup. But when word of Ky\u2019s plotting reached the American Embassy, he was summoned for a dressing-down, with the deputy ambassador, Samuel Berger, pounding his fists on the table in frustration.\n\nAssured of American backing, Thieu quietly made his move, relieving Ky\u2019s military loyalists of their duties, including some of the army\u2019s most capable commanders.\n\nParanoid and reclusive, Thieu continued lashing out at rivals, real and imagined, including Tran Ngoc Chau, an esteemed counterinsurgency specialist. Chau\u2019s unconstitutional arrest, however, provoked howls of protest in the National Assembly, which retaliated by delaying Thieu\u2019s signature Land Reform program for well over a year.\n\nTo his credit, Thieu was the driving force behind that initiative, called \u201cLand to the Tiller,\u201d overcoming American reservations through the tireless efforts of his agriculture minister, Cao Van Than. But while South Vietnam\u2019s proponents then and since have seen land reform as a panacea for the government\u2019s enduring unpopularity, the results at the time were far more mixed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe breakthrough came from Saigon\u2019s de facto recognition of the Communists\u2019 own wildly popular land redistribution efforts, implemented across the South years or even decades earlier. To avoid eruptions of animosity when absentee owners attempted to reclaim requisitioned land, the government sagely bestowed legal title to beneficiaries of previous Communist land reform campaigns.\n\nHowever sound a policy, this approach enraged the government\u2019s beleaguered rural loyalists, who accused the state of betrayal for rewarding those who had backed the other side. Military veterans, often forced to abandon their land after impressment, also greeted the news with dismay.\n\nWorse still, implementation proved slow, uneven and plagued by corruption. For years to follow, pockets of farmers continued paying rent on land that neither the government nor former landlords deigned to inform them they now owned. Refugee beneficiaries complained that their allotments were inaccessible or unsafe due to military disinterest in providing security, while communities in arid Central Vietnam bemoaned land valuations based on those of the more fertile Mekong Delta. Loans for sorely needed farm equipment were all too often siphoned off by unscrupulous local officials, and recipients among the country\u2019s ethnic minorities despaired at systematic Vietnamese encroachment.\n\nWhile land reform was a welcome effort that achieved some qualified success, it did little to diminish Communist influence, or alleviate soaring inflation and corruption. In areas once held by the Communists, the impact was titular rather than transformative, with farmers awarded title to lands they assumed they had already long since owned. If anything, absentee landlords were the primary beneficiaries, granted generous American-subsidized compensation for property they had little prospect of recovering.\n\nBack in the urban centers, meanwhile, the burst of post-Tet solidarity gave way to anger over plummeting living standards and corruption. Starved of government attention, let alone funding, pan-religious coalitions like the nominally state-backed National Social Democratic Front descended into scheming and bickering, while provincial enthusiasts waited in vain for leadership from the capital. In fact, as President Thieu\u2019s private secretary later revealed, covert C.I.A. subsidies to the N.S.D.F. were instead pocketed for personal use by high-ranking officials. Absent official backing, these promising stabs at political unity died on the vine.\n\nInstead, fresh from re-election after his opponents withdrew in protest, Thieu was busy preparing his own decidedly unpluralistic political vehicle: \u201cthe Democracy Party.\u201d In reality, the party was anything but democratic, with its compulsory civil service participation and clandestine military cells earning unfavorable comparisons with the Communist Party. But Thieu, who had long since tired of opposition and resistance to his agenda, envisioned the Democracy Party as a means of binding anti-Communists together from above. Ramming through decrees that all but proscribed any other party, he then coerced bureaucrats and military officers into joining Democracy Party ranks.\n\nBut rather than rallying southern society behind his rule, as Thieu had implausibly gambled, the Democracy Party further alienated the country\u2019s most committed anti-communists, who instead pledged to uphold their previous allegiances. The political party decrees also dealt a death blow to the Senate, by now the South\u2019s last independent political institution. In 1967, a new generation of sincere, enthusiastic politicians had won seats; by 1973, when Thieu replaced the Senate with his own handpicked politicians, the institution\u2019s resistance had been broken.\n\nOn the eve of the Senate\u2019s 1973 replacement, an onlooker recorded the despondent remarks of a departing member: \u201c\u2018The noble experiment at constitutionalism launched in 1967 was turning sour.\u2019 He had been surprised in 1967, [the senator] said, \u2018at the number of qualified people who engaged themselves enthusiastically in the experiment by running for office that year\u2019 \u2026 \u2018These good people are retreating once again,\u2019 the senator concluded, \u2018once more waiting for some watershed before engaging themselves.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the final years of the war, even ferociously anti-Communist northern Catholic groups, long the state\u2019s staunchest proponents, lost faith in the state\u2019s ability to address the nation\u2019s cascading crises. The prevailing sense of dread was a far cry from the energy and purpose that had invigorated the anti-Communist South after Tet. And it took its toll on the military, whose rank and file likewise lost faith in the country\u2019s unresponsive leaders. Drained of discipline and confidence by the spring of 1975, the South\u2019s lavishly equipped military was once again set on its heels by the first Communist skirmishes, with retreating soldiers commandeering frantic civilians\u2019 escape crafts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, belief in the notion of a non-Communist-led South Vietnam was always substantial, if also fragmented and disorganized. For all its flaws, the state was no mere puppet, and as a generation of American statesmen discovered, control of Saigon\u2019s purse-strings in no way bestowed control over its politics.

It was there that Radhanath Sikdar, a young Indian mathematician, and a group of so-called human computers, used triangulation to collect data on the mountain, known then as Peak XV.\n\nFolklore has it that when Mr. Sikdar finished calculating his findings in 1852, he made a beeline for the office of a superior stationed in the foothills of the Himalayas and announced that he had \u201cdiscovered the highest mountain in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 1856, the height of Peak XV was recorded at 29,002 feet, a number remarkably close to the height recognized by climbing bodies today. But Mr. Sikdar\u2019s contributions were pushed to the footnotes, and Peak XV was eventually renamed in honor of Mr. Everest.\n\nAbout 100 years later, when Nepal cracked open its borders to foreigners, scientists moved their measurement tools closer to the mountain, which lies partly in Tibet. In the mid-1950s, the height was recognized as about 29,029 feet, making it the world\u2019s tallest mountain above sea level.\n\n(By one measure, the world\u2019s highest peak is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The summit of Chimborazo, an inactive volcano in the Andes, rises about 20,500 feet above sea level, far short of Everest. But because of the globe\u2019s bulge at the Equator, it\u2019s a different story when you measure from the center of Earth: Chimborazo\u2019s apex then rises the farthest, at about 21 million feet or 3,967 miles.)\n\nGovernment officials in Nepal have been selective about recognizing data generated by other countries, with some measurements less welcome than others.\n\nTake the case of China, which shares the summit with Nepal. After Chinese surveyors assessed Everest\u2019s summit in 2005, measuring the height both from the peak\u2019s rock base and from the top of the snowfall, a heated dispute over the height ensued.", "title": "How Tall Is Mount Everest?

Those completing the program, along with preparers holding professional credentials, are listed in the agency\u2019s searchable database of tax preparers.\n\nA handful of states \u2014 California, Maryland, New York and Oregon \u2014 have laws to regulate paid preparers and make sure they meet minimum standards.\n\nAlso, Connecticut recently adopted new standards for commercial preparers, which will be phased in over several years.

If your preparer doesn\u2019t have one, that\u2019s a red flag.\n\nTaxpayers should always ask for references, inquire how much tax education the preparer gets during the year and ask what the preparer\u2019s areas of specialty are, if any, Ms. Hockenberry said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the preparer is unwilling to share this information,\u201d she said, \u201cwalk away.\u201d\n\nOther signs that the preparer may not be legitimate include charging a fee based on a percentage of your refund, telling you to take a deduction for an expense you didn\u2019t incur and refusing to sign the return.\n\nThe major tax chains generally provide some in-house training for their preparers, said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nH & R Block\u2019s website, for instance, describes a 60-hour tax course for potential employees, covering topics like wages, filing requirements and ethics.\n\nSusan Waldron, an H & R Block spokeswoman, said preparers hired after completing the initial course must take an additional 21 hours of training and complete 10 \u201cpractice\u201d returns before working with clients. In addition, she said, returning preparers must take 32 hours of continuing education and skills training each year.\n\nStill, the consumer law center suggests that people ask probing questions of their preparer, no matter where the preparer is employed.\n\nMichael Best, director of advocacy outreach with the Consumer Federation of America, warned that consumers shouldn\u2019t assume that returns produced by paid preparers were always accurate. In a small study of 19 randomly selected preparers in 2014, he noted, the Government Accountability Office found \u201csignificant\u201d errors in returns. Just two preparers calculated the correct refund amount; errors varied from giving the taxpayer $52 less to $3,718 more than the correct amount.\n\nSo be sure to review the return after it is completed, and question items you don\u2019t understand, Mr. Thompson said. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Does this make sense?\u2019\u201d\n\nHere are some questions and answers about finding a tax preparer:\n\nHow much should I expect to pay for professional tax preparation?\n\nFees vary by geography (higher on the East Coast than in the Midwest), the education of the preparer (C.P.A.s and lawyers tend to charge more) and the complexity of the return, Ms. Hockenberry said.

Across various political divides, there is a sense that Facebook, Twitter and Google exert too much influence on the national discourse; closely connected to this is the widespread concern that we users have developed an unhealthful relationship with our phones, or with the apps on them. But on any more specific claim than that, consensus becomes impossible. The sudden arrival of a new class of tech skeptic, the industry apostate, has only complicated the discussion. Late last year, the co-inventor of the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d Justin Rosenstein, called it a \u201cbright ding of pseudopleasure\u201d; in January, the investment firm Jana Partners, a shareholder in Apple, wrote a letter to the company warning that its products \u201cmay be having unintentional negative consequences.\u201d\n\nAll but conjuring Oppenheimer at White Sands, these critics offer broadsides, warning about addictive design tricks and profit-driven systems eroding our humanity. But it\u2019s hard to discern a collective message in their garment-rending: Is it design that needs fixing? Tech? Capitalism? This lack of clarity may stem from the fact that these people are not ideologues but reformists. They tend to believe that companies should be more responsible \u2014 and users must be, too. But with rare exceptions, the reformists stop short of asking the uncomfortable questions: Is it possible to reform profit-driven systems that turn attention into money? In such a business, can you even separate addiction from success?\n\nPerhaps this is unfair \u2014 the reformists are trying. But while we wait for a consensus, or a plan, allow me to suggest a starting point: the dots. Little. Often red. Sometimes with numbers. Commonly seen at the corners of app icons, where they are known in the trade as badges, they are now proliferating across once-peaceful interfaces on a steep epidemic curve. They alert us to things that need to be checked: unread messages; new activities; pending software updates; announcements; unresolved problems. As they\u2019ve spread, they\u2019ve become a rare commonality in the products that we \u2014 and the remorseful technologists \u2014 are so worried about. If not the culprits, the dots are at least accessories to most of the supposed crimes of addictive app design.\n\nWhen platforms or services sense their users are disengaged, whether from social activities, work or merely a continued contribution to corporate profitability, dots are deployed: outside, inside, wherever they might be seen. I\u2019ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while. These dots are omnipresent, leading everywhere and ending nowhere.

{"date": "2018-02-03 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t have to look far to figure out what has to be done. His Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis released a detailed report in November on this very issue. One recommendation was for the government to increase access to substance abuse treatment. The administration could do so by demanding that health insurance companies cover such care. Federal law already requires insurers to cover addiction treatment and other mental health services, but many do not include those services in their networks of doctors and hospitals, according to a recent report. The commission said the administration and Congress should give the Department of Labor the authority to penalize insurance companies that do not adequately cover addiction treatment. The president should also ask Congress to dedicate more money for treatment. But that\u2019s unlikely since the White House is reportedly considering slashing the budget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates the federal government\u2019s activities in this area.\n\nThe commission also called on the government and insurers to encourage greater use of opioid alternatives like physical therapy and nonaddictive painkillers. Some doctors and hospitals have been moving in this direction. But experts say many health care providers are still prescribing opioids when they ought to be using alternative treatments. That\u2019s because government programs and private insurers do not cover these alternative services and drugs. Other areas the government ought to focus on include cracking down on drug trafficking and the delivery of potent opioids, like fentanyl, through the postal system.\n\nBut will Mr. Trump pursue any of these ideas? His record gives little cause for optimism. One indication of how seriously the White House has taken this issue was its appointment last month of a 24-year-old campaign volunteer with no experience in drug policy as the deputy chief of staff of the drug policy office. Outrage followed, and his tenure was cut mercifully short.\n\nFixing Infrastructure\n\nMost Americans agree that the United States needs to substantially increase investments in transportation, energy, water and other public works. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the country needs to increase infrastructure spending by $2 trillion to be globally competitive. In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Trump said he wanted to increase investment by $1.5 trillion. But leaked copies of the administration\u2019s infrastructure proposal show that it will include only $200 billion in federal spending. And White House officials have said that this money could come from cutting existing infrastructure spending on things like public transit and Amtrak.\n\nThere is no dearth of important public works projects that could benefit from federal investment. At the top of the list is the plan to build new rail tunnels under the Hudson River. Known as the Gateway Program, this project would greatly expand capacity for commuter and long-distance trains on the East Coast. Highways, bridges and transit systems across the country desperately require repairs and upgrades to meet current and future needs.

A somewhat more hedonic version of health food appeared in 1950s Los Angeles. \u201cHealth seekers\u201d could find fresh unprocessed foods \u201cstill charged with their life force\u201d at restaurants like the Aware Inn, the Health Hut and, a bit later, the Source. (It was on the patio of the Source on Sunset Boulevard where Woody Allen broke up with Diane Keaton in \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d after ordering a plate of mashed yeast.) These were restaurants with gurus, and they introduced Americans to such culinary novelties as juicing, alfalfa sprouts and the late, unlamented chocolate substitute called carob.\n\nAround the same time a rather more austere regime of dietary salvation entered the countercuisine via the small but highly influential fad of macrobiotics, or, as it was often called (for no apparent reason), \u201cZen macrobiotics.\u201d Imported from Japan in the early \u201960s, this rigorous, science-free culinary practice demanded of adherents that they scrupulously balance the yin and yang in their diet; for many followers this came down to eating little more than (yang-y) brown rice and tamari, a diet responsible for several cases of scurvy and a handful of deaths. Yet the macrobiotic fringe seeped into the mainstream, introducing Americans to Asian flavors (soy sauce) and methods (stir frying) as well as to eating seasonally and organically, while helping to stigmatize processed foods like refined grains and sugar.\n\nIf Kauffman\u2019s story has a hero, it is Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9, the writer who most galvanized the counterculture just as it was beginning to think of eating as a political act. In 1969, Lapp\u00e9, 25, burrowed into the stacks of Berkeley\u2019s agricultural economics library hoping to learn if Malthusian predictions of mass starvation (recently popularized by Paul Ehrlich in \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d) were true. What she discovered, and told the world about in her 1971 best-selling book, \u201cDiet for a Small Planet,\u201d was that the problem \u201cwasn\u2019t how much food the earth could produce, it was what we did with it\u201d \u2014 which was to feed much of it to animals, nature\u2019s least efficient machine for converting sunlight into edible protein. A far better machine? The humble soybean, which she convinced a generation \u201ccould save the world.\u201d Enter William Shurtleff, who, inspired by Lapp\u00e9, went to Japan and returned as the Johnny Appleseed of tofu.\n\nPhoto\n\nLapp\u00e9 had composed a powerful proof of exactly how the personal is political. Summarizing the message she brought to millions of Americans, Kauffman writes, \u201cShopping and cooking \u2026 were political acts, hopeful acts, whose cumulative impact would be felt around the world.\u201d The arresting idea that what someone in Ann Arbor chose to eat had implications for hunger in Bombay made vegetarianism a moral imperative for many in the counterculture.\n\n\u201cThen came the real struggle,\u201d Kauffman writes, of making vegetarian food \u201cdelicious.\u201d But in time hippie chefs rose to the challenge, usually by raiding other food cultures for flavor, as Mollie Katzen did so effectively in her \u201cMoosewood Cookbook\u201d (three million copies sold since publication). In time, the counterculture rescued vegetables from centuries of mistreatment by Anglo-American cooks.\n\nThe third current shaping hippie food flowed directly from counterculture politics, with its critique of capitalism and romantic notions about preindustrial life. Especially after 1970, when untold numbers of hippies fled a souring scene in the city for a fresh start in the country, figuring out how to feed themselves without depending on the Man became paramount. (America\u2019s rural population increased by more than 10 percent during the 1970s.) Rejecting a chemical agriculture that was fatally linked to the Vietnam War by Monsanto and Dow, hippie farmers with no training had to puzzle out how to grow food without pesticides or fertilizers. Many failed, but a handful went on to develop the sustainable practices now enshrined in the federal definition of \u201corganic food,\u201d which has become a $50 billion industry.\n\nBut for the hippies it wasn\u2019t enough to grow the food differently; it had to be sold and distributed differently, too, which meant networks of buying clubs and co-ops and farmer\u2019s markets. Except for the farmer\u2019s markets, which continue to thrive, these alternatives to capitalism have not fared nearly as well as the types of food they sold. Grocers like Whole Foods eventually co-opted the co-ops, reducing what had been a radical idea to a cool retail vibe.\n\nCapitalism\u2019s genius for absorbing and integrating every challenge to it is on vivid display in this thoroughly absorbing history. Behind familiar brands like Stonyfield (now a subsidiary of Lactalis, a French dairy company) or Cascadian Farm (now part of General Mills) stand hippie ideals as well as pioneering organic farmers. As Gene Kahn, the hippie-farmer founder of Cascadian Farm, told me, somewhat ruefully, after he sold his company to General Mills, \u201cEverything eventually morphs into the way the world is.\u201d True enough, and yet the world is also changed in the process. Hippie foods may have been absorbed into the mainstream, and to an extent hippie farming too, but the big hippie idea about food \u2014 that our eating has moral, ethical and political implications \u2014 has lost none of its power, and continues to feed a movement.", "title": "How We Got From Twinkies to Tofu", "authors": ["Michael Pollan", "Jonathan Kauffman"]}

They argued that a primary open to all voters would lead to political moderation by candidates who, in theory, could not win by appealing only to the base of their party.\n\n\n\nThe voter initiative was vigorously opposed by Democratic and Republican leaders who warned that it would force candidates to invest time and money in debilitating primaries and runoffs and could lead to general elections where a major party would be kept off the ballot.\n\nIt is far from clear whether the top-two system \u2014 which has been adopted in some form by four states so far \u2014 has lived up to its promise of good government reform or created the kind of one-sided general elections that so concerned party leaders. That happened in California in a congressional race in 2012, in which the general election choice was between two Republicans in a district with a Democratic edge, and in last year\u2019s Senate race, in which no Republicans were on the general election ballot.\n\nIndeed, in the middle of this heated battle, it is still a matter of dispute whether the change has made much of a difference at all. Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, suggested that so far it had not. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen big shifts in the Legislature,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed California politics radically.\u201d\n\nThe stakes now are particularly high. Mr. Issa\u2019s seat is one of seven congressional seats that Democrats are targeting to flip in California this year. It is one of two where the Republican incumbent is not running again, which otherwise would have probably assured a straight runoff between the sitting Republican and a Democratic challenger. (The other is Representative Ed Royce\u2019s to the east.)\n\nDemocratic leaders are moving to winnow the field, steering contributions to favored candidates, moving to award the state party endorsement to one person and warning candidates who might have embarrassing chapters in their professional or personal lives of the kind of scrutiny and political attacks that come with entering public life.\n\nBut any attempt by the party to interfere is complicated by the strains between establishment Democrats and the more liberal wing of the party, which have been on particular display in this state. Democratic leaders are wary of coming across as old-school bosses stampeding the concerns of grass-roots activists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy job is not to tell people they can\u2019t run,\u201d said Eric C. Bauman, the state Democratic leader, who has been trying to trim the field to, ideally, he said, two Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s not to push people out of races. But to try to help good candidates look to see if they have other options they could run for and make an equally important contribution.\u201d\n\nMr. Bauman said the current circumstances had confirmed what have been his criticisms of the top-two method from the beginning.\n\n\u201cThat denies people an opportunity to vote for a candidate who represents their interests,\u201d Mr. Bauman said. \u201cIt creates that danger that we could end up with so many Democrats that we split the vote so badly that we get aced out of a spot in November.\u201d\n\nGiven California\u2019s status as the leading edge of Democratic efforts to take back the House, the situation is a top concern of national Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe plan on having a Democrat running in both races this November,\u201d said Daniel Sena, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He said the committee was hoping this could be accomplished quietly but was prepared to move more aggressively \u2014 such as by steering financial contributions to favored candidates if it looked as if Democrats might be running themselves to defeat.\n\n\u201cWe still reserve the right to get involved,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we are preserving the right to invoke military options and spend money as we see fit.\u201d\n\nThis is a problem not only for Democrats. There are four Republicans running in Mr. Issa\u2019s district and six in the Royce district. But Republicans have a registration edge in both districts, making it less of a threat for them, officials in both parties said.\n\nWhen the top-two system was first put on the ballot, leaders of both parties opposed it. And in 2016, after two Democrats emerged from a crowded primary to run for the United States Senate seat eventually captured by Kamala D. Harris, a Democrat, one of the losing Republicans, Tom Palzer, a retired city planner, started his own initiative campaign to repeal the system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the ballot box and two people are from one party, you don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s two Republicans, two Libertarians. We need healthy parties, and we need competitive parties in the State of California. I\u2019m a Republican. If the top two were Republican, that wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\nBut other Republicans, after watching the problems the system has caused Democrats, have reconsidered their position and opposed an effort to persuade the state party to back Mr. Palzer\u2019s effort.

He was riding in an Uber car driven by the crash\u2019s second victim, Jeffrey Monroe, who was from nearby Avon, Ind.\n\nThe car had stopped along the side of Interstate 70 in Indianapolis so Mr. Monroe could get out to help Mr. Jackson, who was sick, when Manuel Orrego-Savala\u2019s Ford truck drove onto the emergency shoulder and plowed into them, the Indiana State Police said. He struck both men, heaving one of their bodies into the highway\u2019s center lane.\n\nWhen a state trooper saw the wreckage on the side of the road shortly after, he headed toward the crash, hitting the man lying in the middle of the highway in the process, the police said. (The police did not say which man the trooper struck.)\n\nMr. Monroe, 54, and Mr. Jackson, 26, were pronounced dead at the scene. Mr. Orrego-Savala was arrested as he tried to flee on foot.\n\nThe state police said that Mr. Orrego-Savala was living in the United States illegally, having been deported to Guatemala twice before. He had been convicted of driving under the influence in California in 2005, and his record also showed \u201cmany other\u201d misdemeanor convictions and arrests in Indiana and California, said Nicole Alberico, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal immigration agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI.C.E. has formally asked the county jail where Mr. Orrego-Savala, who was using the alias Alex Cabrera Gonsales, is being held to continue detaining him for federal immigration agents. But before he is deported again he is likely to be prosecuted locally for causing the fatal crash, and federal prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had charged him with illegally re-entering the country after being deported.\n\nA Growing List\n\nThe Trump administration regularly highlights crimes committed by immigrants, especially those who came here in ways Mr. Trump has vowed to curtail. Last week, Mr. Trump used the biggest stage available \u2014 the State of the Union address \u2014 to warn of the dangers of MS-13, a gang associated with young Central American migrants, drawing criticism that he had, once again, made immigrants out to be little more than criminals.\n\nVideo\n\nBesides a border wall and other measures to discourage illegal immigration, the president wants to curb two forms of legal immigration. He wants to end the diversity visa lottery, which offers people from countries that do not normally send large numbers of immigrants to the United States a chance at a green card, regardless of whether they have special skills or relatives in the United States. The president also wants to restrict family-based immigration, the system that has given millions of visas to relatives of American citizens and permanent residents, in favor of a more merit-based system.\n\nIn January, the administration released a report purporting to show that the vast majority of people convicted of international terrorism-related charges since Sept. 11, 2001, were foreign-born. It took pains to highlight cases in which such people came to the country through the diversity visa lottery or because they were related to an American citizen or legal resident. But parts of the report were misleading, and Democrats and others who support immigration were quick to dismiss it for its political tinge.\n\nLast week, in a news release that began with the words, \u201cOur current immigration system jeopardizes our national security and puts American communities at risk,\u201d the White House listed 15 people accused or convicted of terrorism-related crimes who it said had arrived either through the diversity visa lottery or family ties.\n\nThe list included two others whose immigration records Mr. Trump amplified on Twitter: Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi-born immigrant who tried to detonate a pipe bomb in the New York subway in December, and Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who killed eight people in a bike lane on the West Side of Manhattan in October.\n\nWhat Research Shows\n\nSeveral studies, conducted over many years, have concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States, and much less likely to be in prison than those born in the United States.\n\nHomeland Security officials have estimated that about 1.9 million noncitizens living in the country, whether legally or illegally, have been convicted of criminal offenses. About 820,000 of those people may be in the country illegally, including about 300,000 with felony convictions, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a research group that has opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to cut immigration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Among men ages 18 to 49, immigrants were one-half to one-fifth as likely to be incarcerated as those born in the United States, according to census data, though that proportion rises significantly when only federal inmates are counted. Yet about one-third of noncitizen federal inmates are serving time only for immigration-related offenses, such as slipping back into the country after being deported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for those who support restricting immigration, another question is whether current immigration laws leave the country vulnerable. Opponents of the diversity visa lottery often cite a report the State Department\u2019s inspector general issued in 2003, which concluded that the program could be granting green cards to spies, criminals and terrorists.\n\nAn Emotional Pull\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump spoke of family members of people killed by unauthorized immigrants, arguing that their relatives would still be alive if immigrants were not allowed to come illegally to the United States in the first place. Mr. Trump made the case of Kathryn Steinle, who was shot to death by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco in 2015, into a byword for the dangers of unchecked immigration. After the man who shot her, who claimed it was an accident, was acquitted of manslaughter in November, Mr. Trump renewed his call for the wall.\n\nSome of the most vocal family members have continued to press their cause in Washington, where one such group, Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime, was meeting with several members of Congress on Tuesday. They said they were planning to mention Mr. Jackson\u2019s death in their conversations.\n\nMary Ann Mendoza, the mother of a police officer killed in a drunken-driving crash with an unauthorized immigrant in 2014, said the group was trying to reach Mr. Jackson\u2019s family to offer support.\n\n\u201cWe want to let them know that we are a group of people at AVIAC who have experienced the same sort of loss they have,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can join us in our fight.\u201d\n\nMr. Jackson\u2019s roommate, Chad Bouchez, who said he had been out with Mr. Jackson the night he died, told CBS News that he did not believe Mr. Jackson would have wanted his death politicized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Edwin would have judged anyone on where they were from or anything else,\u201d he said.", "title": "How an N.F.L.

Long-haul flights are the most affected: the airline plans to operate only 50 percent of those scheduled to depart from Paris.

Over the summer, tents and makeshift shelters appeared in Maximilian Park. Migrants who might once have headed for Calais continue to arrive in the city, hoping to journey onward.\n\nMr. Khater certainly does not want to stay in Belgium. \u201cI am afraid here,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have an education, I don\u2019t have money, I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d\n\nMost important, he added, \u201cBelgium doesn\u2019t understand the politics of Sudan; if I ask asylum here, Belgium may send me back to Italy immediately, or worse, even to Khartoum.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union law requires migrants to apply for residency or asylum in the first country in the bloc they reach. In the past three years, tens of thousands of Sudanese have crossed the Mediterranean by boat, landing in Italy, Greece or Spain. Most applied for asylum, and only a few hundred have been deported, according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\nMany Sudanese, however, seek to move on, in secret and without papers, to Britain. Often that involves camping for months near bus stops, truck stops, train stations or seaports.\n\nSo what do countries owe such transitory migrants? Belgium\u2019s state secretary for asylum policy and migration, Theo Francken, has argued that the state cannot take responsibility for those who do not claim asylum.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis reasoning is that if Belgium allows a few hundred migrants to reside illegally on its territory, it could attract millions of others, potentially plundering Belgium\u2019s generous social security system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeeing unauthorized migration rise in Brussels last summer, the Belgian government ordered a series of heavy-handed raids on informal camps and homeless shelters. Those raids \u2014 along with falling temperatures \u2014 have largely succeeded in breaking up camps in public parks, and received wide popular support.\n\nEven so, hundreds of Belgian families have reacted by inviting migrants into their homes. (Last month, the government proposed police raids on the houses of citizens suspected of sheltering unauthorized migrants.) Medical charities are providing food, clothes and assistance, and volunteers have set up shelters like the one where Mr. Khater sleeps, in a former office building. The total cost of sheltering one migrant is about 10 euros per night, organizers estimate.\n\nThere have been several demonstrations against the government policies, and about 3,000 people formed a human chain around migrants at the Gare du Nord last month to prevent a police raid.\n\nThe crackdown has also exposed Belgium to the possibility of rebuke on human rights grounds.\n\nIn September, the government invited Sudanese officials to help identify and expel people in the country illegally who did not want to apply for asylum. Ten Sudanese were subsequently sent to Khartoum, and accounts quickly surfaced that at least three had been abused upon their return.\n\nThe Belgian government ordered an investigation of the allegations. It concluded earlier this month that Brussels had not done enough to assess the risks faced by those deported, and warned that migrants who had not applied for asylum still had the right to be protected from torture.\n\nThe report said it was impossible to establish whether the abuses had taken place.\n\nAt the Gare du Nord, Mr. Khater and several fellow travelers showed wounds and scars that they said had been inflicted by the Belgian police. One had a dislocated thumb, another a fresh cut across his jaw, yet another a stitched eyebrow. Several had open wounds.

EdjSports would not divulge how long it has worked with the Eagles or how many other teams are clients, though the logos adorning the walls of its office \u2014 of the Lions, Saints and Steelers, among others \u2014 offer a hint. Contractual obligations prevented EdjSports from sharing data that could compromise its relationship with the Eagles, but Frigo said many of Philadelphia\u2019s decisions have aligned with EdjSports\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThose recommendations derive from a model drawing on years of play-by-play data, churning it through hundreds of thousands of simulations \u2014 sometimes more \u2014 to determine the decision that most boosts a team\u2019s likelihood of winning, a metric EdjSports calls GWC, for Game Winning Chance. Because the model cares only about producing the most wins on average, it tends to favor unorthodox moves.\n\nLooking at a chart, Sean O\u2019Leary, one of EdjAnalytics\u2019s founders, noted how it\u2019s mathematically defensible for a team on its first possession of overtime to go for it on fourth-and-1 at its own 10-yard line; not that a coach, facing public pressure to adhere to football norms, ever would.\n\nBut fourth downs are embedded with opportunity for those keen to exploit it. Frigo said that on fourth down alone, teams on average give up anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of a win over a season on what Edj classifies as high-confidence mistakes \u2014 that is, decisions that EdjSports\u2019s model has deemed with certainty to be an error. The worst offenders might lose as much as a game and a half.\n\nUsing the Patriots, who are not an EdjSports client, as an example, Frigo cued up on a screen one of the company\u2019s postgame reports, which allow a team to evaluate its decision-making. The report of New England\u2019s A.F.C. championship victory against Jacksonville revealed that Bill Belichick, perhaps the best coach in history, committed four of those high-confidence errors when he elected to punt instead of going for it. To Frigo, those mistakes confirmed coaches\u2019 susceptibility to conservative thinking from a purely game theory standpoint.", "title": "How the Eagles Followed the Numbers to the Super Bowl", "authors": []}

A pair of quick completions from Nick Foles to Nelson Agholor picked up a combined 6 yards and on third down he rolled out to his left before completing a 17-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery that gave the Eagles a first down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA run by LeGarrette Blount went nowhere, with the big running back knocked backward for a 1-yard loss, and a Foles pass to Torrey Smith fell incomplete, setting up another third down, which Foles, after waiting for something to develop, converted with a 15-yard pass to Smith.\n\nFoles found his favorite target, Zach Ertz, for a 7-yard gain then Jay Ajayi had a pair of short runs, the first of which picked up a first down. Foles sold a nice pump fake and then hit Clement for a 16-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia on New England\u2019s 5-yard line.\n\nBlount went up the middle to the 2-yard line, but a false start penalty by Ertz moved the ball back to the 7. Foles overthrew Agholor in the end zone, setting up a third-and-7, and an attempt to Jeffery also fell incomplete, setting up Elliott for the short field goal.\n\nDrape: Foles to Jeffery for the first 3rd down conversion showed a couple of things: Coach Doug Pederson trusts him, and Foles can extend plays with his legs. Then, he gets 3rd-and-11 and throws an even better pass to Torrey Smith. The Eagles did everything but get 7 on that drive. Elliott draws first blood, 3-0 Eagles. Nice start, but mistakes add up, and they can\u2019t make many of them.

It has aggressively lobbied against nominated directors and pushed Congress to enact restrictions on how the bureau spends money to curtail its ability to regulate firearms and track gun crimes. One funding provision, for example, forbids the A.T.F. from using electronic databases to trace guns to owners. Instead, the agency relies on a warehouse full of paper records.\n\nIt is beneficial to the N.R.A. to have a smaller agency like the A.T.F. in charge of gun regulation, one senior bureau official acknowledged, rather than a larger, more politically powerful agency like the F.B.I. that can more effectively demand additional resources from Capitol Hill.\n\nThe gun lobby is one of the most potent political forces in Washington, doling out tens of millions of dollars each election cycle to lawmakers and campaigns to steer the political discourse on gun regulation. The N.R.A. reported spending the most amount of money in its history in 2016 working to support Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, and its backing has come under renewed scrutiny in the gun debate that has taken shape in the days since the shooting in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe president, in turn, has courted gun advocates, vowing to defend firearm owners and the N.R.A. In a tweet on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump called the organization \u201cGreat People and Great American Patriots.\u201d\n\nThe A.T.F. rose to prominence in the Prohibition era with its takedown of Al Capone. In the decades since, its mission has been tailored toward gun violence and trafficking. More recently, the bureau has had its share of troubling episodes. It was infamously involved in the 1993 siege at a Branch Davidian compound in Texas in which 75 peopled were killed, and during the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d scandal two decades later, the bureau lost guns across the Mexican border, which were later recovered at crime scenes. Agents also used a multimillion-dollar slush fund meant to pay informants to instead pad their own pockets, The New York Times revealed last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the White House considered eliminating the A.T.F. The proposal, a direct affront to the N.R.A., would have transferred all its law enforcement authorities to the F.B.I., a former senior Obama administration official said. The plan was largely abandoned, however, after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn.\n\nThe N.R.A. opposed the nomination of Andrew Travers, whom Mr. Obama selected to lead the agency in 2010. Mr. Travers was never confirmed. The N.R.A. did not take a position on the agency\u2019s last and only director confirmed by the Senate, B. Todd Jones, who led the A.T.F. from 2011 to 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe support enforcement of the laws on the books and A.T.F. efforts to apprehend and prosecute violent criminals,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A. \u201cWe have and will continue to oppose political appointees looking to enact an anti-gun agenda through the regulatory process making it more difficult for law abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional rights while criminals continue to break the law.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The White House has confidence in the acting director, Thomas E. Brandon, the official said, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nMr. Brandon, who has served in that capacity since 2015, is thought of highly among the A.T.F. work force, agents said. But even his most ardent supporters acknowledge that a Senate-confirmed director, handpicked by the president, would be better positioned to be an advocate for the agency.\n\nThere is no indication that Mr. Brandon will be nominated to permanently lead the bureau.\n\n\u201cA.T.F. works diligently with the resources that we have,\u201d said a bureau spokesman, Joshua Jackson. \u201cAnd like any agency, we could always use additional resources.\u201d\n\nThe A.T.F.\u2019s own 52-page budget proposal for the current fiscal year describes an agency on the cusp of a resource crisis. That document is separate from the White House budget proposed last week, which lays out the administration\u2019s broader priorities for the fiscal year that begins in October.\n\nIn describing its own shortages, the A.T.F. says it remains unable to fulfill even basic regulatory responsibilities, including inspections of firearms dealers \u2014 something the bureau says presents a \u201csignificant risk to public safety.\u201d\n\nThe A.T.F. is also bracing for the departure of nearly a fifth of its roughly 2,500 special agents. Of them, 499 are at least 50 years old, according to the budget proposal, and face mandatory retirement at 57.\n\nLast year, 141 agents retired from the A.T.F., Mr. Jackson said, and only 117 were hired. An additional 24 agents left the bureau for other reasons.\n\nStill, as ranks thin, the A.T.F. is being tasked to lead some of the Trump administration\u2019s most lauded violent crime initiatives. A team of agents was sent to Chicago over the summer to help the city combat gun violence, and the bureau is leading crackdowns on the MS-13 criminal gang, which Mr. Trump has vowed to \u201ceradicate.\u201d", "title": "How the N.R.A.

Douglass believed that freedom was safe only within the state and under law.\n\nDouglass did preach self-reliance for his fellow blacks: He argued that the freed slaves should be given their rights, protected and then \u201clet alone.\u201d But he never employed that \u201clet alone\u201d dictum without also demanding \u201cfair play,\u201d and security against terror and discrimination. Conservatives have cherry-picked his words to advance their narrow visions of libertarianism.\n\nDouglass, the greatest American abolitionist, also happened to be a Republican in a century when that party stood for using government to free people. The right\u2019s effort to get right with Douglass is born of sincere beliefs but also shows a movement\u2019s need for a famous black voice. Were he alive, Douglass would most likely laugh, and warmly welcome the debate.\n\nAt the unveiling ceremony for the statue of Douglass in the United States Capitol in 2013, congressional Republicans proudly wore large buttons that read, \u201cFrederick Douglass Was a Republican.\u201d Douglass\u2019s descendants who were there, as well as scholars like me with, shall we say, different training, smiled and endured.\n\nWhose Douglass? Which Douglass? Dead, allegedly alive or in his literary work? These are modern questions rife with meaning. But we cannot contain Douglass within such circumscribed limits.\n\nAt the height of the national debate over slavery in 1857 he wrote: \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them,\u201d and added, \u201cThe limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.\u201d Douglass\u2019s understanding of power could never confine him to advocacy of individualism alone.", "title": "Opinion | How the Right Co-Opts Frederick Douglass", "authors": []}

As Americans today grow increasingly numb to persistent mass shootings, such a crime now might not even make the front pages. But on Feb. 14, 1929, Chicagoans were appalled enough to give it an enduring name \u2014 \u201cthe St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre\u201d \u2014 and it remains a powerful example of how to check gun violence with proactive reform.\n\nNinety years ago, Americans felt as helpless to stop the slaughter as many do today. Chicagoans had seen gang killings before, in the bootleg battles that brought Al Capone to power, and they knew the drill. The police would issue indignant statements and roust a few gangsters, but no one would be arrested, much less prosecuted or convicted. Soon enough, just like today, it would all happen again.\n\nYet the scale of this crime prompted a different response. Newspapers nationwide printed photos of the carnage, forcing Americans to consider the costs of Prohibition. Many had seen Capone, whose organization was behind the killing, as a folk hero \u2014 a self-made millionaire, giving the people what they wanted. But he soon picked up a new and enduring nickname: \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1.\u201d\n\nStill, the causes of the massacre went beyond a single mobster. Other cities had speakeasies and bootleggers without open warfare. What made Chicago different were the longstanding alliances between government and gangsters.

More work for faculty? You bet. It\u2019s a lot harder than giving out the As, Bs and Cs that have been the traditional measure of student success. But it\u2019s also far more meaningful for students, parents, policymakers and employers.\n\nAs higher education costs climb and student borrowing increases, it should come as no surprise that colleges and universities are under more pressure to demonstrate what students have gained. Thanks to the work of many dedicated faculty members and accreditors, colleges and universities are providing a richer and more complete picture of student learning than in the past. This is important and worthwhile.\n\nSure, we can always do better. But the demand that colleges assess learning will not slacken. One hopes faculty members will lend a hand to these efforts.\n\nTED MITCHELL, WASHINGTON\n\nThe writer is president of the American Council on Education.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nKudos to Molly Worthen. As a professor in the University of California system, I can attest to the accuracy of her report.

It\u2019s the most seamless way to move through customs: You simply stop at an automated passport control kiosk, identify yourself with your passport and finger biometrics, and tap a screen to answer a few questions. (Note: Global Entry is not strictly for United States citizens, nationals and lawful permanent residents; passport holders from Argentina, Colombia, Germany, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and Britain may also apply.) But a number of travelers (Americans and Canadian visitors) have been discovering a free program called Mobile Passport Control \u2014 the use of which has increased threefold from fiscal year 2016 to 2017.\n\nWhile not necessarily as quick as Global Entry, Mobile Passport Control still saves users the time and hassle of filling out a paper declaration form. And it doesn\u2019t require any sort of advance approval or interview. Rather, it works through a free Customs and Border Protection app for iOS and Android called Mobile Passport and can be used at about 25 airports (in cities that include New York, Houston and Chicago), as well as at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fl a.\n\nTo use the Mobile Passport app, users create a profile by adding their passport information (along with the passport information for each family member traveling with them). Then, when their flight lands at a participating airport, they follow signs to a designated fast Mobile Passport Control lane, open the app and answer five questions about their trip (on behalf of their entire family), submit it, and then receive a receipt with an encrypted bar code. When they reach the Customs and Border Protection officer in their lane, they show their passport, scan the bar code on the receipt, and go on their way.\n\nWhile the Mobile Passport app is not as comprehensive or ubiquitous as Global Entry (Global Entry is at more than 50 airports, while Mobile Passport is at fewer than half that), Customs and Border Protection says they are complementary programs. As veteran Global Entry members know, at certain times of the day and at particular airports there can be a line for the kiosks. Or a kiosk may not be working, slowing up an ordinarily smooth process. For that reason, Customs and Border Protection suggests having both programs so that whenever possible, you have the option of choosing the shorter line.\n\n(For those interested in enrolling in Global Entry, some credit cards offer statement credits to customers who charge the fee to their cards, like Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige and certain American Express cards.)", "title": "How to Bypass Airport Lines With the Tips of Your Fingers", "authors": []}

Soccer is even more commercial and lucrative than hockey, yet its rules work in the opposite way: Teams are obliged, by dictate of FIFA, the International Federation of Association Football, to cough up their stars when they\u2019re summoned by a national team for a tournament. The leagues may not like it, but there is no danger of a World Cup without players like Neymar and Lionel Messi.\n\nClearly, soccer has figured out the better system. The players want to play; the fans want to watch; there is nothing as uplifting and inspiring as international competition between the best of the best. Since 1998, when professional players were admitted, Olympic hockey has consistently been spectacular and exhilarating.\n\nBut the N.H.L. sees itself as a business first and foremost, and it cannot see any profit in Olympic hockey. Moreover, the league has a competing interest: It helps run another international tournament, the World Cup of Hockey, which has so far failed to achieve anything near the popularity of Olympic hockey. Weaker Olympic hockey serves the N.H.L.\u2019s purposes, even if it is bad for everyone else.\n\nWhat might be done? There are a few possible solutions. Despite the notion that the N.H.L. \u201cowns\u201d its players, contracts of involuntary servitude remain illegal in the United States and Canada, and the star players have considerable individual bargaining power. Players like Crosby and Ovechkin should negotiate for a provision in their contracts (or at least reach an informal understanding) that clarifies that the player, when requested by his national Olympic team, would be \u201cloaned\u201d to the team if he wanted to be. Ultimately, the right to play at the Olympics could become part of the collective agreement between league and players.\n\nAnother possible solution is a \u201cnational duty\u201d rule like the one that FIFA has, which the Canadian Parliament, legislatures in hockey-loving states like Minnesota and New York and perhaps even the United States Congress would enact. Such a law would require that notwithstanding any contract, athletes be excused from their jobs when requested by a national team. This would resemble existing laws that require employers to give members of the military reserves leave for their duties.\n\nOnce upon a time, the problem with Olympic hockey was its ban on professional athletes, a rule that, though motivated by a noble ideal of amateurism, kept out North America\u2019s best players and thus made the Soviet teams dominant. Matters have come full circle, for it is now not suspicion of profit that hurts Olympic hockey, but too much attention to it.", "title": "Opinion | How to Fix Olympic Ice Hockey", "authors": []}

Griswold, a philosophy professor at Boston University. Forgiveness means abandoning anger, and that can be long, hard work \u2014 possibly a lifetime\u2019s worth. So before you embark, clearly identify perpetrator and transgression, and make sure the situation calls for forgiveness and not something else, like mercy.\n\nDespite a seemingly endless supply of self-help and religious literature that urges bountiful forgiveness, be careful about offering it up willy-nilly. \u201cDon\u2019t act in a way that condones or enables further wrongdoing,\u201d Griswold says. But take action. Studies find that anger, vengefulness and all the negative ruminations that come with not forgiving can damage the human organism, especially the heart. Indeed, so-called forgiveness interventions (essentially practice sessions) have successfully reduced symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease, chronic pain and even drug addiction.\n\nResearchers disagree about exactly what constitutes forgiveness (though they concede that it involves \u201creducing unforgiveness\u201d). While many theologians and philosophers think it can be unilateral, Griswold holds that forgiveness should be bilateral: For a victim to truly let go of his or her anger, the perpetrator must first admit responsibility. You can ask for an apology, he says, but you won\u2019t always get one. Both parties should use direct and specific language. \u201cClarity is of the essence,\u201d Griswold says. \u201cIf you fudge what it is that you\u2019re doing, the process hasn\u2019t been successfully completed.\u201d And if the person who mistreated you is dead, has disappeared or is just an unrepentant jerk? \u201cYou have to find other ways to put aside your anger,\u201d Griswold says.\n\nMany religions teach forgiveness, but being devout is not required. Griswold has written about forgiveness in secular contexts because he believes that forgiving is one way our species can express true moral virtue. Humans hurt one another in tiny and immense ways, over and over, but we have also worked out this simple \u2014 yet sometimes profoundly difficult \u2014 act to free one another from some impact of that harm.", "title": "How to Forgive", "authors": []}

First, figure out which owl species are in your area, and find field recordings of their vocalizations online. Owls say more than just \u201choo, hoo\u201d: Spend several days just listening to their calls, memorizing their whistles, cackles, grunts and groans. Once you know their repertoire, go outside. Try hooting around dusk; owls tend to be nocturnal.\n\nCohoon mostly calls northern spotted owls, which in 1990 were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The federal government then began requiring owl surveyors like Cohoon to hoot before allowing trees to be harvested. If an owl called back, in many cases the trees around it had to be left standing. New rules curtailed logging in the Pacific Northwest, setting off a clash between loggers and conservationists that came to be known as the Timber Wars (a bumper sticker from the era read \u201cSave a Logger, Eat an Owl\u201d).\n\nCohoon vocalizes differently in the spring, when he knows the birds are looking for mates, than in the early summer, when they\u2019re vociferously defending their owlets. Once he locates an owl, he shuts up. \u201cDon\u2019t bother them,\u201d he says. No response doesn\u2019t mean no owls. \u201cMaybe they got harassed by a bunch of Steller\u2019s jays earlier in the day and just don\u2019t feel like talking,\u201d Cohoon says. Or maybe you don\u2019t sound right; Cohoon has trained dozens of people, and sometimes they simply can\u2019t get the pitch and cadence. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like singing,\u201d he says. Hooting humans are no longer required; as of 2011 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service advises that northern-spotted-owl surveys be conducted using recordings of real owls.\n\nProceed with caution \u2014 when you hoot for owls, you can inadvertently alert predators to their whereabouts, make them worry for their young, give them false hopes for finding a mate or even lure fledglings away from their parents. Cohoon suggests you leave communicating with vulnerable owls to the pros. Instead, hoot for more aggressive and common species, like the barred owl or the great horned owl, which has a booming voice and tends to be chatty. \u201cThey\u2019ll call all night long,\u201d he says.", "title": "How to Hoot Like an Owl", "authors": ["Malia Wollan"]}

{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "What is it? The tweak aims to increase the likelihood that a failing bank would be forced into bankruptcy, rather than into a resolution process overseen by the government. The difference might seem insignificant, especially since the current regulatory procedures for winding down a bank, introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are stringent and mimic bankruptcy. But the Treasury Department believes that an actual bankruptcy would be preferable. It would make the process of restructuring a failed bank more evenhanded and predictable, according to the Treasury. In turn, investors in the big Wall Street firms, and anyone doing business with them, would become more aware of the losses they could suffer if those firms crashed.\n\nBut didn\u2019t the financial crisis of 2008 illustrate the grave dangers of allowing a large bank to go into bankruptcy? The disorderly collapse of Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy set off a panic across the global financial system, according to most analyses of the period. And that is why the Dodd-Frank Act set up a way for regulators to seize a large bank and restructure it in a controlled manner, known as the orderly liquidation authority. As with bankruptcy, it envisions making creditors the new owners of a restructured firm. But it added a feature to limit panic. Under Dodd-Frank, regulators can lend to the failed bank. Such a backstop could prevent a further run on the bank. Its customers and creditors would see that the seized bank had sufficient funds to pay them. The government lending mimics the loans that banks make to bankrupt companies.\n\nHow much of this does the Treasury want to do away with? Not much at all. It recommends using the Dodd-Frank resolution framework \u201cas an emergency tool for use in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d But that\u2019s how the backers of Dodd-Frank saw the process, too. Crucially, the Treasury also wants to keep the emergency government loan. But the Treasury\u2019s proposal does introduce an important and innovative change. It calls for a special type of bankruptcy regime for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. This new regime envisions having a set of specialist judges, working with regulators in the United States and around the world, who could plan for and oversee the bankruptcies of large banks.\n\nWould Chapter 14 work in a crisis? Much depends on whether the customers and creditors of the failing bank yank their money, intensifying the run and spreading fear through the system. The Treasury argues that changes since the crisis mean banks have more cash on hand, and banks can now hold off for a short time on paying claims on financial instruments called derivatives (recall, such claims were particularly debilitating for Lehman.) Also, banks must now have detailed plans to put themselves into bankruptcy, though the Treasury last year suggested changes that might make that planning less stringent. Notably, the Treasury hopes to make Chapter 14 effective by deploying a method for restructuring a failed bank that regulators already expect to use under the orderly liquidation authority.\n\nThis approach rests on turning pre-existing debt owed by a bank\u2019s holding company into new equity at the subsidiaries where the bank does all its business. The theory: If a reassuringly large amount of new equity were created at the subsidiaries, the banks\u2019 creditors and trading partners would feel protected and not withdraw. Indeed, the Treasury says this would eliminate the incentive for counterparties to run.\n\nEliminate is a strong word. In the heat of a crisis, when the scale of a bank\u2019s losses is not known, making it hard to know how much new equity is needed, creditors and trading partners may just head for the exits, crippling the bank. Even so, Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said it made a lot of sense to enshrine this formal wind-down procedure in bankruptcy. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to make bankruptcy better?\u201d he said.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a big reason it might work. Under post-crisis rules, banks must earmark billions of dollars of debt that would be used for creating new equity in a resolution. Put another way, Dodd-Frank has made it possible for the Trump administration to pursue a favored policy goal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nSnap just lost nearly $2 billion in market value.\n\nShares of the social media company tumbled 7.4 percent Thursday after Kylie Jenner tweeted that she no longer opens Snapchat.\n\nThe tweet comes as Snap faces growing criticism from users over the redesign of its app. So far nearly 1.5 million people have retweeted a petition asking Snap to revert to the old version, CNBC reported.\n\nEarlier this week analysts at Citi became the latest to downgrade the stock over the negative reaction.\n\nMark May of Citi wrote:\n\n\u201cWhile the recent redesign of its flagship app could produce positive long-term benefits, the significant jump in negative app reviews since the redesign was pushed out a few weeks could result in a decline in users and user engagement, which could negatively impact financial results.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new tax law is having implications beyond America\u2019s borders.\n\nEuropean banks with significant operations in New York and other parts of the United States have seen multi-billion dollar hits on their results in the fourth quarter as a result.\n\nChanges in corporate tax rates have forced European lenders \u2013 and their American counterparts \u2013 to recognize so-called deferred tax assets at the end of last year.\n\nBut, the pain is expected to be short term as most banks, including Barclays and UBS, anticipate the tax rate for their United States operations will be lower future.\n\nAs earnings season edges toward a close, here is the impact on some of Europe\u2019s largest lenders:\n\n\u2022 Barclays reported an annual loss of 1.9 billion pounds, or about $2.7 billion after it took a series of charges, including \u00a3900 million related to tax changes in the United States. \u201cGiven the group\u2019s substantial U.S. operations, this is expected to result in a reduction of the group\u2019s effective tax rate in 2018 and future periods to mid-20 percent,\u201d the bank said on Thursday.\n\n\u2022 Credit Suisse reported a loss of 2.13 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.3 billion, in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 2.23 billion francs in income tax expenses related to the reassessment of its deferred tax assets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Deutsche Bank reported a full-year loss of 497 million euros, or about $612 million.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "In computer-speak, this \u201copening up\u201d would involve something called an open application programming interface. This is a common software technique that allows different programs to work with one another. For instance, Uber uses the open application programming interface of Google Maps to get information about a rider\u2019s pickup point and destination. It is not Uber\u2019s own mapping algorithm, but rather Google\u2019s open application programming interface, that makes it possible for Uber to build its own algorithms for its distinctive functions.\n\nThe government should require social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to use a similar open application programming interface. This would make it possible for third parties to build software to monitor and report on the effects of social media algorithms. (This idea has been proposed by Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee who helped organize the Tahrir Square uprising in 2011.)\n\nTo be clear, the proposal is not to force companies to open up their algorithms \u2014 just the results of the algorithms. The goal is to make it possible to understand what content is fed into the algorithms and how the algorithms distribute that content. Who created the information or advertisement? And to what groups of users was it directed? An open application programming interface would therefore threaten neither a social media platform\u2019s intellectual property nor the privacy of its individual users.\n\nMedia watchdog groups have long been able to assess the results of the editorial decisions of newspapers and television. Whether those stories express the left, right or center of the political spectrum, they are openly available to independent organizations that want to understand what is being communicated.\n\nExtending this practice to social media would mean that a watchdog group could create software to analyze and make public whatever information from the platforms it might consider important: the demographics of the readership of a certain article, for instance, or whether a fake story continued to be widely disseminated even after being debunked.", "title": "Opinion | How to Monitor Fake News", "authors": []}

Don\u2019t feel ashamed. For Kwachka, it helps to keep the mood light. He tells the crew he\u2019s going to \u201clook for Buicks,\u201d vomits over the side and then sneezes. \u201cThat seems to reset things,\u201d he says.\n\nScientists don\u2019t entirely understand how motion sickness is triggered or why humans and other animals (fish included) experience it. They do know it stems in part from sensory conflict, like discord between visual input to the brain and signals sent from the parts of the inner ear responsible for balance. Some research suggests that facing forward and focusing on a distant point on the horizon can minimize symptoms. Because the placebo effect on seasickness is particularly strong, the prevention measures you believe in are more potent. Kwachka has seen people try everything from chewing ginger root to wearing special bracelets. If you do feel ill, fresh air helps. Drugs, too, but the sedative effects of most anti-motion pharmaceuticals are incompatible with making your livelihood at sea. The most effective treatment is exposure; militaries in many countries run weekslong motion-sickness desensitization programs.\n\nGenerally, the more lurching and vertical the motion, the worse you\u2019ll feel. On a few occasions, though, Kwachka has been out in truly perilous storms with 40- and 50-foot ocean swells. In those conditions, adrenaline is likely to override everything else. \u201cIf your life is in jeopardy, seasickness is the last thing you\u2019re focusing on,\u201d he says. As is true of most things, your psychological state matters: While nearly every human is susceptible to motion sickness, people prone to anxiety and neuroticism are more so. Discussing your symptoms may worsen them, while calm breathing can have the opposite effect.

Finally, don\u2019t forget old-fashioned rendezvous points. If you have no communications at all, it\u2019s critical to have a spot everyone knows to meet up just to make sure everyone is safe.\n\n2. Learn about the hazards and most likely disasters in your area. Not every region is prone to the same types of disasters. If you live on the coast, make sure you talk about plans for coastal storms and flooding. If you live in the Midwest, make sure you\u2019re all on the same page about tornadoes and catastrophic storms. Western state residents may want to talk about mudslides and wildfires. Everyone should probably discuss things like terrorism or other man-made disasters. In every case, people respond better in an emergency if they\u2019ve talked about possible threats before they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also incredibly important to understand that disasters don\u2019t impact people equally \u2014 they tend to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities,\u201d Mr. Stripling said. \u201cSo you need to understand the vulnerabilities in your neighborhood \u2014 things like poverty, housing discrimination or unequal transportation access \u2014 since these elements often point to where the worst consequences will occur.\u201d\n\n3. Understand your neighborhood and how your neighbors can help one another. If everyone is going to rely on one another, think about what is convenient and makes sense for each person. \u201cMaybe one neighbor runs a store and could help stock food supplies for the whole team, and another has a vacation home or relative\u2019s house that could serve as a rendezvous point,\u201d Mr. Stripling said. \u201cThe neighbor who lives within walking distance of the school could be in charge of kid pickup if transportation goes down. Or someone owns an S.U.V. or boat that could help evacuation procedures. Everyone brings something to the table \u2014 and the more diversity your team has, the more powerful it will be.\u201d\n\nIdeally, everyone in your community will be willing to pitch in with their own unique skills, abilities and perspectives to help everyone stay safe and protected. Additionally, while everyone should pool resources in a way that makes sense, you should all be willing to back one another up, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like a particular role is your best fit. If the neighbor responsible for kid pickup is out of town when a blizzard hits, someone else should be ready to step in. Best of all, the closer and more tight knit you are before a disaster, the more you\u2019ll be willing to cover the gaps when one happens.\n\nBe ready before help arrives\n\nMost of us are taught that in an emergency, first responders like police officers, emergency medical personnel and firefighters will be the first ones to get there and help victims. In reality, bystanders and neighbors are usually first \u2014 and in the best position to help save lives \u2014 especially after a disaster significant enough that it may take time for those emergency workers to arrive.\n\nMr. Stripling suggested reading the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s \u201cUntil Help Arrives\u201d program and sharing it with your community group.

The lamination itself can ruin a document beyond repair.\u201d\n\nNot only is the lamination process itself likely to harm delicate papers, it also places undue stress on objects that can cause them to tear, yellow or become brittle prematurely.\n\nFor items like papers and fragile documents, the best thing you can do is to control the environment they\u2019re stored in, said Maureen Callahan, an archivist for the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College.\n\n\u201cWater and vermin are the greatest enemies of paper,\u201d Ms. Callahan said. \u201cFolks also often store family records in basements or attics, where heat and humidity can fluctuate wildly and where water is more likely to enter.\u201d\n\nYour best bet? Ms. Oey said it\u2019s a clean, dark space, like the top of a linen closet.\n\nWith items like printed photographs and albums, making things clean and neat will go a long way.\n\n\u201cNeatness for photographs is almost as important as storage,\u201d Ms. Oey said. Very important photographs can be stored in high-quality paper folders (check to make sure they are acid free and lignin free) or in good plastic sleeves like Mylar. But an important caveat to remember: not using a sleeve is preferable to a cheap one that will scratch.\n\nEvery conservator who spoke to The Times recommended cardboard boxes over plastic bins for storage, because they don\u2019t breed mold as easily and dry out quicker. But if you want to get fancy, the best option is to buy acid-free archival boxes, online or from vendors like the Container Store. They can be a bit pricey, but hold up best against moisture and mold.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd just as important as knowing what to do is knowing what not to do.\n\n\u201cAll conservators would agree with me when I say we have seen miles and miles of terrible sticky tape,\u201d Ms. Oey said.\n\nSo remember: No tape (it sticks). No paper clips or staples (they can rust). Definitely no lamination. And absolutely no plastic bins that can fill up with water.\n\nOther strange heirlooms (wedding dresses, record collections and more)\n\nFamily archives can include all sorts of strange ephemera. Maybe your grandmother had an extensive record collection, or there\u2019s a box of photo slides sitting in your garage that you have no idea what to do with.\n\nWhatever the case, individual items like these don\u2019t have any catchall rules besides common sense. But Ms. Oey encourages individuals with archiving goals they don\u2019t know how to accomplish to seek out experts who are available.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

There are expert tips easily accessible for audio and visual materials, furniture, paintings, historical silver, even individual digital film types.\n\nMost libraries have an online reference system called Ask a Librarian that allows individuals to talk to preservationists who can advise them on how to best take care of the strange item, or point them toward an expert who can provide assistance, or help them find a conservator who might mend the item (though that can get pricey). A great place to start is the Library of Congress website.\n\nAnd that old wedding dress that\u2019s still in the closet? It\u2019s best to let a professional preservationist handle it, experts said. The Association of Wedding Gown Specialists has a list of guidelines and recommendations on its site. (Though, if you still want to go it alone, the same rules apply: Have a professional clean it, then store it in an acid free box in a cool, dark space away from water.)\n\nDigitizing those love letters and printed photos\n\nJust as with paper archives, the most important part of archiving digital files is storage.\n\n\u201cHow you store your files and where will always be the most important form of preservation anyone can do,\u201d Ms. Oey said. Computers, for example, are not safe in and of themselves. Anything important to you should never have only one digital file.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe key with digital archiving, archivists say, is duplication. Every important file should have three copies. Ideally, those three copies should be stored on at least two different storage media. Ms. Levenick said that she personally uses a 3-2-1 method for backing up: three copies, two different media and at least one away from home. For example, you might store two digital wedding albums on your desktop and in a cloud based storage.\n\nThe first step to a good digital practice is high resolution photographs. Ms. Oey recommends snapping photos of your items in good (preferably natural light). \u201cIf you have a nice digital camera like an SLR, that\u2019s great, but honestly an iPhone [or other smartphone] will work just fine.\u201d (Any smartphone camera will do.) You can also use a service to do this for you for 60 cents a pop.\n\nThe second step is storing those files just as safely as the original documents. While your digital photographs aren\u2019t going to get soaked through by a burst pipe, keeping them in well-maintained environments is equally important.\n\n\u201cIf you are using physical storing, you need to regularly migrate off one hard disk and onto another,\u201d Ms. Oey said. That includes hard drives, flash drives, CDs and anything else. \u201cDoing this every three to five years on average will keep your files safe and up to date.\u201d\n\nOnline storage solutions can be weird and confusing, but luckily there is already a handy and thorough guide on Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, to help you choose.\n\nDigitizing audio, video and everything else\n\nAudio and video preservation are often neglected by family archivists because they are more technical than common sense, but they are no less important.\n\nAudio recordings \u2014 like reel-to-reel, cassette, mini-tapes from answering machines \u2014 can be easily translated to digital form as MP3 files, but not in a high enough quality to replace the original recording. Several archivists said that you could spend anywhere from $400 to $40,000 digitizing audio, and that letting a vendor handle it is definitely the way to go (unless you want to make a hobby of digitization).\n\nBut if you have a large collection, it\u2019ll be more expensive. Many vendors charge around $15 to digitize a cassette. The Association for Recorded Sound Collections has a list of vendors and plenty of resources on preserving physical sound and digitizing it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPreserving video follows much of the same rules. The trend is toward storing video in digital formats instead of carrier-dependent formats. Again, if you want to make a hobby of it, there\u2019s plenty of info to dive into. The Institute of Museum and Library Services has a thorough detailing of all the trials that go into digitizing video and deciding how to do it.\n\nBut for those who just want their videos safe, vendor help is the way to go.

Drafts can come from unexpected spots, like near the plumbing under the kitchen sink, around electrical sockets, from non-working fireplaces, and more \u2014 basically, any place that leads outside.\n\nFor out-of-the-way spots, Ms. Bailey recommends filling the gaps with expanding spray foam, an easy project that your landlord should be grateful for. (Bonus: It\u2019ll keep out bugs and other critters.) For electrical sockets, Mr. Lipford suggests fitting a pre-cut gasket behind the outlet cover. If you have a drafty decorative fireplace, cut a piece of foam core to fit the back or opening to block the cold air.\n\nPut down area rugs\n\nIf your floors feel cold, put down a rug. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s more helpful than you may think. \u201cNot only will a rug keep your feet from feeling cold, but it actually add a layer of insulation,\u201d Ms. Bailey said.

Even if your living room furniture isn\u2019t blocking vents, consider scooting everything toward the center of the room in wintertime. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be colder around the perimeter,\u201d Mr. Lipford explained.\n\nCirculate warm air\n\nIf you have high ceilings and a ceiling fan, switch the fan to run in reverse during the winter. On a low setting, the fan will create a mild updraft that pushes the warm air down from the ceiling back into the room. \u201cThis costs pennies a week,\u201d said Mr. Lipford.\n\nTurn down the thermostat\n\nWhile some apartment buildings operate on a single thermostat, single-family rentals and newer apartment buildings tend to let renters control (and pay for) their own heat, said Mr. Lipford. So take my dad\u2019s advice: Put on a sweater!\n\nLearning to live in a chillier space is a surefire way to save on your energy bill. The Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat at 68 degrees in the winter for maximum energy savings. If you can lower your home\u2019s temperature an additional seven to 10 degrees for eight hours a day (as in, when you\u2019re sleeping or at work), you can save up to an additional 10 percent on your energy bill.\n\nThere is a threshold, though: Don\u2019t turn the heat down more than 10 degrees if it\u2019s only for a few hours, because it\u2019ll take too much energy to heat your space back up. If you can, automate it with a smart or programmable thermostat. \u201cSomething like 60 percent of homes now have programmable thermostats, but many people still don\u2019t use them,\u201d Mr. Manfredini said. If you don\u2019t, you may be able to install an inexpensive model yourself. (Just get permission first or save the old one to reinstall when you move.)\n\nSpot-heat zones you use most\n\nFor nighttime, turn down the heat and outfit your bed with a cozy down comforter or heated mattress. Wirecutter, the New York Times product review site, recommends the Snowe Down Comforter for a durable, well-priced comforter and the Sunbeam Premium Quilted Mattress Pad for even more warmth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you have a room that always feel chilly, warm it with a space heater while you\u2019re using it. \u201cThese use about the same amount of energy as a refrigerator, but that\u2019s much less energy than warming up the whole house to make one room feel comfortable,\u201d said Mr. Manfredini.\n\nWirecutter\u2019s pick for the best space heater is the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater. Just be sure to use the same precautions with a space heater as you would with a lit candle: Never run it while you\u2019re sleeping, don\u2019t leave the room when it\u2019s on and use caution when kids are around.\n\nAdd humidity\n\nThe same way humidity can affect the \u201creal-feel\u201d outside temperature in summertime, adding humidity to cold air makes it feel warmer inside. Moisture in the air holds onto heat better, keeping it warmer longer, and making it feel warmer on your skin, too. Wirecutter recommends the Honeywell HCM-350 Germ-Free Cool Mist Humidifier as the most effective, leakproof and easy to maintain option.\n\nUse nature to your advantage\n\nEspecially in the winter, when the sun is low in the sky, you can get a lot of heat through south-facing windows. During the day, open curtains or blinds, then close them at night to keep that warm air in. Consider thick, lined curtains for extra insulation at night. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be thermal, just thick enough to block a draft,\u201d said Ms. Bailey.\n\nFinally, the next time you\u2019re looking to move, ask the landlord what the average energy bill is before you sign the lease. In Mr. Lipford\u2019s experience, the cost can vary by almost $100 a month even in similarly-sized homes, depending on how energy efficient they are.", "title": "How to Save Money and Energy Heating Your Apartment", "authors": ["Ayn-Monique Klahre"]}

In the recent past, we didn\u2019t have this problem.\u201d\n\nSome cross-country and biathlon athletes have been spotted holding a whistle-like gadget in their mouths as they ski. The device is a respiratory heat exchanger.\n\nAluminum coils inside of it capture the heat from an athlete\u2019s breath. When the athlete sucks in cold air, the air is warmed by the residual heat so it feels less cold going into the athlete\u2019s lungs. The Czech biathlete Eva Puskarcikova has been photographed using it. A team spokesman said it helped her breathing during the event. But the gadget looks odd, like a hunting whistle, and sometimes icicles made of saliva form on the end of it.\n\nIn 1988, University of Wisconsin researchers studied the device, called a Lungplus, when used by 91 subjects in various cold-weather conditions. Over all, Lungplus users reported more comfort breathing in very cold temperatures. The researchers noted that Lungplus breathing at minus 15 degrees Celsius received similar scores, in terms of comfort, as regular breathing in 20 degrees Celsius, according to the research published in Applied Ergonomics.\n\nThe Norwegian athletes, who are accustomed to very cold weather, have adopted several strategies to stay warm in Pyeongchang, according to the team\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Mona Kjeldsberg. Members of the Alpine team and support crew use heated socks while they wait to compete, she said. Most wear wool undergarments and use tape and buffs to protect exposed skin on the face. To stay warm, \u201chot chocolate from Norway is a favorite,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the bitter cold, the wind chill and temperatures in Pyeongchang have not dropped low enough to create serious concerns about hypothermia or frostbite for the athletes, experts say. (Frostbite risk becomes significant if the temperature drops below minus 13 Fahrenheit, or minus 25 Celsius.)\n\nDuring competition and training, most athletes will generate enough heat to keep their internal body temperature at a comfortable level. Between events, athletes will need to keep moving to maintain deep body temperature. One mistake athletes and spectators can make is to focus on warming hands and feet, which often feel cold first, rather than warming the rest of the body.\n\n\u201cAn old mountaineering adage is, if you want to keep warm hands, wear a hat,\u201d Dr. Tipton said.\n\nAthletes do best when they keep their head and torso warm. That\u2019s because the body\u2019s first defense against cold is to shut down blood flow to the extremities, essentially sacrificing the hands and feet to maintain the temperature of the heart, lungs and brain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe temperature of the hands and feet, however, dominates a person\u2019s perception of thermal comfort. In other words, the athletes may feel colder than they actually are.\n\nFor elite athletes, feeling cold can affect performance in several ways. The discomfort becomes a distraction. Hands and feet can become numb and lose motor function \u2014 a problem for biathletes who stop midrace to fire guns. Then there is something called \u201ccold-induced diuresis\u201d \u2014 as the body concentrates blood flow to key body parts, blood pressure rises and urination increases. That can lead to a corresponding loss in blood volume \u2014 a hazard for endurance athletes.\n\nAnd if athletes get cold enough to begin shivering, that can spell real trouble. When shivering is induced in a research setting, the study subject typically feels extremely tired after the experiment and the next day as well, Dr. Tipton said, since it causes \u201cmuscles to work against each other in asynchronous fashion.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

Feeling seen by a new partner who truly gets you can feel like a drug, and downloading the contents of your brain is a tempting binge to go on.\n\n\u201cThis is a period of intense expansion, and so it\u2019s only natural to want to know and be known,\u201d said Ian Kerner, a psychotherapist and sex counselor in New York City.\n\nThe key is to reveal parts of yourself and your history over time as they become contextually relevant. Wait for natural segues in the course of having normal exchanges, rather than dumping information about yourself in order to fast-track the other person\u2019s understanding of you.\n\nOne of the core problems with monologuing is that you risk inventing (even if accidentally) an idealized version of yourself, creating a high \u2014 but fictional \u2014 bar you\u2019ll fail to clear over and over for the rest of the relationship.\n\nDr. Kerner added one question to keep in mind as you open up: \u201cWhat\u2019s the mental image that this other person is creating of me?\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you\u2019re dating someone who doesn\u2019t make you want to share everything, that can be its own red flag.\n\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t really have chemistry with this person if you\u2019re not intensely curious about them, or maybe they don\u2019t feel it for you,\u201d Dr. Kerner said. \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re narcissistic and only want to be seen, known, validated and affirmed, without expressing the same towards you. But hopefully you\u2019ve picked someone that you can continue to reveal yourself to.\u201d\n\nBe protective of your time from the very beginning\n\nIn any new relationship there is a constant balance of figuring out how much to integrate this person into your life, and at what pace that intertwining should occur.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany new relationships that unfold successfully seem to follow a three-stage path,\u201d Dr. Kerner said, adding that knowing the different phases can be helpful toward figuring how to balance the retention of the autonomous self while in the process of creating a \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nThe first stage, he said, is often that \u201cintense desire for togetherness and a sense of mutual self-expansion\u201d \u2014 or, as we all probably better know it, that honeymoon phase we feel when we\u2019re smitten. Stage two is when the pendulum swings back and we assert our individuality a bit more. And stage three is, hopefully, when the previous two stages meet in the middle and a genuine, healthy integration happens.\n\nThat balance will be unique for every relationship, but holding onto some of your alone time, friend time, work time and time for everything else will mean you won\u2019t have to fight to get back that time later.\n\nDr. Kerner added that it can be helpful to think of your new relationship as a Venn diagram.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a relational overlap, but you\u2019re still also an individual. What is the size of the overlap?\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to get the right-sized overlap while still maintaining a sense of individuality, the balance between togetherness and differentiation. Strong couples consist of strong individuals, and strong individuals are often bolstered by strong relationships.\u201d\n\nSex, love, and compatibility don\u2019t always come as a package\n\nAssuming that great sex inherently equals the potential for great love or that love always indicates long-term compatibility is setting yourself up for endless, and unnecessary, disappointment. Sometimes these things exist in tandem; they often stand alone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re setting yourself up to believe that because someone is interested in having sex, that you\u2019re going to get the call or the next date,\u201d Dr. Fleming said. \u201cAnd if that happens, fantastic, but that\u2019s often not the way it looks, and strategically, people can be setting themselves up for rejection and what feels like abandonment, even though it\u2019s a stranger.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been mindful, strategic and have successfully navigated the dopamine rushes without getting lost in them. Perhaps, against all of your haste-prone habits, you\u2019ve slow-played your way into the solid beginnings of a burgeoning relationship. That\u2019s great! New love is fun and exciting. But just because things are off to a smooth and reasonable beginning doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ve found \u201cthe one.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t \u201cassume that the sudden, shocking thrill of new intimacy means you\u2019re meant to be together for life,\u201d Dr. Snyder said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn order to know that, you\u2019ll need to see how good the two of you are at managing disappointments,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are inevitable, so it\u2019s best to expect them. It\u2019s in dealing with disappointments that you achieve confidence as a couple.\u201d\n\nHolding that somewhat contradictory idea isn\u2019t easy for a love-addled brain: knowing that disappointments are coming, but trying to see them as positive, trust-building moments. It can feel unnatural to assign work to something you\u2019re presently experiencing as pleasure.\n\nBut doing so could mean the difference between building a partnership that\u2019s fortified to last and one that\u2019s built on a foundation of explosive-yet-fleeting feelings.

It stains every aspect of the show, a meditation on the knights of the Holy Grail, the vessel that supposedly caught Jesus\u2019 blood as he hung from the cross. It also floods the Met\u2019s vast stage: 1,250 gallons of fake blood \u201cmade from a recipe that includes tap water, glycerin, and red and blue dye, mixed to taste,\u201d writes Michael Cooper, who attended a rehearsal. Damon Winter, a Times photographer, joined Mr. Cooper, capturing scenes of a world stained red: the feet of singers and dancers, their costumes, the set. His photos drip with the stuff. Mr. Winter recently explained how he got the shot.\n\nWhen you took the assignment, what specifically did you want to capture?\n\nWe wanted to give our readers a more close-up look at the gritty details that they wouldn\u2019t be able to get from sitting in the audience: seeing the way the blood splatters up the legs of the performers and begins to slowly seep into the costumes as the scene progresses, and the contrast with the heavy waterproof boots the stagehands wear as they slog through it.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis was why it was so crucial to see as much as I could see before the curtain was raised and they began rehearsing the scene. I brought a small flash to pump some extra light into what was a very darkly but exquisitely lit stage while they were filling the pool. Under the stage lights the blood could appear like a sheet of black glass, but the extra light really helped to get deep into the ruby red color under that reflective surface. I think it is because of blood that we have such a visceral connection with the color red, and photographing an entire of pool of blood or a facsimile of it, and people working and performing in it, presented stunning visual opportunities.\n\nThe setup of the blood pool is elaborate. How did you shoot it?\n\nThe challenge for me was trying to be in lots of places at once, because it only takes about six minutes to fill the pool. Before it was completely full, members of the chorus started wading in and before I knew it, the scene was starting. I had to map out a little schedule for myself for those crucial minutes to try to be in as many places at once, or at least have it look like it. I set up a video camera high above the stage on a lighting tower at stage right and started that running about 15 minutes before the blood started flowing, which allowed me to be free to shoot still photos from the front of the stage (or downstage), from backstage, from up on the lighting tower and also from the seats in the house.\n\nWas this the weirdest assignment you\u2019ve had?\n\nThis is not something that I would put in the category of weird \u2014 more among the most visual and beautiful assignments I have had in a long time. I saw a recent production of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cA View From the Bridge\u201d with my partner, who is also a photographer. Without giving too much away, there is a scene toward the end that involves another kind of deluge of blood, and we both were blown away by how powerful that scene was both visually and emotionally. Getting to work with the Met on their own \u201cbloody\u201d production and seeing how they finely tuned this essential element to great emotional effect was inspiring, maybe even a bit cathartic.", "title": "How to Take Pictures at a Blood Bath", "authors": ["Raillan Brooks"]}

He found he liked not talking, so extended his vow of silence for a year. Francis, an environmental activist, suggests starting with four days, knowing you can always opt to go longer. In the end, he didn\u2019t speak for 17 years. \u201cI kept feeling I had more to explore,\u201d he says.\n\nTake a break from texting, emailing or participating in social media, or at least minimize your digital output. \u201cA big part of being silent is being the recipient, not the broadcaster,\u201d Francis says. Don\u2019t worry if you slip up. A couple of times, he inadvertently said something, including \u201cexcuse me\u201d after bumping into a woman in a grocery store. Once, after 10 years of silence, Francis gave himself an hour to call his worried parents before he set off alone to walk across the United States, a mute, African-American man with a banjo. Your silence should be an experience, not a contest. \u201cDon\u2019t make it a gimmick,\u201d he says.\n\nIdeally, your first foray will be in a retreat setting where you might spend time alone in nature. \u201cBut many people can\u2019t do that,\u201d Francis says. To be silent in your day-to-day life, you need to give those around you notice. Talk to your family and co-workers and see if you can work out logistics ahead of time. Francis learned some sign language over those 17 years but also got quite good at miming and using nonverbal cues if he needed to communicate. \u201cSmile a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand wave.\u201d He kept a pen and journal handy in case he needed to write something down for someone.\n\nExpect some measure of personal transformation. \u201cIt helped me find myself,\u201d says Francis, who within a few silent weeks began to realize that previously he only ever listened to people long enough to start formulating what he was going to say next; but, he says, his mind didn\u2019t need to be filled up with endless chatter.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "Get Their Perspective\n\nInstead of leading with facts, consider starting with genuine curiosity. Setting judgment to the side, ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your take on e-cigarettes?\u201d or \u201cDo you know kids who are vaping?\u201d or something along those lines.\n\nFinding out what adolescents already know and think about vaping, or any other hazardous behavior, does two things at once. First, it shapes how the rest of the exchange might go. If your teenager wrinkles her nose and says, \u201cI tried it and thought it was weird,\u201d you\u2019re having one conversation; if she responds slyly, \u201cLots of kids are doing it \u2014 I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d you\u2019re having another.\n\nSecond, asking teenagers what they know about any topic increases the odds that they\u2019ll want to hear what we know about that topic, too. To get our teenagers to take our concerns about vaping \u2014 or anything else \u2014 seriously, we should start by recognizing that they may have already drawn upon firsthand observation or personal experience to arrive at their own conclusions.\n\nAsk Why Before Suggesting Why Not\n\nAdolescents have their reasons for vaping. Some do it for the thrill of defying authority, often in view of their peers. Compact vaporizers like Juuls, which look like flash drives, allow teenagers to easily conceal their e-cigarettes and take quick, discreet hits at home, in school hallways and even in class. And some teenagers may enjoy the stimulant quality of nicotine while trusting that they are swimming in the risk-taking shallows by forgoing harder drugs. Adolescents, by their nature, often seek ways to push the limits set by adults; vaping happens to offer a convenient vehicle for doing so.\n\nOther teenagers may simply find themselves wanting to sample flavors with names like \u201cGerman Chocolate Beefcake\u201d or be drawn to e-cigarettes by mesmerizing videos of tricks done with the exhaled vapor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIf adults address only the downsides of risky temptations it\u2019s easy for adolescents to dismiss us as killjoys who just don\u2019t get it. Appreciating the allure of vaping and the other chancy things teenagers sometimes do can make it easier for adults to say their piece. In the end, we want our teenagers to weigh their options and be self-protective. We can model this approach by saying, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not that I hate fun. It\u2019s that I love you.\u201d\n\nShare Your Concerns\n\nTeenagers can be quick to tune out adults when we treat all hazards as equal. To this end, we should allow that experimenting with conventional e-cigarettes is almost certainly less harmful than experimenting with illegal drugs, while also helping teenagers understand that using e-cigarettes is not without risks. Of course, vaping is also replacing the traditional ways of smoking marijuana \u2014 what may seem like a strawberry-kiwi flavored vape could contain cannabis-infused oil.\n\n\u201cWe are still learning new things about vaping, none of which are reassuring,\u201d says Dr. Skyler Kalady, assistant professor of pediatrics and medical director of complex care at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe developing brain is a lot more susceptible to addiction,\u201d she notes, \u201cand nicotine is highly addictive.\u201d Even vaping solutions without nicotine sometimes contain compounds that may become toxic or even carcinogenic when vaporized. In addition, metal microparticles that are released by the e-cigarette\u2019s heating coils can, according to Dr. Kalady, \u201cput kids at risk for reactive airway disease, asthma and even emphysema.\u201d\n\nWe keep our teenagers\u2019 trust when we are forthright about what we know and what remains unclear.\n\n\u201cNicotine is highly addictive,\u201d we might say, \u201cand even if you don\u2019t get hooked, it can affect the way your brain is developing. As for the long-term impact of inhaling chemicals and metal particles, there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know. But why risk it?\u201d\n\nConcede the Limits of Your Power\n\nParenting teenagers would be a lot less stressful if we could lay down the law and leave it at that. But adopting a thou-shalt-not stance overestimates the adult\u2019s control and underestimates the teenager\u2019s autonomy. It can also inspire teenagers to abuse their independence to make a point.\n\nTo stay out of a fruitless (if not counterproductive) cat-and-mouse game, it\u2019s often useful for parents to take a two-pronged approach, articulating high expectations in one breath and acknowledging the limits of their power in the next. \u201cVaping isn\u2019t harmless,\u201d one might say, \u201cso I hope you will steer clear of it. That said, I don\u2019t have the power to make this choice for you. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll decide for yourself.\u201d\n\nParents who feel inclined to make rules about e-cigarettes could add, \u201cIf we find out you\u2019re using them, there will be repercussions.\u201d We serve our teenagers best when we remind them that all choices come with consequences, just as we parent most effectively when we remember that our teenagers will always have choices.\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to engage our teenagers about the dangers they face. But adolescents care what their parents think and take fewer risks when we keep the lines of communication open. In discussing dicey choices with adolescents, there are many ways to get it right. And one of those ways is to be sure that we are talking with, not at, them.", "title": "How to Talk With Teenagers About Vaping", "authors": ["Lisa Damour"]}
{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "This story on willow baskets is the first installment of a series for T on craft around the world. For each practice I researched, I knew I would discover more incredible resources and makers than could fit on just a few pages. While the focus of each column is the current state of a particular craft (what we are calling \u201cuniversal crafts,\u201d as nearly all cultures have created versions of them), it is worth noting that the craftspeople engaged in these centuries-old traditions are involved in a living practice. These are objects meant to be used, not simply regarded as historic artifacts or hung on a wall. These makers are not starting from scratch or reinventing the wheel, yet their work is the product of innovative new ideas, practices and modifications. And it is also a tangible link to our past.\n\nBaskets are unique in the realm of craft in that their materials remain unchanged in finished form. For pottery, earth is turned into clay. For weaving, wool must be spun into yarn. But the willow sticks as cut are the willow sticks that form your basket. Each of the makers featured here grow their own willow. In the winter, they coppice year-old withies, or sticks, to the ground (in the spring, the willow will sprout again from the stump). Then they bundle their harvest and transport it home, where they size and rebundle the pieces. Over a period of months, the willow sticks are left somewhere covered, but well ventilated, so that they may lose their sap. Just before weaving, the now-dry willow is soaked for about to a day in a basin of water and then drained and wrapped in a towel to mellow, so that it will bend without kinking.\n\nThere are three different ways willow can be processed for making baskets: There\u2019s unpeeled willow, called \u201cbrown,\u201d as it\u2019s still clad in its bark; there\u2019s stripped willow, called \u201cwhite,\u201d which is the palest because its bark has been skinned off; and there\u2019s the honey-hued willow, or \u201cbuff,\u201d which is boiled in water, allowing the bark\u2019s tannins to leach into the pith before it\u2019s peeled.", "title": "How to Try and Where to Buy: Willow Baskets", "authors": []}

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Games happens Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, but some of the competition actually starts sooner: Early rounds of curling and alpine skiing begin airing late Wednesday night; prime-time figure-skating coverage starts as soon as Thursday. For two and a half weeks, the networks and streaming platforms of NBCUniversal, which owns exclusive broadcast rights, will air so much skating, skiing and hockey you\u2019ll need multiple screens and DVRs to keep up with it all \u2014 more than 2,400 hours, in all.\n\nSo where can you catch every second of luge? What if you\u2019re away from your TV and need your live biathlon fix? And what if you\u2019ve cancelled your cable package?\n\nLuckily, your options are plentiful. Here\u2019s a guide for how to watch, on a variety of devices and platforms:\n\nI have cable (or an HD antenna). What\u2019s on and where?\n\nWith the rebranding of Universal HD as the Olympic Channel last year, NBC acquired a second home on the cable dial dedicated exclusively to sports. But only one \u2014 NBCSN \u2014 will be shouldering the bulk of the network\u2019s broadcasting load over the course of the games. USA and CNBC will fill in some gaps, adding a few hours of coverage of specific events, at roughly the same time each day. And while NBC has tried in the past not to compete with itself \u2014 limiting its prime-time coverage to its primary broadcast network \u2014 this year it will offer additional choices for viewers all day and night, including prime time. (For a full network schedule, go to the NBC Sports website.)\n\nNBC\n\nEvery two years, devoted Olympics-watchers complain that NBC\u2019s home channel relies too much on tape-delayed events and \u201cup close and personal\u201d human interest segments. The good news for 2018 is that even though Pyeongchang is 14 hours ahead of Eastern Time, NBC plans to air as much of its coverage as possible live. In primetime and in late night (which the network is calling prime time plus), viewers can expect live downhill and freestyle skiing, cross-country, ski jumping, snowboarding, short-track and long-track speed-skating, skeleton, bobsled and a disproportionately heavy amount of figure skating. In the afternoons \u2014 beginning around 3 p.m. Eastern, daily \u2014 NBC will have still more skating and skiing, as well as biathlon, luge, bobsled and skeleton.\n\nNBC generally tailors its network Olympic telecasts to a wide TV audience, not necessarily to sports nuts. If you\u2019re tuned into your local NBC affiliate, expect an emphasis on storytelling and pageantry, with a focus on American athletes. For more competition-driven telecasts, turn to some of NBC\u2019s affiliate networks if you have cable.\n\n0\n\nNBCSN\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of NBC\u2019s televised coverage will happen here \u2014 a wide variety of sports, airing almost round the clock. Medal rounds for most of the marquee competitions will be on your local NBC channel during primetime; but NBCSN will air prelims, pool play and early heats aplenty \u2014 including during evenings, when the channel will also host gold medal finals for biathlon, bobsled, cross-country skiing, luge, Nordic combined, short-track, ski jumping, snowboarding and speed skating.\n\nCNBC\n\nA few Olympics ago, NBC discovered that when it aired the men\u2019s and women\u2019s curling tournaments \u2014 even when the sport was relegated to one of its non-sports cable channels \u2014 American audiences tuned in, getting hooked on a competition they otherwise rarely see. The tradition will continue this year on CNBC, with games starting in the late afternoons (around 5 p.m. Eastern). CNBC will also air some hockey in its late prime time slot (around 10 p.m.).\n\nUSA\n\nAs with CNBC, USA will feature over 40 hours of Olympics coverage, also specialized. This will be mainly a home for hockey, as well as for more curling. USA\u2019s slate of games will typically begin in the wee hours after midnight and continue past dawn, ending around the time most people on the East Coast are arriving at the office. USA joins the lineup a little late, with its first telecast beginning in the early hours of Feb. 14.\n\nOlympic Channel\n\nAs one might expect, the Olympic Channel will be dedicated exclusively to the Winter Games throughout the duration. Rather than focusing on live sports, however, its coverage will be focused on highlights, news, interviews and medal ceremonies.\n\nI\u2019m away from my TV. What are my options?\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck at work \u2014 or anywhere with access to a computer \u2014 NBCOlympics.com will be streaming the Games live, in their entirety. That\u2019s \u201cevery second of competition streamed for all 15 sports and 102 events,\u201d according to NBC, as well as some practice sessions, including for figure skating. If you\u2019re on a tablet or a smartphone, the NBC Sports mobile app will carry the same content as the website. (The app is also available for a handful of set-top boxes, including Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV and Xbox, if you prefer to watch on your television.)\n\nUnlike in years past, NBC\u2019s online coverage will be available during prime time. And even events that aren\u2019t being shown on NBC or its cable partners will be streaming live. What\u2019s more, those with the proper technology can strap on their virtual-reality goggles and watch some sports in an immersive 360-degree presentation.\n\nBoth the website and the app require viewers to authenticate up front that they have a cable, satellite or telco TV subscription, and streaming is free to anyone with one of those subscriptions. And now cord-cutters can watch Olympics coverage on the website and app, too, by authenticating their subscriptions to live TV services like Hulu With Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, DirecTV Now, Playstation Vue, CenturyLink Stream and FuboTV, according to NBC Sports. (See below for more on those services.)\n\nNBC\u2019s streaming coverage is unavailable outside of the United States and its territories. For more on requirements and restrictions, check NBC\u2019s FAQ.\n\nI cut the cord already. What can I watch?\n\nPlenty. If you\u2019ve read our cord-cutting guide, you know that not having a cable or satellite subscription is no longer an impediment to watching live sports. If nothing else, you can at least get what\u2019s airing on your local NBC affiliate by hustling to any big box store and picking up an indoor HDTV antenna.\n\n0\n\nSeveral of the major subscription streaming services and other providers offer live-stream TV packages, which include not just NBC, but can also include CNBC, USA and NBCSN. Services including Hulu With Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling TV Blue, DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, FuboTV and CenturyLink Stream all have NBC as part of their standard packages, and they offer NBC\u2019s cable affiliates either within their standard package, as part of other entry-level packages of comparable price, or as add-ons for a marginal extra monthly fee. Many of these services also include some cloud DVR storage if you want to catch up with the day\u2019s hockey and curling action later. (Click the Live TV tab in our cord-cutting guide for a more detailed look at these services, including cost comparisons.)\n\nHaven\u2019t yet subscribed to a live-TV streamer? Some of these services offer five- or seven-day free trials, so if you\u2019re interested in finally trying some of them out, you can watch the Olympics while you\u2019re at it.\n\nNot all of these subscription services are available in every region, and some restrictions may apply as to what you can see. Go to the websites\u2019 sign-up pages, and you will usually be asked to enter your zip code in order to confirm what\u2019s available.

My parents believed an all-girls education would put me on the path to an Ivy League college without the distraction of boys and their gazes.\n\nTo function as a schoolgirl, I cordoned off the memories of the other life I led, a life dictated by the gaze of a middle-age man. Instead, I dreamed of growing up and getting away from him. When, during a car ride, I spoke about my hopes for college, he promised to get an apartment wherever I attended. He dreamed I would come home to him after class and live with him like a surrogate wife.\n\nI wept, devastated by the prospect of a future without exit. At the intersection he kissed my forehead, apparently mistaking my tears for joy.\n\nOver time it became harder to deny the reality of the abuse, but still I felt I could tell no one. Exposing my uncle would ruin him, and I considered myself too unimportant to upend a grown man\u2019s life. So I endured, pushing my family away and pulling my uncle close, and, I hoped, past suspicion.\n\nI felt as if I were growing into two identities, the woman I was and the woman-as-object eclipsing her. And in \u201cLolita\u201d I found a strange validation: that there was glamour to be had as an object of desire. If a pedophile\u2019s gaze could be normalized and even beautified, then perhaps I could normalize and beautify my own situation. It was easier to digest an image of myself as a nymphet than to confront the reality of my victimhood.\n\nOver time, the novel became more than a coping mechanism; it became a guide.

The social atmosphere was now sown with frustration, skepticism and ambivalence, intermingled with growing anxieties over the war and uncertainty regarding the future of the nation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here five years, and the situation has never been this bad,\u201d a university student told The Washington Post in April 1967.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in Hue\u2019s environs added to the city\u2019s tensions.

No one knew exactly how many of Hue\u2019s people were part of these networks; members worked independently and met their direct contacts only by appointment. And few people had information on what would happen to the town during the Tet holiday. Plans for the coming attacks were being made in Hanoi and carefully communicated to forward North Vietnamese units gathering in the mountains north and west of the city.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

He had become a respected high school teacher with strong anti-foreign instincts. In 1965 he began work as a liaison to Communist forces, moving easily among the town\u2019s communities of students, teachers and merchants. In the months before Tet, he was ordered to map out the locations of Hue\u2019s rice stores and pharmacies, at the same time sending medical supplies and transistor radios to his comrades in the hills. Meanwhile, the reverse flow of weapons from his comrades found its way into town.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut by the final days before the holiday, Hue\u2019s populace had set its anxieties aside, temporarily disregarding ominous signs to embrace the arrival of a new and hopefully better year. Train and bus stations were packed with passengers carting fresh flowers and festival cakes and candies made of glutinous rice, beans and ginger or lotus seeds, all wrapped in banana leaves or colorful translucent plastic wrap. With the annual Tet cease-fire, about half of South Vietnamese military personnel were off duty, their families welcoming them home for a time, at least, fathers and sons, brothers and nephews and uncles.\n\nAmong these hurried travelers was Tran Thi Thu Van, who had left her husband and children in Saigon to rush home for her father\u2019s funeral on the eve of the lunar new year, Jan. 29, 1968. Seeing out the old year with death and mourning, Ms. Thu Van and her family adorned their heads with traditional white crepe mourning bands.\n\nThere were warnings of a surprise attack, but it was expected to be just the usual small guerrilla force striking quickly in the night and disappearing before dawn.\n\nThe Year of the Earthen Monkey was ushered in with the customary \u201cgiao thua\u201d family altar rites at midnight on the new day of Jan. 30, 1968; those with Communist sympathies tuned their radios north to hear Ho Chi Minh reading his annual \u201cSpring Poem.\u201d First Day passed with food and family and visits to friends and temples, and card games at night. Rich, poor, Buddhist, Christian \u2014 all believed the events of First Day foreshadowed the year to come, so they were grateful when the day passed in peace.\n\nThat night, Ho Tan Phan attended a meeting at a comrade\u2019s house; back home by 11, he turned on his radio and, in his room full of books, waited for what he knew was coming as the day turned.\n\nShortly after midnight on Jan. 31, 1968, waves of Communist troops converged from multiple locations around Hue. Around 2:30 a.m. automatic weapons and artillery rained hellfire on the town. South Vietnamese soldiers visiting home recognized the sound of Soviet B-40 rockets and the clack-clack of AK-47s, all of them so close.\n\nMs. Thu Van woke up in her family\u2019s ancestor-worshiping house. \u201cI do not know when was the first gunfire,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the middle of the night I was suddenly awake with explosions shredding my fragmentary dream. As soon as I rolled off of the wooden plank bed, my ears were ringing with the sounds of guns firing from all directions. What was this?\u201d\n\nAfter the initial moments of surprise, it was quickly understood that this was something unforeseen. The attackers shouted out commands in the rough tones of North Vietnamese.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Tet offensive had begun, in Hue and throughout South Vietnam.\n\nBefore the day was far gone, the city had become one of the war\u2019s deadliest fronts and, after 25 days of struggle, would become the offensive\u2019s longest, bloodiest battle.\n\nThe abundance of food prepared for feasting allowed the people of Hue to feed themselves through four weeks of siege. But thousands, mainly civilians, were killed, and the great pride of the Viet empire \u2014 the royal Citadel \u2014 was in ruins.\n\nThe city of kings had become a city of ghosts, its bloody metamorphosis immortalized forever by Tran Thi Thu Van, using her pen name, Nha Ca, in her novel \u201cMourning Headband for Hue\u201d and in a pair of songs composed by Hue\u2019s native son Trinh Cong Son, \u201cSing Upon the Corpses\u201d and \u201cA Song for the Corpses,\u201d whose haunting words and melodies ring even today like wind over bones:\n\nCorpses lie all around here, in this cold rain/Next to corpses of the old and weak, corpses of the still innocent \u2026.", "title": "Hue Prepared for a Holiday, Then the War Came", "authors": ["Nguyen Diu-Huong"]}

Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu\u2019s owners \u2014 Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal \u2014 will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly awkward,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. \u201cThe question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?\u201d\n\nThe corporate uncertainties have come to Hulu at a time of mounting losses: It lost $920 million in 2017, according to BTIG, which projects that the business will lose $1.67 billion this year. Hulu is also facing more intense competition than ever as its rivals disrupt the entertainment industry by handing out big checks. In recent months, Netflix has signed the producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure deals; Amazon has pledged more than $200 million toward a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series; and Apple, a newcomer in the field, is shelling out hundreds of millions to create original programming of its own.\n\nThe outlook is not all bleak. According to Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, Hulu had more subscriber growth domestically than Netflix in the last two quarters of 2017. And this month, Disney signaled its commitment when its chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, suggested that the other streaming services now in the works at Disney would not get in Hulu\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much in support of growing Hulu,\u201d Mr. Mayer said at Recode\u2019s Code Media conference. \u201cIt takes an investment, for sure. We\u2019re happy to undertake that investment for the outcome, which we know is going to happen. It\u2019s going to be a big, profitable service.\u201d\n\nHulu has tried to match its rivals in courting talent aggressively. In addition to greenlighting \u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d and \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d the company made a deal with George Clooney for a six-episode adaptation of \u201cCatch-22\u201d; signed Jason Blum, a producer of \u201cGet Out,\u201d for a monthly horror anthology series; brought aboard Beau Willimon, the creator of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d for a series starring Sean Penn about human colonization of Mars; and arranged for a reboot of the popular 1990s cartoon \u201cAnimaniacs\u201d with Steven Spielberg and his Amblin Entertainment production company.\n\nHulu has also built up its catalog by gaining the rights to shows like \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Its recent purchase of the 15-season library of the NBC medical drama \u201cER\u201d \u2014 which had not appeared on any streaming platform since it went off the air in 2009 \u2014 prompted think pieces about the show\u2019s surprising popularity in 2018.

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "The seeming contradiction between the analysis based on partisan symmetry and one based on simulated nonpartisan congressional districts gets at the heart of what may be the next big debate in gerrymandering: whether nonpartisan maps should strive for partisan symmetry, or whether they should try to avoid political considerations altogether.\n\nThe question is important because both methods of analysis are routinely employed to identify Republican gerrymanders.\n\nAnd it is likely to continue to be a question, because it emerges when Democrats are at a geographic disadvantage, as they often tend to be. Just look at Pennsylvania. Democrats waste more votes than Republicans by carrying urban areas, like Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, by more lopsided margins than the Republicans carry their best areas. The result is that the rest of the state, and therefore the rest of its districts, tend to favor Republicans.\n\nIf one believes that partisan symmetry should be a goal in redistricting, the new map is eminently fair. It gives both parties a similar chance to translate their votes to seats, and makes no compromises to do so; it still admirably adheres to standard nonpartisan criteria like compactness or minimizing county splits.\n\nThe Upshot analysis also helps address a more arcane matter in the debate about the new court-ordered map: why many nonpartisan analysts thought it favored Democrats, even though it seemed to score well \u2014 it wasn\u2019t an outlier \u2014 by the measure of Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis. The reason is simple: Most nonpartisan analysts have judged the map by today\u2019s electoral landscape, while Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis used elections from 2008 and 2010.\n\nBack then, Pennsylvania\u2019s political geography did not pose such a severe challenge to Democrats. But since then, the Democrats\u2019 geographic disadvantage has worsened. State and national Democrats lost ground in traditionally Democratic areas in western and northeastern Pennsylvania where the party still excelled as late as 2008 and 2010; they gained additional ground in many urban and suburban areas where Democrats already had an advantage. As a result, Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations imply that Democrats were at a notable geographic disadvantage in 2016, but not 2008 or 2010.\n\nWhatever the limitations of these simulations, the fact remains that the court seemed to find this sort of analysis persuasive. The strong Democratic performance on the remedial map adopted last week may imply that the map was drawn with consideration for attaining partisan symmetry, and perhaps even specifically by the measure of average Democratic performance in 2016 statewide elections.", "title": "Hundreds of Simulated Maps Show How Well Democrats Fared in Pennsylvania", "authors": []}

More curious than afraid, Ms. McNamara went to the alley where the body was found, and picked up shards of the victim\u2019s broken Walkman. The killer was never caught.\n\nShe was living in Los Angeles and writing screenplays and TV pilots when she met Mr. Oswalt in 2003, at one of his comedy shows. They went on a few dates and bonded over their shared obsession with serial killers. They got married a couple of years later, and Mr. Oswalt urged her to channel her grim hobby into writing. In 2006, she launched her website, True Crime Diary, where she chronicled hundreds of unsolved crimes.\n\nIn 2011, she wrote on her blog about a string of unsolved rapes and murders from the 1970s and 1980s that were committed by an unidentified man who was known as the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy.\u201d For a true crime addict, the case was tantalizingly complex.

He was a meticulous planner who stalked his targets in advance, learning their daily routines before breaking into their homes. He brought his own precut ligatures to tie victims up, and always wore a mask. He stole objects that had sentimental value for the victims, like engraved jewelry and class rings. He grew increasingly confident, and went from assaulting women who were home alone to attacking couples in their bedrooms. She gave him a catchier name: the Golden State Killer.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. McNamara wrote about the case for Los Angeles magazine, and signed a book deal with Harper several months later.\n\nThe research consumed her, and began to weigh on her. She suffered from insomnia and anxiety. Once, she panicked because she woke up to a scraping sound: A neighbor was dragging his trash can to the curb in the middle of the night, Mr. Oswalt said. Another time, when Mr. Oswalt tiptoed into their bedroom, trying not to wake her, she mistook him for an intruder and jumped out of bed and swung a lamp at his head. She felt an obligation to solve the case, and was devastated each time she developed a promising theory or zeroed in on a suspect but failed to find sufficient evidence.\n\n\u201cShe had overloaded her mind with information with very dark implications,\u201d Mr. Oswalt said.\n\nMr. Oswalt wasn\u2019t aware of all the prescriptions she was taking or what the medications were for, he said. Both of them led busy work lives and were devoted parents to their then 7-year-old daughter, Alice, and Ms. McNamara seemed to be managing the stress. It wasn\u2019t until he saw the coroner\u2019s report months after her death that he realized that Ms. McNamara was coping in part by taking prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so clear that the stress led her to make some bad choices in terms of the pharmaceuticals she was using,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just took this stuff on, and she didn\u2019t have the years of being a hardened detective to compartmentalize it.\u201d\n\nMr. Oswalt, who married the actress Meredith Salenger last year, said he still thinks there\u2019s a chance the killer will eventually be caught, due in part to the work Ms. McNamara did and the attention it brought to a decades old cold case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McNamara believed that too. In a letter to the killer that appears at the end of \u201cI\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark,\u201d she addresses him directly, and says it\u2019s only a matter of time until officers arrive at his door. \u201cThis is how it ends for you,\u201d she writes.", "title": "Michelle McNamara Hunted, and Was Haunted by, the Golden State Killer", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"]}

After all, it has no flavor, and more often than not it\u2019s left off ingredient lists, making it seem like an afterthought. Yet water is an essential element of almost everything we cook and eat, and it affects the flavor and texture of all our food. This is in part because many ingredients \u2014 including all fruits and vegetables \u2014 contain some water, which they\u2019ll start to release when they\u2019re cut, salted and heated. And water affects how an ingredient will brown. The temperatures required for caramelization and browning almost always far exceed the boiling point of water. So the presence of water on the surface of a food, or on the bottom of a pan, is a signal that browning can\u2019t yet occur. And in a lidded pot, steam \u2014 water\u2019s gaseous alter ego \u2014 will condense, return to its former state and drip back inside.\n\nRemember this when you set out to caramelize the huge pile of onions for your panade, and use it to your advantage. Slide the heap of onions into the heated oil, and add a pinch of salt, which will begin to draw water out. Give the onions a stir, release some steam and set the lid on the pan. Let the onions wilt and soften. Now that you\u2019ve drawn the bulk of the water out of the onions, remove the lid, increase the heat and let that water cook away so that browning can commence.\n\nWater also affects flavor in a simpler way: Add it to dilute, and remove it \u2014 or let it evaporate \u2014 to intensify flavor. When introducing his panade recipe, Olney emphasized that the precise measurements don\u2019t matter much. \u201cThe important thing,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that there should be lots of onion, lots of bread and lots of cheese in relation to the amount of water.\u201d Increase the proportion of liquid, and you\u2019ll turn this dish into a less filling \u2014 but no less delicious \u2014 first course: soup. Because I\u2019m always looking to boost flavor, I\u2019m quick to replace water with stock, as I urge you to do with this dish. But no matter what you\u2019re cooking, you can consider replacing water with another, more savory liquid, be it chopped canned tomatoes, coconut milk or wine, to weave in an extra strand of flavor.", "title": "I Buy Fancy Bread Just to Let It Grow Stale.

My husband and I bought our house in West Orange, N.J., after first renting 10 minutes away in Montclair. We entered the deal aware that we were forever signing away our previous life in Brooklyn. I accepted the bargain because I like the slower pace and the small-town vibe. But I have also made peace with the fact that the city is no longer at my doorstep, and that my quaint downtown strip is no New York.\n\nI, of course, am not alone. In 2017, home sales hit a 35-year high in Westchester County and a 14-year high in Nassau County, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants. \u201cCity costs have risen more than the cost of a home\u201d in the suburbs, Mr. Miller said. \u201cWe can see that in the massive migration in the last three or four years of city dwellers.\u201d\n\nOver the past 25 years, the number of people commuting across the Hudson River has grown by 28 percent, to 320,000 people a day, with bus trips up 83 percent and nearly tripling the number of rail trips in and out of Penn Station, according to a 2017 Regional Plan Association report.\n\nCompanies like PicketFencer and NeighborhoodScout offer services that play destination matchmaker for these newcomers. But until you get here, it\u2019s hard to realize how far you have actually gone. Train and bus schedules are deceptively optimistic. Talk to real estate brokers and they reinforce the rosy narrative, rattling off options \u2014 the jitney stops at the corner! There\u2019s a park-n-ride five minutes away! You can walk to the train!\n\nMaps don\u2019t do the situation justice either. Just ask Ilana Dubrovsky, 32. When she was considering moving out of Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, with her husband, Allen Razam, 40, and their two children, she pulled out a map and drew a circle around the city. She limited her search to towns less than an hour away. She settled on South Orange, N.J., where she and her husband bought a six-bedroom house in 2014. \u201cI wanted that access. I wanted to see our friends,\u201d said Ms. Dubrovsky, who works in sales.\n\nDo you want to know how many times she has been to Brooklyn in the past four years? Twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a pain in the butt,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put two kids on the train, so then I drive.

Why battle crowds and traffic to go to Prospect Park when there\u2019s a nature reserve with a zoo and miniature golf up the road? \u201cI just don\u2019t have the patience for the city anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer husband, however, a real estate broker and personal trainer, still works in Brooklyn, and leaves the house at 4 a.m. every morning to beat the traffic.\n\nLeave Brooklyn and you trade Sahadi\u2019s grocery for impromptu barbecues with a dozen neighbors. Have you seen the size of the parking lot at Costco? You can really load up on burgers. Join the town pool, and you spread out your towel on the grass \u2014 yes, there\u2019s grass at the pool \u2014 and wait for friends from the neighborhood to just show up.\n\nThe perks make it easier to forget the two miserable hours you spent commuting on the train this morning when a city friend asks what it\u2019s like to live out here. Instead, you focus on the charm. Did I tell you about those cute fawns in the yard? And, of course, there are the happy Park Slope transplants.\n\nThis might explain how Jennifer and Mark Loga ended up buying a four-bedroom house in Maplewood last December without realizing how long their new commutes would soon be. \u201cEverything that we heard was that it was really convenient,\u201d Mrs. Loga, 31, told me in January when she was eight months pregnant. It was about three weeks after they had moved from Jersey City. The couple had lived in Brooklyn before that.\n\n\u201cNobody was like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s a great area, but your commute is going to be horrible,\u2019\u201d she said. Mrs. Loga works in marketing near Madison Square Park and Mr. Loga, 32, a civil engineer, works in the Financial District. \u201cDid we think it was going to be an hour and a half each way? No.\u201d\n\nWondering how buyers can arrive here unprepared for what\u2019s ahead, I called Leslie Kunkin, a real estate broker who I met one night in 2010 while trapped on a bus for three hours in a snowstorm. Finally, at 3 a.m., we were dropped off on a deserted Montclair street corner to trudge home in knee high snow. Yet, somehow, the odyssey didn\u2019t completely sour me on the suburbs and Ms. Kunkin sold me my house three years later.\n\nIn December, Ms. Kunkin and a group of other brokers started an agency, West of Hudson Realty Group, because Montclair is, you know, west of the Hudson River. \u201cDespite our snowstorm, I stand behind our commute,\u201d she said, describing the commute, on the whole, as \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure you get stuck in traffic,\u201d she said.

We\u2019ve seen this before: a campaign built on the politicization of intelligence and shortsighted policy decisions to make the case for war. And the American people have apparently become so accustomed to executive branch warmongering \u2014 approved almost unanimously by the Congress \u2014 that such actions are not significantly contested.\n\nSo far, news organizations have largely failed to refute false narratives coming out of the Trump White House on Iran. In early November, news outlets latched onto claims by unnamed American officials that newly released documents from Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound represented \u201cevidence of Iran\u2019s support of Al Qaeda\u2019s war with the United States.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a vivid reminder of Vice President Cheney\u2019s desperate attempts in 2002-03 to conjure up evidence of Saddam Hussein\u2019s relationship with Al Qaeda from detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It harks back to the C.I.A. director George Tenet\u2019s assurances to Mr. Powell that the connection between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden was ironclad in the lead-up to his United Nations presentation. Today, we know how terribly wrong Mr. Tenet was.\n\nToday, the analysts claiming close ties between Al Qaeda and Iran come from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which vehemently opposes the Iran nuclear deal and unabashedly calls for regime change in Iran.\n\nIt seems not to matter that 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were Saudis and none were Iranians. Or that, according to the United States intelligence community, of the groups listed as actively hostile to the United States, only one is loosely affiliated with Iran, and Hezbollah doesn\u2019t make the cut. More than ever the Foundation for Defense of Democracies seems like the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Special Plans that pushed falsehoods in support of waging war with Iraq.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s case for war with Iran ranges much wider than Ms. Haley\u2019s work. We should include the president\u2019s decertification ultimatum in January that Congress must \u201cfix\u201d the Iran nuclear deal, despite the reality of Iran\u2019s compliance; the White House\u2019s pressure on the intelligence community to cook up evidence of Iran\u2019s noncompliance; and the administration\u2019s choosing to view the recent protests in Iran as the beginning of regime change. Like the Bush administration before, these seemingly disconnected events serve to create a narrative in which war with Iran is the only viable policy.\n\nAs I look back at our lock-step march toward war with Iraq, I realize that it didn\u2019t seem to matter to us that we used shoddy or cherry-picked intelligence; that it was unrealistic to argue that the war would \u201cpay for itself,\u201d rather than cost trillions of dollars; that we might be hopelessly na\u00efve in thinking that the war would lead to democracy instead of pushing the region into a downward spiral.\n\nThe sole purpose of our actions was to sell the American people on the case for war with Iraq.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "The video above is based on the following letter, which I wrote to my senator, Marco Rubio, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I urge you to hold your elected officials accountable by sending them a letter and tagging them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and whatever other social media platforms you use.\n\nDear Senator Rubio,\n\nI am writing to you as a former employee of your Tallahassee, Florida office. My sophomore year at Florida State University, I accepted a non-partisan internship at your Tallahassee, Fla. location. As an eager, young Political Science student, I was excited to get my foot in the door of a Senator\u2019s office; however, I was dismayed when your staff told me that you probably wouldn\u2019t be present for the duration of my internship.\n\nAs it turns out, they were right \u2013 I worked for your team for five whole months, twenty hours a week, and never once saw you in the office.\n\nAs an intern, I was tasked with fielding constituents\u2019 calls and writing their comments into a call log, which was sent to you at the end of each week. Supposedly, you used this log to address the needs of constituents, but I am skeptical that you ever actually read through it.\n\nNow, three years later, I am one of those concerned constituents pleading for change from you, our elected Florida official. I am afraid, though, that my pleas for help will fall on the ears of another intern and go no further \u2013 but you can prove me wrong by taking action against gun violence.\n\nWhen I was 19-years-old, FSU \u2013 my home away from home \u2013 experienced a campus shooting. On November 20, 2015, Myron May approached the Strozier Library on FSU\u2019s campus and opened fire on students using a .380-caliber handgun. Three of my fellow colleagues were injured. May was mentally disturbed and consumed by paranoia to a point where he sought to murder people on my campus.\n\nThankfully, during the shooting I was not at the scene of the crime, but rather, across the street sitting in my dorm. While I studied for my upcoming finals, students were being shot a few yards away from me.\n\nWhen I was 20-years-old, yet another community I hold close to my heart suffered a mass shooting. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 others using an AR-15 style-rifle at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Mateen specifically targeted LGBTQ+ Latinx/people-of-color that evening.\n\nI was about one mile up the same street from the massacre that night. Again, a blood bath occurred yards away from me and my friends.\n\nLess than 7 months later, tragedy struck while I was visiting home for winter break. January 6, 2017, Esteban Santiago-Ruiz used a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol to gun down five individuals and injure six others at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The Broward County airport my family used to travel our entire lives became a warzone.\n\nToday, I am a 21-year-old college graduate and am writing this with great despair \u2013 and even more anger. On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz used an AR-15 style-rifle to murder 17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and staff, and injured at least 14 more.\n\nI sat in my parents\u2019 home, just around the corner from my alma mater, as children were being slaughtered. Once again, I sat in a silo of safety as a bloody massacre literally played out across the street.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in the serene town of Parkland since I was three-years-old, and attended MSD for four formative years of my life. The hallways where I once shared laughter, curiosity, and hope are now crime scenes. Members of my community have lost their lives. Students and staff of MSD are traumatized. My tight-knit community of loving people is broken.\n\nI am in shock that one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history happened in Parkland, Fla., my hometown \u2013 the safest place in Florida.\n\nIn my short lifetime, these countless acts of terror have plagued communities throughout the United States with unimaginable grief, and it is time for this pattern to stop. I will no longer feel helpless nor sit idly by while these atrocities occur.\n\nI will not accept mass shootings as the norm.\n\nIt is YOUR responsibility as our elected official to pass laws that protect your constituents. This isn\u2019t about party politics - this is about human lives. I am begging you to implement a systematic plan that will end the mass shooting epidemic in Florida and beyond, starting with:\n\n\u00b7 Stricter gun licensing\n\n\u00b7 Recognizing gun violence as a public health issue\n\n\u00b7 Funding research on gun violence and gun violence prevention\n\n\u00b7 Extensive background checks for gun purchases\n\n\u00b7 Close loopholes in gun purchasing (i.e. gun shows)\n\n\u00b7 Implementing a buffer period between purchasing a rifle and taking it home\n\nIt is shameful that I have to write this and beg you to do SOMETHING.\n\nI hope you have read my letter free from the influence of wealthy lobbyists who may impede your senatorial judgment. I hope you read this letter at all.\n\nRespectfully, your former intern and concerned Parkland citizen,\n\nShana Miranda Rosenthal", "title": "Opinion | I Interned for Senator Rubio.

Quitting Twitter is just a thing that you can do. I mention it only because there was a time when I didn\u2019t think it was a thing that I could do, and then I did it, and now my life is better.\n\nI\u2019m frequently approached by colleagues, usually women, who ask me about quitting Twitter with hushed titillation, as if I\u2019ve escaped a cult or broken a particularly seductive taboo. Well, here\u2019s what my new life is like: I don\u2019t wake up with a pit in my stomach every day, dreading what horrors accrued in my phone overnight. I don\u2019t get dragged into protracted, bad-faith arguments with teenage boys about whether poor people deserve medical care, or whether putting nice guys in the friend zone is a hate crime. I don\u2019t spend hours every week blocking and reporting trolls and screen-grabbing abuse in case it someday escalates into a credible threat. I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge filled with swastikas and Alex Jones\u2019s spittle. Time is finite, and now I have more of it.\n\nAt the same time, I know this conversation is more complicated than that. I\u2019ve lost a large platform to self-promote and make professional connections, which isn\u2019t something many writers can afford to give up (less established writers and marginalized writers most of all \u2014 in a horrid irony, the same writers disproportionately abused on Twitter). I get my news on a slight delay. I seethe at the perception that I ceded any ground to trolls trying to push me out. I will probably never persuade RuPaul to be my friend. Also, I loved Twitter. Twitter is funny and smart and validating and cathartic. It feels, when you are embroiled in it, like the place where everything is happening. (Scoff if you like, but the president of the United States makes major policy announcements there. This is the world now.)\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have had to walk away from all that because for Twitter to take a firm stance against neo-Nazism might have cost it some incalculable sliver of profit. No one should. Sure, as in everything, global culture change would have been better. But I didn\u2019t have global culture change, and I\u2019m better equipped to fight for global culture change now that I\u2019m not locked in eternal whack-a-mole with a sea of angry boy-men, an unknown percentage of which are probably robots.\n\nWhen you deactivate a verified Twitter account (nail-polish emoji), you have one year to log back in or your account \u2014 everything you ever tweeted, every reply in every thread \u2014 is permanently deleted. I always planned to log in and then immediately deactivate again, to re-up for another year. I figured I\u2019d eventually reactivate, even if just for posterity. I was part of some important cultural conversations; I said some smart things before other people said them; I made some good jokes. One time the actor Michael McKean called me \u201cdoodlebug\u201d in an affectionate manner because he liked one of my movie reviews. I wouldn\u2019t mind preserving that.\n\nLast week I realized: I was late. I\u2019d forgotten to log back in. A year had passed. It\u2019s all gone.

After Mary Wollstonecraft published her \u201cVindication of the Rights of Woman\u201d in 1792, laying the groundwork for discussions of gender equity, Horace Walpole mocked her as a \u201chyena in petticoats,\u201d and she was savaged for her \u201cwhoredoms.\u201d\n\nFlash forward, and Breitbart reflected the same ethos when it published an article declaring \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.\u201d But this isn\u2019t just a battle of the sexes, and one reason for hope is that youth and education are sometimes better predictors of attitudes toward women\u2019s rights than gender is. Last year for the first time, Gallup found that a majority of Americans don\u2019t care whether their boss is a man or a woman; Americans under 35 actually prefer a female boss over a male boss by 14 percentage points.\n\nThe most important trend in the world, I believe, is the empowerment of women. This is transforming society and the global economy (although researchers believe that the world would still be $28 trillion richer if gender gaps were bridged).\n\nWhy is a man writing this column? Frankly, because women\u2019s rights aren\u2019t \u201cjust a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d any more than civil rights were \u201cjust a black issue.\u201d We all have an interest in a more fair society \u2014 and if only women speak up for gender equity, they may be dismissed as shrill \u201chyenas.\u201d\n\nWhat matters above all are policies. That means pushing for easier family leave, better child care, more women on boards, and cracking down on sex trafficking and domestic violence. It means helping teenage girls avoid pregnancy, providing locations at work for moms to express milk, and confronting the general tendency to defer to male self-confidence rather than female expertise. It means a determined effort to hold accountable sexual predators even when they\u2019re not Hollywood figures but simply factory supervisors or shift managers at a McDonald\u2019s.\n\nOf course there will be disagreements about policies or about where to draw lines \u2014 about what to make of Aziz Ansari and how to distinguish between the Harvey Weinsteins and the Al Frankens.

Any apology you made would be unsatisfying. You feel no actual remorse.\n\nInstead, you made a pragmatic call about the best way to deal with his ex-wife. (You rationalize it still, and I may agree with you.) But deciding how to interact with his ex, early in your marriage, was mostly your husband\u2019s call. You robbed him of that choice, probably accidentally, but you seem not to have acknowledged your mistake.\n\nGive him his due now.

I secured it with a padlock overnight while I slept in the barracks, and unlocked it each morning before chow.\n\nOnly at the shooting range was I allowed to check out magazines and ammo from the armory. The first day at the range I spent 12 hours disassembling, cleaning and reassembling the weapon. I had to do this blindfolded. I had to do this while a drill instructor hurried me, yelling that enemies were at the gate. I had to do this while fellow Marines wept nearby from doing hundreds of burpees as punishment for not being able to reassemble their weapons fast enough.\n\nThe military issue M-16 is the model for the AR-15 assault rifle that the accused shooter used to kill 17 people this month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter bought the weapon lawfully. He received zero hours of mandated training. There is no reason that any civilian, of any age, should possess this rifle.\n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, President Trump suggested that if a football coach at the high school, Aaron Feis, had been armed, he would have saved even more lives than he did, perhaps even his own, because rather than simply shielding students from gunfire, he could have drawn his weapon, fired and killed the assailant \u2014 putting a tidy end to the rampage.", "title": "Opinion | I Was a Marine.

Haggerty said the proposal had received unanimous support from the I.T.F.\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThough mild-mannered in person, Haggerty is unafraid to make bold moves (if this one fails, his bid for re-election in 2019 certainly will suffer, too). A former tennis industry executive and a former president of the United States Tennis Association, Haggerty was among those who pushed successfully for a roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open and for the U.S.T.A.\u2019s vast new complex at Lake Nona in Orlando, Fla.\n\n\u201cCertainly this is a big decision for the I.T.F.,\u201d Haggerty said by telephone from London on Monday. \u201cWe know the environment has changed in tennis over the last few years. Players are playing later in their careers. It\u2019s a very physical sport, so I think many factors were taken into account.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, if you go back 50 years ago, in Bournemouth they had the first Open tennis event. There had to have been a number of tennis leaders sitting around saying, \u2018Jeez, tennis is O.K., do we really need to make this change? What is it going to do to us? Is it good or bad?\u2019 You never know, so that strength of conviction, they had that at the time. They took a risk, but look how tennis has changed.

Haggerty also said that national federations would benefit.\n\nIf the overhaul is approved, only the seasons ahead will determine who was correct in their assessment: the Kafelnikovs or the Haggertys. But one can understand the lure and the timing.

Each team would have four players, and each encounter would include two singles matches and one doubles match. Eight teams would advance to the quarterfinals (the six group winners plus the two best second-place teams) and would be guaranteed a spot in the following year\u2019s final phase.\n\nDuring the week, the strongest eight of the 10 eliminated teams would then play for a place in the following year\u2019s competition against the eight teams who have come through home-and-away qualifying during the Davis Cup\u2019s traditional dates earlier in the season. The semifinals would be played on Saturday, and the final on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing is that by the end of the week, you\u2019ll know the 16 teams playing in next year\u2019s event,\u201d Haggerty said.\n\nHe said the 17th and 18th teams would be selected by the I.T.F. and Kosmos \u201cbased on criteria to be determined.\u201d\n\nSuch an overhaul would have been unthinkable in Davis Cup\u2019s heyday, when its prestige was on par with the four Grand Slam tournaments in the 1930s, \u201940s and \u201950s. But those moments are long gone, even if Davis Cup continues to generate big crowds and enthusiasm in several countries, including France, which won the title for the 10th time last year.\n\nBut many leading players and tennis officials have been clamoring for a change in format for decades. In this golden age in the men\u2019s game, the biggest stars \u2014 including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic \u2014 have all been part of winning Davis Cup teams but have rarely participated at the same time as one another and have faced each other too rarely in the event.\n\nAlso, rival national-team events with shorter formats have surfaced, including the Laver Cup, which was started successfully last year by Roger Federer\u2019s management company, pitting a European Team against an International Team.\n\nBut the biggest threat was the ATP\u2019s recent interest in relaunching the single-week World Team Cup, which could have further reduced top players\u2019 interest in committing to Davis Cup. Piqu\u00e9\u2019s group, with support from Djokovic, first negotiated with the ATP and its executive chairman Chris Kermode about creating such an event before turning to the I.T.F. in late November.\n\nThe result was Monday\u2019s announcement.

{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "The result is that the highest echelons of academia, think tanks and research institutions are dominated by men. So if we go by seemingly objective criteria like seniority or citation counts, the \u201cbest\u201d experts will overwhelmingly be men. We can\u2019t fix those imbalances on our own, but we can try to correct for them in our own writing by ignoring seniority and deciding for ourselves whose work is worth quoting. We start by looking offline to find equally qualified \u2014 or, often, better qualified \u2014 women, by scanning academic journals and asking around for names.\n\nThat, unsurprisingly, can rankle people. It can rankle the men who believe we skipped over them unfairly and the institutions that wish to promote their most senior figures. Tellingly, some think tanks that publicize all-female panels also bar junior fellows from speaking to the news media, silencing the women in that role. And it can rankle readers, some of whom inevitably ask a variation of, \u201cIsn\u2019t that just more discrimination?\u201d\n\nThis is the challenge of systemic gender bias. No one person can fix it, even with the benefit of a platform as powerful as The New York Times. But conscious efforts to correct for its effects can, at a glance, look unfair because the biases that privilege men, while far more systemic, are often less visible. Last November, over 200 women in national security signed an open letter warning that sexual assault, harassment and \u201cenvironments that silence, demean, belittle or neglect women\u201d were driving their female colleagues from the field. And a 2015 analysis by Micah Zenko and Amelia M. Wolf found that women were sharply underrepresented in think tank leadership and senior government positions relating to foreign policy and national security.\n\nWe haven\u2019t undertaken the kind of rigorous accounting of our sources that Ed Yong and Adrienne LaFrance of The Atlantic have, though we suspect we\u2019d be similarly disappointed by the results. But even if we\u2019ve hardly closed the gender gap in our work, the act of trying isn\u2019t just our responsibility: It has its own benefits. We, and readers, are exposed to ideas and research otherwise obscured by systemic bias. Articles exclusively quoting women register with colleagues, who tell us they will try it themselves. The most rewarding feedback comes from young professional women, who see encouragement amid the many obstacles they face.\n\nThese are only symbolic gestures. But perhaps they are a reminder that the gender gap, though so pervasive it can sometimes feel normal, is anything but.\n\nRebecca Hamilton, an American University assistant law professor, tweeted in response to our recent article, \u201cSuch a surreal experience to read a national security article so populated with the voices of female experts.\u201d\n\nIt can indeed feel surreal to see women granted the same intellectual weight as men.

The current situation is certainly accelerating decisions about this.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s original decision to join the free trade pact with the United States divided the country.\n\nTrade policies dating back almost to Canada\u2019s founding meant that aside from automobile and car part plants \u2014 which had been under a limited free trade agreement since 1965 \u2014 many Canadian factories were relatively small and inefficient. They largely owed their existence to the high tariffs that kept out imports from the United States and elsewhere.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, tariffs in the United States made Canadian exports a tough sell for many industries.\n\nAs those tariffs disappeared under Nafta, so did many Canadian businesses, and the jobs that went with them. Memories of those closings still rankle many Canadians, even though many economists say that automation and other factors would have doomed many of the jobs regardless of new trade rules.\n\nWhile much is unclear about exactly what would happen if Nafta comes to an end, there is universal agreement that the factories that closed \u2014 like a Hershey chocolate plant that moved from Smiths Falls, Ontario, to Mexico after that country joined Nafta in 1994 \u2014 are not coming back.\n\nAlso not returning are the high tariffs that created and sustained many factories, both in the United States and Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe agreement that created the World Trade Organization in 1995 means that, in the worst-case scenarios, Canadian companies would be facing duties of about 5 percent on shipments to American customers, and closer to 3 percent on many auto parts.\n\nWhile those duties are not exactly negligible, Canadian companies have successfully dealt for years with much larger percentage swings in the exchange rate between the American and Canadian dollars.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Herman, a trade lawyer in Toronto and a former Canadian diplomat. \u201cCanada would continue to do business with the United States \u2014 maybe just not as efficiently.\u201d\n\nGus Van Harten, a professor of international investment law at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto, has long criticized Nafta for allowing American and Mexican companies to sue if they feel they have been treated unfairly by Canadian laws and regulations. These complaints (which can also be filed by Canadian companies over practices in the other two Nafta countries) are heard by arbitrators, not courts, and the decisions cannot be reversed.\n\nThe system was originally introduced, Professor Van Harten said, to protect Canadian and American investments in Mexico. But based on his research, Canada has been sued twice as much as Mexico and has lost several prominent cases, including one in which the Canadian government had rejected, for \u201csignificant adverse environmental effects,\u201d a quarry in Nova Scotia proposed by an American company. Because these complaints allow retroactive damages, including compensation for lost profits, the amounts involved could be billions of dollars, creating what Professor Van Harten called \u201cpotentially catastrophic risk.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWith or without Nafta, geography means that the United States will continue to be Canada\u2019s largest customer.\n\nBut the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement \u2014 which was initially to include the United States, until Mr. Trump pulled out \u2014 and a Canada-European Union trade deal reached in late 2016 could significantly expand business opportunities for Canadian companies across oceans.\n\nSuch entry into new global markets will not be possible for every industry. Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency, said that, for example, it is unlikely that Canadian auto parts will make their way to Japan or Europe. \u201cSo we\u2019d better stay on good terms with the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Cross, now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group in Ottawa.\n\nBut some major Canadian industries have weaned themselves off a near-total reliance on Nafta markets for their exports.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBritish Columbia once sent nearly all of its softwood lumber exports to the United States. Now, the United States accounts for about 49 percent of that industry\u2019s 5 billion Canadian dollar export business, with 26 percent of sales going to China and 16 percent to Japan.\n\nEven if Nafta disappears, Susan Yurkovich, the president of the B.C.

Parts like pig\u2019s feet, which have a relatively small market in North America, can fetch premium prices in Asia.\n\nBut, Mr. Davies added, the search for new markets also came out of concerns about relying too heavily on a single customer. During the early 1990s, the United States took more than three-quarters of Canada\u2019s pork exports. Today, Mr. Davies said, it accounts for less than 30 percent at Olymel.\n\nGiven all the uncertainty surrounding Nafta, Mr. Davies said it is not practical to try to plan for its demise.

After all, the reason Congress is even debating immigration at this point stems from the Dreamers\u2019 own courage in advocating a solution consistent with our best democratic traditions.\n\nIf the Dreamers are deported, it will do great harm to this country. According to the Center for Migration Studies of New York, the two million or so young people who could be covered by a Dream Act have integrated successfully into our society. Sixty-five percent work, with over 70,000 self-employed. Eighty-eight percent speak English exclusively, very well or well. Nearly 30 percent have attended college or earned a college degree. They have lived in the United States an average of 14 years and are parents to 392,000 American citizen children. Removing them would hurt our country economically and socially. It is not an option.\n\nThe American public already agrees with this. Eight-seven percent support passage of a Dream Act to let young immigrants stay here. The parties in Congress now need to work together to pass a bill consistent with the views of the American people.

President Trump has articulated his support for \u201ca bill of love\u201d \u2014 exactly what we need in this situation \u2014 not a bill of discord.

That is why the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is urging all Catholics and others of good will to phone their senators and House members today and implore them to pass the Dream Act. Catholic teaching calls for all people to make a commitment to uphold the dignity of every person and to work for the common good of our nation. It is both our moral duty and in our nation\u2019s best interest to guide our lawmakers in this matter.\n\nHelping Dreamers to become American citizens is a clear moral test.

Prices for inflation-protected bonds imply 2.09 percent annual inflation over the coming decade, up from 1.98 percent at the start of the year.\n\nOther market indicators that might signal global economic troubles, like the price of oil, instead point to a steady-as-she-goes global economy.\n\nNone of this makes a case for economic complacency.

Mr. Homan, the ICE chief, had promised to increase enforcement in California, saying in January that the state had \u201cbetter hold on tight.\u201d\n\nJames Schwab, a spokesman for ICE in San Francisco, said agents were targeting around 1,000 people in the area, which appeared to be one of the largest operations since Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Homan blamed the mayor\u2019s warning for agents not being able to detain 800 people they had targeted in recent days.\n\nOne official briefed on the plans for the operation at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, said that ICE agents typically find only about 30 percent of their targets during any large sweep. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation, declined to be identified.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 30 percent rate would suggest that while some immigrants may have benefited from the tip-off, it is unlikely that 800 of them did, as Mr. Homan suggested.\n\nImmigration advocates have occasionally sought to warn of rumors of impending ICE arrests, but Ms. Schaaf\u2019s decision was striking because it came from the mayor of one of California\u2019s largest cities.\n\nMs. Schaaf, the mayor since January 2015, has been a strong promoter of Oakland\u2019s diversity, including its large population of immigrants, who make up around a third of the city\u2019s 420,000 residents.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, the mayor said she did not regret her decision to issue advance warning.\n\n\u201cI still contend that what I did was both legal and moral,\u201d she said, batting away a suggestion made during Mr. Homan\u2019s appearance on Fox News that she could have obstructed justice. \u201cI did not provide any specific detail that could have endangered law enforcement.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

On Wednesday, several dozen protesters gathered outside the ICE office in San Francisco, chanting support for undocumented immigrants and writing \u201cKEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER\u201d across an intersection.\n\nWhile the Obama administration focused arrest efforts on undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes in the United States, Mr. Trump has made clear that anyone in the country without permission can be arrested. Last year, immigration arrests nationwide rose by more than a third from the previous year, in large part because officers have more freedom to detain unauthorized immigrants with no criminal record.\n\nStill, the administration has made a point of highlighting the criminal pasts of undocumented immigrants. Around half of those arrested in Northern California in recent days had previous criminal convictions in addition to immigration violations, said Mr. Schwab, the ICE spokesman.\n\nAn ICE statement said some had lengthy criminal records, including one, Armando Nu\u00f1ez-Salgado, whom the agency called a \u201cdocumented Sure\u00f1o gang member\u201d who had been deported four times and who over the past 18 years had accumulated convictions \u2014 it listed burglary and hit-and-run causing injury \u2014 resulting in more than 15 years in prison.\n\nMr. Schwab would not say on Wednesday whether the arrest operation was continuing, but he said the agency would issue a statement once it was completed.", "title": "Immigration Agency Rails Against Oakland Mayor\u2019s Warning of Raids", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller"]}

Nation-Building, Minus the Nation\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what my best-case scenario would be,\u201d said Frances Z. Brown, an Afghanistan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nThat, she said, would see the American-led coalition abandon its efforts to impose a centralized state and instead allow Afghans to build their own state from the bottom-up.\n\nIt would mean accepting a central government that acts more like a horse trader among local strongmen and warlords. American and allied troops would guarantee enough security to sustain the state. Afghans would figure out the rest for themselves.\n\nOver time, ideally, Afghans might develop a functioning economy, then something like real democracy and, finally, peace and stability.\n\n\u201cBut what we know from other cases is that this takes generations,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cSo the 18-month time frames we\u2019ve always had for Afghanistan are not realistic.\u201d\n\nThe perpetual occupation necessary for this to work might also doom it. Continued foreign aid incentivizes Afghan elites, who are already on the verge of splintering, to compete rather than come together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis approach would involve tolerating the Taliban\u2019s presence in rural areas. And rolling crises would be built into this model, so Afghans would have to hope that they would somehow never derail the decades of progress needed before lasting change could take hold.\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Starting Over\n\nIf Afghanistan were forced back to square one, it might, some scholars think, be able to rebuild itself from scratch.\n\nAfter all, humanity lived for millenniums in something resembling low-grade anarchy. Modern nation-states grew out of that chaos only recently.\n\nThis would start with the effective collapse of the state and American withdrawal. Because the Taliban are too weak and unpopular to retake the country, as most analysts believe, Afghanistan would splinter.\n\nOut of the ashes, local warlords and strongmen would rise up. Without the United States forcing them to take sides in an all-or-nothing war, they might eventually accommodate one another, and the Taliban. Their fiefs, once stable, could coalesce over years or decades into a fully realized state.\n\nResearch by Dipali Mukhopadhyay, a Columbia University political scientist, suggests that the warlords would gravitate toward the kind of state building that occurred in medieval Europe over centuries.\n\nJennifer Murtazashvili, a University of Pittsburgh political scientist who studies state building and failure, said the process might unfold more quickly and stably in Afghanistan. She has studied rural Afghan communities that outside the reach of the state, have begun reproducing the basic building blocks of one.\n\nBut hers is only a theory, untested in modern history.\n\n3. The Somalia Model\n\nIn a sign of how far hopes have fallen, the war-torn East African country of Somalia is increasingly being raised as worthy of emulation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Afghan government would retreat to major cities.

But power would effectively flow to whichever warlords and strongmen \u2014 potentially including the Taliban \u2014 rose up in the countryside.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThis would, in theory, combine the first two models. The government could reconstitute itself as it mediated between local enclaves that would one day reintegrate with the state.\n\n\u201cThis is the outcome we have de facto ended up with, but not in a peaceful sense,\u201d Ms. Murtazashvili said. The government is receding and the warlords are rising, but the two are in conflict.\n\nThe Somalia model would manage that process of disintegration, like crash-landing a plane rather than waiting for it to fall from the sky. It would leave communities to find their own peace with the Taliban, which some in remote parts of the country are already doing.\n\nIn Somalia itself, this model has found mixed success. Security has improved nationwide, but a devolving state has been left unable to root out extremists, who still carry out devastating attacks.\n\n4. A Peace That Satisfies No One\n\nThe paradox of peace deals is that while all sides benefit, each fears that it will not do as well as it could \u2014 or that its enemies might do too well. This gives each an incentive to block all but the perfect deal, a dynamic so pronounced in Afghanistan that in 16 years, talks have never advanced far enough to make clear what each side considers acceptable.\n\n\u201cI doubt the Taliban has even given any thought at a higher level to what a government looks like that it could have a stake in,\u201d said Courtney Cooper, a Council on Foreign Relations analyst.\n\nThe fear of losing out is not misplaced. Afghan elites already squabble over control of ministries and lucrative patronage networks, and their infighting grows as those resources shrink. In any peace deal, they would need to surrender many or most of those resources to the Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban, too, would probably need to surrender or curtail their hopes for dominating Afghanistan. That could anger the extremists rising in the group\u2019s ranks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd any American president would risk a political backlash for appearing to usher the Taliban back into power. Veterans and military leaders might reasonably ask what they had fought for.\n\nThe clearest winner of any deal might be the Afghans themselves, but they are largely at the mercy of political actors for whom peace is risky.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. A Post-American Civil War\n\nThere is a more pessimistic version of the collapse-then-rebuild model, in which warlords compete until one prevails over all.\n\nAfghanistan itself offers a particularly vivid example of this scenario: After the 1992 collapse of the Soviet-backed government there, the country was gripped by a terrible civil war. If the Americans abandoned the government now in place, that history could repeat.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong possibility that this county could splinter, and not in consensual ways,\u201d Ms. Murtazashvili said.\n\nThat war culminated, in 1996, with one faction prevailing: the Taliban. It then sheltered Al Qaeda, prompting the American-led invasion and the war still raging all these years later.\n\nThat history, too, could repeat. Research by Barbara F. Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that extremists tend to prevail in civil war, and to do better as the war drags on. I f the Americans exit Afghanistan, it might not be for long.\n\n6. Perpetual Stalemate\n\nThe likeliest outcome may be allowing the status quo to continue, even as all sides suffer under rising violence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeither the government nor the Taliban are strong enough to retake control. Outside actors like the United States and Pakistan may be unable to impose their vision of victory, but they can forestall losing indefinitely.\n\nForeign aid can sustain the government, even as its control of the country shrinks. There is little to stop the Taliban from carrying out ever more brazen attacks in the capital. The death toll, already high, would probably rise.\n\nEventually, the stalemate would almost certainly break, hurtling Afghanistan into one of its possible endgames. But it is difficult to say when.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of an analogous case,\u201d said Ms. Brown, the Carnegie Afghanistan expert.\n\nFew modern wars have raged this long, this destructively and with this much outside intervention.

Children may refuse to go to school, or become socially isolated, depressed or even suicidal, experts say.\n\nThe bullying problem is widespread. Some 5.9 million children in the United States, or about one in 13, suffer from food allergies, and studies have found that close to one in three children with food allergies have been bullied specifically because of their allergy.\n\nMost of the bullying is done by other children who are peers or classmates, but adults may also make insensitive remarks. All too often, children make the mistake of not telling their parents they are being bullied, even though studies have found that adult involvement is effective and can usually put a stop to the behavior. As children get older, however, they are more reluctant to have their parents get involved.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A growing number of victims are alerting law enforcement officials and pressing charges.\n\nJust last month, a 14-year-old girl from Butler, Pa., was charged with felony aggravated assault after an incident in December in which she rubbed pineapple on her hand and then high-fived a girl known to have a severe pineapple allergy. Two other teenagers were charged with criminal conspiracy.\n\nIn August, a Central Michigan University student pleaded guilty to assault and battery after being charged with hazing for smearing peanut butter on the face of an unconscious student with a severe peanut allergy. The victim was treated at a campus clinic and recovered, but his parents said he could have died if the peanut butter had gotten inside his mouth.\n\nCivil lawsuits have been filed against restaurants accused of deliberately inserting allergens into food ordered by customers who made their allergies known when they placed their orders.\n\nIn one such case, a Natick, Mass., man has filed suit against Panera LLC and its franchisee organizations on behalf of his daughter, who experienced an allergic reaction after eating a grilled cheese the family had ordered from a local restaurant.\n\nThe family had specifically noted in its online order that the customer was allergic to peanuts, but the grilled cheese came with peanut butter hidden inside.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese kinds of incidents have long-term impacts on kids,\u201d said Mary Vargas, one of the lawyers representing the family. \u201cThis little girl thought she was going to die.\u201d", "title": "In Allergy Bullying, Food Can Hurt", "authors": ["Roni Caryn Rabin"]}

One firefighter reported seeing a flock spread a wildfire all the way up a small valley.\n\nA cattle station caretaker described a small group of raptors moving a fire front across a river, resulting in a blaze that wiped out much of the station infrastructure.\n\nPhoto\n\nStories like these are part of the reason black kites and other raptors are illegally shot on sight by irate station managers, Dr. Bonta said in an interview.\n\nTaken together, the accounts suggested that the birds act primarily when wildfires are going out because they have reached a natural barrier or through human intervention.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how common the behavior is \u2014 or whether it exists at all. As yet, no conclusive photographic or video documentation exists.\n\nEven without direct evidence, though, formerly skeptical ornithologists have found the combination of ethnographic research and firsthand accounts compelling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRaptors are already well known for \u201csmart\u201d hunting approaches, including following human vehicles that might flush prey to dropping stones on tough eggs, said Steve Debus, an adjunct lecturer at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia.\n\nBlack kites, one of the species implicated in fire-spreading, have a reputation for being particularly clever. \u201cThey seem intelligent and quick to learn ways of obtaining food,\u201d Dr. Debus said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been known to take food from schoolyards, even from children\u2019s hands, and use bread scraps at picnic areas to bait fish within capture range.\u201d\n\nDr. Bonta believes that fire-spreading is not observed more often because only a few birds in any large flock understand how to do it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s notable that we did not receive credible reports from casual tourists or others who might have simply gotten lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears that one needs to have spent a lot of time in the bush, and a fair amount of it close to wildfires.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAboriginal peoples, on the other hand, know the bush intimately and are no strangers to wildfire. The idea that some birds spread fires is common among indigenous groups in the Northern Territory, Dr. Bonta said.\n\nMr. Redford pointed out that the birds are ceremonially important.

Many scientists dismissed accounts of fire-spreading as accidental, a misperception about birds mistakenly snatching smoldering material.\n\nFirehawks have also tended to be regarded as folklore by government officials, Dr. Bonta said, becoming scapegoats for fires that have been improperly managed.\n\nWhen Mr. Gosford reread his copy of the book in 2011, however, the section on fire-spreading caught his eye. As an amateur ornithologist and lawyer working on indigenous cases in the Northern Territory, Mr. Gosford said, he\u2019d developed a deep respect for Aboriginal knowledge of the landscape.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe wrote a pair of blog posts on the subject that received media attention in 2016. He and Dr. Bonta, a frequent correspondent, decided it was time to collaborate on a peer-reviewed paper.\n\nDr. Bonta and Mr. Gosford hope to launch a three-week research expedition in May, where they\u2019ll work with fire rangers in hopes of documenting the behavior firsthand. They\u2019ll be accompanied by volunteer birders with cameras and with drones.\n\nThe team also plans on collaborating with Aboriginal authors on future publications, part of an effort to incorporate indigenous ecological knowledge into ornithology.\n\nFire has long been a central land management tool for Aboriginal people; carefully controlled burns shaped forests and savannas for hunting and agriculture.\n\nWhile the indigenous practice of controlled burns was largely suppressed during Australia\u2019s colonial period, legal decisions that delivered land back to Aboriginal ownership have fueled a return to traditional strategies that more closely mimic natural processes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor these strategies to be successful, Dr. Bonta said, officials need to take local expertise seriously about animal habits, including firehawks.\n\n\u201cAboriginal people \u2014 like the peoples of New Guinea and Amazonia and many other places \u2014 often have far better knowledge of local flora and fauna than outsiders, built up over the course of millennia,\u201d Dr. Bonta said.\n\n\u201cWhat possible reason could there be to not put enormous effort into helping them preserve what they know and collaborate to improve our overall understanding of nature?\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Australia\u2019s firehawks are enacting a process similar to the one humanity used to control fires. Or perhaps, as the Aboriginal people say, the birds\u2019 activities lit the spark for people in the first place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that others are now talking about co-evolution and learning from birds,\u201d Dr. Bonta said. \u201cFire may not be so uniquely human after all.\u201d", "title": "In Australia, Arsonists May Have Wings", "authors": ["Asher Elbein"]}

At a meeting in Kuwait to solicit investments and donations for Iraq\u2019s reconstruction, the Qataris are expected to make a significant pledge of funds, according to a senior State Department official. But the Saudis, saddled with a costly war in Yemen, and Emiratis, long suspicious of Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government, are not expected to make similar pledges, said diplomats in the region who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the funding assistance had not yet been announced.\n\nQatar\u2019s foreign minister and defense minister led the delegation to Washington last week for the country\u2019s first strategic dialogue with the United States \u2014 a diplomatic platform that the Trump administration has generally reserved for global heavyweights like China and India. Mr. Tillerson has been among Qatar\u2019s chief supporters in the administration; he played a key role when he was at Exxon Mobile helping Qatar develop its vast gas field.\n\nThere are signs that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s view now holds sway in the White House.\n\nSince the summer, the Trump administration has become increasingly unnerved by Saudi moves to remove Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, jail hundreds of princes and businessmen and prosecute a war in Yemen that has created a humanitarian disaster. Additionally, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s one-time chief strategist who has close ties to the Emirates and has sharply criticized Qatar, is no longer at the White House.\n\nQatar, meanwhile, signed agreements with the United States for sharing information on terrorists and terrorist financing, fighting human trafficking and disclosing detailed financial information about its national airline. Last month, Mr. Trump called Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and praised the nation for being \u201cone of the few countries\u201d to sign a counterterrorism agreement.\n\nIn his meetings last week, Defense Minister Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah said Qatar would upgrade living quarters for United States military personnel stationed at al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts nearly 10,000 American troops. The base, southwest of Doha, is the overseas headquarters for United States Central Command.\n\nAt the same time, Qatar has hired some of Washington\u2019s most influential deal makers and now pays 21 lobbyists in Washington.\n\nThey include Nicolas D.

And it\u2019s paying off. I\u2019ve watched Mr. Trump through the lens of the faith community for years, and he has delivered the policy goods and is progressing on the spiritual ones.\n\nMy reporting suggests Donald Trump is on a spiritual voyage that has accelerated in recent years, thanks to evangelicals who have employed the biblical mandate of sharing and showing God\u2019s love to him rather than shunning him. President Trump told me that he \u201cwas exposed to a lot of people, from a religious standpoint, that I would\u2019ve never met before. And so it has had an impact on me.\u201d\n\nThis president\u2019s effect on our cultural norms has been shocking. His critics would call it appalling; evangelicals say it\u2019s immensely satisfying: They\u2019ve seen a culture deteriorate quickly in the past decade, and they\u2019re looking for a bold culture warrior to fight for them. Showing that God does indeed have a sense of humor, He gave them Mr. Trump. Yet in God\u2019s perfection, it\u2019s a match made in heaven. Mr. Trump and evangelicals share a disdain for political correctness, a world seen through absolutes and a desire to see an America that embraces Judeo-Christian values again rather than rejecting them.\n\nFinally, why in the world wouldn\u2019t evangelicals get behind and support a man who not only is in line with most of their agenda but also has delivered time and time again? The victories are numerous: the courts, pro-life policies, the coming Embassy in Jerusalem and religious liberty issues, just to name a few. He easily wins the unofficial label of \u201cmost evangelical-friendly United States president ever.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Trump have moral failings? Yes. Critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don\u2019t have an \u201cR\u201d next to their name. But the goal of evangelicals has always been winning the larger battle over control of the culture, not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. For evangelicals, voting in the macro is the moral thing to do, even if the candidate is morally flawed. Evangelicals have tried the \u201cmoral\u201d candidate before.\n\nJimmy Carter was once the evangelical candidate. How did that work out in the macro? George W. Bush was the evangelical candidate in 2000: He pushed traditional conservative policies, but he doesn\u2019t come close to Mr. Trump\u2019s courageous blunt strokes in defense of evangelicals.\n\nEvangelicals have found their man. It may seem mystifying to outsiders, but for someone like me, with a front-row seat to an inside view, it makes perfect sense.

The range of topics \u2014 literary and sporting, personal and political \u2014 provides a map of what various editors over the years thought Amis might be interested in. Or (not quite the same thing) what they thought their readers might be interested in Amis on. I\u2019m not snarking, I\u2019m admiring. We can quibble about whether the ability to turn out a predetermined quantity of lucid, witty, sometimes moving, rarely boring prose on assignment and on deadline should be classified as a talent or a skill \u2014 I\u2019m here to tell you it isn\u2019t easy \u2014 or about whether thinky journalism is an art or a craft. What seems to me beyond argument is that Amis is good at it.\n\nHe is especially good at literary criticism. The best parts of \u201cThe Rub of Time\u201d are devoted to his two favorite novelists, Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow (whom he calls his \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d). Amis\u2019s affection for them is hardly news, and there is some repetition among the essays, but they serve as vaccines against cynicism, as reminders that affection is a powerful engine of critical inquiry. Bellow he adores without qualification: \u201cI hereby trumpet the prediction that Bellow will emerge as the supreme American novelist.\u201d Nabokov, arguably a more pervasive influence, is a more complicated case. Amis has never been able to finish \u201cAda,\u201d and he notes with measured distaste that Nabokov\u2019s imagination, in his later years, \u201cinsufficiently honored the innocence \u2026 of 12-year-old girls,\u201d adding, \u201cThis leaves a faint but visible scar on the leviathan of his corpus.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Alessandra Montalto/The New York Times\n\nOur favorite writers can lead us into ideological brier patches and ethical thickets. They can confuse and disappoint us, which is why we must keep rereading them. That is how I am with Amis. I will confess an absolute and steadfast devotion to his novels \u2014 including the bad ones, of which there are not a few \u2014 even as I chuckle to see him (and by implication myself) described, in a jokey online catalog of rotten literary men, as \u201cthe favorite author of every dude who hates women but loves telling people about the year he lived in London.\u201d When asked by one of his Independent questioners whether he\u2019s a misogynist, Amis responds that his wife doesn\u2019t seem to think so, that he has written some fine female characters and that he is a \u201cgynocrat\u201d who believes women should run the world. Maybe so, but he doesn\u2019t seem to believe they write novels worth discussing. He does, in passing, mention reading Zadie Smith \u201cwith a constant smile of admiration,\u201d but the essay about Iris Murdoch is really about her husband, John Bayley, and the one about Jane Austen is really about Hollywood.\n\nAmis\u2019s literary interests are limited not only by gender, but also by generation, and the two limitations are entwined. Like Prince Charles, who was also born just after World War II, and with whom he has half-ironically identified, he is a permanent son. This means he cranes his neck to see what the grown-ups are doing long after becoming a grown-up himself. The criticism collected here is mostly about his male elders: Philip Roth, John Updike, Don DeLillo, Anthony Burgess, J. G. Ballard, Philip Larkin and of course Kingsley Amis. Whatever Oedipal aggression Martin may have harbored toward these dads has softened into mildly barbed fondness, and the result is assessments that are clearsighted and generous. This is especially valuable in the case of Larkin, whose greatness is wound up tightly with his flaws. Amis\u2019s explanation of why Larkin is not \u201ca poet\u2019s poet\u201d but \u201ca novelist\u2019s poet\u201d is so illuminating, so useful to a reader, that it almost justifies the book all by itself.\n\nBut there is some filler to get through. Sending Amis \u2014 the author of books called \u201cMoney\u201d and \u201cSuccess\u201d \u2014 to Las Vegas to play poker may have seemed inspired, but his insights prove to be as middling as the cards that sent him home a loser. The essay isn\u2019t a bad read, but Colson Whitehead on poker is a much better one. Likewise, if you want to read about the porn industry, you\u2019re better off with David Foster Wallace (or, more recently, Molly Lambert).

A third gold places them among legends in the sport, alongside Gillis Grafstrom of Sweden, who won the men\u2019s singles competition in 1920, 1924 and 1928; Sonja Henie of Norway, who won the women\u2019s singles in 1928, 1932 and 1936; and Irina Rodnina, the Soviet pairs skater who swept three consecutive golds with two partners in 1976, 1980 and 1984.\n\nVirtue and Moir now have five career Olympic medals, the most among figure skaters, though earlier generations did not have a chance to compete in the Olympic team competition, which began at the 2014 Games.\n\nIce dancing often does not receive the same respect from outsiders as singles and pairs skating. No throws or jumps or lifts above the head are allowed. That can make it difficult to discern between competitors based on the precision and edge control of their dance steps, unless someone makes an obvious mistake as they earn points with step sequences and permitted lifts.\n\nThe Canadian and French couples are highly regarded across the sport, given their accomplishments and fearlessly aspirational performances. Virtue and Moir carried the flag for Canada in the opening ceremony at these Games. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve always admired, they never seem to play it safe,\u201d Hubbell, the American, said of the Canadians.\n\nFor many fans of ice dancing, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Britain remain the best ever, signature innovators whose gold medal \u201cBolero\u201d routine at the 1984 Winter Olympics remains one of the most memorable moments in figure skating.", "title": "In Ice Dancing, the Electric Tops the Ethereal", "authors": []}

He was to be buried on Tuesday, and it remained unclear if the family\u2019s wish for an independent autopsy would be granted.\n\nAlso unclear is where the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, comes down in the feud between the hard-liners and Mr. Rouhani. Mr. Khamenei has long sought to balance opposing factions to preserve his power, and analysts said he would be unlikely to take a strong stand on one side or the other until he felt he had no choice. On major decisions, like the nuclear agreement and seeking better relations with the international community, he has supported Mr. Rouhani, if grudgingly.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Rouhani struck back at his opponents, warning the Revolutionary Guards, the judiciary and the clerical councils that his government is considering organizing a referendum to break the deadlock between those who want change and those who want to hold it back.\n\n\u201cAnywhere we may have differences,\u201d he said in a speech at the 39th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, \u201cwe should refer to the vote of the people and a referendum.\u201d\n\nWhile there is little chance of that plan succeeding, analysts say, suggesting a referendum could perhaps help Mr. Rouhani regain popularity among the middle classes who have become cynical over his inability to deliver on years of promises of a more open and transparent economy and greater personal freedoms.\n\n\u201cMr. Rouhani insists on diverting attention away from his failing economic policies,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. \u201cThe government is not allowed to initiate referendums on everything, only in the case of a stalemate between separate powers. These are just disputes.\u201d\n\nSince the New Year\u2019s protests, the pressure on the two sides has only increased, with the economy dragging and the national currency, the rial, falling sharply in value against the dollar and the euro.

Nationalists in the governing party have long resented the so-called Kono Statement, with some holding it against the son.\n\nAnd unlike the typically somber political elite, Mr. Kono frequently shows a playful side.\n\nOn Twitter, in Japanese and English, he reveals glimpses of his sense of humor.\n\nExhibiting a sweet tooth, he regularly posts pictures of macarons served in foreign destinations.

After giving an opening speech in Parliament last month, he called his performance \u201csuper high-strung.\u201d\n\nHe takes some lumps on social media. After suggesting that the foreign minister should have a dedicated plane (he currently travels on commercial flights), he blocked several Twitter followers who criticized him for wanting to waste tax money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile at Georgetown, he volunteered in a campaign for Alan Cranston, a Democratic senator from California, and interned for Richard Shelby, then a Democratic congressman from Alabama and now a Republican senator.\n\nSenator Shelby described Mr. Kono as \u201cprobably stubborn, but he\u2019s not stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he believes in something and he thinks he\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Shelby said in a telephone interview, \u201che\u2019ll stand his ground.\u201d\n\nMr. Kono\u2019s fluency in English makes him well suited to the role of foreign minister. At a meeting of world leaders in Manila last August, Mr. Kono effectively doubled the amount of time he was able to spend speaking with Rex Tillerson, the American secretary of state, because he did not need an interpreter.\n\nHe is the first Japanese foreign minister to visit Pakistan since 2009. He has taken an active interest in the Middle East and South Asia as the United States makes controversial decisions like moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and freezing security aid to Pakistan. In Jerusalem in December, Mr. Kono told Israeli and Palestinian leaders that the city\u2019s status should be resolved through negotiations.\n\nAt home, he has called on Japan to open its borders to more immigration.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about immigration policy sooner because it\u2019s a very psychological issue,\u201d Mr. Kono said, acknowledging public wariness of foreigners. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can wait that long because we are losing our aging population fast,\u201d he added.\n\nAnalysts point out that some of his views may not be so progressive. In the interview last month, he suggested that immigrants could be admitted if they demonstrate proficiency in Japanese, but in the past, Japan has used language requirements to bar immigrants.\n\nTo explain the tiny number of refugees in Japan, Mr. Kono repeated the government\u2019s line that most asylum seekers are \u201cfalsely applying\u201d and just want to work in Japan.\n\nAs for his political ambitions, commentators say one challenge will be persuading the right-leaning Liberal Democrats to choose him.\n\n\u201cHe must be dreaming of a version 3.0 in the future,\u201d said Mr. Miyake, the former diplomat. \u201cBut to get to version 3.0 is much more difficult than getting from 1.0 to 2.0.\u201d", "title": "In Japan, a Liberal Maverick Is Seeking to Lead a Conservative Party", "authors": ["Motoko Rich"]}

To Real, this competition is a central part of its identity: It has won the trophy 12 times, including three of the last four years; the European Cup defines what Real is.\n\nIn Parisian eyes, by contrast, the competition is a symbol of what P.S.G. wishes \u2014 no, craves \u2014 to be. There is no glory in winning the French domestic championship, not for a club with a budget vastly larger than any of its rivals\u2019. There is no pride in claiming either of the country\u2019s domestic cups, not to a Qatari ownership group that got involved in soccer to accrue that unique soft power, that sense of relevance that the world\u2019s most popular sport offers.\n\nOnly the Champions League justifies the investment, only the Champions League validates the project, only the Champions League brings Qatar the kudos it desires: proof that what was once a backwater can become a global player.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was for the Champions League that P.S.G. sanctioned a $276 million move last summer for Neymar, the Brazilian superstar.

It does so because it sees him as the sort of player who can deliver in these moments, on the biggest stages, against the most illustrious opponents.\n\nHis ability to do so is not in question: P.S.G. knows that all too well \u2014 it was Neymar, after all, who orchestrated that humiliation in Barcelona last year.

He could not be heralded as the finest player on the planet, ran the logic, if he was not the finest player on his team. If, from the outside, it looked almost like a step down, there was a sense that the ambitions of player and team meshed rather neatly. Both, after all, had their eyes on usurping the established order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Neymar, then, as much as P.S.G., this was a night to shine, and not just because Real has convinced itself that the Brazilian yearns to make Madrid his permanent home. This was his chance to demonstrate that his move to Paris had been more than folly, that change was coming.\n\nHe did not do it. Neymar did not decide this game: Ronaldo, the man he would depose, did. It should not be a source of great controversy to suggest that Ronaldo, at 33, is now beyond his wondrous peak, no longer the force of nature he once was. He has had to metamorphose into something different to remain pre-eminent. Where once Ronaldo\u2019s embroidery \u2014 his dazzling array of tricks, his jet heels \u2014 set him apart, now it is his economy, his ruthlessness.\n\nTwice, when the pressure was greatest, Ronaldo delivered. Not prettily, necessarily \u2014 he converted a penalty kick to draw Real level, after Rabiot had given P.S.G. the lead, and then scuttled the ball home fortuitously to put his team ahead \u2014 but decisively.\n\nIt was a model of efficiency, an object lesson of what big players do in big moments.\n\nNeymar was the opposite: endless slaloming dribbles, drifting effortlessly past defenders with sure touches and elegant movement \u2014 all culminating in cul-de-sacs. It was an inherently cinematic performance. He played as you imagine a superstar should, as opposed to how a superstar does.\n\nHe will have a chance, in Paris next month, to make amends. Unai Emery, his coach, saw enough here to believe his team can score the two goals it needs to progress to the quarterfinals (though it may well require more). The score line, he said, \u201cdoes not reflect what we saw on the pitch.\u201d\n\nP.S.G. has heard that line before. It has felt this sensation before. It is the mantra of a team that gets so far and then can go no further: We are so close, we will get there in the end. The ceiling, though, never seems to shift.

Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery.

He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it.

Now, as the prime minister awaits a possible criminal indictment, his efforts to cling to power could pose even greater strains on a society that already seems at risk of tearing itself apart.\n\n\u201cImagine if, in the next few weeks, there is a justified case for Israel to go to war,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cHalf of this country would think Netanyahu\u2019s position was impacted by his legal situation. That is unacceptable. Political decisions are sometimes existential in Israel.

Most readers will never know, though this riveting book will make many feel as if they\u2019ve had a taste of it. Twelve-year-old Nisha and her family, refugees headed for the border of India, are on a desperate journey through the desert. Nisha\u2019s legs start \u201cquivering like jelly in the heat,\u201d her \u201cteeth feel like apricot skin\u201d and, when she tries to stand, \u201cmy arms and legs felt filled with sand.\u201d\n\nSet in 1947, the novel tells the story of Nisha\u2019s family\u2019s struggle during the bloody events of Partition, when India was divided into two countries after the nation\u2019s independence from Britain. Nisha and her brother, Amil, are from a mixed family; their deceased mother was Muslim and their father, a respected physician, is Hindu. As violence looms, the family must flee their comfortable home in what\u2019s now Pakistan and cross the border to the new India. Nisha is especially bereft at her separation from the family\u2019s kind Muslim cook, Kazu, who kindles her love of cooking (a freshly folded samosa feels to her like a \u201csmall animal, soft and warm in my hand\u201d) and encourages her to keep a diary.\n\nHiranandani (\u201cThe Whole Story of Half a Girl\u201d) does a remarkable job conveying the terrors and absurdities of the conflict in ways young readers can understand. Neighbors turn against neighbors and fear is so thick that even children are seen as a threat. (\u201cWhat side are we even on?\u201d Amil asks at one point.) She\u2019s also created a family with satisfying complexity: While the father is a good man, he shows scorn for Amil\u2019s poor academic performance.

But whatever the reason, living on even a small park does make a difference to buyers. And, ultimately, the apartment\u2019s value.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, however, expectations should be modest: According to Mr. Miller, apartments on Central Park are only about 10 to 15 percent more than those on a side street if they\u2019re below the tree-line, and 15 to 25 percent more if they\u2019re above. And any analysis of prices for park-facing units comes with a caveat: Developers are more likely to put the largest apartments where the best views are, and there\u2019s also a premium for more contiguous space.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cwhile there\u2019s an aesthetic of openness that people gravitate to,\u201d there is a difference between living on a tiny Moses-era playground and a Frederick Law Olmsted masterpiece like Morningside Park \u201cthat has been a stalwart of the neighborhood for many years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToni Martin, an associate broker with the Corcoran Group, said that anytime she has a listing on a park \u2014 be it Von King Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, or Washington Park in Park Slope \u2014 it gets snapped up fast.

The war and Holocaust reduced that number to 350,000 or less. The number kept shrinking during the Communist period from 1945 to 1989, when Jews were made to feel unwelcome and even forced to emigrate. In the immediate postwar years, about 185,000 left; another 50,000 did in the late 1950s, and some 18,000 in 1968.\n\nDuring those dark days, Poland was closed to the West, which prevented nearly all prospective visitors from traveling and supporting the Jewish community. Polish Jews felt alone, isolated from the Jewish world as they made the painful decision of whether to stay or go. Those who stayed frequently hid their Jewish identities, even from their own children, in order to get by. And when Communism fell, not many \u00e9migr\u00e9s or their descendants returned. Those two factors have left it hard to gauge how many Jews remain in Poland, but it is probably in the low tens of thousands; some are children and grandchildren of survivors and only recently learned that they had Jewish roots.\n\nNow Poland is no longer under Soviet domination. We aren\u2019t sealed off from visitors. In the past couple of decades, our Jewish community has welcomed hundreds of thousands of visitors who have come to Poland to see the Nazi death camps, the shtetls where Jewish villagers once lived and the graves of great rabbis.\n\nThey also have found something unexpected: Jewish life emerging anew. Nothing less than a miracle of cooperation between Jews and non-Jews who believe that by working together we can ensure that Poland has a bright Jewish future. And after 17 years here, I remain solidly optimistic that this cooperation will endure.\n\nThose visitors who have engaged with our communities have taught us and been taught by us. They have left invigorated after meeting young Polish Jews who are eager to enter Jewish institutions and reconnect to their heritage. And through this engagement, Polish Jews have come to understand that they are no longer alone. They are part of not only a more accepting Poland, but also of a big, messy, complex and interconnected Jewish world that has welcomed Polish Jews back into its own fold with open arms.", "title": "Opinion | In Poland, a Grass-Roots Jewish Revival Endures", "authors": []}

Since the 1800s, doctors had been prescribing hydrotherapy, and health resorts were being established across the continent. As the historian David Clay Large has written, \u201cthe grand spas in their heyday amounted to their world\u2019s equivalent of today\u2019s golf and tennis resorts, conference centers, business retreats, political summits, fashion shows, theme parks and sexual hideaways \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nPeople afflicted with everything from gout to arthritis came to \u201ctake the waters\u201d at spa towns across Europe, but unlike the sanatoriums with which they were concurrent, their visitors were not always ill. Instead they came to socialize, attend cultural events and negotiate political treaties. The towns themselves \u2014 Aix-les-Bains and Vichy in France; Bath and Buxton in England; Aachen and Baden-Baden in Germany \u2014 built above the rubble of thermal baths established by Roman conquerors centuries earlier, were plotted to maximize what was known as a \u201ctherapeutic landscape,\u201d a kind of aestheticized social engineering that promoted strolling and alfresco mingling. The architectural style of the bathhouses themselves was formal and atavistic, with marble walls, high arches, domed ceilings and mosaic floors. Well-maintained, infrastructurally sophisticated and aggressively promoted, these grand spa complexes were some of the earliest examples of modern tourist destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nYEARS BEFORE THE concept of a politically and culturally unified Europe gained traction, withdrawing from life (if even for a week) was a recurring feature of Continental existence. Spa culture \u2014 defined by its intentional architecture, geographical remove and somnambulistic ambience \u2014 was experienced in direct opposition to the rapid-paced, sick-making atmosphere of industrialized Europe. Unlike in America, where tuberculosis sanatoriums functioned more like hospitals than lifestyle colonies, the bosky outreaches of central Europe served as a sort of mystical destination where people from kingdoms near and far could live temporarily apart from reality \u2014 intermingling, arguing, falling in love \u2014 even as the security and sovereignty of the world around them remained imperiled. It\u2019s unsurprising that a microcosm containing different types of people with little to do but reflect and cathect provided fiction writers with a generative setting, one which everyone from George Eliot to Henry James to Guy de Maupassant took advantage of.\n\nIndeed, with enough selective reading it can seem as though every 19th-century writer of note spent at least a little time at a spa town. Turgenev and Goethe took the waters at Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia; Dickens and Tennyson visited Yorkshire\u2019s Harrogate. The Black Forest-surrounded Baden-Baden was perhaps the most popular, especially among the Russians: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky both visited; Chekhov died 90 miles south of there in Badenweiler in 1904 after an injection of camphor, a sip of champagne and a few weeks of writing letters to his sister in which he described his diet (boiled mutton, strawberry tea and \u201cenormous quantities\u201d of butter) and complained about German women\u2019s poor taste in clothing. His body was brought home in a refrigerator car meant for oysters. Mark Twain visited the Bohemian spa town of Marianske Lazne (often referred to by its German name, Marienbad) in 1892 and sarcastically cataloged a spa regimen for a patient suffering from gout that involved rising at 5:30 a.m., drinking \u201cdreadful\u201d water, tramping in the hills, wallowing in the mud and eating as much as possible \u201cso long as he is careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMy daily routine in Marianske Lazne wasn\u2019t actually so different. It began with a walk through the small, central part of the village, whose springs have been touted as curative for centuries and which was visited by an almost-laughable list of luminaries that included state heads (Czar Nicholas II, Emperor Franz Josef I), intellectuals (Freud, Edison, Kafka, Nietzsche, Kipling) and composers (Mahler, Wagner, Chopin, Strauss). The town is made up of pale neo-Classical buildings edged with verdigrised turrets and elaborate spires. The public gardens are tidy and politely pretty. Czech couples stroll along camel-colored crushed-granite paths, carrying flattened porcelain spa cups whose handles also serve as straws and which they fill at public fountains. Large groups of Germans walk briskly in excessive hiking gear, stopping at outdoor cafes where they order steins of pilsner and read Der Spiegel. The Russians wear their bathrobes everywhere and keep to the gilded hotel lobbies, where they play chess with one another as mole-removal videos loop on overhead TVs. At the grand hotels, whose convoluted floor plans also house spas, sublimated weight loss strategies are nonexistent, as are the high-tech instruments and the suggestions of pan-Asian wellness (gongs, bamboo) that one sees everywhere in America. In the absence of vanity and hard science and globalism, a sort of generic and primal prewar Europeanness persists, as unsettling as it is soothing.\n\nAnd as Twain himself reported, the meals were indeed curious and the prescriptions harebrained. At the Danubius Health Spa Resort Centralni Lazne, treatments are administered in tiled, cobweb-laced rooms. My first was a \u201cmineral bath with natural CO2\u201d for which I was led into a stainless-steel bathtub by a caustic attendant and told to ignore a half-submerged rusty wire. The water, just above lukewarm and smelling of sulfur, fizzed lightly. I had the impression of floating in rapidly cooling club soda. The attendant came back in, unannounced, wrapped me in a blanket, and discouraged me from trying to remove an arm so I could read my book. Benefits are said to include \u201cimproved blood circulation, heart and kidney activity as well as reduced stress and anxiety.\u201d Later, I dawdled in a Kneipp foot bath, named for a Bavarian priest who advised walking without shoes through morning dew, and the following day spent a disturbing 30 minutes in a tiled alcove, while dry oxygen was delivered into my nostrils via a latex tube. Each evening, a heavy dinner was served (often including hot sauerkraut, beef tongue in cream sauce, pickled herring and, for dessert, whole peeled kiwis), followed by flutes of Bohemian sparkling wine, which one could sip while classical musicians performed.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE SANATORIUMS OF Europe are now closed, and the spa towns where acute and imagined maladies alike were elevated to a glamorous lifestyle are today visited almost exclusively by the elderly. But medically informed repose \u2014 experienced far and away from the world, quietly and alongside others as sick (or not) as oneself \u2014 can still be had. In Vals, Switzerland, not 70 miles from Davos (once studded with about 40 sanatoriums), thermal waters run through the valley\u2019s granite walls. A beautiful if deliberately sterile-feeling spa hotel sits just above the small village and beckons visitors from all over the world, who come to bathe in silence and eat overpriced pear bread while gazing at verdant pastures. Those seeking wellness today do not want outdoor concerts or lectures or chitchat. They want to be by themselves, ideally in a photogenic location with poor cellphone service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe walls of the Peter Zumthor-designed spa, opened in 1996 under the name Therme Vals and now part of the 7132 Hotel, are made from 60,000 one-meter-long slabs of locally quarried quartzite; the concrete roof is covered with grass. Giant windows overlooking gray mountains somehow don\u2019t do much to brighten what is otherwise a dark and labyrinthine experience. \u201cMoving around this space means making discoveries,\u201d Zumthor has said. \u201cYou are walking as if in the woods. Everyone there is looking for a path of their own.\u201d\n\nI often wondered if I would ever find mine. I spent as much time soaking in various baths as I did wandering around through the mist between them. It was easy to appreciate the solemn beauty of Vals\u2019s imposing modern design, which was clearly plotted with great intention and intellect, while still feeling unpleasant panic each time you rounded a corner only to see a dim hallway coaxing you who knows where. Before the property owner stepped in and insisted otherwise, Zumthor was adamant that his spa have no clocks inside. He wanted bathers to feel not just weightless in the water but timeless too. The twin clocks that were installed are nearly hidden (I only found out about them weeks after I had come home) and the cavernous space succeeds in making the minutes melt into hours.\n\nIn daily life, it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t know the time down to the minute, and with the tap of a single skeuomorphic button I can find out where I am anywhere in the world, as well as whatever terrible things are happening halfway around it. In previous centuries, those suffering from ailments and ennui could travel through forests and up glaciers, by train and horse, to drink and dip in therapeutic waters. They endured unthinkable hassle to gain access to legendary liquids and dubious expertise. Today, we know better. Sunlight doesn\u2019t kill germs and physical maladies aren\u2019t cured by carbonated water. The best we can hope for is the kind of psychological balm that comes from temporarily removing oneself from the responsibilities of daily life, which lately seem to involve the helpless monitoring of catastrophes we can do nothing about. To travel from one empire in decline to countries whose golden eras were over 100 years in the past is to accept \u2014 and if possible, enjoy \u2014 the undeniable fact that disorientation can be its own kind of decadence.", "title": "In Search of Lost Time in Europe\u2019s Sanatoriums", "authors": ["Alice Gregory"]}

Though for the best tableau, it\u2019s best to mimic the writer and her three siblings on their first trip back to the house as adults.\n\n\u201cWe passed through the gate, groped stealthily but with sure feet up the carriage drive, mounted the little flight of rough steps,\u201d wrote Woolf in a 1905 diary entry, adding that they peered through a chink in the escallonia hedge and \u201chung there like ghosts.\u201d\n\nThe original wooden gate no longer exists, though the \u201crough steps\u201d and hedging, now about chest-height, are still there, beyond which is a full-on view of the house and its stately French windows and balconies.

Everything was the opposite of what it is now.\u201d\n\nKnowing Hruby, the possibilities enticed her. She officially launched Hesperios \u2014 a brand centered on the unlikely pairing of knitwear and an art-literary publication \u2014 in January 2016. Soon after came an online concept shop that sells limited-edition items made by artists featured in the Hesperios Journal. All the while, Hruby kept an eye out for empty storefronts. She signed the lease to 23 Cleveland Place, close to La Esquina, last July and started to sketch her plans for the space the following month. She ultimately sought out the carpenter Josh Thompson to oversee the execution and enlisted the creative consultant Carla Knapp as the brand and shop director.\n\nPhoto\n\nA half-year later, Hruby is in her element, perched next to stacks of turtlenecks and pullovers of her own design, copies of the first two volumes of Hesperios Journal leaning against a display shelf behind her. There are racks of fantastically soft dresses, cardigans, tank tops and pants; the only other clothing brand for sale at the store is Mark Fast. (\u201cHis pieces are beautiful; they\u2019re works of art and something you can\u2019t ordinarily find,\u201d Hruby says).\n\nHruby has interspersed woven totes (the fruit of her collaboration with Dragon Handbags), belts by Maximum Henry and Temps Des R\u011bves silk scarves among colorful Hesperios-branded notepads, Kaweco pens, a selection of found books and issues of the Paris Review and Lapham\u2019s Quarterly. She also has on offer an assortment of homewares and, in keeping with the Hesperios world where no person has just one descriptor, Knapp (the brand and shop director) is selling her ceramics.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith this new store, the Hesperios world has broadened to include food. Off to one side stands a low-key kitchen \u2014 helmed by the bartender Selma Slabiak \u2014 that serves breads from Meyers Bageri, Saxelby\u2019s cheeses, pour-over coffee, tea and homemade sodas. The cafe items can be enjoyed at a series of large marble-slab-topped tables \u2014 on wheels, so they can be easily moved around for events.\n\nSome of the buzzier amenities remain in-progress: the backyard garden, to be cultivated by the landscape architect Miranda Brooks, and a rentable \u201creader\u2019s shed\u201d that Hruby thought up with Erik Heywood of Book/Shop. Plus, Hruby will expand Hesperios\u2019 offerings to include outerwear for fall/winter 2018.

{"date": "2018-02-03 00:00:00", "text": "Under South Africa\u2019s Constitution, the Parliament elects the president. That leaves the A.N.C., which dominates the legislative body, with two options if it wants to recall Mr. Zuma before the end of his term in 2019: Order him to step down and avoid bringing the matter to Parliament; or allow the anti-Zuma camp to join forces with opposition lawmakers to impeach him.\n\nMr. Ramaphosa\u2019s allies are pressing Mr. Zuma \u2014 whose corruption-plagued eight years in office have damaged South Africa\u2019s economy and reputation \u2014 to step down as early as possible. His successor, they argue, should be the one to deliver the state of the nation address, scheduled for Thursday, to give the nation a badly needed reset.\n\nAmong Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters, the reaction has been more complicated. A few high-profile former allies of the president, including the finance and police ministers, have leapt into Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s camp with head-spinning speed.\n\nPhoto\n\nOthers have dug in, clearly hoping to extend Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency \u2014 and their own power \u2014 as long as they can.\n\nThe vast majority of officials, though, appear open to negotiations with Mr. Ramaphosa, who has made his career \u2014 in labor, business and politics \u2014 by being the best negotiator in the room.\n\nMr. Ramaphosa, known for always keeping in mind the political long game, has been carefully nudging Mr. Zuma, even as the new leader of the A.N.C. seeks to unite a fractured party behind him. The matter of Mr. Zuma\u2019s departure, he told the South African news media, should be approached with \u201cmaturity\u201d and \u201cdecorum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should never do it in a way that is going to humiliate President Zuma,\u201d said Mr. Ramaphosa, who has been the nation\u2019s deputy president since 2014.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven as negotiations over Mr. Zuma\u2019s departure continue, power has begun to shift in real ways. Mr. Ramaphosa led the nation\u2019s delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, effectively acting as South Africa\u2019s leader on the world stage.\n\nMore significantly, there have been domestic developments that would have been highly unlikely before Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s election as party leader in December.\n\nAt some state enterprises, which have been the source of much public corruption in recent years, Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies have been quickly replaced by respected officials chosen by Mr. Ramaphosa. State prosecutors have begun investigating some senior political allies of the president, along with the Guptas, a powerful family with close business ties with Mr. Zuma\u2019s relatives and his inner circle.\n\n\u201cIt does reflect the changing of the guard at the A.N.C. \u2014 it has freed up some of the good pockets in some of the law-enforcement agencies to start acting,\u201d said David Lewis, the executive director of Corruption Watch, a nonprofit organization, adding that state prosecutors and police investigators tend to be heavily influenced by politics in South Africa.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s fate now lies with the A.N.C.\u2019s top leadership, which remains divided, with an edge in Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s favor, political analysts said.\n\nWhile Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies initially kept quiet, some have begun pushing back in recent days, including his two supporters among the party\u2019s half-dozen most senior leaders. Jessie Duarte, the deputy secretary general, said that Mr. Zuma would serve out his full term until elections next year.\n\nThe secretary general, Ace Magashule, denied news reports that the party\u2019s leaders had decided to remove Mr. Zuma, adding of Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s allies, \u201cIt\u2019s only factional leaders who want to be populist, the ones who are loved by the papers, the ones who don\u2019t know the A.N.C., who are making noise outside.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The province, which is the A.N.C.\u2019s biggest source of votes nationally, remains one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s strongest cards in his negotiations with Mr. Ramaphosa \u2014 as does the party\u2019s youth league, which held the rally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMandla Shange, the youth league\u2019s spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, dismissed any talk of removing Mr. Zuma.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a decision you just take,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere must be a transition plan between President Zuma and President Ramaphosa. That is why President Zuma\u2019s term of office ends in 2019, so we expect President Zuma to continue to be president until 2019.\u201d\n\nBut analysts say that because of the survival instinct of the A.N.C., which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, it is unlikely that Mr. Zuma will be allowed to serve out his full term. The longer Mr. Zuma stays in power, the harder it will be for Mr. Ramaphosa to rebuild the party\u2019s brand before next year\u2019s elections.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRemember, all they want at the end of the day is to make sure that the A.N.C. can win elections,\u201d said Lukhona Mnguni, a political scientist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they want Zuma gone because of misgovernance. They want him gone so that they, as A.N.C. members, can remain at the top of South African politics. It\u2019s in their best interest that he goes, but they have to manage the timing and any fallout.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Zuma hangs on to power, he risks facing impeachment in Parliament after a recent ruling by the nation\u2019s highest court. The A.N.C., which holds more than 60 percent of parliamentary seats, would face two unattractive options: defending a deeply unpopular president or impeaching a leader it has steadfastly supported for the past eight years.\n\nMr. Zuma also faces other embarrassing legal challenges, including 783 counts of corruption related to an arms deal before he became president in the 1990s when he was a top party leader. He has successfully avoided prosecution over the years, and he argued again last week that he should not be indicted. State prosecutors are expected to make a decision later this month.\n\nHow and when Mr. Zuma leaves office, experts say, will influence how much Mr. Ramaphosa can reinvent the A.N.C. before next year\u2019s elections.\n\nMr. Ramaphosa and his allies enjoy strong support among urban, middle-class black voters who, disillusioned by Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency and with the party\u2019s transformation from Nelson Mandela\u2019s heroic liberation movement to an organization associated with corruption and mismanagement, began abandoning the A.N.C. in recent years. In local elections in 2016, the A.N.C. lost control of most of the country\u2019s major cities as those disenchanted voters backed the opposition or stayed home. Mr. Ramaphosa needs to win them back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe A.N.C.\u2019s continued, foolhardy inability to remove President Zuma clearly indicates that the A.N.C. cannot be trusted and cannot be relied upon to bring about the changes promised by its newly elected leadership,\u201d Bantu Holomisa, leader of the opposition United Democratic Movement, said in a news conference.\n\nIn one suburb that turned against the A.N.C. in 2016, Danny Zitha, a retired high school teacher, was so angry with the party that he vowed never to back it again. But recent changes in the A.N.C. have softened his position.\n\nHe was disappointed that the A.N.C.\u2019s top leaders had not tried to remove Mr. Zuma at their first meeting in January. But he was impressed by prosecutors moving against some of Mr. Zuma\u2019s political and business allies, and the thought of returning to the A.N.C. was no longer inconceivable to him.\n\n\u201cOnce Ramaphosa gets rid of Zuma and all those corrupt guys are taken to task, perhaps then I can have another way of thinking \u2014 but only then,\u201d Mr. Zitha said. \u201cZuma must be toothless.

Some gave within days of being appointed.\n\nThe governor also has accepted $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees, state records show.\n\nIn some cases, a husband and wife each won state appointments and then kept contributing. In others, the appointees stopped donating after receiving state posts, but their families continued writing checks. One appointee and his wife donated 11 times while he was serving. Another has given Mr. Cuomo, personally and through companies tied to him, more than $500,000.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe executive order explicitly forbids appointees from soliciting donations for the governor. Yet multiple appointees have done so, like Mr. Weiss and Mr. Manning last fall, raising a considerable additional amount for Mr. Cuomo.\n\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s donor-appointees span the state\u2019s vast network of boards and authorities. They have served as trustees of both the city and state university systems, on the panel overseeing economic development and on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City\u2019s subways and buses. Most positions are unpaid, but they hold great power and prestige: Board members can approve multibillion-dollar contracts and multimillion-dollar grants, oversee the distribution of tax breaks, and have broad influence over everything from the state\u2019s highways to local arts projects.\n\nIn response to questions about the donations from appointees, Cuomo administration officials said they believed that the order only applied to appointees who could be fired at any time by the governor, not those serving set terms. Under that interpretation, donations by board members of many of the state\u2019s most powerful authorities would be allowed.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the order is to prohibit employees and board members who serve at the pleasure of the governor from making political contributions,\u201d said Alphonso B. David, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s counsel. \u201cIt does not apply to every single person who serves in government, to individuals who volunteer for government, or to individuals who were appointed by the Senate and cannot be removed by the executive. A different reading simply divorces the purpose of the order from its language.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Cuomo interpretation differs from what some public authorities say in their own internal ethics rules, from the interpretation of independent government watchdogs and from what Mr. Spitzer himself said he intended when he crafted the order.\n\n\u201cThe executive order was intended, and did, in fact, apply to all gubernatorial appointees, regardless of the need for Senate confirmation, or any term applicable to their service,\u201d Mr. Spitzer said in an interview.\n\nThe order does not differentiate between types of authority appointees. It simply says that \u201cno member of a public authority appointed by the governor\u201d can donate or solicit donations.\n\nRichard L. Brodsky, a former 14-term member of the State Assembly and longtime watchdog of state authorities, questioned the Cuomo reading. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to claim somehow the language does not include all his authority appointees. It does,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nImage of a Political Reformer\n\nThe prohibition on appointee giving is hidden in plain sight, incorporated in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s own campaign website.\n\n\u201cNo state agency officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of the governor or their appointing authority or members of state public authority or other boards appointed by the governor may contribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018,\u201d the website says. Similar language has been included on invitations to fund-raisers for the governor going back to 2011.\n\nThe order originated on Mr. Spitzer\u2019s first day in office, part of a set of sweeping mandates under the banner of \u201celiminating politics from government decision-making.\u201d (Even under Mr. Spitzer, records show that a few appointees still contributed to his campaign.) Gov. David A. Paterson signed a revised version of the order when he took office.\n\nMr. Cuomo, who fashioned himself as a political reformer from the day he launched his 2010 bid for governor in front of Tweed Courthouse, included his renewal of the order as part of an ethics package adopted on his first day in office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter seven years, watchdogs say Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ethics record, despite some new measures, has been mostly a disappointment, from his disbanding of the Moreland Commission on public corruption to his aggressive use of campaign-finance loopholes.\n\nTo tally the donations that Mr. Cuomo has received from his appointees, The Times compared a New York State Authorities Budget Office database of hundreds of the governor\u2019s nominations and appointments against the state\u2019s campaign finance database. Both databases are public.\n\nReporters then vetted the matches, searched for others and excluded authorities not covered by the executive order, like the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, an interstate agency. Appointees named to their posts by previous governors and not reappointed by Mr. Cuomo also were excluded.\n\nThe total also does not include donations raised at fund-raisers hosted by appointees, since they are difficult to track.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe analysis identified about $890,000 in donations from 26 appointees. An additional roughly $830,000 came from family members, and $490,000 from firms owned or controlled by appointees.\n\nAll told, 37 of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees have donated $2.2 million either directly or indirectly to the governor\u2019s campaign since 2011. And those people had donated another $2.2 million before being appointed to their state posts.\n\nDani Lever, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s press secretary, said donors were only a fraction of his appointees. \u201cClearly, most board members are not campaign contributors, and most campaign contributors are not board members,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the Epicenter of the Arts\n\nAby J. Rosen, a colorful real estate developer and art collector, is a major donor whom Mr. Cuomo installed as chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts less than six months into his governorship. It is an enviable posting at New York\u2019s cultural epicenter, a position responsible for overseeing tens of millions of dollars in arts grants across the state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rosen has a long history as a Cuomo donor. In 2002, when Mr. Cuomo first ran for governor, Mr. Rosen was one of his largest contributors, and also rented Mr. Cuomo campaign space in one of his company\u2019s buildings for one-sixth of the advertised rate. (His opponent complained they were skirting contribution limits.) When Mr. Cuomo ran a second time in 2010, Mr. Rosen again was a major donor. He and his wife gave more than $85,000 between 2007 and his 2011 appointment to the arts council.\n\nThe money kept flowing afterward \u2014 more than $40,000 since from Mr. Rosen, and $50,000 from his real estate holding company, RFR Holding, according to government records.\n\nWhile on the arts council, Mr. Rosen also appears to have provided private aircraft for Mr. Cuomo. In December 2011, Mr. Rosen\u2019s firm contributed $3,272.20 in \u201ctravel\u201d expenses to Mr. Cuomo on the same day the governor\u2019s schedule shows him taking a private aircraft from Albany to New York City for a fund-raiser. Mr. Rosen made another $2,903.23 in-kind donation to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign in December 2013; that day the schedule again shows the governor taking a private aircraft to a fund-raiser. Mr. Rosen did not return requests for comment.\n\nMr. Rosen served on the arts council until February 2016. Three months later, he agreed to a $7 million settlement with New York\u2019s attorney general for failing to pay taxes on artwork he had bought or commissioned, in some cases during his tenure on the council.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo replace Mr. Rosen as chair, Mr. Cuomo promoted another major campaign donor already on the arts council, Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author and longtime arts advocate.\n\nMs. Diamonstein-Spielvogel has donated $27,500 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign since he reappointed her to the council in 2013. Her husband, Carl Spielvogel, was reappointed by Mr. Cuomo to the board of the State University of New York in 2015. He has given $20,000 since then.\n\nThe Spielvogels could not be reached for comment. But a woman who answered the phone at their home and identified herself as the assistant to Ms. Spielvogel, who is 86, said that Ms. Spielvogel \u201cnever contributed unless she was asked,\u201d and that she recently refrained from making a contribution to Mr. Cuomo because she had heard about the executive order for the first time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Cuomo nominated Jonathan Sheffer on May 16, 2011; three days later, records show that he donated $10,000 to the governor\u2019s campaign. He served until 2016. Mr. Sheffer said he has donated to Cuomo for years and that the timing of his May 2011 donation was \u201ccoincidental.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCouncil member Laura Aswad has contributed $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign since he appointed her, and Jaynne Keyes has contributed $10,000 since her appointment.\n\nMs. Keyes is married to Michael J. Del Giudice, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Ms. Aswad is married to Joseph W. Belluck, who has served for years on the State Commission on Judicial Conduct and the board of the State University of New York. He was reappointed by Mr. Cuomo to the judicial conduct commission in 2012 and has given $56,000 since then.\n\nMr. Belluck said he was unaware of the executive order until several months ago, when he was told that he could not donate because he was on the State University of New York board.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Lever, the governor\u2019s press secretary, said the administration believes that arts council board members are allowed to donate to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe language of the order with respect to agency boards bans contributions from board members who serve at the pleasure of the governor,\u201d she said. The arts council \u201cis an agency board whose members do not serve at the pleasure of the governor, as they are Senate-confirmed and serve in fixed terms of years \u2014 therefore are not covered by the order.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s counsel called the order \u201cextremely vague\u201d but said that \u201cwe believe our interpretation is the most consistent with the purpose of the order.\u201d\n\nContrary to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s interpretation, ethics handbooks of some state boards still bar donations by board members. \u201cNo board member, pursuant to executive order, may make or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the governor,\u201d according to the ethics code for M.T.A. board members.\n\nBecause an executive order does not have the force of law, it is not clear if violating it would prompt any repercussions. The order itself says \u201cpenalties\u201d could include \u201cdismissal or other appropriate sanction,\u201d but the person who would enforce that would be Mr. Cuomo.\n\n\u201cAll of this shows why you don\u2019t do ethics by executive order,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. \u201cThis kind of thing helps to drive cynicism about Albany.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the Tip of Manhattan\n\nPerhaps nowhere are the connections of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees more apparent than on the board of the Battery Park City Authority, a public benefit corporation created to own and manage 92 acres of land in Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe authority has power over a valuable sliver of New York: Battery Park City includes the Brookfield Place development, the global headquarters of Goldman Sachs and luxury hotels and restaurants, in addition to homes for about 10,000 residents. The authority controls development and maintains the public spaces in the area, and can impose de facto taxes on residents. None of the seven board members live there; some have a history of large political donations.\n\nTake the chairman, Dennis Mehiel, for example. He built a fortune in the shipping container industry and was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2002. He donated $92,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns before being appointed to the authority in June 2012, government records show.\n\nPhoto\n\nLess than a month after he was confirmed to the job, his wife, Karen, gave $20,000 to the governor\u2019s campaign account. She has given $105,000 more in the years since, while Mr. Mehiel himself has contributed $10,000, and companies associated with him have kicked in an additional $35,000.\n\nAnother board member, Lester Petracca, the president of a construction firm, has given $85,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns since being confirmed in June 2013, records show. His wife, Tracy, contributed $105,000.\n\nIn all, four men have been on the Battery Park City board at least a year; three have donated personally or through their companies during their tenures.\n\nA spokesman for the Battery Park City Authority declined to comment. Mr. Mehiel and Mr. Petracca did not return requests for comment.\n\nResidents called the donations problematic. Anthony Notaro Jr., the chairman of Manhattan Community Board 1, said the authority board was too powerful to be filled with \u201cthe governor\u2019s close friends and fund-raisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers Around the State\n\nSimilar stories are scattered across state government.\n\nAt the New York Thruway Authority, Mr. Cuomo has placed his longtime Republican ally Joanne M. Mahoney, the Onondaga County executive. Since her 2015 appointment, she has given $10,000 to his campaign through her political committee, finance records show. Ms. Mahoney did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nAt the City University of New York, Mr. Cuomo installed as trustees the prominent lawyer Brian D. Obergfell in 2012 and the construction firm founder Sandra Wilkin and the public relations executive Ken Sunshine in 2016. Since their appointments, they have contributed $45,000, $37,500 and $5,000, respectively, records show. A university spokesman said, \u201cThe order does not apply to the CUNY board of trustees.\u201d\n\nAt the M.T.A., Mr. Cuomo in June appointed one of his biggest donors, the real estate developer Scott Rechler; a company tied to Mr. Rechler donated $65,000 to the governor in December. Including donations before the appointment, Mr. Rechler, his family and his companies have given Mr. Cuomo more than $500,000. Mr. Rechler declined to comment.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the New York Convention Center Operating Corporation, which oversees the Javits Center, there are a half-dozen major Cuomo donors.\n\nAmong them is George J. Tsunis, a hotel magnate who, along with his wife, Olga, has contributed more than $180,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, who named him to the board in June 2016. Within a month of being appointed, Ms. Tsunis donated $15,000 and made a $5,100 in-kind donation for \u201cevent costs,\u201d presumably for a fund-raiser, government records show. In June 2017, George and Olga Tsunis hosted a Cuomo \u201csummer barbecue\u201d fund-raiser at their Long Island home, according to an invitation obtained by The Times.\n\nMr. Tsunis\u2019s name was in boldface type at the top. The small print included the disclaimer that state appointees were not allowed to \u201ccontribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018.\u201d\n\nWithin two weeks of the barbecue, Mr. Tsunis got a second posting \u2014 to the Battery Park City Authority.\n\nMr. Tsunis did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nAt the Empire State Development Corporation, the powerful authority that runs the state\u2019s economic development programs, Mr. Cuomo nominated Howard Zemsky as president and chief executive in 2015. About three years earlier, Mr. Cuomo had made Mr. Zemsky chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. Mr. Zemsky and his wife, Leslie, have combined to donate $125,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign. All of Mr. Zemsky\u2019s donations came before he was appointed in 2012; all $95,000 of his wife\u2019s donations came afterward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn July 2015, Ms. Zemsky donated $25,000 on the same day that the governor\u2019s calendar shows he was meeting with Mr. Zemsky, along with officials from Uber.\n\nMr. Zemsky said in a statement: \u201cI have not contributed to the governor since my appointment. My wife contributed in 2015 because she strongly supports the governor\u2019s vision for New York State.\u201d\n\nA Political Relationship\n\nIn Buffalo last November, Mr. Weiss, a lawyer with a specialty in affordable housing who had spent five years as one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees on the New York State Housing Finance Agency, served as host for the governor.\n\nThe arc of their political relationship is not uncommon.\n\nMr. Weiss gave his first $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign three weeks after joining Mr. Cuomo\u2019s transition team in 2010. By May 2011, Mr. Cuomo had forwarded Mr. Weiss\u2019s name to the State Senate as his nominee for a spot on the state\u2019s housing finance agency, according to emails obtained by The Times. (Mr. Cuomo did not immediately publicly announce Mr. Weiss\u2019s nomination at the time.)\n\nOn June 1, 2011, Mr. Weiss contributed another $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, according to government records. Six days later, Mr. Weiss was confirmed to the housing agency, where he served until the summer of 2017. He has been on the Roswell Park Cancer Institute board since 2016. Mr. Weiss did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Mr. Manning, the other appointee who hosted a fund-raiser that night.\n\nLast month, Mr. Cuomo reported having $30.5 million in his campaign war chest.

He said that the goal was to get \u201cbig money out of politics.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio was the target of multiple investigations during his first term into his political fund-raising and the favors that donors sought in return. He often dodged questions about his ethics by saying that the role of money in politics should be reined in.\n\nMr. de Blasio was roundly criticized in his first term for the access that he gave to lobbyists seeking favorable city actions on behalf of their clients. He said that he had ordered all commissioners and other top city officials to make their contacts with lobbyists public. The mayor already reveals his lobbyist meetings.\n\nThe mayor said that the charter revision commission would also propose ways to better reach out to voters to provide them information about elections, candidates and the location of polling places. He said that was necessary because the Board of Elections, which is governed by state law, does not do an adequate job. The commission\u2019s recommendations would have to be approved by voters.\n\nMr. de Blasio also said that he would budget $500,000 a year for electronic and digital security to protect the city\u2019s voting system.\n\nThe mayor said that he would name a \u201cchief democracy officer,\u201d whose job would be to solve \u201cthe problem of shrinking voter participation.\u201d The job will come with the goal of registering 1.5 million New Yorkers to vote in the next four years. There are currently about 4.6 million registered voters in New York City \u2014 so Mr. de Blasio\u2019s goal could mean an increase of nearly one-third.\n\nThe plan calls for a registration push among high school students 17 and older, and an expanded civics curriculum that would be used at all grade levels.", "title": "In State of the City Speech, Mayor Calls for Improved Democracy", "authors": ["William Neuman"]}

Rooting Ada\u2019s story in Igbo cosmology forces us to further question our paradigm for what causes mental illness and how it manifests. It causes us to question science and reason.\n\n\u201cFreshwater\u201d builds slowly, but that only crystallizes how fractured Ada and her personalities are. As the voices in her head get louder and grow hungrier, the story gains momentum. Only when Ada looks to her roots is there hope that she will wrest back control from her tormentors.

{"date": "2018-02-17 00:00:00", "text": "There is no doubt that there are limits to state and local gun laws. Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms.\n\nAnd the drop in fatal shootings in Connecticut has occurred in the context of a broad, long-term decline in violent crime across the country. Citing F.B.I. statistics, the Pew Research Center reports that violent crime fell 48 percent from 1993 to 2016.\n\nGun-rights groups say the problem is not the guns, but the individuals using them. They argue that laws alone are no panacea, and that social issues like mental illness and unemployment must be addressed to help curb gun violence. Some gun advocates have also called for more training and security for those who legally and responsibly maintain guns.\n\nStill, with little appetite in Congress to take on gun control, the debate is playing out at the state level, with Connecticut seen as a model for gun-control advocates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s laws are among the nation\u2019s toughest and homicides are down,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cObviously the link is a circumstantial one; cause and effect can\u2019t be proven conclusively. But the numbers are all in the right direction. States like Connecticut can help shame Congress into adopting common-sense measures that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\u201d\n\nState officials say Connecticut has experienced the fastest drop in violent crime of any state over the last four years. Gun-control advocates say the suspect in Florida, Nikolas Cruz, could not have bought the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle believed used in the attack, or the high-capacity magazines, in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe really need to do a better job at making sure we have strong gun laws in every state in the country, because we are losing our most valuable resource, which is our children,\u201d said Jeremy I. Stein, the executive director of CT Against Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in Connecticut, where parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook met with lawmakers as they debated the legislation, the measures fell short of what gun-control advocates wanted. For example, the laws did not force residents to relinquish existing assault weapons and high-capacity magazines or limit the number of firearms people could own.\n\nAt a hearing a month after the Newtown shooting, some speakers talked of the need to hold people accountable. \u201cThe problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility,\u201d said Mark Mattioli, whose son James, 6, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nThe Giffords Center, which keeps a state-by-state report card, gave Connecticut an A-minus for its gun laws \u2014 the same grade given to New York, which moved even more swiftly after Sandy Hook to pass stricter laws. The center ranked Connecticut 46th and New York 48th for their gun death rates, among the five lowest in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The New York law not only bans the sale of assault weapons and imposes universal background checks, it also prohibits both the sale \u2014 and possession \u2014 of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. And it requires mental health professionals to alert the authorities about at-risk patients who should not be allowed to buy a firearm. As of Feb. 8, 77,447 people deemed to be dangerously mentally ill had been added to the database.\n\nAvery W. Gardiner, a president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that generally, blue states are, not surprisingly, more likely to regulate guns and require background checks and licensing. Conservative red states either lack gun-safety laws or fail to enforce the ones they have. Her group\u2019s strategy includes filing lawsuits to enforce existing safety laws and countering the gun lobby, which uses its muscle in statehouses as well as Congress.\n\nThe lobbying has been hard on both sides. According to the nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics, in the past three election cycles the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s leading gun lobby, spent a total of $10.6 million to support candidates for state office in 25 states. Between 2009 and 2016, at least two-thirds of that spending went to state contests in which the group\u2019s chosen candidate won.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFlorida has gone the wrong way since Sandy Hook for sensible laws,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, citing a Florida law that would have restricted doctors from even asking patients about gun safety. The Brady Center sued Florida on the grounds that the law violated the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech, and a year ago a panel of federal judges ruled in the center\u2019s favor.\n\nIn Connecticut, the question of magazine capacity became emotionally charged as the stricter gun laws were being debated. That is because the Sandy Hook attacker, Adam Lanza, like other mass gunmen, used high-capacity magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire 30 rounds. A group of first graders at Sandy Hook ran past Mr. Lanza, escaping from the hail of bullets when he had to stop and reload.\n\nAt a news conference in April 2013, on the day lawmakers announced an agreement on gun control, Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, died at Sandy Hook, said: \u201cWe ask ourselves every day \u2014 every minute \u2014 if those magazines had held 10 rounds, forcing the shooter to reload at least six more times, would our children be alive today?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConnecticut\u2019s sweeping gun laws did, however, require residents who already owned high-capacity magazines and assault rifles to register them with the State Police. Today, the registry lists 52,648 assault weapons. A single resident registered 179 assault weapons, while another registered more than 500,000 magazines exceeding the 10-round limit. Between 2013 and 2017, 248 people were charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon because they either failed to register an existing weapon or had bought a weapon after the law went into effect.\n\nThe state also requires that individuals admitted to psychiatric hospitals relinquish their guns, at least temporarily. The State Police is notified of such patients by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, which maintains a database, and ensures that upon discharge, the gun owner turns in the weapon or transfers it to someone eligible for a gun permit. In addition, people who were previously treated in a mental hospital cannot get a permit for up to two years afterward.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, a lobby group in Newtown, Conn., declined to comment on the impact of Connecticut\u2019s gun laws \u201cout of respect for the families, the community and the ongoing law enforcement investigation\u201d in Parkland, Fla. The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nConnecticut is also one of a few states with another gun law with some teeth \u2014 an \u201cextreme risk protection order.\u201d Akin to a restraining order for domestic violence victims, the protection order, which predates Sandy Hook, gives the police the power to temporarily take away an individual\u2019s guns if a person makes threats, acts violently, abuses drugs or commits animal cruelty.\n\nIn the Florida massacre, the authorities believe that the gunman may have made threatening comments on social media, including one last September \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 and had also posted a photo of a bloodied frog.\n\nA study that examined Connecticut\u2019s risk protection order found that, from 1999 to 2013, 99 percent of warrants led to the confiscation of at least one gun. In nearly half the cases, the gun owner wound up receiving psychiatric treatment.\n\nMike Lawlor, the criminal justice adviser to Governor Malloy, said that the law arose from two high-profile shootings in the 1990s by people with severe mental health issues. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no law that\u2019s actually been broken, but when there is real evidence that the person is a danger to others, the police need to have an option,\u201d he said. \u201cStep one is to get the guns.\u201d", "title": "In Wake of Florida Massacre, Gun Control Advocates Look to Connecticut", "authors": ["Lisa W.

He polished off four bottles of water in less than an hour on the witness stand.\n\nUber acquired Otto for a reported $590 million in 2016, just six months after it was started. It is unclear how much Mr. Levandowski, already a wealthy man thanks to a $120 million bonus from his time at Google, personally made in the deal. An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the company had fired Mr. Levandowski in May before Otto could meet any of its performance targets. As a result, he lost out on an estimated $250 million worth of equity in Uber.\n\nWaymo contends that the clever solution \u2014 let Mr. Levandowski create his own company and then buy it \u2014 was simply obfuscation for a plot to steal important technology from Waymo.\n\nWhile the deal was unusual, it\u2019s not rare for an executive to want to ensure his independence inside a larger company. Technology giants often have to sell founders of start-ups on the idea that they will maintain some independence, as well as a big payday, in an acquisition. Facebook, for example, acquired Instagram and kept the photo-sharing app a separate unit within the company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOtto is still an independent unit within Uber and is technically a separate defendant in this case.\n\nWaymo is trying to portray Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski as a pair of aggressive, money-hungry conspirators who worked together to steal Google\u2019s intellectual property.\n\nBefore Mr. Kalanick testified, Uber\u2019s lawyers objected to Waymo\u2019s presenting a text message that Mr. Levandowski sent to Mr. Kalanick with a clip from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, passionately argues that \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201d No ruling was made.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Kalanick is expected to be asked how much he revealed to Uber\u2019s board about Mr. Levandowski and what the engineer had taken with him from Google.\n\nIn deposition testimony before the trial, Bill Gurley, an investor and a former board member at Uber, said the company\u2019s board had not been shown a due diligence report before the acquisition of Otto.\n\nMr. Gurley, who stepped down from Uber\u2019s board in June, said he wouldn\u2019t have voted in favor of the acquisition had he known the report indicated that Mr. Levandowski possessed files from Google.\n\nNathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Levandowski, said after the session in the federal courthouse in San Francisco that \u201calthough a great many things have been said about Anthony over the last two days, we are confident that he will eventually be vindicated.\u201d", "title": "In Waymo-Uber Trial, Kalanick Recalls \u2018Jam Sesh\u2019 With Rival Engineer", "authors": ["Daisuke Wakabayashi"]}

The Reagan era had arrived, bearing its burden of endlessly multiplying \u2014 and sexually sanitized \u2014 series, or what my mother called \u201cbubble-gum books.\u201d There was Sweet Valley High (for which, as it turned out, I later wrote) with its size 6 Wakefield twins, and the lesser Sweet Dreams series, with titles like \u201cTen-Boy Summer\u201d and \u201cLights, Camera, Love.\u201d For history buffs, there was the Sunfire Series, where a love triangle might ignite alongside the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. (Oh, how I loved the heroine of \u201cCaroline,\u201d growing up during the Gold Rush, who cross-dressed to pan alongside her brothers!) The Baby-Sitters Club and the Girls of Canby Hall presented the first Asian and the first black heroines in mainstream Y.A., which was revolutionary \u2014 but insufficient, sexually speaking. My mother retaliated by handing me \u201cTess of the d\u2019Urbervilles.\u201d\n\nThe \u201980s did have accessible teenage sex, though: the camp goddess V. C. Andrews, whose books you had to sneak past your mother in the checkout line. They were not explicitly written for teenagers, but they sure featured them in starring roles. On each glossy black cover, a girl\u2019s face peeked out from an oval cutout. Andrews\u2019s teenage heroines would star in filth beyond your wildest imaginings: bare-butt spanking, torrid incest, rape-to-romance story lines. Who can forget the scene in which Cathy Dollanganger is brutally assaulted by her brother, Chris, an act that ignites a five-book, multigenerational incestuous love story? Who can forget \u201chill scum\u201d Heaven, the protagonist of \u201cHeaven,\u201d and the predatory stepfather who becomes her true love?

It barely needs to be said what a titanic effect Harry Potter had on the culture, but one of its greatest achievements, or annoyances, depending on your point of view, was to make reading a family affair. J. K. Rowling\u2019s series facilitated a golden age of magic and fantasy that endures. Series like Harry Potter and Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials are brilliant, revelatory, hilarious, educational \u2014 great reducers of screen time. But they are largely sex-free zones that give new meaning to the term Planned Parenthood.\n\nAnd pity those who look to this era\u2019s love stories for succor. The most popular are studiously flesh-free. John Green\u2019s \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d arguably the greatest romance of the past decade, gives its heroine a few lines to spill the details \u2014 and they are mostly to inform the reader she won\u2019t. \u201cThe whole affair was the precise opposite of what I figured it would be: slow and patient and quiet and neither particularly painful nor particularly ecstatic.\u201d Rainbow Rowell\u2019s \u201cEleanor and Park\u201d is lovely, but not the place where you will find words like these from \u201cForever\u201d: \u201cI need your written consent for the gonorrhea culture.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s Y.A., the new attempts to get back into sex have been fumbling and awkward, like a first time. Consider a novel published last fall, Laura Hopper\u2019s \u201cI Never,\u201d an explicit homage to \u201cForever.\u201d \u201cI Never\u201d unfortunately combines the breathlessness of adolescent romance with some of the vulgarity of porn. (At one point the protagonist, Janey, revels in the dissonance of helping her boyfriend\u2019s mother with dishes only seven minutes before feeling the boy\u2019s erection \u201cpractically tearing a hole\u201d in her dress.) Janey frequently wonders what the popular track star Luke, who has all the character development of an American Eagle hoodie, sees in her. At least Jessica Wakefield was confident in her powers of attraction.\n\nLast year\u2019s \u201cRelease,\u201d by Patrick Ness, comes closer. Adam is gay in a fundamentalist Christian household, but he has already had a healthy mix of sex and love in his life. The scene in which he finally loses his virginity is funny and physical, but at the moment of truth, it still resolves into an ironic distance. Adam \u201csaid embarrassing sex things,\u201d Ness writes, echoing Green\u2019s jokey evasions, like this one from \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d: \u201cThere were a lot of condomy problems that I did not get a particularly good look at.\u201d\n\nI wonder if the reason today\u2019s young adult fiction feels so sexually airless is that it lacks what made Blume and her peers seem so dangerous: Their books were physically arousing. In adult books, that trait is often a reliable sign of bad writing. But for teenagers, who are still strangers or newcomers to sex, the bonus physical stimulation of something like \u201cForever\u201d or \u201cDomestic Arrangements\u201d can be validating, a way of making pleasure ordinary, appropriate enough to check out of the library.

Those close to her, however \u2014 particularly Lee \u2014 could find her intolerably frustrating, just as Diana was to Nancy. In Taraborrelli\u2019s account, one gets a sense of Lee\u2019s life as a series of reactions against her sister, a hectic parade of attention-seeking antics: three marriages (the second to Prince Stanislaw \u201cStas\u201d Radziwill); and brief brushes against the worlds of fashion, acting, writing. Then there were the high-profile affairs, the most infamous being the one with the Greek millionaire magnate Aristotle Onassis, who from the early 1960s had set his eye on the greater prize, Lee\u2019s American royal-sister. Of course, Jackie herself engaged in many of the same behaviors, but to entirely different effect.\n\n\u201cMy God, how jealous she is of Jackie\u201d: so wrote Lee\u2019s so-called friend Truman Capote. To be fair, the rise of Jacqueline Bouvier to the status of first lady would have been hard for even the saintliest of sisters to bear. But Lee\u2019s reaction was frankly venial: \u201cHow can anyone compete with that? It\u2019s all over for me now.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nYet the competition had been ongoing from the first. In 1941, the 12-year-old Jackie was scheduled to play a piano piece for her school assembly. Despite her best efforts, her performance was rather wretched, only to be followed by an immaculate rendition by the 9-year-old Lee, who had been practicing in secret in order to achieve just such a triumph.\n\nTaraborrelli is highly effective at describing this sisterly dynamic \u2014 the bond that tensed at the least provocation; the never-fully-sincere exchanges of \u201cI love you\u201d; even, at the height of some ghastly adult trauma, uneasy relapses into games of \u201cYou\u2019re it.\u201d The material, most of which will inevitably be familiar to many readers, is newly enhanced by telling, gossipy details from a satisfying bundle of interviews. The sisters\u2019 half brother, Jamie Auchincloss, who became persona non grata after he spoke to the author Kitty Kelley about Jackie circa 1977, provides a running commentary that portrays a society whose tastefully presented aim is to keep its chalice of wealth and privilege filled to the brim. \u201cMoney is power,\u201d as Jackie once said to Jack Warnecke, the lover she took after Kennedy\u2019s death \u2014 the architect who designed the gravesite memorial at Arlington, and whom she later left for the unassailably rich Onassis.\n\nFor all the sisters\u2019 dramatics, the true star of this particular show is decidedly neither the directionless Lee nor the determined Jackie. It is, in fact, the third figure in the book: Janet Bouvier Auchincloss, their diet-pill-popping \u201cMummy,\u201d hostess of the \u201cmother-daughter teas\u201d to which she was still inviting her girls as they approached 40. Descended from Irish Catholics, just like the Kennedys, whom she regarded with a hauteur only leavened with a respect for their money, Janet claimed kinship with the English upper class broadly, and even a specific relation to the lineage of Robert E.

Kraft helped design one with 283 diamonds to commemorate the 28-3 deficit that the Patriots overcame to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl. The ring also included five large diamonds to symbolize each of the team\u2019s titles. The team logo is in red and blue stones. The words \u201cunequivocally the sweetest\u201d are etched on one side.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my privilege to do it, and I love it,\u201d Kraft said of his role in designing the rings with Jostens. \u201cTo me, having 283 diamonds, I knew our players would never forget.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the Patriots embraced their new jewels, the Falcons owner Arthur Blank was not happy that Kraft had highlighted the score on the ring.\n\nOn average, Super Bowl rings in recent years have had more than 250 diamonds, a far cry from the relatively austere ring given to the Green Bay Packers after they won the first Super Bowl in 1967. That version had a single diamond in the middle of a large gold band.\n\nTeams now demand rings so large that Jostens is trying to create a two-fingered ring. The players are getting larger, too. Most men typically wear rings between size 8 and size 14. The largest ring Jostens ever made was for William (The Refrigerator) Perry of the 1985 Chicago Bears, who got a size 25. (Jostens later expanded it to size 27.)\n\nThe rings, which are given to players and coaches, can easily cost more than $10,000. The league pays for the first 150 rings. The teams pay for any additional ones. Owners often give more modest versions to team staff members, family and friends, and the wives and partners of players and coaches. Last year, Kraft gave Super Bowl rings to his friend President Trump and to the mother of quarterback Tom Brady, Galynn Brady, who had been fighting cancer.\n\nPhoto\n\nJostens manufactures the rings at its factory in Denton, Tex., about 40 miles north of Dallas. More than 400 employees produce as many as 5,000 rings a day there, and roughly 600,000 a year. Most are high school class rings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpecialty items like Super Bowl rings are more complicated, requiring nearly three dozen separate manufacturing processes. When the designs arrive from the head office in Minnesota, the production team uses a 3-D printer to make the ring chassis and the four-pronged settings that will hold the stones. The introduction of computers into the design process has let Jostens more easily customize rings.\n\n\u201cFor the masses, we try to keep it simple,\u201d said Ken Sprabeary, a project manager for Jostens in Denton. \u201cFor the professionals, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\n\nThe rings and settings begin with wax models that are used to create cast molds. The molds are then filled with white gold or one of roughly 30 alloys that Jostens uses.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

Six percent of casts are rejected, Sprabeary said.\n\nOnce the rings cool, workers like Darian Redmond clear away the plaster from the mold, one of 20 different processes from polishing to setting. Redmond is a longtime Eagles fan who spent January hoping he would help make his team\u2019s Super Bowl ring.\n\nPolishing removes any excess material. Sometimes, other parts of the ring are welded on, and black paint is sprayed on as a background to the stones. Then 70 setters add diamonds and other precious stones.\n\nJostens has had to triple the number of setters in recent years. \u201cEveryone wants bling,\u201d Sprabeary said. \u201cBrand X just doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d", "title": "In the Super Bowl City, Building the Rings", "authors": ["Ken Belson"]}

But it\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg \u2014 formerly a Google vice president and currently Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 who is depicted here in especially heroic terms.\n\nThe adulation of Sandberg gets surprisingly personal. Chang describes being pregnant with her first child in 2012, doubting her \u201cability to succeed as a working mom,\u201d and emailing Sandberg out of gratitude for her willingness to step into the fray. \u201cI gasped aloud when, 30 seconds later, Sandberg\u2019s reply hit my inbox.\u201d\n\nOne might have hoped that this intimacy would at least generate some pointed insights or candid quotes. But Sandberg gives Chang her well-worn lines about trickle-down feminism. \u201cWomen in leadership will help create the environment for more women in leadership,\u201d Sandberg tells her, in a sentence that sounds about as spontaneous as a TED Talk. \u201cWomen will create the institutional change we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe this will happen,\u201d Chang writes. This credulity is as disappointing as it is puzzling. As her own reporting shows, Google found it hard to scale its good intentions as it grew, and last year it reported numbers comparable to the rest of the industry, with women accounting for less than a third of its work force and only 25 percent of its leadership roles. Google had regressed to the mean \u2014 and the mean, as it stands, isn\u2019t great for women.\n\nBut as much as these numbers matter, and as telling as they are, it\u2019s the sex in this book that will probably get the most attention. Chang recounts cases of sexual harassment and vicious online trolling. She also includes a chapter on polyamory and sex parties that\u2019s heavy on salacious details and light on named sources. Participants tell Chang that they\u2019re proudly disrupting tradition: \u201cTheir behavior at these high-end parties is an extension of the progressiveness and open-mindedness \u2014 the audacity, if you will \u2014 that makes founders think they can change the world.\u201d They describe Molly tabs molded into the shape of the Snapchat logo, and food being served off the bodies of naked women.\n\nThat last detail gave me pause, if only for how trite it is.

And though the several hundred tiny eels added up to perhaps a fistful, they were still worth $500, said Mr. Silva, who now faces possible fines that could exceed $80,000.\n\nThe baby eels are rarely encountered on Long Island, and along the East Coast they are considered a prize for black market poachers looking for a lucrative haul. The eels have sparked a gold rush hysteria and a related reality show in Maine, which has restricted catch quotas.\n\nIn 2016, federal and state agents conducted a four-year investigation they called \u201cOperation Broken Glass,\u201d and charged dealers and fishermen across several Atlantic states with trafficking nearly $2 million in elvers, which are flown live to Asian aquaculture companies and raised for use as seafood delicacies (sushi and sashimi).\n\nMajor Scott Florence, of the Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s law enforcement division, said the state\u2019s fishing regulations apply to anyone fishing in state waters, including Native Americans fishing outside reservation property.

The treaties stipulate that tribal members retain a sovereign right to harvest fish freely even in nonreservation areas.\n\nOne is a 1648 deed for the sale of East Hampton from the Shinnecock and three other tribes \u2014 payment included 20 coats, 24 looking glasses, 24 hoes, 24 hatchets, 24 knives and 100 mugs \u2014 to early British settlers.

Moore III, a former chief of the Passamaquoddy tribe in Maine, which has negotiated with their state authorities to gain access to elver fisheries. Mr. Moore was invited by Chief Wallace to help them develop an elver management plan to both harvest and preserve the local eels.\n\nChief Wallace criticized state officials for refusing to meet with him to discuss fishing rights, which are \u201cour history, our culture and part of our everyday existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have a better system of regulating fish than the state does,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is about power and controlling and decimating our way of life.\u201d\n\nOn the reservation recently, Mr. Silva showed his eeling equipment, including finely woven nets and large containers that are needed to keep eels alive before shipment to Asia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But the governor has repeatedly denied reports that he took a compromising photo of the woman without permission and blackmailed her.\n\nThe felony indictment handed up Thursday by a St. Louis grand jury accused Mr. Greitens, 43, of photographing a nude or partially nude person in 2015 without consent, a charge that carries up to four years in prison if he is convicted. The governor\u2019s lawyers said that he violated no laws and that they were seeking to have the case dismissed.\n\nBut Missouri lawmakers could begin deciding whether to impeach Mr. Greitens even before he appears in court, on March 16, in the criminal case.

Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nFew Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.\n\nBut veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United.

And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\n\n\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.\n\nThe interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAccording to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nFurther, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.\n\nShe could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has told associates that if he accepts the premise of Russian meddling, it will call into question the idea that he won the election on his own merits.\n\nThat fear drove many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary tweets and statements throughout his first year in office, especially about the size and breadth of his electoral victory. The day after his inauguration, Mr. Trump ordered his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to insist that his inaugural crowd was the largest in history, which it demonstrably was not.\n\nIn news conferences, on Twitter and at rallies, he has called the Russia investigation \u201cfake news\u201d and repeatedly predicted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation will end without finding much.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not settle the overarching question of whether Mr. Trump or any of his campaign associates colluded with Russia.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Nearly all mainstream economists agree that at some point, higher interest rates and inflation hurt stock prices. \u201cInvestors are right to be concerned,\u201d said Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nNuveen\u2019s Mr. Nick said it\u2019s important for investors to look beyond the headlines about rising interest rates to ask why they\u2019re going up. Rising rates can be a sign of a healthy, growing economy, and if the Fed can keep it from overheating, it may well be good for stocks. But if the Fed is forced to raise rates to ward off inflation, the risks of a recession \u2014 and lower earnings and stock prices \u2014 are much greater.\n\nMr. Nick said the current situation \u201clooks like a little bit of both,\u201d which leaves him cautiously optimistic, but in no rush to add to stock positions. He hasn\u2019t made any changes to Nuveen\u2019s model portfolio allocations.\n\n\u201cUnlike the last few corrections, we don\u2019t see this as a V-shape recovery, where investors might blink and miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think stocks can rise by the end of the year, but it will be a slower grind back.\u201d\n\nOthers are less sanguine. The Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, who has long studied the complex relationship among interest rates, inflation and stock prices, has been warning for months that markets are highly vulnerable to rate increases and inflation. Markets face \u201ca fragile financial situation, and potentially a steep drop somewhere up ahead,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal just weeks before the recent correction.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven after the recent pullback, he expects more declines. \u201cWhen interest rates rise back to normal levels, share prices are also likely to revert to previous norms,\u201d Mr. Feldstein told me this week.\n\nThat could be a long decline. Even after the recent 10 percent correction, stocks remain richly valued by historical norms. James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research, pointed out that a common valuation measure \u2014 the price-to-earnings multiple for the S.&P. 500 \u2014 recently went from 26 times earnings to 23.4 after the correction, which is a level reached less than 10 percent of the time since 1928. (The long-term average price-to-earnings ratio for the stock market, excluding extreme periods, is about 14.) \u201cThis is a very richly priced market no matter how you slice it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Stack recently lowered the stock portion of his model portfolio to 72 percent from 82 percent out of concern over high valuations and rising rates. He noted that during 11 periods since 1955 when the Federal Reserve was tightening credit, a so-called soft landing was achieved only twice \u2014 in the mid-1960s and mid-1990s \u2014 and that a recession followed in every other instance.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He hasn\u2019t increased the allocation since the sell-off.\n\nMr. Blinder told me that stock valuations reached such extreme levels that he started reducing his equity holdings several months ago. \u201cI sold too early,\u201d he said with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cI missed the last 15 percent gain, and I missed the 7 percent drop.\u201d He hasn\u2019t resumed buying at current levels.\n\nThe Fed is now two full years into its current cycle of rate increases, which is already longer than most tightening periods. But the benchmark interest rate for 10-year Treasuries, which has recently risen to just over 2.9 percent, still has a long way to go before reaching its long-term average of 6.24 percent. The Fed has forecast three more quarter-point rate increases this year, but that would bring the Federal funds rate only to 2.25 percent.\n\n\u201cHistorically it\u2019s impossible to name any threshold at which rising rates might trigger a rush for the exit or a bear market,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cIn most cases, stock prices can weather rising interest rates until they reach 5 to 6 percent, which was the case in 2000 and 2007.\u201d\n\nBut after years of such low interest rates, and with stock valuations extremely high, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime.\u201d\n\nIf this is, indeed, the last stage of the long-running bull market, and interest rates continue to rise, as the Fed has suggested, some sectors typically perform better than others. According to InvesTech, the best performing sectors during periods of rising rates since 1972 have been health care, energy, consumer staples and telecommunications. During the last year of a bull market, the best performing sectors have been energy, health care and technology. Health care and energy show up in both categories.\n\nOf course no one knows for sure when the bull market will end \u2014 or whether it already has. But investors are clearly on edge, and the last few weeks may be a preview of what the end looks like.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of very bright people on Wall Street who are all counting on being the first out the door when the party ends,\u201d Mr. Stack said.

The visa application of a third Russian, Robert S.

The Russians also used the identities of real Americans from stolen Social Security numbers.\n\nAt the height of the 2016 campaign, the effort employed more than 80 people, who used secure virtual private network connections to computer servers leased in the United States to hide the fact that they were in Russia. From there, they posed as American activists, emailing, advising and making payments to real Americans who were duped into believing that they were part of the same cause.\n\nThe playing field was mainly social media, where the Russians splashed catchy memes and hash tags. Facebook has estimated that the fraudulent Russian posts reached 126 million Americans on its platforms alone.\n\nThe Russian operatives contacted, among others, a real Texas activist who, evidently assuming they were Americans, advised them to focus on \u201cpurple states like Colorado, Virginia & Florida.\u201d After that, F.B.I. agents found that the phrase \u201cpurple states\u201d became a mantra for the Russian operation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has tracked the Russian campaign closely, said that he had no doubt that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was behind the effort, which was carried out by companies controlled by his friend and ally, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. But he noted that the so-called trolls employed by Mr. Prigozhin took elaborate steps to obscure their identities and locations and to avoid leaving government fingerprints.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, they built this so it could be plausibly denied,\u201d Mr. Watts said. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any government role in hacking and disinformation aimed at the United States, while coyly allowing that patriotic Russians may have carried out such attacks on their own.\n\nAndrew S.

Mrs. Clinton, he said, had sent \u201ca signal\u201d to \u201csome actors in our country\u201d after elections that were condemned as fraudulent by both international and Russian observers.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not present evidence that the campaign overseen by Mr. Prigozhin was ordered by Mr. Putin.

After taking office, he urged the police to kill drug suspects and promised to protect officers from prosecution. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed by the police, in what the authorities said were shootouts, or by unidentified gunmen.\n\nLast year, after an outcry over the killings of three teenagers by police officers, Mr. Duterte suspended the police operations and put the antidrug campaign in the hands of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. But he put the police back in charge in December. Last week, the police said that 46 people suspected of using or selling drugs had been killed by the police since then.\n\nThat brought the police\u2019s official death toll from the campaign to over 4,000, a number much lower than the estimated 12,000 deaths reported by various international and local rights groups.\n\nSenator Antonio Trillanes, a prominent political foe of Mr. Duterte, said the news of a preliminary inquiry \u201cshould jolt Duterte into realizing that he is not above the law.

That\u2019s because the owner, Ed Raven, who also owns Greenpoint Beer & Ale nearby, is running the restaurant under a farm brewery license from the state. It permits him to serve beer by the glass without a separate license and, as a brewery owner, to open an off-premises restaurant or retail establishment. Mr. Raven has also collaborated with North Brooklyn Farms in Williamsburg for many of the ingredients used by the three chefs, each of whom has a specialty. Christian Perkins, who worked at Marlow & Daughters, is the butcher. Emma Jane Gonzalez, a vegan, and the omnivorous Kenneth Monroe come from North Brooklyn Farms. Their menu features seafood, steaks, sausages and vegetable specialties like charred sweet potatoes with kale and tahini, celery root with apples and crispy nori, and a green chile stew.

The report said he spent much of the trip sightseeing and improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets; it also accused Ms. Wright Simpson of wrongdoing in connection with Dr. Shulkin\u2019s wife\u2019s airfare, which it said should not have been paid by the department.\n\nDr. Shulkin characterized the report as inaccurate and biased, but he said he would reimburse the government for his wife\u2019s airfare and pay for the tennis tickets.\n\nMr. Leinenkugel\u2019s suggested replacement for Dr. Shulkin would be likely to spark controversy: Michael J. Kussman, a former under secretary who has been associated with Concerned Veterans of America, a group funded largely by the billionaire conservative activists Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch that advocates shifting spending on veterans\u2019 health care to the private sector.\n\nIt is not clear whether the president supports the move. The Department of Veterans Affairs referred questions about its leadership, the tensions in the department and Mr. Leinenkugel\u2019s email to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nThe fight over the leadership of the department is part of a long-running battle over how to deliver health care to the nation\u2019s veterans. The department currently operates its own health system, with more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics across the country where about nine million veterans receive treatment at little or no cost to them. Some conservatives, including some advisers to the White House, favor gradually dismantling that system and allowing veterans to choose to receive taxpayer-subsidized care from private doctors instead.\n\nVeterans\u2019 groups have overwhelmingly opposed that idea. But Mr. Trump promised during his election campaign that \u201cvets will have the right to go to a V.A. facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice \u2014 whatever is fastest or best for the vet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPolicymakers in both parties have said that offering that kind of unrestricted choice between the public system and private providers would be too expensive. They have generally favored a more measured approach that would allow the department to approve the use of private care when waiting times are too long at veterans\u2019 hospitals. Dr. Shulkin has also backed this plan.\n\nDr. Shulkin said in the interview that he was determined to remain in his post. Though one lawmaker called for his resignation in the wake of the travel report, others were cordial to Dr. Shulkin at a budget hearing Thursday morning and did not bring up the report.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Thursday, he spoke directly to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, about concerns that political appointees were trying to undermine his agency, according to department officials.\n\n\u201cIf there are people here who don\u2019t want the V.A. to succeed, I want them out,\u201d Dr. Shulkin said in the interview.\n\nDr. Shulkin was an unexpected but popular choice for secretary. After the 2016 election, Mr. Trump considered several critics of the department as possible nominees to head the agency. But to the relief of most veterans\u2019 organizations, he chose Dr. Shulkin, a moderate who headed the agency\u2019s health care system under President Barack Obama.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Dr. Shulkin. At a bill signing in June, he said the secretary did not have to worry about hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s old reality-show catchphrase, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have to use those words on our David,\u201d Mr. Trump said, pointing his finger at the secretary like a pistol. \u201cWe will never use those words on you, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nBut in recent months, some of the president\u2019s appointees have felt betrayed by what they see as backtracking at the department on access to privately provided health care, and have moved to oust Dr. Shulkin.\n\n\u201cHe has shown total disdain for the White House,\u201d said one White House official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter. \u201cThis isn\u2019t ideological; it is just what the president wants. He wants veterans to have choice.\u201d The official said that current legislation to fund privately provided care was more restrictive than rules during the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn December, according to congressional staff members, political appointees in the department quietly bypassed the secretary to advance legislation that would open the way for more privately provided health care for veterans. The bill was introduced by Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, who has received substantial campaign donations from the Koch brothers.\n\nTurmoil at the department seems to be growing. Last week The Washington Post quoted unnamed White House officials who said Mr. Bowman, the deputy secretary, would soon be fired as a \u201cwarning shot\u201d to \u201cknock Shulkin down a peg or two\u201d for not pushing harder for privatization.\n\nIn the interview, Dr. Shulkin said he had spoken to President Trump, and was told there were no plans to fire Mr. Bowman. He attributed the Post article to opponents trying to sow disarray.\n\nHe said he was worried that his chief of staff\u2019s email account might have been hacked, and was investigating the matter.\n\nIn another sign of division, John Ullyot, a former top Trump campaign official who now runs the press office, told staff members in an email on Wednesday that reporters\u2019 requests for comment should not be forwarded to the secretary or deputy secretary; instead, he would be referring them all to the White House.\n\nThe move forced Dr. Shulkin to do much of his communication with the media over the travel investigation on his personal cellphone.", "title": "Intrigue at V.A. as Secretary Says He Is Being Forced Out", "authors": ["Dave Philipps", "Nicholas Fandos"]}

Iran continues to train and equip fighters while strengthening ties with allies in Iraq and Lebanon, in hopes of building a united front in the event of a new war.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is, in the case of another war, to make Syria a new front between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran,\u201d said Amir Toumaj, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies Iran. \u201cThey are making that not just a goal, but a reality.\u201d\n\nIranian leaders speak openly of their work to build this axis of resistance against Israeli and American influence. A key to Iran\u2019s strategy, analysts and officials say, is to rely not on conventional military hardware or control of territory, which Israel can easily bomb, but on building ties with local forces who share its goals and benefit from its financing and expertise.\n\nThat approach has enabled Iran to amplify its power in the Arab world while decreasing the threat to its own forces and homeland. It has also created a problem for countries including the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who fear Iran\u2019s growing influence but have struggled to come up with ways to stop it.\n\nSome people in Israel have started referring to a potential \u201cFirst Northern War,\u201d meaning that Israel will have to fight across both the Lebanese and Syrian frontiers. And many Israelis say the danger is not just from the new Iranian-backed militias, but also from the Iranian efforts to give advanced, high-precision weapons capable of hitting sensitive infrastructure to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful and experienced external force.\n\nPhoto\n\nIsraeli officials have said that Iran and its allies are seeking to establish a land corridor from Iran to the Mediterranean, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, to ease the transportation of such weapons and to build underground factories to manufacture them in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has been bombing convoys in Syria that are believed to be carrying advanced arms to Hezbollah, but the group\u2019s covert nature makes it hard to determine which arms have slipped through and whether its arms factories are functioning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch arms, coupled with heavy barrages from the more than 100,000 rockets and missiles without high-precision targeting capability that Israel says Hezbollah already has, could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses.\n\n\u201cIsrael will face not only quantity, but the threat to vulnerable strategic sites,\u201d said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and now a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies. Referring to the combination of more precise weapons and a new front, he added: \u201cEach one is problematic; together, they are devastating.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s moves in the region have alarmed the United States. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly concerning is that this network of proxies is becoming more and more capable as Iran seeds more and more\u201d of its \u201cdestructive weapons into these networks,\u201d Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said at a security conference in Munich on Saturday. \u201cSo the time is now, we think, to act against Iran,\u201d General McMaster added.\n\nIn expanding its influence in Syria in recent years, Iran has followed a standard template. In Lebanon in the 1980s, it helped create Hezbollah, which has since evolved into the country\u2019s predominant military force and a regional power in its own right, joining the wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. In Iraq, Iran has sponsored a range of militias while developing deep ties to the Iraqi economy and political system.\n\nThe war in Syria gave Iran a new opportunity to advance that project by linking its allies across the Levant together.\n\nFighters from Hezbollah routed Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border and Iran sent advisers to help Mr. Assad\u2019s beleaguered forces during the early years of the war.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While some directly participate in combat, most are trainers, commanders or experts who advise the Syrian military and oversee militias. It is these militias, which could have as many as 20,000 fighters, that give Iran its true muscle.\n\nThose fighters include about 6,000 from Hezbollah. Most of the rest of the militia members \u2014 who come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2014 have been enticed to fight in Syria with money and appeals to their Shiite faith. Indeed, most see the war in Syria in religious terms, as a jihad against enemies of their religion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAli Alfoneh, a researcher at the Atlantic Council who tracks reports of foreign militia fighters killed in Syria, said the number of deaths reported had decreased substantially as those fighting for Mr. Assad have gotten the upper hand in the war. But instead of leaving the country, he said, the militias appeared to be shifting their sights toward Israel.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIran has realized that it is actually possible to maintain a front against Israel where there is no war but also no peace,\u201d Mr. Alfoneh said.\n\nIn his research, Mr. Alfoneh said he had identified three main Iranian bases that oversee operations in large parts of Syria \u2014 one near Aleppo in the north and two south of the capital, Damascus \u2014 as well as seven smaller tactical bases near active front lines where Iran and its proxies have a presence.\n\nThe idea of a permanent Iranian presence in Syria worries Israel, which fears that it could face a threat there similar to that posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysts close to Iran and its proxies say that is exactly the idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a replication of the Hezbollah model,\u201d said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst who writes for Al Monitor, a news website focused on the Middle East. Iran is already training fighters in southern Syria, he said, so that if Hezbollah draws down its presence there, as its leaders have vowed to, it will leave behind a Syrian prototype.\n\nIn recent months, at least two Iraqi militia leaders have visited the Lebanon-Israel border with Hezbollah, and militia members say the visits have included developing plans for how they might collaborate in a future conflict.\n\nLife has returned to normal in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights since the day of battle on Feb. 10, and the ski resort on Mount Hermon has been operating as usual. There was no immediate sense among Israelis of being on a war footing.\n\nBut Israelis and many Lebanese have long worried that another war across their border is inevitable. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ratcheted up the rhetoric on Sunday at the security conference in Munich, warning Iran\u2019s leaders not to test Israel\u2019s resolve and pledging that if pushed, Israel would act \u201cnot only against Iranian proxies that are attacking us, but against Iran itself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth sides say they do not want war, and the fear of extensive destruction and civilian deaths has deterred new hostilities since the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. But the more entrenched Iran\u2019s allies become, the greater the pressure Israeli leaders could face to launch a strike \u2014 and the greater the chances that a miscalculation or mistake by either side could provoke new hostilities.\n\nSome analysts have expressed hopes that Russia, which also intervened in Syria on Mr. Assad\u2019s behalf, could serve as a check on Iran\u2019s ambitions. Russia has cooperated with Iran during the war but also seeks to maintain good relations with Israel.\n\nNotably, Russia has not publicly complained when Israel has bombed convoys believed to be bound for Hezbollah. Others question to what degree the Syrian population will buy into Iran\u2019s ideological project, noting that only a tiny portion of Syrians share Iran\u2019s Shiite faith.\n\nMuch remains unclear about Iran\u2019s intentions. Days after Israel destroyed the drone, Israeli military officials said they were still not sure whether it had been armed, had been sent on a surveillance mission or was merely a test of Israel\u2019s defenses.\n\n\u201cIt is very important for us to understand its mission,\u201d Brig.

Yet while Iraq estimated that it would need $88 billion to pay for reconstruction, it was expected to receive only $4 billion in pledges by the time the conference ends. The majority of that is to come from Arab donors in the Persian Gulf, with the Saudis, Emiratis, Kuwaitis and Qataris all pledging around $1 billion each.\n\nThere was also a flurry of loan guarantees, including one by the United States. But all in all, the pledges amounted to less than 5 percent of what Iraq said it wanted and needed.\n\nThe State Department emphasized that the United States since 2014 had already given Iraq $1.7 billion in humanitarian aid and $6 billion in economic and security assistance, money mostly committed during the Obama administration. In an evening speech to the conference, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson called on others to do their part.\n\n\u201cEveryone in this room has an opportunity to help set Iraq on a new course and contribute to its long-term development,\u201d he said, although he admitted that \u201cdoing business in Iraq can be complicated.\u201d\n\nThe conference was held against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s emphasis on more military spending. The administration\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2019, unveiled Monday, proposed eliminating much of the nation\u2019s foreign aid and reducing the State Department\u2019s overall spending by a third while increasing the Pentagon\u2019s budget by $195 billion in the next two years.\n\nAmong the programs the administration has proposed eliminating are a $4.6 billion economic support fund, a $3 billion budget for international development assistance and a $211 million fund to promote democratic institutions.\n\nIn Iraq, those priorities seem to mean that the United States, after leaning heavily on the Iraqi military, which suffered heavy casualties in the fight against the Islamic State, appears to be leaving the task of rebuilding Iraq\u2019s shattered cities to other nations and the private sector.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFew other nations have stepped up. Most of the four dozen foreign ministers in Kuwait City for the donor conference brought only good wishes, not money.\n\nSaudi Arabia, in a statement from its embassy in Washington, said that it \u201ccontinues to support a secure, stable and united nonsectarian Iraq.\u201d And American officials emphasized that the pledge campaign was just beginning.\n\nMr. Tillerson and other diplomats hoped to compensate for the shortfall by calling for private sector investments, much as President Trump has done for his own infrastructure plan in the United States. Representatives from nearly 2,000 companies, many brought by the United States, Iran, Germany and other governments, gave the conference an atmosphere of an investment road show.\n\nBut Sami Al-Araji, the head of Iraq\u2019s National Investment Commission, said no investments had been generated so far from the companies. \u201cI am not expecting any contracts to be signed,\u201d he said on Monday evening.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those were the places where a Sunni insurgency took root after the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and later gave rise to an affiliate of Al Qaeda and the leadership ranks of the Islamic State. If they are not rebuilt, diplomats fear the region\u2019s populace will once again turn to extremism, a risk Mr. Tillerson highlighted in a morning speech to a separate gathering of the 74-nation coalition to defeat the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe end of major combat operations does not mean that we have achieved the enduring defeat of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cISIS remains a serious threat to the stability of the region, our homelands and other parts of the globe. Without continued attention on the part of coalition members, we risk the return of extremist groups like ISIS in liberated areas in Iraq and Syria and their spread to new locations.\u201d\n\nApproximately 2.5 million Iraqi citizens remain displaced after their homes were flattened, utilities destroyed and schools bombed. Almost half of Mosul remains uninhabited.\n\nThe Trump administration has vastly reduced American aid for refugees and resettlement, arguing that helping displaced people return to war-torn regions is preferable to resettling them in the United States or elsewhere. But no one can return without intense rebuilding efforts.\n\nMr. Trump complained Monday that the United States had spent $7 trillion in the Middle East over the past 17 years with little to show for it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSeven trillion dollars. What a mistake. But it is what it is,\u201d he said in introducing his domestic infrastructure plan.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s calculation included the direct costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as estimates for the costs of care for veterans. Whatever the total, the Pentagon has spent the vast majority of the money, not the State Department.\n\nOn Sunday, a group of 151 retired senior military commanders, including former chiefs of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Special Operations and Air Force, sent a letter to congressional leaders saying that cuts to aid programs would threaten the military gains made against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cAnd while we have seen military progress against ISIS, the question that looms is whether we are prepared to protect those battlefield gains and prevent bad actors from stepping into the void,\u201d the letter states.\n\nDonors have expressed wariness at what some see as throwing good money into a black hole in Iraq, which Transparency International, an anti-corruption research group, ranks as among the 10 most corrupt nations in the world. Of the $61 billion in American funds spent on development aid in Iraq between 2003 and 2012, around $6 billion vanished and a further $1 billion was wasted, American auditors concluded.\n\nMr. Abadi has made fighting corruption a priority, and his ministers have promoted a 300-page manifesto for investment that acknowledges past failures and pledges better oversight and fiscal management for reconstruction funds.\n\nThe shortfall in pledges on Tuesday could hurt the political standing of Mr. Abadi, who faces a tough re-election battle May 12 against pro-Iranian political blocs. Western diplomats have warned that Mr. Abadi\u2019s defeat could plunge the country into a sectarian struggle that could rip it apart.\n\nIraqi officials from politically important Sunni regions, as well as leaders from minority groups that Mr. Abadi had hoped to win over in the upcoming elections, criticized the list of reconstruction projects that his ministers highlighted at the conference for ignoring their communities and needs. Their outrage was fierce, despite Mr. Abadi\u2019s failure to secure support of any kind for any project.\n\n\u201cWe are sorely underrepresented,\u201d said Marwan al-Jibara, a spokesman for the council of tribal sheikhs in Salahuddin Province, one of the predominantly Sunni areas that produced the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe failure of the donor conference could also cool the extraordinarily warm ties between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which reached a high point in a euphoric trip by President Trump to Riyadh in May.

The government also wants the church to relinquish control of some schools.\n\nThe archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, warning that schools are gradually losing their Catholic character, has pushed for years for the church to divest itself of hundreds of schools. But he has had little success, meeting strong resistance from the religious orders that control them.\n\nIt is a measure of how much Ireland has changed that the loudest objections to the new policy on religion classes in state-run schools have come from the schools themselves. Teachers and administrators have objected not to having less religious instruction, but to the statement by the education minister, Richard Bruton, that the government will not provide funding for alternative classes.\n\n\u201cIreland has changed tremendously, and in urban areas there will be significant numbers of people choosing other subjects rather than religion,\u201d said Michael Moriarty, the general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, the organization created by the government that oversees most state-run schools. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the staffing resources to put on extra classes with extra teachers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe teachers\u2019 union went a step further, not only calling for more money and more teachers to carry out the policy, but also asking why \u201csuch a measure would only be implemented for a proportion of the country\u2019s second-level schools\u201d and not the religious ones.\n\nFor generations, Ireland was deeply conservative and its governments ceded much of the public service sector \u2014 schools, hospitals and orphanages, among other institutions \u2014 to the church. In recent years, the church\u2019s role and reputation have been eroded by revelations about how its people and institutions abused that power \u2014 including widespread sexual abuse and the mistreatment of unwed mothers and their children in homes that resembled prisons.\n\nAt the same time, the country has become much more liberal on social issues, often in ways opposed by the church. In the 1990s, Ireland decriminalized same-sex relations and legalized divorce.\n\nIt legalized same-sex marriage by referendum in 2015, with 62 percent of voters approving the change.

A comparison to Mike Pence isn\u2019t so far-fetched: They\u2019re both second in charge of a conservative government led by a flashy businessman, and standard-bearers for family values, tilled in the nation\u2019s agrarian heartland. For most of the Australian public, Mr. Joyce was a bumbling farm boy who meant well.\n\nLast week, though, a story broke that turned public sentiment against him. Following investigations by two small websites last year, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph reported that the deputy prime minister was having a child with a former staff member, Vikki Campion. A photo on the front page of the tabloid showed Ms. Campion, pregnant and unwitting, crossing the street. (\u201cBundle of Joyce\u201d said the headline.) That this story, like so many others, involves personal hypocrisy is hardly surprising. Mr. Joyce has been a strident opponent of gay marriage, basing his opposition in part on what he has called his four daughters\u2019 right to a \u201csecure relationship with a loving husband\u201d and the right of every child \u201cto know her or his mother and father.\u201d What is more noteworthy is the degree to which the Joyce affair has sparked a long-overdue debate about the deference Australian media still accords politicians when it comes to their private lives.\n\nMr. Joyce\u2019s relationship with Ms. Campion, we\u2019ve learned in the past few days, was an open secret among the Canberra press corps. Back in October, Sharri Markson, the reporter who eventually got the print scoop, wrote a piece alluding to a \u201cdeeply personal crisis\u201d in Mr. Joyce\u2019s life. Now that the story\u2019s out there, it\u2019s very easy to read between the lines about \u201cvicious rumors\u201d and \u201cpersonal pressures\u201d in dozens of media clips from last year. The deputy prime minister\u2019s private situation was well known enough that he got into a pub brawl with a constituent about it last year and apparently knocked the man\u2019s hat off.\n\nDid the media choose not report on Mr. Joyce because they didn\u2019t have all the facts? Perhaps in part. As the national broadsheet The Australian has reported, repeated inquiries about Ms. Campion\u2019s multiple job titles, let alone her taxpayer-funded salary, were met with stonewalling. Mr. Joyce would refuse to talk about the relationship when they asked.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Such conduct could expose Mr. Nunes and his staff to liability for conspiracy to obstruct justice. According to press accounts, the Nunes memo may be designed at least in part to provide the president an excuse for firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the individual with supervisory authority over Mr. Mueller, the special counsel in charge of the investigation. The purported scheme: clear a path to install a Trump-friendly replacement who would either fire Mr. Mueller or otherwise defang the investigation. Indeed, after the memo was released the president did nothing to quell these suspicions, ominously responding \u201cyou figure that one out\u201d when asked if the memo made him more likely to fire Mr. Rosenstein. The double standard applied by the president in refusing the immediate release of a rebuttal memo offered by the minority is hardly reassuring as to his good intentions.\n\nEndeavoring to stop an investigation, if done with corrupt intent, may constitute obstruction of justice. Plotting to assist such action may be conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nNormally, what is called \u201cspeech or debate\u201d immunity would provide a strong bulwark against any such liability for Mr. Nunes or his staff. The Constitution provides that senators and representatives \u201cshall not be questioned in any other Place\u201d for \u201cany Speech or Debate in either House,\u201d immunizing members of Congress from criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits that concern the legislative process. The Supreme Court has explained that this immunity extends to legislative acts that are an \u201cintegral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings.\u201d The court also has made clear that the clause covers not just members of Congress but also their staff, and that oversight activity may come under its ambit.\n\nIn this case, however, Mr. Nunes and company may have ranged so far afield that those protections no longer apply. Under the clause, mere peripheral connection to legislative acts cannot serve as a fig leaf to shield criminal conduct. Mr. Nunes would do well to remember what befell Senator Daniel Brewster of Maryland: In 1972 the Supreme Court declined to afford him speech or debate immunity in a bribery prosecution, pointing out that the alleged crime turned on acceptance of payment, not the ultimate voting act promised in return.\n\nAn additional worry for Team Nunes: The clause does not protect activities that courts consider \u201cpolitical,\u201d such as communicating with the executive branch on behalf of constituents, issuing a newsletter or news release or speaking outside of Congress. The most famous example involves Alaska Senator Mike Gravel and his staff, who were involved in the release and publication of the Pentagon Papers. The courts found that the speech or debate protections applied to Senator Gravel\u2019s actions in entering the documents into the record of a subcommittee hearing, but did not apply to actions of the senator and his staff in arranging private publication following the hearing. The reason: The latter conduct was \u201cin no way essential to the deliberations of the Senate.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Is Devin Nunes Obstructing Justice?", "authors": []}

My dad\u2019s previous job was at a company that offers internships in my area of interest. He suggested that I consider interning there and use his connection to my advantage. I think that internships should be earned based on merit, and that nepotism is unethical. I am not sure, however, if avoiding nepotism as an applicant would do anything to put a stop to the practice. I worry that only employers have the power to stop nepotism, and that by avoiding it, I would just hand the internship to other children of employees or former employees who are less concerned about the ethics of nepotism. Also, if I intern (and possibly get a full-time job) with a company that practices nepotism, I might one day be able to change the hiring policy from the inside. What do you recommend? Name Withheld The world of work is full of unfairness. Nepotism \u2014 from the Latin for nephew \u2014 occurs when we give a resource to a relative while overlooking people who are more deserving. One of my favorite historical titles is cardinal nipote, Italian for cardinal nephew, which would be awarded when a pope appointed a kinsman to the College of Cardinals. That old papal practice is what gave us the word. (The last time a papal relative was appointed cardinal was in 1879, when Leo XIII appointed Giuseppe Pecci, his brother.) But nepotism isn\u2019t the most important source of unjustified inequality. Those who already have the advantage of better educations, better connections and better financial resources often parlay these advantages into securing more valuable opportunities and more remunerative careers. Internships are one device for doing this. They\u2019re often unpaid or low-paid, so that only those with substantial family resources can afford to do them. And access to them is often by way of connections. So, internships require both social capital and financial capital. (Charles Murray has famously pronounced them \u201caffirmative action for the advantaged.\u201d) Given all this, you might think that internships should be given to applicants with the best qualifications, but these qualifications are easier for the rich and well connected to acquire, which is why such people often have more cultural capital, too. So, there\u2019s a real problem here. The question is what your role should be in finding a solution. If the system is as you describe it, you\u2019re unlikely to get this internship unless you agree to the pulling of the paternal strings. Should you forswear a system you rightly think unfair at the cost of not getting an internship? There are at least two worries about that.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Do you agree with Mr. Appiah\u2019s advice to the student?

(Some labels like these were eventually changed.)\n\nOn the other side is a cadre of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers \u2014 nicknamed \u201cthe Food Bar\u201d \u2014 who have filed more than 300 lawsuits seeking class-action status in the past three years. Those claims involve allegations of misrepresentations, just on food labels, of the term \u201cnatural\u201d and other descriptions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd, increasingly, the lawsuits are moving beyond food and focusing on consumer goods like baby wipes and cleaning products.\n\nAmong the brands that have faced legal challenges are several that have long promoted their use of natural ingredients: Tom\u2019s of Maine antiperspirants and toothpastes, the Honest Company\u2019s laundry detergent and dish soap, Annie\u2019s Homegrown salad dressings, Breyers and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Aveeno face moisturizers and Seventh Generation dish soap.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuits you see are only a fraction of the claims that are made,\u201d said David T. Biderman, a partner at Perkins Coie who defends food companies in class-action lawsuits. Behind the scenes, Mr. Biderman said, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are sending letters to companies and threatening to file lawsuits over labels they argue are misleading or violate consumer protection laws. Those letters, Mr. Biderman said, are often rejected, go away or are resolved with a small payment.\n\nWhether the lawsuits are necessary, or a nuisance, depends on whom you ask.\n\nProponents say that in lieu of clear regulation, consumers have been protected by these lawsuits, pointing to a number of cases in which manufacturers have altered their labels. General Mills, which faced at least two federal lawsuits claiming that its Nature Valley granola bars contained artificial ingredients, replaced labels that once read \u201c100% Natural\u201d to say they are \u201cMade With 100% Natural Whole Grain Oats.\u201d\n\nCorporations, lawyers say, have been reluctant to allow a case to go to trial and risk having a legal definition of \u201cnatural\u201d emerge \u2014 which might set standards companies would have to meet. As a result, the bulk of the lawsuits filed over the past decade have been settled, dismissed or, more recently, stayed by judges who hope regulators will step in with a definition.\n\nKim Richman, a plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said his clients, including consumers and nonprofit groups, \u201cengage in socially conscious litigation to level the playing field against corporate America as government oversight increasingly falls short.\u201d\n\nBut critics say a big chunk of the settlement money lands in the pockets of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, and does not financially benefit consumers.\n\nCritics also argue that some lawyers are robo-filing lawsuits \u2014 cut-and-pasting nearly identical allegations into complaints against multiple companies \u2014 and in the process are bringing head-scratching cases that risk undermining the credible ones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In December, a New York federal court judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming that Dannon yogurt was falsely labeled natural because the cows might have been given genetically modified feed.\n\nThe new focus in litigation away from the ingredients in the food to the actual food chain \u2014 how the crop was grown or what the animals were fed \u2014 may undermine the original goal of the lawsuits, which was addressing nutritional concerns, some experts say.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really getting into splitting hairs about what is natural and what\u2019s not,\u201d said Maia Kats, the director of litigation for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group has been involved in a handful of lawsuits over so-called natural products.\n\nStuck in the middle of this natural-or-not morass are consumers. Unable to trust the labels lining store shelves, shoppers are left with little choice but to examine the small type on the back of the box and try to decipher terms like methylisothiazolinone, a synthetic preservative found in some personal- and skin-care products.\n\nA survey of consumers in 2015 by Consumer Reports magazine showed that at least 60 percent of respondents believed \u201cnatural\u201d on packaged and processed foods meant they contained no artificial colors or ingredients and no genetically modified materials.\n\n\u201cAbout two-thirds of consumers surveyed think that natural on a food package means no pesticides were used,\u201d said Charlotte Vallaeys, a senior policy analyst with Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports. \u201cThey\u2019re confusing it with organic,\u201d which prohibits nearly all pesticides from use on food products.\n\nBut when it comes to commonly used terms like \u201cnatural\u201d or even \u201chealthy,\u201d the various agencies that oversee food and beverages and advertising have been slow to come up with definitions.\n\nIn late 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration sought feedback from consumers and the industry on whether it should define and regulate the word \u201cnatural\u201d on food labeling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 7,600 comments flooded in.

We will have more to say on the issue soon.\u201d\n\nMost agencies argue they lack the resources to police products that, while not necessarily truthful in their labeling, do not appear to be causing harm to consumers, either. The class-action lawsuits, for the most part, seek reimbursement in the price difference between the \u201cnatural\u201d product and its less natural competition.\n\nApart from food, the regulation of claims in the advertising of shampoos and laundry detergent gets even murkier.\n\nIn 2012, when the Federal Trade Commission updated its Green Guides, a road map to help marketers avoid making environmental claims that could mislead consumers, it did not define the word \u201cnatural.\u201d Laura Koss, a lawyer in the division of enforcement, said the commission received insufficient consumer feedback about the term when it sought comment.\n\nStill, lawyers say that until regulators come up with a definition, the not-so-natural dance among consumers, manufacturers and lawyers will continue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of companies, in the absence of clear standards, willing to take the class-action risk because there is so much consumer demand for products that are marketed as natural,\u201d said Randal M. Shaheen, a lawyer with Venable who defends corporate advertising and marketing claims. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a consumer who is really passionate about, for example, not giving your kids high-fructose corn syrup, you should read the label to see how it is sweetened.\u201d", "title": "Is It \u2018Natural\u2019?

{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "Anxiety about loneliness is a common feature of modern societies. Today, two major causes of loneliness seem possible. One is that societies throughout the world have embraced a culture of individualism. More people are living alone, and aging alone, than ever. Neoliberal social policies have turned workers into precarious free agents, and when jobs disappear, things fall apart fast. Labor unions, civic associations, neighborhood organizations, religious groups and other traditional sources of social solidarity are in steady decline. Increasingly, we all feel that we\u2019re on our own.\n\nThe other possible cause is the rise of communications technology, including smartphones, social media and the internet. A decade ago, companies like Facebook, Apple and Google pledged that their products would help create meaningful relationships and communities. Instead, we\u2019ve used the media system to deepen existing divisions, at both the individual and group levels. We may have thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d on Facebook and Instagram, but when it comes to human relationships, it turns out there\u2019s no substitute for building them the old-fashioned way, in person.\n\nIn light of these two trends, it\u2019s easy to believe we\u2019re experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of loneliness and isolation. Surprisingly, though, the best data do not actually show drastic spikes in either loneliness or social isolation.\n\nThe main evidence for rising isolation comes from a widely reported sociology journal article claiming that in 2004, one in four Americans had no one in their life they felt they could confide in, compared with one in 10 during the 1980s. But that study turned out to be based on faulty data, and other research shows that the portion of Americans without a confidant is about the same as it has long been. Although one of the authors has distanced himself from the paper (saying, \u201cI no longer think it\u2019s reliable\u201d), scholars, journalists and policymakers continue to cite it.\n\nThe other data on loneliness are complicated and often contradictory, in part because there are so many different ways of measuring the phenomenon. But it\u2019s clear that the loneliness statistics cited by those who say we have an epidemic are outliers. For example, one set of statistics comes from a study that counted as lonely people who said they felt \u201cleft out\u201d or \u201cisolated,\u201d or \u201clacked companionship\u201d \u2014 even just \u201csome of the time.\u201d That\u2019s an exceedingly low bar, and surely not one we\u2019d want doctors or policymakers to use in their work.", "title": "Opinion | Is Loneliness a Health Epidemic?", "authors": []}

My mother made clear that I would go to college, but neither she nor I had entertained the idea that I might go to schools like that. Inspired by Recruiter Bae, I applied for as many scholarships as I could find and won 17 in a semester. But I needed additional money to cover the cost of Howard University in Washington. So I turned to Citibank. I took out about $10,000 for the first year, but it soon became clear that I\u2019d need much more to keep studying at Howard and living in Washington until graduation. After I received my diploma, I immediately owed almost $800 a month in private loans, with 12 years to pay it off. That\u2019s not counting the few hundred dollars I pay each month in federal loans. Fortunately, the government gives me more than twice the time to cough it up. This may be the part of my story where you question my judgment. Why did I choose a fancy school if I didn\u2019t have the money? How could I not have understood the financial commitment I was making? And if I\u2019m so far in debt now, why am I writing this and not pursuing a more lucrative career as a doctor or lawyer \u2014 or, as one relative put it bluntly, \u201cWhen are you going to work in a building?\u201d I\u2019m not dismissing my responsibility for this. But along with many other 17- and 18-year-olds, when I went to college, I didn\u2019t know anything about student loans, interest rates or rude private debt companies that hound the living hell out of you. All I knew was what I was told: College was the ticket to social mobility, and good students deserved to go to schools that matched our talent and ambition. Folks like me, who come from working-class backgrounds, are told to chase down a bachelor\u2019s degree by any means necessary. But no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 What more have you learned about student loans from this article? How do you feel about the system based on this author\u2019s experience or that of people you know? What more would you like to know about taking out student loans?\n\n\u2014 In your opinion, is going to the college of your dreams \u2014 one that matches your talents and ambitions \u2014 worth the debt you might accrue? Or would you choose a school based on its affordability for you and your family? Why?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 If you do plan to take out loans to finance your education, how much will this debt influence your career choice? In other words, will you choose your job based on how much money you can make, or based on your interest in a particular field?\n\n\u2014 Over all, do you think that student debt is a problem in the United States? If so, what can schools, students or the government do to address this issue? If not, why not?", "title": "Is Student Debt Worth It?", "authors": ["Natalie Proulx", "Student Opinion"]}

Animated by a wave of polling since the Florida massacre, Democratic governors warned that candidates would pay a political price for opposing new gun regulations, and some of their Republican counterparts conceded that the pleas of voters could no longer be ignored as they increasingly abandon the party.\n\n\u201cI think for Republicans our challenge in the next race is going to be about appealing to the suburban vote that hasn\u2019t been so good for Republicans the last few races,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, citing in particular suburban women. It is clear, he added, that \u201cpeople want to see action.\u201d\n\nThe combination of political pressure from the governors and moves by President Trump to embrace certain limited measures opposed by the National Rifle Association could set up a congressional showdown with the powerful firearms lobby not seen since the gun debate that followed the deadly school shooting in 2012 in Newtown, Conn.\n\nThe sudden focus on guns is likely to complicate an already busy agenda. Congress left Washington without coming up with a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and expires next week. A contentious debate over gun legislation could push immigration to the back burner.\n\nWhile the Newtown massacre and the many that have followed have produced familiar scenes in which Democrats push for tough new gun restrictions and Republicans dig in and resist, the latest mass shooting appears to have shifted the landscape, even if just slightly, as the Parkland students have become overnight gun control advocates and media fixtures.", "title": "Is This the Moment for Gun Control?

Bork, that Mr. Nixon \u201cillegally discharged\u201d the prosecutor because he \u201cdid not serve at the president\u2019s pleasure.\u201d\n\nThat case holds both peril and promise for Mr. Trump.\n\nThe risk comes in the precedent. It shows how even if a president gets the Department of Justice to do his dirty work, judges have the final say. They can keep prosecutors on the job. (With different facts and law, the Nixon case does not predict how courts would rule today on any potential removal of Mr. Mueller. But courts do have the power to reverse an illegal firing.)\n\nThe promise for Mr. Trump comes in how he is pressuring the Justice Department. He may be reshaping law-enforcement leadership, and the key people around the Russia probe, without actually crossing into the potentially illegal firing of a special counsel.\n\nIn other words, Mr. Trump may be slowly bending the system and personnel toward him, without explicitly ordering people to choose between their job and Mr. Mueller\u2019s job.\n\nThat can build internal resistance to whatever Mr. Mueller ultimately finds, stacking skeptics around him. Indeed, few legal experts say firing federal appointees is itself illegal. (In an obstruction case, prosecutors look at how firings form one element of a wider plot.)\n\nHas Mr. Trump decided to pursue his Russia agenda through this method, having learned the red line \u2014 trying to get Mr. Mueller fired, which his own White House counsel reportedly threatened to resign over \u2014 is not worth the personal risk?\n\nTo observe that this tarrying plot may be lawful is not, of course, to endorse it.\n\nFinding technically legal ways to grind down, pressure and reshape law enforcement is an affront to our constitutional democracy. It weeds out the type of independent public servants who are supposed to be in these posts. It invites partisanship and abuse. It undermines public confidence in the one institution that we trust to patrol, prosecute and even kill our fellow citizens.", "title": "Opinion | Is Trump Working on a Different Kind of \u2018Massacre\u2019?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "The culture right now is in a state of acute ambivalence about Woody Allen, which is to say that, as in so many other matters, the public conversation is defined by conflict, polarization and the exclusion of the middle ground. Love and hate occupy opposing camps, and reconciliation of their claims seems impossible, at least when those claims involve the allegations that Mr. Allen molested his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was a young child. He adamantly denies the accusations, and his most passionate defenders insist that to doubt it is to be a latter-day McCarthyite, a witch hunter.\n\nBut relitigating the abuse charges is a way of avoiding the real work, which is the endless, not always pleasant task of interpreting Mr. Allen\u2019s work. The movies and what they have meant to so many of us will not just vanish. The ambivalence needs to be acknowledged and analyzed, which is why I\u2019ve spent much of the past few weeks rewatching movies that I used to count among my favorites.\n\nThat is an analysis that Mr. Allen\u2019s most vociferous detractors and his most ardent partisans share a wish to terminate. Dylan Farrow\u2019s allegations and the other episode they bring up \u2014 the demise of Mr. Allen\u2019s 12-year relationship with the actress Mia Farrow and his affair with her daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who is now his wife \u2014 are to many people, especially young people, a deal breaker, evidence of a creepiness they find impossible to see past. For others, including myself for most of my career as a film critic and for those who stuck with Mr. Allen for the last 25 years, seeing past it was nearly a reflex. It seemed to be the more mature, the more reasonable, the less hysterical stance to adopt.\n\nI\u2019ve already written about why I no longer find that an ethically or intellectually tenable stance. Not everyone was persuaded, of course, and some readers helpfully sent along lists of Great Artists Who Have Done Terrible Things. What about them? Should we judge their work by their actions? Should we banish it because these men treated women badly, or represented them in ways we now consider misogynist?\n\nThe fact that bad men make great art tends to be asserted as if it were the solution to, rather than the statement of, a problem. It also supposes greatness to be a fixed quantity, rather than the subject and result of perpetual argument.", "title": "Is Woody Allen a Great Filmmaker? Discuss", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "What conclusions may be drawn? For one thing, Instagram puts a premium on superficial dog traits like cuteness over ones like intelligence or obedience.\n\n\u201cInstagram and social media is impacting everything, and influencing all kinds of lifestyle and consumer decisions, so it makes sense that it would influence what kind of dog people choose,\u201d said Cameron Woo, the publisher of The Bark, a dog-culture magazine based in Berkeley, Calif. In that way, Instagram is like television was in an earlier era, Mr. Woo said. \u201cLassie\u201d inspired a mid-century collie boom; \u201cFrasier\u201d propelled a Jack Russell terrier moment in the 1990s.\n\nThat was certainly the case with Aleksandar Gligoric, a dog breeder from Serbia who named his online dog store Frenchie World, in part because of Instagram. \u201cPeople are considering Instagram worthiness in all aspects of their life,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that the Frenchie would be the next big thing on Instagram.\u201d\n\nAlmost Human\n\nSo, what dog traits are favored by Instagram users? Well, for starters, they like dogs that look like them.\n\nBreeds like pugs and Boston terriers \u201creally resemble humans, or babies,\u201d Mr. Woo said. These so-called brachycephalic breeds, with their shortened heads, flat faces and barely there noses, \u201care very photogenic with their large, forward-looking eyes,\u201d Mr. Woo said. \u201cThey appear to be grinning or smiling,\u201d never mind that the \u201csmiles\u201d are often caused by breathing difficulties native to their breeds.\n\nPug owners don\u2019t disagree.\n\n\u201cWith their smushed-in faces, all the rolls, and their funny tails, pugs are the least doglike dogs,\u201d said Leslie Mosier of Nashville, whose pug, Doug (@itsdougthepug), is one of the most popular pets on Instagram, with 3.2 million reputed followers. \u201cThey are more like humans-slash-pigs-slash-dogs.\u201d\n\nThe breed\u2019s almost-human face makes it easy for owners to anthropomorphize their pets with costumes. Ms. Mosier routinely plays off Doug\u2019s perma-frown by dressing him \u2014 wrapped in towels, say, with cucumber slices over his eyes, looking like a moneyed divorc\u00e9e taking refuge at Canyon Ranch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs actors or models, pugs are the canine equivalent of hams. \u201cThey were bred in China to sit at the emperor\u2019s feet and entertain,\u201d Ms. Mosier said.\n\nA dog\u2019s popularity can increase exponentially when it has a signature style flourish, the canine equivalent of Anna Wintour\u2019s sunglasses or Pharrell Williams\u2019s hats. Case in point: the Gene Simmons-length tongue of @marniethedog, a Shih Tzu rescue that at this point may be more famous than the real Gene Simmons, thanks to an explosively popular Instagram feed.\n\nAnd if the canine flourish isn\u2019t genetic, there\u2019s no stopping the owner from creating one with careful grooming. Take Agador (@poochofnyc), a maltipoo with teddy bear looks who has appeared in ad campaigns for Google and a teaser for Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d video.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

It is a look that conjures Bob Ross, the TV painter who died in 1995. And who isn\u2019t going to follow \u201cthe Bob Ross of dogs,\u201d as Agador is billed on Instagram.\n\n\u201cIt makes him instantly recognizable,\u201d said Allan Monteron, one of his owners. \u201cPeople stop us on the street and say, \u2018I follow that dog on Instagram!\u2019\u201d\n\nExaggerated features are a plus, too. Take corgis, those squat-legged canine courtiers to the queen. They are certainly hot on Instagram, with accounts that have \u201ccorgi\u201d in the user name rising 200 percent over the past year, according to Instagram, and that cannot all be attributable to the breed\u2019s occasional cameo on \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\n\nEvery feature of the corgi works as a visual punch line: those oversize Yoda ears, the squat \u201cHoney I Shrunk the Collie\u201d body, the 50-percent-off appendages, which make the corgi\u2019s movements particularly comical on social media.\n\nThe same may be said of bulldogs, the one breed that appears in the top five of both Instagram and the American Kennel Club. Outside of social media, bulldogs\u2019 popularity will be assured so long as there are Anglophiles, Marine Corps veterans and college football fans in the state of Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd on Instagram, where user names that include \u201cbulldog\u201d have seen a 60 percent surge in the past year, bulldogs check multiple boxes: They look like people (specifically, grumpy old men), have inherently comic features (the volleyball-size head, the tiny bow legs) and are easy to anthropomorphize.\n\nThe breed has also reaped a windfall of \u201cit dog\u201d publicity from celebrities, including Brad Pitt, Jessica Biel and David Beckham, for whom these homely little bruisers seem to make the perfect foil. The message seems to be: \u201cDo not hate me because I am beautiful, since my dog is not.\u201d\n\nMutts and Tripods\n\nBecause of their associations with the queen and the British Empire, however, both corgis and bulldogs seem out of step with the current vogue for rescue dogs and less rarefied breeds.\n\nThese days, pointedly aristocratic breeds tend not to pop on social media as much as dogs with quirky features or compelling back stories, said Elias Weiss Friedman, a New Yorker photographer who spends his days snapping pictures for The Dogist, a dog-centric street photography site that has a rabid Instagram following.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that people prefer the more real, natural dogs,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cPoodles seem to give off a pretentious vibe, especially if they have the classic poodle haircut. The older generations love them, but I think the younger generation sees that style as fake, undogly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, his two most popular posts have been a mixed breed puppy with funny ears named Larry and a 12-year-old Labrador with vitiligo named Rowdy. \u201cPeople crave relatability, and see dogs as individuals with similar life challenges to themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe right kinds of mixed breed \u2014 they were once called mutts \u2014 play well on social media, particularly if their features are camera worthy. A husky-malamute-wolf mix called @loki_the_wolfdog has become one of the 10 most popular pets on Instagram, thanks in part to his rugged \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d aura and head-turning looks (including mismatched eye colors and a silky coat that changes color with the seasons), that his owner, Kelly Lund, uses to poetic effect in his shots of Loki in the snow-dusted Colorado wilderness.\n\nMany dog owners interviewed also said they see mutts, rescues and disabled dogs as a more ethical choice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think the most difficult question posed to us is always \u2018Where did you get that dog? I want to get one exactly like it,\u201d said Francis Bott, who owns Agador with his partner, Mr. Monteron. \u201cIt is simple enough to provide the breeder\u2019s name, but we are big proponents of adopting rescues whenever possible.\u201d\n\n(They opted buy a hypoallergenic poodle mix from a breeder, Mr. Bott said, because their previous dog, a rescue Shih Tzu/Bichon mix, aggravated their allergies.)\n\nRescue organizations like the North Shore Animal League and the Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition blanket social media with heart-rending photos of doe-eyed animals looking for a home.\n\nSuch social media efforts to raise awareness have led to a demand for differently abled dogs and so-called tripods, or those missing a limb, said Jennifer Nosek, the editor of Modern Dog magazine. One such unlikely Instagram star was Smiley, a golden retriever born without eyes, and with a form of dwarfism, in a puppy mill, who went on to become a widely publicized service dog in nursing homes and hospitals. (Smiley\u2019s death last year, after a battle with cancer, was covered by the news media.)\n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s an antidote to all the bad news we\u2019re so often bombarded with,\u201d Ms. Nosek said. \u201cThese accounts remind us that there are people, and dogs, out there doing good.\u201d\n\nEither that, or such dogs just provide a break from the pressure that the rest of us feel trying to look too perfect for Instagram.\n\nTake @chloekardoggian, a gray-whiskered 13-year-old rescue Chihuahua in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, with huge eyes and 153,000 followers. \u201cHer ears go up, her nose goes right, her tongue goes left, and her eyes each go in different directions,\u201d said Dorie Herman, her owner. \u201cEveryone has felt like Chloe looks at some point in their lives.\u201d", "title": "Is Your Dog Ready for Instagram?", "authors": ["Alex Williams"]}

But the government\u2019s decision has struck a particular chord here and among Jews abroad since the modern state of Israel has served as a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and was largely built by immigrants.\n\nThe issue is also testing what it means to be a Jewish state: to preserve its Jewish majority, or to be governed by Jewish values, including the ideal of \u201ctikkun olam,\u201d or repairing the world.\n\n\u201cEvery country must guard its borders,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in announcing the policy last month. \u201cIt is important that people understand that we are doing something here that is completely legal and completely essential.\u201d\n\nHe cited the \u201cplight\u201d of residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants are concentrated.

The influx stopped in 2012, when Israel constructed a steel barrier along the 150-mile border with Egypt.\n\nOf the thousands of Eritreans and Sudanese who have filed asylum requests in Israel in recent years, only about 10 have received refugee status. Some Sudanese refugees from war-torn Darfur have been given a special humanitarian status but most of the other asylum requests have not been processed.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt least 20,000 African migrants have since left Israel.

It says its policy toward Africans in need of a home is one of \u201copen doors,\u201d but only to those who come voluntarily.\n\nMigrant and human rights organizations say many Africans who left Israel for Rwanda and Uganda did not find work or receive legal status. Many are said to have continued on their journeys, often putting themselves in grave danger.\n\nInterior Minister Aryeh Deri told a parliamentary committee this week that Israel had deported more than 5,000 non-African illegal immigrants since last year, proof that the government policy was not racist; more than 20,000 Ukrainians and Georgians have sought asylum in Israel in recent years.\n\nUnder increasing public pressure, he clarified that the new policy would apply only to single African men who had not formally submitted an asylum request by Jan. 1.

Israel, which considers Iran its most potent enemy in the region, has been lobbying world powers to push these forces from the border areas.\n\nIsrael has carried out scores of strikes in Syria in recent years, largely targeting what it says are advanced weapons stores or convoys taking weapons to Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. Israel has also reportedly hit Syrian government facilities involved in weapons development and an Iranian base under construction in Syria.\n\nBut this was the first Israeli strike on a site where Iranian forces were present, analysts said, and Israeli military officials said this was the first time an Iranian drone had penetrated Israeli airspace during the Syrian war.

Government supporters celebrated in the streets of Damascus, handing out sweets and hailing Mr. Assad and the army.\n\nThis is the first time the Syrian government appears to have made good on promises to shoot down Israeli aircraft, after years of threats against both Israel and the other international militaries that have flown sorties over Syria without permission.\n\n\u201cI am so happy,\u201d said Haidar, 30, a government supporter, as he handed out sweets downtown. \u201cIt makes me proud to see a Syrian response, shooting down the Israeli F-16. For years we have been waiting for a Syrian reaction against the Israeli violations and airstrikes.\u201d\n\nBut just as Syrian self-confidence appears to have grown, Israel also sent a strong message with its broad wave of strikes on Saturday, Israeli analysts said. They noted that this was the first time in recent years Israel had struck Syrian territory in broad daylight and said that Israel had inflicted serious damage on Syria\u2019s air-defense system. Despite more Syrian antiaircraft fire, all Israeli jets returned to base safely from the second mission, after the first jet was lost, according to the Israeli military. Syria is believed to have fired at least a dozen antiaircraft missiles, with the wreckage of one landing in Lebanon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the Israeli F-16 was directly hit by the Syrian antiaircraft fire.

What\u2019s that going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Billy Bragg, an English singer-songwriter and a purveyor of protest music since the 1970s, what makes writing political music these days different than in previous eras is that what was once considered outrageous behavior is now shrugged at. \u201cWhen the people who elected Trump aren\u2019t even offended when you call him a liar, it makes him a very slippery customer,\u201d he said by phone.\n\nThe music industry and the overall media landscape have been remade, too. The fading influence of radio, MTV and music magazines coupled with the rise of streaming services and social media has virtually erased the idea of a musical monoculture. \u201cThe centrality of music to youth culture, that\u2019s changed,\u201d Mr. Bragg said. \u201cIn the 20th century, music, for young people, was our only social medium.

Together they would be an anti-establishment nightmare.\n\n\u201cThe project of Salvini is a national project. His political ideas, his notion of protecting the territory, is seen the same in the north and the south,\u201d said Francesco Zicchieri, a leader of We\u2019re With Salvini, a movement that has acted as the southern and central Italian branch of the Northern League.\n\nUntil a few years ago, the Northern League was a separatist party built on antagonism toward Rome (the great thief) and the south (filled with \u201cterroni,\u201d a derogatory term for southerners). The dream was sovereignty for Padania, a mystical northern Italian land imbued with the sanctity of the River Po.\n\nMr. Salvini, 44, took over the party in 2013 from its founder, Umberto Bossi, who had been weakened by a stroke and corruption scandals. Mr. Salvini has since been an indefatigable candidate for prime minister and an omnipresent media figure, while severing the party from its secessionist roots.\n\nHe has used the country\u2019s growing economic discontent, and especially its wariness about immigrants, as a vehicle to reach voters in former enemy territory.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Italy\u2019s center-left government \u2014 like other formerly more welcoming European countries \u2014 has cracked down on illegal immigration, Mr. Salvini\u2019s message continues to resonate in a country on the front lines of a great migration that has reshaped European politics.\n\nMore than 600,000 migrants, many from Africa, have landed on Italian shores in the last four years, prompting a backlash that has fueled the the center right.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast summer, a candidate of Mr. Salvini\u2019s party shocked Italy by winning in Cascina, a liberal stronghold in Tuscany once liberated by American soldiers in World War II.

He currently has about 12 percent of the vote, but has become a challenger to Mr. Berlusconi as well as a potentially mutinous partner in their leading center-right alliance.\n\nHe has shown a capacity for change before. Mr. Salvini, a critic of the European Union despite being a paid deputy in the European Parliament, used to reserve his hostility for Italy\u2019s southerners.

Clara Agnoletti showed off a Northern League sign that she had made herself by hand with 4,000 green crystals.\n\nShe was for the national expansion but expressed exasperation that Mr. Salvini had eliminated the word Northern from the party\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019ll put some paper over the Northern,\u201d she said with a shrug.\n\nBehind her, a group of white nationalists who called themselves \u201cYoung Identitarians,\u201d held a sign against offering citizenship to Italian-born children of immigrants.

For example, I said to my designer, \u201cWe are not setting the production in any place. We don\u2019t need to worry about what country are we in; we can do whatever we bloody well like.\u201d And that opens you up to all sorts of things. But I said, \u201cLet\u2019s just put Escamillo in a fabulous toreador\u2019s costume.\u201d When he comes on, everyone\u2019s waiting for that number \u2014 and we turn it into a huge number. I said, \u201cJust make sure the toreador costume looks fabulous, and it solves the problem.\u201d\n\nA lot of the Spanish flavor comes from dance rhythms in the music: The overture opens with a pasodoble, there\u2019s the famous \u201cHabanera,\u201d and so forth. What role does dance play in your \u201cCarmen\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs you say, it\u2019s in the music. She dances, and we\u2019ve put other dance elements in, in places where there\u2019s not normally dancing.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe uses dance but not in the form of go-go dancing: It\u2019s not pole dancing, and it\u2019s not the local men\u2019s night, with a stripper there. She uses dance in the absolute primal sense of a kind of Dionysian expression of joy and power, which is an entirely different thing.\n\nEarlier this year, in a production of \u201cCarmen\u201d in Florence, there was a lot of controversy when the ending was changed so that she kills Don Jos\u00e9, and not the other way around. What do you think about that?\n\nI\u2019m a little bit cynical because I think it was very connected to the whole #MeToo movement. I mean there have been thousands of productions in the last hundred years where people change the ending. There have been thousands where it says in the libretto that she dies, and a production makes him die. This is nothing new.\n\nIf people think that that\u2019s contributing to a debate about #MeToo, then I roll my eyes in enormous cynicism, because the #MeToo moment is very important: It has to do with what is happening in the offices and streets and corridors of real life. But we are in the fantasy space of theater.\n\nWhen you make decisions about what to do onstage, do you think about the statements these make, politically?\n\nI\u2019ve got to think about it, because I\u2019m a man who lives in the 21st century. We\u2019ve got to be honest here: The history of opera is a history of misogyny. With glaring exceptions \u2014 Monteverdi, Mozart, Janacek \u2014 most of the rest, particularly the 19th century, is deeply problematic.\n\nYou have a duty as a director, male or female, to investigate that and try and twist it or try and play with it or try and subvert it. That\u2019s what makes opera so fantastic. You operate in opera on many different levels. You are having a conversation with the past, on a stage, to a contemporary audience.

{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "When I was assaulted at 18, I knew clearly what I wanted: I wanted him to never violate anyone else again, ever. Four of us whom he\u2019d assaulted told the university, through proper channels; he was eventually found responsible, but the punishment was negligible. Nor did it achieve my goal: He assaulted another person the weekend of his graduation. The whole process made me feel betrayed, angry and unvalued. It was worse than the assault itself.\n\nLater, when I got involved in campus sexual assault activism and did Q. and A. sessions around the country, people often asked me why I hadn\u2019t then gone further, seeking to have him expelled or reporting him to the police. I always felt uncomfortable when asked these questions \u2014 it was as though I had to prove that my story was really \u201cthat bad,\u201d as if I admitted I didn\u2019t want him to go to jail, it would minimize his wrongdoing. The reason I gave for not reporting him to the police was that I didn\u2019t want to go through a lengthy court process. While this was true, it was more than that: First, I wanted to get on with my life. But second, putting him in prison seemed almost laughably ill suited to what I needed. What I wanted was for him to change his behavior. He needed an intervention, not prison. He got neither.\n\nI had to fit my priorities into a box that was never designed to hold them, as do so many other survivors. Sexual injustices exist in many forms, from casual sexism and harassment to sexual assault and rape. But people harmed by them have, by and large, only two options: They can try to have the perpetrator formally punished, or they can do nothing. The process of reporting formally is important to many survivors and must be protected; we know, however, that a vast majority of people will not choose this path. And all survivors \u2014 regardless of whether a report is filed or a harm-doer is exposed \u2014 deserve justice, healing and trust.\n\nRecognition of the scale of sexual assault and harassment in the United States has, understandably, inspired a wave of outrage. Women who have watched known predators act without consequences for years are angry, as they should be.\n\nBut it is this same factor \u2014 the scale of the problem \u2014 that ensures that cries for retribution on a mass scale are untenable. We\u2019re simultaneously dehumanizing the people who committed sexual assault for years by calling them monsters and learning that the people who commit these crimes are our friends, co-workers, family members and partners. Such dynamics become too much to grapple with; as a result, the conversation devolves into an argument about whether #MeToo has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d versus \u201cnot far enough\u201d; my fear is that this is where it will stall until we lose patience and move on, when what we really need is a new approach.", "title": "Opinion | I\u2019m a Campus Sexual Assault Activist.

His tenure lacked lasting policy successes. His words, actions and appointments repelled investors and often sent the local currency, the rand, spiraling lower.\n\nAt the same time, he reflected the problems of a party that has struggled to transform itself from a liberation movement to a modern political party, and that has led, mostly unchallenged, for a quarter of a century.\n\nThe A.N.C. unfailingly stood behind Mr. Zuma until the end of his second term as party leader in December and the election as party leader of Mr. Ramaphosa, an anti-apartheid leader who went on to become one of the nation\u2019s most successful businessmen.\n\nDo You Live in South Africa?

But under Mr. Zuma, the country\u2019s economy stagnated.\n\nGovernment debt was downgraded to junk status because of poor governing. Unemployment topped 25 percent, and the nation remained one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies.\n\nSome successes, like a push into renewable energy, were eventually undermined by Mr. Zuma\u2019s administration; the effects of others, like the passing of a minimum wage, are still unclear.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe police massacre of 34 miners involved in a wildcat strike in Marikana in 2012, the worst act of official violence since the end of apartheid, intensified the widespread belief that the A.N.C. had betrayed the people it claimed to be representing.\n\nWhile Mr. Zuma remained popular in many areas that were economically dependent on the party and public works, he was deeply unpopular in Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, where the black middle class is concentrated.\n\nStill, though mocked by the country\u2019s black elite, Mr. Zuma was the most gifted politician in townships and rural areas, where he tapped into the resentment of those left behind. He excited crowds by dancing, delivering speeches in English and Zulu, and often performing a song by the A.N.C.\u2019s former military wing, \u201cBring Me My Machine Gun.\u201d\n\nProblems in his private life spilled out often into public view. In 2006, Mr. Zuma was found not guilty of raping a 31-year-old family friend. He testified in court that she had seduced him by wearing a short skirt. He also said he had taken a shower afterward to minimize the risk of contracting H.I.V.\n\nPhoto\n\nA polygamist under Zulu tradition, Mr. Zuma has more than 20 children, some of whom have been involved in questionable business deals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout his time in office, corruption flourished, especially at the state enterprises where access was given to family, friends and business associates, including the Guptas, a wealthy family with widespread business interests.\n\nHe appointed loyalists \u2014 sometimes with little experience \u2014 to his cabinet and to top positions at state companies like Eskom, the power utility, and South African Airways, the national carrier.\n\nIn a 2016 report on corruption, Thulisile Madonsela, the former public protector, described widespread influence-peddling in the Zuma administration and called for a public inquiry. After failing to quash the investigation in the courts, Mr. Zuma recently announced the appointment of a commission of inquiry.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Zuma spent his adult life in Africa\u2019s oldest and most famous liberation party, serving as the party\u2019s intelligence chief during the anti-apartheid struggle. He succeeded in becoming president despite a string of problems that would have ended the careers of less skilled politicians.\n\nHe faced charges of corruption in an arms deal in the 1990s when he was a senior party leader. He has avoided prosecution in the case, but state prosecutors are expected to decide this month whether to indict him on corruption charges.\n\nMr. Zuma often said critics exaggerated the level of graft in his administration. In his last speech as party leader in December, he said the party needed to be protected from \u201ccorporate greed\u201d and attacked the country\u2019s white-dominated business community.\n\n\u201cTheft and corruption in the private sector is as bad as that in government,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the case that perhaps angered most South Africans was related to the improvements to Mr. Zuma\u2019s homestead in Nkandla, in KwaZulu Natal Province.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Zuma said that the upgrades, including a swimming pool and chicken coop, were necessary to ensure his safety and that the costs should therefore be borne by taxpayers. In Parliament, he mocked opposition lawmakers\u2019 pronunciation of Nkandla and cackled openly, secure in his party\u2019s overwhelming majority.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Public Protector\u2019s office rejected the president\u2019s claims and ordered him to reimburse the state. Mr. Zuma refused, leading the nation\u2019s highest court to rule that he had acted unconstitutionally by disregarding the Public Protector.\n\nMr. Zuma eventually paid the government the $650,000 \u2014 about 7.8 million rand \u2014 but his intransigence led to further legal problems.\n\nThe nation\u2019s highest court ruled in December that the A.N.C.-dominated Parliament had not properly investigated Mr. Zuma\u2019s conduct in the Nkandla case when it defeated an opposition-led effort to impeach him in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe court ordered lawmakers to create rules to regulate a president\u2019s impeachment, raising the possibility that a sitting Mr. Zuma would have faced proceedings this year.\n\nThe Nkandla affair turned many loyal voters against the A.N.C. in local elections in 2016. For the first time, many urban middle-class black voters stayed home or jumped to the opposition at the ballot box, as the party lost control over the nation\u2019s biggest cities.\n\nEven with their rural strongholds, A.N.C. leaders worried that the party might garner less than half the vote in national elections in 2019, forcing it to take on a coalition partner to govern, or lose power outright.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be relegated to a rural party,\u201d Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C.\u2019s national chairman, said during the election for party leader in December. \u201cWe want to regain the metros and be a strong A.N.C.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mantashe is an ally of Mr. Ramaphosa, who is backed by business and whose core supporters include educated, middle-class black South Africans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Zuma probably realized the end was near when Mr. Ramaphosa defeated Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Mr. Zuma\u2019s preferred candidate and his former wife, in the election in December. As the results were announced in a large convention hall in Johannesburg, Mr. Zuma, famous for his joviality and charisma before crowds, sat stone-faced and bit his lips.\n\nIt took less than two months for Mr. Ramaphosa and his allies to win over fence-sitters and recalcitrant members of the Zuma camp. For all of Mr. Zuma\u2019s skills as a strategist, he was a lame-duck leader battling the future as embodied in Mr. Ramaphosa and the new leader\u2019s power over appointments and patronage.\n\nMr. Zuma was well acquainted with the dangers of what South Africans call the two centers of power: the year and a half during which the nation and the all-powerful A.N.C. are headed by different people. After being elected A.N.C. leader in 2007, Mr. Zuma himself orchestrated the early exit of his rival Mr. Mbeki as South Africa\u2019s president.\n\nIn pressing Mr. Zuma to step down, Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s allies argued that the new leader should take over the government as soon as possible to rebuild the A.N.C.\u2019s reputation and brand before the 2019 elections. The longer Mr. Zuma remained in power, they said, the greater the risk of performing poorly next year.\n\nThe party that had always shielded Mr. Zuma agreed.", "title": "Jacob Zuma\u2019s Legacy Is a Weakened South Africa", "authors": ["Norimitsu Onishi"]}

As he talked about the coming program, Mr. d\u2019Amboise narrated bits of his career, which has included decades at City Ballet, where Balanchine created dozens of works for him. Hollywood beckoned \u2014 he appeared in films like \u201cCarousel\u201d and \u201cSeven Brides for Seven Brothers\u201d \u2014 but he always remained loyal to City Ballet and to Balanchine. While still a principal, in 1976, he created the National Dance Institute to engage children with dance, no matter their background or ability.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven when he was a student himself, Mr. d\u2019Amboise was quick to recognize talent. He recalled when he first met Mr. Villella at the School of American Ballet in the 1940s. \u201cThere were only two or three boys at S.A.B. \u2014 Eddie and me and another boy,\u201d he said. \u201cEddie was terrific.

Several staff members told The New York Times last year that they were sexually harassed and groped by Mr. Friedman and high-profile guests at some of their other restaurants, and that Ms. Bloomfield didn\u2019t do enough to stop those abuses.\n\nA committee of 18 food writers, editors and producers is charged with sifting through 23,000 nominations \u2014 from regional judges, restaurants and the public \u2014 to create the semifinal list. In a sometimes contentious meeting in Honolulu last month, they grappled with how best to apply the foundation\u2019s new standards for personal and corporate behavior. Because members signed nondisclosure agreements, they would not publicly discuss why certain restaurants did or did not make the list.\n\n\u201cObviously, the names in these categories are presented without context, but we hope that they reflect the foundation\u2019s desire to present awards that will more accurately represent the nation\u2019s true wealth of culinary talent,\u201d Mr. Addison said.\n\nIt has been a challenging year for the Beard Foundation, which welcomes Clare Reichenbach, its first new chief executive in 11 years, on Tuesday.

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "One surprising place we can find counter-narratives of what women want and desire is in at least two of the movies that Clint Eastwood has directed. In one of his earlier films as a director, \u201cSudden Impact,\u201d Harry Callahan, yes, the infamous Dirty Harry, ends up on the trail of what seems to be a serial murderer, Jennifer Spencer, who is systematically murdering all of the men, and indeed one woman, who raped her and her sister in the small town of San Paolo, Calif.\n\nSpencer is a painter who has returned to San Paolo with these murders as a goal. Her excuse for being there is to paint hobby horses, a famous symbol of the penis, on the merry-go-round in the amusement park in which she was raped. Her sister is institutionalized and has not spoken since having been raped multiple times. Harry Callahan becomes romantically involved with her and sees the anguish in her paintings. Her killings are premeditated. She shoots her victims in the scrotum, watches them suffer, and then she shoots them in the head. It\u2019s a Dirty Harry movie so, yes, Harry comes out of the midst to save the day when she is embattled with the last murder.\n\nHarry takes out the last rapist and is about to read Jennifer Spencer her rights, but she interrupts with the following speech: \u201cRead me my rights? What exactly are my rights? Where was all this concern for my rights when I was being beaten and mauled? And what about my sister\u2019s rights when she was being brutalized? There is a thing called justice. And was it justice that they should all just walk away? You\u2019d never understand, Callahan.\u201d\n\nHarry makes a decision knowing that the last rapist\u2019s fingerprints are on the gun that killed him. He hands the gun to another officer and simply says, \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d and walks away with Jennifer Spencer. Is Eastwood showing us that if there is no justice for women, then they cannot be judged by Man\u2019s law? Watch the movie. I started with \u201cSudden Impact\u201d because we are dealing now with men who are violent sexual harassers, indeed some who are accused of rape.\n\nIn \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County,\u201d Eastwood redoes a popular novel by focusing on how the two children of Francesca Johnson, played by Meryl Streep, take up the search for the woman in the mother by reading the diaries she had left behind for them. The diaries tell of her four-day affair when her children and husband were gone to the state fair. The dairies tell a sexually explicit story. The film is shot from the perspective of Francesca Johnson and we watch her joyously embracing her own eroticism, and indeed lust, for Robert Kincaid.\n\nWe know how heterosexual sex is often shot in Hollywood movies. The man picks the woman up, throws her against the wall, penetrates her, and we see ecstasy on her face in about 10 seconds \u2014 same formula used in pornography. In \u201cBridges,\u201d the couple dance in the kitchen in what some women see as one of the most sensual and erotic scenes ever shot in Hollywood. Then there is the fade-out into the bedroom, which is deliberately kept blurry.\n\nFrancesca is a woman in her late 40s, not a teenybopper with redone boobs. So, do we need to lose Eros if we are to treat women as full persons with equality? Clearly not. The two are reunited in death as both have their ashes thrown off the bridge where their romance begins. The narrative in the movies that Eastwood directs follows men, and, yes, we are talking about straight white men here, as they move from conventional sexism to being shaken by a woman who testifies to that sexism, to having the courage \u2014 and yes it does take courage \u2014 to see women as full persons and to treating them with the respect that they deserve.", "title": "Opinion | James Bond Is a Wimp", "authors": []}

The woman, Maggie Ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets James, a married poet, at a conference. They spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. The affair culminates in a single, searing night together in Chicago, after which they part for good. In the unsent letters she writes to James during this embargo, Maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. In one such letter, she admires the Buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, \u201cWhat relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs.\u201d Her antagonist is time \u2014 so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.\n\nThe novel dips back through time to track life before the affair. The mores of the Ellmanns\u2019 lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel\u2019s touchstones \u2014 weddings, baptisms, the death of pets. But the way this slim book condenses these happenings in the context of the affair gives them poetry. Lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: \u201cParent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. Organelles. Passive versus active transport.\u201d Quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. Maggie\u2019s little daughter mispronounces \u201cnail polish\u201d as \u201cpale nolish\u201d; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father\u2019s old T-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. But over the years, \u201cinvasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. The backyard steadily shrinks.\u201d Even before she meets James, Maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self \u2014 \u201cthis nothing.\u201d This nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. Middle age looms. The children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. In other words, Maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. Enter James. She first becomes aware of him through reading his poetry, which she admires. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to write to him,\u201d she announces to her husband, Thomas.\n\nPhoto\n\nPoor Thomas. He surely has his side of the story, but we don\u2019t get it here. Instead we are told: \u201cThomas is, in fact, a good husband.\u201d Syntactically, the sentence says so much. The fact of the husband\u2019s goodness becomes a sidebar. Maggie is aware of, but helpless against, the greed for more love, when she already has more than most. The marriage has its problems, but the biggest one is its earthly limitations, the waning of interest and desire \u2014 its mortality. Only if a person were \u201cmarried to God\u201d would she or he have a partner who would never suffer from overfamiliarity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGod is crucial to \u201cFire Sermon.\u201d Quatro\u2019s protagonist is genuinely at a loss over the contradictions of her specifically Christian body, one that is both devout and also full of appetite. (The themes here re-tread precisely those of her hugely original collection of stories, \u201cI Want to Show You More,\u201d from 2013.) Maggie genuinely cannot understand how to religiously interpret her adultery. She is full of guilt, but also suspects that she uses \u201cguilt as fuel, guilt as food, guilt as energy.\u201d In the next breath she wonders why she can\u2019t just give in to her desires if God has already granted \u201ceternal forgiveness from before all time.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know whether to believe the pastor at her parents\u2019 church, who says: \u201cGod wants your holiness, not your happiness. \u2026 All of history \u2026 is one long terrible story of men and women trying to make themselves happy.\u201d", "title": "Jamie Quatro\u2019s First Novel Centers on Religious and Sexual Passion", "authors": ["Amity Gaige", "Jamie Quatro"]}

Perhaps it was a matter of choice, of not wanting or needing the ego shot of marquee-goddess stature, though her high cheekbones and lynx\u2019s eyes endowed her with the appropriate appearance.

During the Korean War in 1950-53, it served as a major operating platform for United States forces fighting in support of South Korea: American soldiers who had been maintained in Japan after World War II were quickly sent to the Korean Peninsula, and American battleships, aircraft carriers, fighter jets and bombers operated from bases in Japan. Should conflict break out in South Korea today, the United States could, and presumably would, come to its ally\u2019s help by using once again its main footholds in Japan, including its air force base in Yokota, naval base in Sasebo and Marine air station in Futenma.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Japanese government stands ready to support American military operations that would be deployed in the event of a conflict. In 1997, the United States and Japan agreed that Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Force would provide noncombat assistance to United States troops \u201cin situations in areas surrounding Japan\u201d \u2014 a code phrase, in part, for the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOver the years, United States-Japan cooperation for the defense of South Korea became so close that some specialists said it created a \u201cvirtual alliance\u201d among the three countries, and have credited it with deterring war in East Asia despite North Korea\u2019s steady pursuit of nuclear weapons and regular flare-ups and crises, such as in early 2003 and 2009.\n\nJapan\u2019s commitment to South Korea has only been strengthened since, bolstered by Mr. Abe\u2019s return to power as prime minister in 2012. For all his nationalistic bluster, Mr. Abe\u2019s hawkishness has served South Korea\u2019s defense interests well.\n\nIn 2014, the Japanese government reinterpreted the Constitution to allow Japan to use force \u2014 under limited conditions \u2014 to defend itself or its allies, including the United States and South Korea. The legislature passed security legislation in 2015 authorizing Japanese forces to provide combat support to United States troops that might fight in the waters or air space around the Korean Peninsula. If necessary, they may, for example, shoot down a North Korean ballistic missile aimed at Guam or Hawaii, conduct anti-submarine operations to protect American naval forces or clear mines in waters near North Korea ahead of United States amphibious operations.\n\nIn other words, Japan\u2019s participation in the defense of South Korea is consequential.\n\nAnd yet it has largely been downplayed, if not deliberately ignored \u2014 mostly, again, for pragmatic reasons.\n\nThe idea of defending South Korea isn\u2019t very popular in Japan, especially among people who identify as liberal pacifists. Some Japanese are wary of seeing their country dragged into someone else\u2019s war or cannot fathom having to sacrifice for South Koreans who keep criticizing Japan for its historical record.\n\nSome South Koreans, for their part, are uncomfortable about receiving security support from a government that once colonized them. Many South Korean journalists and academics I have spoken to over the years gladly acknowledge the importance of America\u2019s security commitment, but regard any such contribution by Japan as suspect \u2014 or even, as one legislator has said, as an attempt to \u201cseize hegemony in East Asia.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Japan and South Korea, the Friendly Foes of East Asia", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "The meaning of Smile Japan has evolved since it was first coined in February 2013, by a Canadian in the Tatra Mountains of Slovakia.\n\nCarla MacLeod, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was a member of Japan\u2019s coaching staff during the 2014 Olympic qualifying tournament in Poprad. The Japanese team had just finished breakfast before its opening game against Norway when MacLeod felt a nervous energy permeating the room. MacLeod watched as a thick, fluffy snow fell and ordered the team to put on their outerwear. Outside, MacLeod engaged the entire team in a snowball fight, melting away their nerves.\n\n\u201cI could see the Norwegian players standing at their windows looking at us like, \u2018What is going on there?\u2019\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cI pulled them in and said: \u2018This is how we have to play. Because when you play with a smile, you play your best hockey.\u2019 Then before every game, when I fist-pumped them, I said, \u2018smile\u2019 and they would smile back at me.\u201d\n\nFrom that moment, the concept of Smile Japan became a rallying cry for Japanese women\u2019s hockey. The team\u2019s logo is now a red circular face \u2014 similar to the sun found on Japan\u2019s national flag \u2014 with a hockey stick forming a smile.\n\nAlmost every Japanese national team has a nickname. Japan\u2019s baseball team is Samurai Japan. The women\u2019s soccer team is Nadeshiko Japan, named after a flower that symbolizes beauty.\n\nBut some players on the women\u2019s hockey team worried Smile Japan presented the wrong message to audiences who did not understand its meaning and only associated the name with the images from the Olympics.\n\nAfter Japan scored its first goal of the 2014 tournament, the team\u2019s celebration of forming a circle and bowing instantly became an animated GIF. Canadian newspapers ran articles with headlines like \u201cJapan\u2019s team is just adorbs\u201d with polls asking \u201cHow cute is Japan\u2019s Olympic women\u2019s hockey team?\u201d The players were called \u201ca lovable underdog\u201d and \u201ckawaii\u201d \u2014 the Japanese term for cute \u2014 as if they were Hello Kitty characters, not world-class athletes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just we\u2019re happy to be here; we worked our butts off to be here and we\u2019re going to share this time with the people we got here with,\u201d said MacLeod, who was not retained after the 2014 Olympics. \u201cThe Smile Japan moniker, the name is incredibly powerful to me and what it stands for. It wasn\u2019t because they were these small petite women who were happy go lucky.\u201d\n\nMacLeod noted that even Canada, which has won the last four Olympic tournaments, takes photos on the ice during practices.\n\nPhoto\n\nAina Takeuchi, a defender on the 2014 Olympic team who played in the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League after the Sochi Olympics, said she was motivated to change the perception of Japanese players.\n\n\u201cI went to Calgary for three years so I have to show them even as a Japanese player, I can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter Sochi, each of us learned so many things, so now we have to show in Pyeongchang we are not the team that is always smiling.\u201d\n\nAs Japan attempts to shed labels, win its first Olympic game and qualify for the medal round, the team simultaneously feels pressure to grow women\u2019s hockey at home. South Korea and China are investing heavily in the sport, strengthening the competition in Asia. After the Sochi Games, interest in Smile Japan sharply declined. When Japanese sports papers did cover the team, the coverage often consisted of only photos of players, notably goaltender Nana Fujimoto.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 2014, only one player had competed in the Olympics. Almost two-thirds of this year\u2019s team will be carry-overs from Sochi.\n\nOne first-timer is Shoko Ono, 36, who played in three Olympic qualifying tournaments with the national team, falling short each time. She retired after 2010, resigned that Japan could not compete on the level of Olympic teams. Watching her former teammates qualify for the 2014 Games, though, reignited Ono\u2019s passion for hockey.

Instead of turning private feelings into bland public statements, he claimed public symbols for the realm of inwardness and private experience. Viewers were puzzled by his apparent lack of interest in communicating a higher truth in the usual sense.

Lukas Holzhausen is both tender and weary as a single parent whose teenage daughter suspects he is not her biological father. Anja Herden gets to survey a wide dramatic range, from a matriarch who must plead for her grandchild\u2019s return to the cynical, promiscuous neighbor in the most famous episode of \u201cThe Decalogue.\u201d As both a lawyer against capital punishment and a committed doctor who is forced to play God, Gabor Biedermann demonstrates how a practiced, professional demeanor cracks up in the face of moral uncertainty and outrage.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of Kieslowski\u2019s most admired traits as a filmmaker was his ability to translate his philosophical and dramatic ideas into stark images. In putting \u201cThe Decalogue\u201d on stage, one has to find equivalents for visual storytelling. Mr. Kimmig, a prolific German director, resists the urge to use video, concentrating the entire drama in the raw performances of the actors. Instead, he finds cinematic texture by fiddling with narrative structure.\n\nKieslowski\u2019s film is centered on a large social housing project. Over the long course of the series, there are many chance encounters: We gain new perspectives on stories we have already seen. In Mr. Kimmig\u2019s version, the characters from various episodes intrude on each other. Sometimes they take a seat downstage and spectate. At others, they interrupt to introduce a new tale. Each segment builds to a moment of ethical crisis, and so these narrative breaks, which become increasingly frenzied after the intermission, succeed in sustaining tension over the course of the whole performance. After the emotionally frantic, \u201cShort Cuts\u201d-like crisscrossing of the final half-hour, the energetic curtain call, with its numerous costume changes (to remind the audience who played whom) felt cathartic in itself.\n\nThe ethical conundrums of a building full of Poles would probably seem like small fry to those of the House of Atreus, whose famous family curse is being revisited next door in the Burgtheater\u2019s powerful all-female production of \u201cDie Orestie\u201d (\u201cThe Oresteia\u201d).

The trilogy\u2019s final chapter, \u201cThe Eumenides,\u201d can, in fact, be read as a parable for the establishment of the Athenian judicial system.\n\nBy assigning all the roles to a handful of actors, Mr. Nunes also highlights how the cycle of familial violence affects everyone \u2014 protagonists, chorus, gods and Furies. For the spectator as well, it is impossible to remain neutral or indifferent to the vicissitudes of this 2,500-year-old tragedy.\n\nWith soiled white garments, black boots and ratty blonde locks, their faces caked in white paint, the actresses look like a chorus of the undead.

Where are our simple pleasures now, it asks without asking? Why has everything become so complicated? Why is life filled with so many things we don\u2019t want and so few things we do?\n\nBut \u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019Clock Somewhere\u201d \u2014 a song he didn\u2019t write but recorded with Alan Jackson and took out on tour \u2014 man, that one\u2019s the real heartbreaker. Take away the jaunty island beat and you\u2019ll find a song about a man who is so miserable that he can\u2019t bring himself to return to work from his lunch break. \u201cI\u2019m getting paid by the hour, and older by the minute,\u201d it goes. \u201cMy boss just pushed me over the limit.\u201d The guy hasn\u2019t taken a vacation day in a year. He knows that there will be consequences tomorrow, but he doesn\u2019t care. He can\u2019t face it for another afternoon. Just keep pouring those Hurricanes.\n\nHas any pop star identified this particular strain of existential crisis better than Mr. Buffett? Who has been such a dedicated balladeer of the T.G.I.F. class? Who has been such a folk hero of workaday boredom and 9 to 5 drudgery? The knowledge that if we allow ourselves to think hard enough about our lives we will realize that they are spent in service of making someone else rich while we merely scrape by? Mr. Buffett may be rich, but he wasn\u2019t always. He has grappled with dark thoughts about time and existence. He saw from the stage that we had, too. So he gave language to it: There has to be something more to this. There has to be a way to exist that isn\u2019t quite so compromised. The ocean is often so far away. But a T-shirt that says \u201cNo Shoes No Shirt No Problem?\u201d That you can take with you.\n\nYou know, he could be rewatching \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d like he wants to, enjoying it even more now that he can tell the characters apart. He could be watching \u201cNarcos,\u201d which he loves, and vaping all day. He could be flying from house to house and kayaking and surfing. He could never work another day in his life and still dive like Scrooge McDuck into a swimming pool full of money. He could splash his name across the marquee of the Marquis and never care for a second if the musical you got was something that felt real \u2014 that really delivered escape. This is America, and poor-quality licensed products are our birthright.\n\nBut Mr. Buffett won\u2019t give you that. He still remembers who got him here. He still shares the existential worry of how to spend a day. He protects your experience of the lifestyle he sells in a way that someone living that lifestyle should be incapable of. Look beyond the MAMA NEEDS SOME WINE sign in the Margaritaville gift shop. Look beyond the beer cozy that says \u201cFins to the left, fins to the right.\u201d This is no longer a business. This is a cause. Can you hear its anthem? You can hear the Parrotheads singing it from beneath their feathers; you can hear it in their hums.\n\nMr. Buffett arrived at the rehearsal space. He spotted Mr. Nolan and complimented him on his tan.", "title": "Jimmy Buffett Does Not Live the Jimmy Buffett Lifestyle", "authors": []}

I speak from experience here.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nAnd Colbert attacked Florida lawmakers for refusing to debate a gun control bill, even after students from Stoneman Douglas showed up at the legislative session.\n\n\u201cWith Parkland students watching from the gallery, State House members voted down a motion to debate an existing bill that would ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines.

He pointed out that Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has reportedly developed a close relationship with the White House.\n\n\u201cDevin Nunes somehow still is in charge of this Russia investigation in the House, in spite of the fact that he recused himself from the investigation after he got caught sneaking to the White House to share information with the people he was supposed to be investigating.

The company recently started a program to help franchisees expand their marketing efforts by hiring at-home parents and others who had not been in the labor force. The jobs are meant to appeal to people who might not be looking for traditional work: They do not require being at an office every day or having a traditional schedule. Mr. Mabry said that kind of flexibility made sense when filling full-time slots with experienced workers was harder than ever.\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to be pigeonholed into a particular r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a particular experience?\u201d Mr. Mabry said of his recruitment approach. \u201cI\u2019m sure there is someone out there who can bring something different to the team. It\u2019s just having an open mind.\u201d\n\nMore companies are likely to adopt that kind of flexible approach as the labor market tightens. And there are other signs that companies are rethinking their approach to hiring. They are becoming more willing to consider candidates with criminal records, for example, or to waive educational requirements. The car retailer AutoNation said this week that it was no longer refusing to hire workers who tested positive for marijuana use \u2014 a sign of changing legal and societal norms, but also an indication that companies are rethinking hiring practices in a tight labor market.\n\n\u201cPeople who are marginally employable suddenly become highly employable in a period like this,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM, a financial consulting firm.\n\nThere were some notes of caution in Friday\u2019s report. The total number of hours worked \u2014 a measure that combines the number of jobs and the average hours worked on those jobs \u2014 fell slightly, a sign that demand for labor might not be as strong as the headline job-growth figures suggest. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans, a figure highlighted by Mr. Trump after it fell to its lowest recorded level in December, jumped nearly a full percentage point, to 7.7 percent. The unemployment rate for white Americans fell to 3.5 percent.\n\nBut despite such month-to-month fluctuations, economists say the tightening labor market is paying dividends to groups that were left behind by earlier stages of the recovery. Wages have risen most quickly in lower-paying industries in recent months, and employment gains have gone disproportionately to less-educated workers.\n\nCompanies including Walmart, Starbucks and Lowe\u2019s have also announced new benefits for hourly workers, such as paid time off to care for sick relatives and paid parental leave. And the number of Americans working part time because they can\u2019t find full-time work has fallen 15 percent in the past year.", "title": "Job and Wage Gains Deliver a Promising Start for the Year", "authors": []}

In his 10 years as the Yankees\u2019 manager, Girardi fastidiously protected his players from public criticism; one notable exception came last August when Girardi became exasperated with Sanchez\u2019s defensive shortcomings. He also tried to be as bland as possible in his daily meetings with the news media.\n\nBut Girardi, 53, also has aspirations of managing again and should be a prime candidate somewhere next season. Thus, there seems little point in publicly laying bare the shortcomings of a player you might soon be managing.\n\n\u201cWhen you hire somebody like Joe with the amount of success that he\u2019s had in the past, you know there\u2019s a very real possibility that at some point he may get back on the field, and we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d said Rob McGlarry, the MLB Network president.\n\nMcGlarry said that what made Girardi attractive for his network was not only his success with the Yankees, whom he led to the 2009 World Series title, but also that he has recently been in the dugout.\n\nStill, on the conference call a few hours before he was to make his on-air debut, Girardi delivered few insights.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the 1960s and early \u203270s, he was a special adviser to the secretary general of the Organization of American States, which fosters democracy and regional security. He also undertook assignments promoting American and Latin American film production for the Alliance for Progress, established by President John F. Kennedy.\n\nMr. Gavin was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1971 to 1973.\n\nHe was named ambassador to Mexico when Ronald Reagan, a like-minded conservative Republican who had also been president of the actors guild, entered the White House in 1981. Mr. Gavin had been active in Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign.\n\nAmid complaints from veteran diplomats that American embassies were still being turned over to financial backers and unqualified amateurs, the selection of an actor and friend of the president for one of the nation\u2019s most sensitive diplomatic posts was met with dismay in Mexico. Officials there sardonically jested about sending the comedian Cantinflas to Washington in retaliation.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Gavin was chiefly known in Mexico at the time as the tuxedoed spokesman for Bacardi rum in television commercials. He had some qualifications for the assignment, however. His mother was Mexican, he spoke fluent Spanish, he had extensive travel and business experience in Latin America and he had a degree in Latin American economic history from Stanford University.\n\nBut his tenure as ambassador in Mexico City, in charge of an embassy with more than 1,100 American and Mexican employees, became extremely contentious, despite a close relationship between President Reagan and President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo and his successor, Miguel de la Madrid.\n\nMr. Gavin pressed Mexico to limit the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigrants into the United States, and voiced Washington\u2019s belief that the revolutionary Sandinista government in Nicaragua posed dangers to the security of Mexico and Central America. Mexico was cool to many of Washington\u2019s concerns, even when Mr. Gavin relayed intelligence that implicated Mexican officials in corrupt activities.\n\nThe ambassador feuded regularly with the Mexican press. Journalists who tracked his movements called him an absentee envoy who had been out of Mexico for 142 of his first 438 days on the job, traveling frequently to Los Angeles. Mr. Gavin insisted that his trips were work-related.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Gavin was denounced by Mexican business and labor leaders, politicians and academics after he appeared in a 1982 ABC television special, \u201cMexico: Times of Crisis,\u201d in which he spoke of fears that Central America\u2019s economic and political troubles could \u201cspill over\u201d into Mexico. President L\u00f3pez Portillo did not comment, but there were wide demands for Mr. Gavin to resign or be declared persona non grata.\n\nIn 1984, after Mr. Gavin had a casual lunch with leaders of the opposition National Action Party, the head of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had long controlled political life in Mexico, accused him of interfering in Mexican politics and of insensitivity to Mexican traditions.\n\nAnd Mr. Gavin sometimes put his foot in his mouth. In 1985, after earthquakes toppled buildings and killed thousands in Mexico, he told reporters \u201cwe have been extremely fortunate\u201d that more Americans had not been killed or injured, a circumstance he explained by saying, \u201cThe types of hotels that fell down were not the types normally frequented by citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Gavin quietly resigned in 1986 and went on to a successful business career. In retrospect, American business executives gave him high marks for fostering trade, and he was credited with helping Mexican businesses obtain foreign loans as the economy worsened.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was born Juan Vincent Apablasa in Los Angeles on April 8, 1931, to Juan Apablasa and Delia Diana Pablos. His father was of Chilean descent, and his mother was from an influential family in Sonora, Mexico. His parents divorced when he was a young child; his mother later married Herald Golenor, who adopted him and changed his name to John Anthony Golenor. He attended St. John\u2019s Military Academy in Los Angeles and Villanova Preparatory School in Ojai, and graduated from Stanford in 1952.\n\nIn the Navy over the next three years, he served as an intelligence officer aboard the aircraft carrier Princeton in the Korean War theater and was an aide to Adm. Milton E. Miles in the Panama Canal Zone.\n\nAfter his ambassadorship, Mr. Gavin joined the Atlantic Richfield Company as a public relations executive. In 1987 he became president of Univisa Satellite Communications, which at the time was the parent of the Spanish-language television network Univision. He later became a director of various capital investment and financial consulting companies.\n\nHe married the actress Cicely Evans in 1957. They had two children, Cristina and Maria, and were divorced in 1965. He had been married to Ms. Towers since 1974. She had two children from a previous marriage, Michael and Maureen McGrath.\n\nBesides Ms. Towers, his survivors include his children and stepchildren and several grandchildren.", "title": "John Gavin, Actor and Ambassador to Mexico Under Reagan, Dies at 86", "authors": ["Robert D.

That same year he appeared in Mr. Mamet\u2019s \u201cThe Water Engine.\u201d One of his fellow cast members happened to be John Malkovich, then an unknown actor, who invited him to join the fledgling Steppenwolf Theater Company, founded in 1974.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mahoney appeared in dozens of Steppenwolf productions, including \u201cOf Mice and Men,\u201d \u201cBorn Yesterday,\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Came to Dinner\u201d and \u201cThe Dresser.\u201d One production, \u201cOrphans,\u201d transferred to New York in 1985, and Mr. Mahoney found himself with a Theater World Award for his performance as a mobster kidnapped by small-time criminals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA year later he was starring at Lincoln Center, alongside Stockard Channing, Christopher Walken, Ben Stiller and Swoosie Kurtz, in \u201cThe House of Blue Leaves.\u201d\n\nHe returned to Broadway only once, in 2007. He played the frail character, known only as Old Man, who magically trades bodies with a healthy young woman in a revival of Craig Lucas\u2019s \u201cPrelude to a Kiss.\u201d\n\nMr. Mahoney never married. He told one interviewer that his love of theater was his family substitute \u2014 and another that he would never consider a romantic relationship after dealing with serious medical problems.\n\nHe is survived by a sister, Rita Sullivan.\n\nMr. Mahoney appeared in some 30 films, beginning in 1981 with \u201cHudson Taylor,\u201d a religious drama about a British missionary.

The Swedes packed the second end with exquisite shotmaking, and when John Shuster misfired on a double takeout with his last stone of the end, Nik Edin took advantage, scoring two for Sweden. Edin is widely regarded as the best skip in the world for a reason. Opponents pay for making mistakes against him.\n\nAlso, Ivanka Trump is here with a swarm of secret service personnel.\n\nDevin Heroux: Edin learned how to curl by watching past Canadian curling championship games on VHS tapes while growing up in Sweden. In fact, his favorite curler to watch was Kevin Martin. He studied his strategy and learned the game by watching tapes over and over.\n\nEdin moved his team to Canada two years ago for a year to practice in the curling-crazed nation and compete against the top teams there.

A huge emphasis, she said, has been developing strategies to help them execute in pressure situations.

This is how precise the game has become. But a slight error by Edin on his last rock allowed Shuster a tough double takeout and he threw his rock perfectly to score two.\n\nSweden likes low-scoring battles. They wait for their opponents to crack. The USA has hung tough with teams throughout this Olympic competition. We\u2019ll see how Shuster and his team handle the added pressure of this game, though. Sweden is the top-ranked team in the world right now. USA has the ability to play a simple style of curling but can also complicate the game and draw opponents into making mistakes. Many curlers in the game say Shuster has the ability to single-handedly win a curling game because of his shotmaking brilliance.

Whoa!\u201d This is the soundtrack being provided at the moment by the Americans, who are putting all sorts of pressure on the Swedes.

Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year.\n\nSome context\n\nHigher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year\u2019s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies.\n\nLong Blockchain is back in the news\n\nRemember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies?\n\nWell, new developments have come up:\n\n\u2022 Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik.\n\n\u2022 It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company\u2019s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business\u2019 board.\n\n\u2022 And last week, Nasdaq informed Long Blockchain that it planned to delist the company because its stock price had traded too low.

Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed curtailing the use of cash bail in many low-level cases as the centerpiece of a package of criminal justice legislative fixes.\n\nAt the same time, district attorneys in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Westchester County have all announced that they will no longer ask for cash bail in many misdemeanor cases. In April, Jonathan Lippman, the state\u2019s former chief judge, called for bail reform, noting in a broad report on the state\u2019s criminal justice system that judges and prosecutors rarely consider a defendant\u2019s financial situation when requesting or imposing bail.\n\nThe purpose of bail is to ensure that defendants return to court to answer charges against them and, in part, to ensure public safety. But relying heavily on cash bail often leads to what Ms. Lieberman called a \u201ctwo-tiered system of justice\u201d in which wealthy people can pay their way out of custody while the poor remain locked up before they can even contest the accusations against them.\n\nThe collateral effects can be devastating and include losing jobs, housing, even the custody of children.

The court gave the Republican-dominated legislature three weeks to draw a new House map, adding that it would take over the map-drawing if the lawmakers could not reach agreement on new boundaries with the state\u2019s Democratic governor.\n\nEven after the United States Supreme Court rejected the legislature\u2019s plea to intervene on Feb. 5, Republicans have refused to completely accept the state court\u2019s decision. The president of the State Senate, Joe Scarnati, first raised eyebrows by stating that he would not comply with the court\u2019s order to turn over any data used in drawing the House maps.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Chicago was shocked. To be rejected by the art world was a refutation of her identity. She\u2019d studied art since she was 5 years old, and had been one of the few women to gain recognition in the 1960s L.A. art scene. For her, \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d was the culmination of a process of radical self-transformation. She retreated to her modest studio in a small town outside San Francisco, $30,000 in debt from loans she\u2019d taken out to pay for the work\u2019s completion, and spent the rest of the summer alone. \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d was taken apart, boxed up and put into storage.\n\nFor years, the gulf between popular adulation and critical dismissal of \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d persisted. Over the next two decades, it was largely ignored by American art institutions. (An exception was the Brooklyn Museum, which showed it in 1980, prompting a nasty review in The New York Times by Hilton Kramer, who plainly disdained the work\u2019s vaginal imagery.) But thanks to the strenuous efforts of Diane Gelon, who had been the project coordinator on \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d it was shown all over the country in alternative venues \u2014 the top floor of an office building in Chicago, the Cyclorama in Boston \u2014 and supported by donors, from the Rockefellers to women who sent Chicago five dollars because they thought the work was revolutionary. Slowly, \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d was reinscribed into art history. In 2002, when it was acquired and again shown at the Brooklyn Museum, Roberta Smith, an art critic for The Times, pithily summarized its jagged reception. \u201cCall it what you will: kitsch, pornography, artifact, feminist propaganda or a major work of 20th-century art,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much difference. \u2018The Dinner Party\u2019 \u2026 is important.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen I first saw \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d several years ago, I regarded it with a mixture of reverence and suspicion. I had somehow absorbed two contradictory ideas about it \u2014 that it was major and that it was kitsch. Its symbolism had come to supersede its status as a made thing, the product of a particular brain. Standing next to it alongside its creator, the plates glinted with a new meaning. It was a repository of women\u2019s history, but it was also an archive of Chicago\u2019s evolution as an artist.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI started to imagine how different the fate of \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d would have been if it had been shown for the first time in 2018. The opening with Solange and Patti Smith and Oprah and maybe even Hillary Clinton in attendance; the scores of Instagram posts \u2014 loving shots of the plates accompanied by hashtags: #JudyChicago, #Vaginachina, #Herstory \u2014 the winking references to it during fashion week. The work\u2019s populism, I suspect, would have been instantly embraced by artists and thinkers; no critic would have dared to dismiss it out of hand, though the small number of women of color included in the work might have prompted a heated discussion on social media of an alternative canon of names who could have been listed on the floor. It would have penetrated the culture so deeply that it would have been impossible to reject.\n\nThe audacity of \u201cThe Dinner Party,\u201d its rhetorical energy, its humor (the vulva plates are, among other things, a play on what it might be like if women took as much pride in their anatomy as men did) would be obvious to us now. Chicago anticipated this generation\u2019s style of feminism \u2014 pugilistic, sincere, frank and unapologetically grandiose. Her investigation of \u201cdomestic\u201d forms was also prescient: Artists as different as Swoon, Cindy Sherman and Emma Sulkowicz are indebted to her. Her vision reached beyond the art world as well: She saw how identity could be the locus of larger structural change, how the fury women felt at being left out could be channeled to dismantle the fortified institutions men have built to retain their control. She anticipated the very question at the core of the #MeToo movement: What would the world look like if women held power?\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Chicago seems doomed to a lonely clairvoyance. Of course, she doesn\u2019t mind that her nearly-60-year career is finally being considered as a whole \u2014 she has upcoming or current shows at the Brooklyn Museum, Salon 94 in New York, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D. C. For a long time, she has chosen to work outside familiar methods and institutions \u2014 a path that promised little recognition or attention. She has always taken the long view. Now she has posterity in mind: What will happen to her work once she\u2019s gone?\n\nJUDY CHICAGO WAS born Judy Cohen to a progressive Jewish family in Chicago in 1939. Her mother was a former dancer and medical secretary, and her father was a labor organizer who adored his daughter and encouraged her precocity. The house was often full of friends debating books and Marxism, and Chicago was invited to participate. As she writes in \u201cThrough the Flower: My Struggle as a Woman Artist,\u201d the first volume of her wonderfully earnest 1975 autobiography, her father instilled in her a lasting sense that she was a match for any interlocutor. Throughout her childhood, she spent Saturdays at the Art Institute of Chicago, taking figure drawing and painting classes, and then wandering through the museum alone, studying Seurat, Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec. When Chicago was 13, her father died suddenly \u2014 the great loss of her life.\n\nIn 1957, she enrolled as an undergraduate at U.C.L.A., eventually earning a master\u2019s in painting and sculpture. Through her roommate, she met her first husband Jerry Gerowitz, a rebellious free spirit who was killed in a car accident. At 23, she was a widow, and one of the few women to participate in the burgeoning scene around the Ferus Gallery, a locus of West Coast cool whose artists included Edward Kienholz, Robert Irwin, Ed Moses and Ken Price. This storefront on La Cienega Boulevard represented an irreverent hyper-masculinity. (A 1959 photograph showed four Ferus artists draped over a motorcycle.) Chicago would join \u201cthe boys\u201d at the bar where they jousted with one another, teased her and talked about cars and their \u201cjoints.\u201d She often went home and cried, but told herself to suck it up. This was the world she wanted to be part of.\n\nVideo\n\nTo fit in, Chicago cultivated her own brand of machismo, shearing her hair, wearing big boots and smoking cigars. She moved away from the biomorphic, feminine imagery that her graduate school professors had ridiculed, and pushed herself to do work that was increasingly abstract and technically difficult. She went to autobody school to learn to spray-paint, making a series of four pastel-colored paintings on car hoods; she created an enormous fiberglass sculpture modeled on freeway pillars and environmental sculptures she called \u201cAtmospheres,\u201d setting off flares of colored smoke in the desert, in the mountains and on the beach.\n\nOne day, Walter Hopps, an owner of Ferus, visited the Pasadena studio Chicago shared with her second husband, Lloyd Hamrol. Her 1965 sculpture \u201cRainbow Pickett,\u201d a series of brightly colored wooden beams, each progressively larger in size, leaned against the wall. Rather than look at the work, Hopps literally turned his back on it and started talking with Hamrol and another male artist. (In 1966, it was included in \u201cPrimary Structures,\u201d a major Minimalist show at the Jewish Museum.) Years later, she ran into Hopps and he explained that he\u2019d been paralyzed by the fact that her work was better than that of the men in her circle, and he didn\u2019t know how to respond. She was demoralized and increasingly angry. She hated being ignored by critics. She hated constantly being told her ambition made her a bitch and a dyke and that women couldn\u2019t be artists.\n\nPhoto\n\nThese experiences of misogyny radicalized her, a stance that was reinforced by literature from the women\u2019s movement that was reaching the West Coast \u2014 Valerie Solanas\u2019s \u201cSCUM Manifesto\u201d (1967), Kate Millet\u2019s \u201cSexual Politics\u201d (1970) and Shulamith Firestone\u2019s \u201cThe Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution\u201d (1970). \u201cIf these women could say how they felt,\u201d she writes in \u201cThrough the Flower,\u201d \u201cso could I.\u201d Rather than distort her ideas to suit the male-dominated art world, she wanted to invent a new art world, and a new way of being in it. In 1970, she decided to divest herself of her married name. Together with Jack Glenn, the owner of a local gallery, she created an announcement of a solo show that was a spoof on the brawny posters of the Ferus boys. She posed in a boxing ring \u2014 one where Muhammad Ali had once trained \u2014 wearing work boots, satin shorts and a sweatshirt emblazoned with her chosen name: Judy Chicago. In the ad, Glenn crouches in the background, a skulking manager, and her friend\u2019s girlfriend, who was pulled into the shoot at the last minute, poses alongside her. Chicago\u2019s expression is confrontational and cocksure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer paintings from this period, however, tell a different story. They suggest she was struggling, frightened, trying to invent an image-language that reflected her vulnerability and the bruises she\u2019d sustained trying to wedge her work into the rigid strictures of the art world. She asked herself the question, \u201cHow do you fit a soft shape into a hard framework?\u201d and made a series of paintings that tried to answer it. Her painting \u201cFlesh Gate I\u201d from 1972 has a repetitive grid structure painted in gentle oranges and pinks; inside each cell is a dark opening that seems to pulse or beckon. In another series from the same period called \u201cFresno Fans,\u201d pinks and yellows fade and flicker. The paintings are tense and luminous, forceful and delicate. You can feel Chicago breaking out of the cage of abstraction, teaching herself to become the artist who could make work that was declarative and explicit.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nChicago began immersing herself in art made by women, reading literature (Jane Austen, George Eliot, Virginia Woolf and others) and studying generations of female artists (from Judith Leyster to Mary Cassatt to Barbara Hepworth), trying to locate in their work an iconography that reflected the female body and its particular sensations. She painted round forms, shapes that opened and closed and seemed to pulsate or wriggle. She became a teacher of studio classes on feminist art, the first of their kind, at Fresno State College and then at CalArts in Valencia. She pushed her students to create work based on consciousness-raising sessions in which they investigated their experiences as women, including being harassed by men.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, along with Dextra Frankel, a curator and professor of art at California State University, Fullerton and Miriam Schapiro, a painter whose work was a model for Chicago\u2019s, she toured the West Coast to find pieces for a women\u2019s art show. Many of the artists they encountered were self-taught, working in cramped spaces in their bedrooms, on porches, or in the back rooms of studios belonging to male friends or partners. Chicago was struck by the way their art-making was tucked between laundry and cooking, their work displayed among toys and family curios. Some of it was excellent \u2014 like the paintings of a woman who worked on scraps of her husband\u2019s canvas \u2014 but Chicago had to overcome her own snobbery to really begin to see it. Her idea of what it meant to be an artist was changing: It was no longer being alone, making large paintings in a studio; it could be something more improvisatory and intimate.\n\nDuring this time, her New York contemporaries, feminist artists like the sculptor Lynda Benglis (famous for her nude 1974 Artforum ad \u2014 inspired by Chicago \u2014 in which she posed with a dildo) or Judith Bernstein (who outraged critics and gallery-goers alike with her large-scale phallic drawings) were establishing themselves as deliberate provocateurs: Their goal was to make men uncomfortable. Chicago was more interested in how feminism could be cultivated within a community. Frustrated by the lack of cohesion among feminist artists, she began to seek a way to create it herself. That, as well as the idea of taking work made at a small scale and enlarging it, of mingling the domestic and the personal, became the basis of an installation, \u201cWomanhouse\u201d (1972), that Chicago and Schapiro undertook with local artists and students at CalArts. (This predated the first all-female cooperative gallery \u2014 New York\u2019s A.I.R., which counted Bernstein among its members \u2014 by about eight months.)\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWomen had embedded in houses for centuries and had quilted, sewed, baked, cooked, decorated and nested their creative energies away,\u201d Chicago wrote in \u201cThrough the Flower.\u201d \u201cWhat would happen, we wondered, if women took those same homemaking activities and carried them to fantasy proportions?\u201d Along with 21 of their students, Schapiro and Chicago renovated a dilapidated 17-room mansion in Hollywood, turning each room into a sculptural environment \u2014 Chicago\u2019s contribution was the \u201cMenstruation Bathroom,\u201d a pristine white-tiled space with a garbage can overflowing with bloody tampons. The living room became the site of performance pieces in which the women enacted births, or engaged in mundane domestic tasks like ironing. Ten thousand people came to see it during its one-month run.\n\nChicago was becoming convinced that in order for her work to be seen and understood, she would have to create an alternative canon, placing herself in a lineage of powerful women. In 1972, she began a series of biographical portraits called the \u201cGreat Ladies,\u201d dedicated to historical queens: Marie Antoinette, Catherine the Great, Queen Victoria. They were still abstract: spirals of undulating lines radiating from a taut center, painted in subtly graded pinks, yellows and blues that seemed almost to breathe. She told an interviewer that she \u201ctried to make my form-language and color reveal something really specific about a particular woman in history, like the quality of opening and blockage and stopping, the whole quality of a personality.\u201d Eventually, to make her meaning even clearer, she began to write on her paintings, documenting her fears, her methods, her daily experiences, in a cursive that is touchingly neat and girlish. (\u201cI put my finger in my pants and up my vagina, pulling out a bit of leftover menstrual blood,\u201d she wrote on a 1973 painting called \u201cThe Liberation of the Great Ladies.\u201d) The writing unleashed in her a sense of freedom. She began to study the craft of china painting (the decoration and glazing of porcelain) and to wrestle it into the realm of high art with \u201cThe Dinner Party.\u201d Chicago had to unlearn everything she knew in order to teach herself how to make something so bizarre and original.", "title": "Judy Chicago, the Godmother", "authors": ["Sasha Weiss"]}

She was having a bad day and I told her we could postpone if she wasn\u2019t in the mood, but she decided to rally. We established some code words: one as a warning and another to call the whole thing off.\n\nWalking to the bar that night to meet my own girlfriend, I was nervous. I had freaked out over what to wear. Choosing a bar stool felt as fraught with possibilities and drawbacks as an opening chess move. In the end I settled on a stool two away from a guy at the end of the bar, leaving my girlfriend the choice to sit beside either him or me. I took out the book I had brought, Nabokov\u2019s \u201cPale Fire\u201d (whose narrator is also pretending to be someone else), and waited.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she arrived, she wounded me by taking the stool next to the other guy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take the one next to you,\u201d she later said. \u201cThat would have been too easy.\u201d She said she had even considered sitting on the other side of the bar from me, making eyes at me from there.\n\nI have no idea how to pick someone up on the other side of a bar and would certainly have failed and disgraced myself.\n\nIt\u2019s relevant to mention here that my girlfriend is, um, voluptuous. She tired long ago of men staring at her cleavage and now dresses in severe black clothing with high necklines and austere copper accessories that look like machine parts or totemic objects. So when she slid onto her stool in a tight sleeveless shirt that clung to her breasts and bared her midriff it had roughly the same warm, disorienting effect on me of half a Dilaudid, chewed. Her skirt, with an angled hemline that showed off her thighs, only added to the feeling.\n\nShe took a book out of her purse and opened it \u2014 also \u201cPale Fire\u201d (we were reading it together as a winter project). The other guy was also reading a book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end-of-the-bar book club,\u201d I said as an opening gambit.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Other Guy said. \u201cDid you know you two are reading the same book?\u201d\n\nWe both feigned surprise, and the three of us got into a conversation. Other Guy\u2019s book was a collection of essays that sounded pretty good. Alarmingly, he turned out to be smart and well read, because of course New York is full of smart, well-read people vying, with their formidable educations and charm, for mates.\n\nHe was a lawyer, and not even a boring lawyer but one who did something interesting and cool. It seemed to me that my girlfriend was talking with him more than me. It began to seem as if Other Guy might be doing better with her than I was, and that it was by no means a foregone conclusion that I would win her.\n\nI had begun to both like and feel sorry for this guy (since he had no idea he was a supporting player in our private game and, I hoped, had no actual chance with her), but also to hate him and want to best him in combat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy girlfriend and I had once seen two male Canada geese fighting over a female goose, squawking furiously and beating the water with their wings and grappling at each other\u2019s snaking throats with their bills. Because (no offense) all geese look pretty much alike, it was hard to say which goose won, the attacker or the defender, but I knew that I wanted to be the goose that ended up with the girl, not the one who flew off honking in ignominious defeat.\n\nThank God the guy\u2019s wife eventually showed up, with a colleague of hers. They were both writers for a TV show they assured us we had never seen, who got together every Tuesday night to watch the new episode. They were all interesting people; we liked them. But we also couldn\u2019t break character.\n\nWe had felt self-conscious and uncertain about this plan to start out with, but now that our private game had become an uncontrolled experiment, involving other people, we were committed. It had gotten real.\n\nHaving to maintain our pose of being strangers in front of a third party also forced us to reintroduce ourselves \u2014 to ask each other, \u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d and \u201cWhat neighborhood do you live in?\u201d And we had to try to answer without being boring, and to listen to each other\u2019s answers anew.\n\nMy girlfriend said later that she was sure she would have dropped the act 15 minutes in if not for the presence of these strangers. It also kept our role play tethered to reality; she was forced to be more realistically flirtatious, treating me like a stranger at a bar, with some wariness and respectability, instead of just inviting me back to her place after one drink or having sex with me in the bathroom.\n\nJust before our three new friends left, the lawyer gave us each his card and said, \u201cI\u2019m here every Tuesday, if you want to keep our book club going.\u201d\n\nI thought he gave me a collegial-guy look of \u201cGood luck\u201d or \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, I asked my girlfriend if she would let me pay for our drinks.

(This was actually his third halftime performance, including 2004 and also \u2019N Sync\u2019s appearance in 2001.)

In a year in which the N.F.L.\u2019s bumbling relationship to race has been at its most visible, this whitewashing has a particularly acrid smell. On Sunday, in anticipation of Mr. Timberlake\u2019s performance, Twitter and Instagram were flooded with photos and videos of Ms. Jackson, often posted with the hashtag #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay.\n\nIn the days before the Super Bowl, there was also a minor conflagration at a report that Mr. Timberlake would be joined onstage by Prince, in hologram form, causing offense to Prince fans (who knew he rejected such spectacles); to those who recall Prince\u2019s 2007 halftime performance \u2014 one of the greats, full of range, attitude and carnal verve; and to those loath to see another black body handed over to a performer who had so famously mishandled one in the past.\n\nAs it happened, there was no hologram, just a projection of Prince onto a gargantuan scrim as the lights turned purple, and a quick, inoffensive duet of \u201cI Would Die 4 U\u201d that served more as an exaltation than a musical performance.

But after Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, the publisher increased its offer and encouraged Ms. McDougal to act quickly.\n\nShe signed the agreement on Aug. 5, 2016, giving the publisher exclusive rights to her account of any relationship with any \u201cthen-married man,\u201d with nearly half of the payment going to three men who had helped arrange the deal, according to The New Yorker.\n\n\u201cI knew that I couldn\u2019t talk about any alleged affair with any married man, but I didn\u2019t really understand the whole content of what I gave up,\u201d she told The New Yorker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe affair began after Ms. McDougal and Mr. Trump met at a party at the Playboy Mansion in June 2006, the magazine reported. The pair began talking by phone and soon met for a private dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous! I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man,\u201d Ms. McDougal wrote in the note about the encounter. \u201cWe talked for a couple hours \u2013 then, it was \u2018ON\u2019! We got naked + had sex.\u201d\n\nThe relationship allegedly continued until April 2007, when Ms. McDougal called it off, partly out of guilt and partly because of racially insensitive and disrespectful comments Mr. Trump had made.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, told The New York Times this week that he had used $130,000 of his own money to facilitate a payment to another woman, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known by the stage name Stormy Daniels. In 2011, she relayed her account of an affair with Mr. Trump to a different tabloid, \u201cIn Touch,\u201d which published excerpts from the interview in January.", "title": "Karen McDougal Describes Alleged Affair With Trump in New Yorker Article", "authors": ["Niraj Chokshi"]}

The president added, \u201cHe also, as you probably know, says he is innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe worked very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked for a comment about Mr. Porter. The president said he had only \u201crecently\u201d learned of the allegations against his former aide and was surprised.\n\n\u201cHe did a very good job when he was in the White House, and we hope he has a wonderful career, and he will have a great career ahead of him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly he\u2019s also very sad now.\u201d\n\nThe glowing praise of a staff member accused of serial violence against women was in line with the president\u2019s own denials of sexual impropriety despite accusations from more than a dozen women and his habit of accepting claims of innocence from men facing similar allegations. Among them was Roy S. Moore, the former Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, who is accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nBut later in the day, the White House dealt far more aggressively with another allegation of abuse. A spokesman confirmed that a second White House staff member, David Sorensen, a speechwriter, had resigned over allegations by his former wife that he had abused her during their marriage. The spokesman said that officials confronted Mr. Sorenson on Thursday night when they learned of the accusations and that he had denied them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sorensen\u2019s resignation, first reported by The Washington Post, came as a new timeline emerged indicating that top officials knew much earlier than previously disclosed that Mr. Porter faced accusations of violence against women.\n\nShortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. McGahn, the White House counsel, first learned from Mr. Porter himself that there could be allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. Mr. McGahn\u2019s knowledge of the accusations in January was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Porter told him about the possible allegations because he was concerned that what he characterized as false charges from aggrieved women who were out to destroy him could derail his F.B.I. background check, according to one of the two people briefed on the matter.\n\nVideo\n\nSix months later, the F.B.I. told Mr. McGahn that accusations of domestic abuse had indeed surfaced in Mr. Porter\u2019s background check. Mr. McGahn opted at that time to let the F.B.I. complete its investigation into any incidents. Mr. Porter assured Mr. McGahn, another person briefed on the matter said, that the accusations from the former wives were lies.\n\nThe emerging timeline illustrates the degree to which Mr. Porter, a clean-cut and ambitious former Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School-educated lawyer, concealed troublesome episodes from his past that would normally be considered disqualifying for a senior White House aide.\n\nThose efforts appear to have succeeded for months, at least in part because of the willingness of a virtually all-male staff in the top echelons of the West Wing to believe a talented male colleague over women they had never met.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Senior White House officials, including Mr. Kelly, Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff, and Mr. McGahn received word from the bureau that the allegations were credible and that Mr. Porter was not likely to pass his background check.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut while Mr. McGahn privately informed Mr. Porter and encouraged him to consider moving on, according to one of the two people briefed, no action was taken to immediately terminate him. Rather, Mr. McGahn requested that the F.B.I. complete its investigation and come back to the White House with a final recommendation, a process that could take months.\n\nOn Friday, several White House aides described confusion among the staff about why Mr. Kelly and others had initially rallied to defend Mr. Porter, and some suggested that Mr. Kelly had tried to cover up what he knew. Others insisted that while he was aware of the broad strokes of accusations against Mr. Porter, and while he could have made more of an effort to learn more, he trusted the staff secretary\u2019s denials.\n\nMr. Kelly began telling people at the White House on Thursday that he had learned the details of Mr. Porter\u2019s situation only \u201c40 minutes before he threw him out\u201d two days earlier, before pictures of Mr. Porter\u2019s bruised ex-wife began circulating.\n\nBut on Wednesday afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, and other aides had maintained to reporters that the White House fully backed Mr. Porter, who they said was leaving of his own accord. She issued a statement saying that both the president and Mr. Kelly had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his performance.\n\nIn a meeting with senior staff members on Friday morning, Mr. Kelly appeared to be trying to paint his handling of the matter in a more favorable light. At the end of the session, according to people with knowledge of his remarks, Mr. Kelly volunteered that he had something he wanted to \u201cclarify.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly went on to say that he had learned of Mr. Porter\u2019s true situation less than an hour before he removed him from his job. Two people familiar with the comments said that most of the staff appeared incredulous; one person said several people in the room knew that the timeline Mr. Kelly had presented was false.\n\nAs the meeting broke up, Ms. Hicks loudly complained about what had transpired, using an expletive, a person briefed on the meeting said.\n\nThe infighting unfolded amid signs of a brewing shake-up in the West Wing.\n\nThe president has now sounded out several people as possible replacements for Mr. Kelly. Those possible replacements include Mick Mulvaney, the budget director; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California; and Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser. He has also returned to a notion he has raised privately in the past, telling people he would like Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a close friend and confidant, to take the job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kelly is not ready to explicitly offer a resignation, according to a person familiar with his thinking. But people close to Mr. Trump said the president had begun the process of making the job so unpleasant for Mr. Kelly that it might hasten his departure, the same sort of ritual humiliation to which he subjected Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, before his departure in July.\n\nDespite his warm words on Friday, two advisers said, Mr. Trump was livid when he learned of the allegations against Mr. Porter, and referred to his disgraced former aide in one phone call as \u201cbad garbage.\u201d He also expressed his frustration with both Mr. Kelly and Ms. Hicks.\n\nOn Friday evening, the White House announced new posts for 31 officials, including elevating to acting staff secretary Derek Lyons, another Harvard Law School-educated lawyer, who formerly worked on Capitol Hill and had been Mr. Porter\u2019s No. 2. Also included on the list was the departure of Jim Carroll, a lawyer in the counsel\u2019s office who had only recently been designated to be Mr. Kelly\u2019s deputy, but will now become acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.", "title": "Kelly Says He\u2019s Willing to Resign as Abuse Scandal Roils White House", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Michael S.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "BY ITS NATURE, wood does not lend itself to spectacle. A common material in Japanese traditional architecture until the firebombing of World War II (which is to say, about 10 years before Kuma was born), it weathers easily and visibly, requires constant attention and replacement and exudes impermanence, fragility and modesty. Kuma gravitates toward it relentlessly, appropriate for someone who told me that \u201carchitects should be very shy, everywhere.\u201d\n\nKuma\u2019s pleas for shyness derive from a complex resistance to the profession he decided he wanted to enter some 50 years ago. He began his training as a proverbial angry young man, more inclined to define himself against trends, to say \u201cno\u201d rather than to determine what he wanted. Though visiting Tange\u2019s gymnasium was formative, he had soured on Japanese Modernism by the time he was 16, in 1970. That year, Kuma attended the Expo \u201970 in Osaka, where Tange and his \u201cMetabolist\u201d associates Kisho Kurokawa and Kiyonori Kikutake had displayed some of the most outlandish and eye-popping structures in the history of architecture. The Metabolists had emerged in the 1960s as the vanguard of Japanese Modernism \u2014 their name was meant to imply a flexible architecture that had a cellular, metabolic relationship to the growing city \u2014 and they produced a number of spectacular plans and futuristic visions that extended the programs of European Modernism into the realm of the fantastic: cities floating in the sea or houses vaulted into the sky. At Osaka, however, Kuma saw only exhaustion: The architects he admired were exclusively interested in producing fantastic forms, completely divorced from their environment or human needs.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nKuma found a more copacetic model for his developing interests in architecture school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, where he studied with Hiroshi Hara. The renowned theorist took Kuma and his other students on a two-month trip through the Sahel, where they visited and documented village structures of nomadic peoples. With no knowledge of the relevant languages, let alone the customs, they had to learn to manage in harsh conditions, and explain their curious interests with a flurry of exaggerated gestures and a mixture of English and French. This experience with impermanent, modest dwellings, as well as the travel through unfamiliar rural areas, gave Kuma skills and confidence that he would later use in the countryside of Japan. (A recent guide to the architecture of Japan lists over 30 major projects by Kuma\u2019s offices, though his own website points to dozens more.)\n\nWhen Kuma arrived for a yearlong fellowship at Columbia University in 1985, he was in the midst of a transitional period both in architecture and in the economic history of his country. The high tide of architectural postmodernism was cresting, just as the economies of both the U.S. and Japan were entering a period of historic growth. That year, West German, French, British, American and Japanese officials signed a treaty known as the Plaza Accord, designed to coerce the United States into devaluing its currency, thereby limiting Japanese exports \u2014 cars and electronics \u2014 that had flooded U.S. markets and driven many Americans into an existential panic over their country\u2019s declining power. The immediate result was to give Japanese consumers a newly strong yen and, after the Bank of Japan lowered official interest rates, to overheat the domestic market. From 1985 to 1990, an enormous stock market bubble swelled. And it wasn\u2019t just bankers and salarymen who made fortunes. The result in architectural terms was an explosion of construction throughout the country, and a seemingly unending stream of commissions for any architect who wanted them.\n\nPhoto\n\nKuma spent his year at Columbia immersed in the then-dominant kingdom of architectural postmodernism. He met with and interviewed the reigning figures of the day, visiting their offices and observing them at work: Philip Johnson, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Frank Gehry. But he ended up collecting his interviews in a book that was a kiss-off to the style. Published in Japan in 1989, the book was titled, rather aggressively, \u201cGood-Bye Postmodernism.\u201d Kuma\u2019s feeling was that American postmodernism was tied to a bubble economy \u2014 in this case, the American bubble of the 1980s, which culminated in Black Monday in 1987 \u2014 and as a phenomenon was limited to the Western world. Nonetheless, he started his own, eponymous firm in Tokyo in 1990, and in a typical Kuma gesture, produced for his very first major building an almost canonical example of the postmodernism he had just dismissed. Called M2, it was commissioned as a Mazda showroom, but its scale and imagery far exceeded the requirements. A defiantly crazy and arguably cynical building, its standout feature is a central, monstrously oversize column crowned with an ionic capital, buttressed on either side by a bricolage of arches, made up of concrete panels meant to look like solid blocks. Postmodern architecture had always gestured toward the antique past, usually in a mode of acerbic or calculatingly boisterous irony, but Kuma\u2019s wild gesticulations in M2 were grotesque and overwhelming. Familiarity with his later work makes it hard to fathom how an architect so fixated on humility would begin his career with such a spectacular folly.\n\nVarious external forces coincided to make Kuma\u2019s flirtation with monumental excrescences an abortive one. Around the time that he was finishing M2, Kuma received a phone call related to some of the construction details on the building. Picking up the receiver with his left hand, he put his right hand \u2014 his drawing hand \u2014 down on a nearby glass table to balance himself, and the table shattered beneath him. The nerves and veins in his wrist were severed and the bone exposed. The injury he sustained to his hand was permanent. He lost his ability to draw in detail or fasten a button (Kuma\u2019s habitual uniform now is a suit with a T-shirt), and \u2014 as is perhaps typical of near-death experiences \u2014 he was at once shaken and, by his own account, liberated by the experience. Another paradoxical liberation came the following year, when the Japanese economic bubble burst. For an entire decade \u2014 known proverbially as Japan\u2019s lost decade, due to its persistently and irremediably sluggish growth, and intermittent years of recession \u2014 commissions in Tokyo completely dried up. Kuma was forced into a period of necessary reflection, and out of it he developed the practice and thought that would come to define his career.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nIN A WAY that wouldn\u2019t be possible with any other major architects one can think of, the results of Kuma\u2019s exploration of a new style are documented in a single small mountain town on the island of Shikoku in the south of Japan. Yusuhara, a two-hour sinuous drive through hills sculpted with tanada (rice-growing terraces) from the closest major city of Kochi \u2014 itself a seven-hour train ride southwest from Tokyo \u2014 is not a name that many in Japan will recognize, unless they are familiar with Kuma\u2019s work. With a population of just 3,600, but sprawling over a wide area, the town contains four buildings by the architect, built over a span of nearly two decades, with another currently under construction. Members of Kuma\u2019s firm make the relatively grueling trip a few times a month, and the second day I was there, I ran into one of his many overworked epigones, looking cadaverous and damp-haired as he sucked down a can of cold Starbucks espresso; he and his team had stayed up all night working on a project before catching the train from Tokyo. Kuma\u2019s enduring loyalty to the small Japanese town, even as his stature has grown, remains one of the distinctive aspects of his person and his architecture. For Kuma, the scale of the place has meant fewer impediments to his true passions: working with local craftsmen and using local materials. It offers freer access to the past, in a country that until the postwar era had been mostly rural.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKuma was drawn to Yusuhara in the 1990s because he was friends with an architect working in the town; the architect asked his advice on a conservation matter regarding an old wooden theater, and the town\u2019s mayor ended up contracting him to build a hotel. To track this work \u2014 from the Kumo-no Ue-no Hotel (completed in 1996), through to the Yusuhara Town Hall (2006), a new fruit market and hotel called Machi-no-Eki Yusuhara (2010) and the extraordinary Wooden Bridge Museum (2010) \u2014 is to watch the progress of a mind as it grows increasingly bold and fanciful in its experimentation with wood. Kuma works almost exclusively in cedar \u2014 typical both to the region and to Japanese architecture in general. Throughout his buildings, unfinished beams and panels intersect with smoother, thinner louvers. The effect is warm, of course, but also weathered and transient: Exterior panels become darkened by years of afternoon sun; interior spaces have a rough-edged sensation, and the buildings exude the scent of cedar, as if they had been freshly tossed up. In Kuma\u2019s first hotel, still a recognizably postmodernist work (its surfboard-shaped roof is meant to resemble a cloud, since Yusuhara\u2019s nickname is \u201cTown Above the Clouds\u201d), the wood appears here and there as floor slats slathered in white paint \u2014 atypical, since Kuma usually likes to leave his wood exposed. The Town Hall, finished a decade later, represents an enormous leap forward. A seemingly simple rectangular box, with a hidden concrete walled exterior, its roof is cantilevered from a traditional Japanese beam structure. A glass facade, parceled out into asymmetrical wood paneling to shade the interior, can be opened up in warmer months to the exterior. This permeability would be a recurring feature of his later work. Lingering in the warm, brightly lit lobby, where a wooden stage is set up for performances of kagura (a traditional Shinto dance native to the region), one can forget the immediate presence of bureaucracy, and all its connotations of willful obscurity.\n\nDuring his years in Yusuhara, Kuma was theorizing his own work with some frequency, and his substantial body of writing reveals a repeated turning over of the same ideas and experiences, much as he constantly comes back to wood to see what else it can accomplish. Above all, Kuma is drawn to a vision of architecture that he has variously called \u201cdefeated architecture,\u201d \u201csmall architecture\u201d or \u201canti-object\u201d architecture. It is a story of returning to the values of traditional Japanese architecture through the work of modern architects who admire them, as well as the rather simple idea \u2014 however sometimes tortuously expressed by Kuma via detours into Western philosophy and critical theory \u2014 that architecture should cease to force itself onto a landscape and should instead, through acquaintance with local materials and methods, relate itself harmoniously to its surroundings.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPresented as an argument with the traditions of Modernism and postmodernism, it is also an argument Kuma has been conducting with his forbears and his peers about the function of architecture, part of a longstanding debate about what is \u201cJapanese\u201d in the art. Some of the most enduring monuments to international Modernism, especially in their use of concrete, are in Japan, perhaps the only Asian country to have embraced, so fully and ardently, the movement descended from Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus. Partly this is a result of the war: American firebombing decimated Japan\u2019s wooden cities, and after that, the government limited wood as a building material in cities like Tokyo. Breakneck development since then had by the 1970s turned Japan into the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and its exuberance for Modernist architecture exemplified this growing national self-confidence like nothing else. But as with many modernizing movements in Japan, there was always dissonance. Weren\u2019t these massive concrete forms, these spectacular metropolises, foreign to the humble wood architecture that Japan had always cultivated? Complicating matters was the fact that Modernist architects themselves \u2014 from Bruno Taut to Richard Neutra to Frank Lloyd Wright \u2014 had been greatly influenced by prewar, traditional Japanese architecture.\n\nKuma was not the first to grapple with these questions. Kunio Maekawa, an acolyte of Le Corbusier, evoked the Japanese vernacular in concrete and used wood paneling throughout his buildings; decades later, Arata Isozaki alluded to the catastrophe of the American bombing campaign in buildings that resembled shards of ruins, reflecting on the problem of how Japan expresses its identity through its buildings in his essay \u201c1960 Blue Sky of Surrender Day: Space of Darkness.\u201d But among them, Kuma\u2019s solution \u2014 to focus obsessively on local materials, and to build with those materials, at the expense of the overall form \u2014 may be the most distinctive. He concentrates not on the formal aspect of his buildings, but on the immediate experience they provide \u2014 on surfaces, effects and moods \u2014 all at the risk of producing structures that photograph poorly, or seem modest. Besides his evocation of Japanese forms and materials, it is precisely all the modern obsessions that he ignores \u2014 sleek designs, a privileging of style over function \u2014 that signify what is traditionally \u201cJapanese\u201d in his architecture. Small architecture is not his only mode, but it is the most natural expression of his approach, and a testament to how much he fights against other architects in his work.\n\nKuma has so defined himself against his immediate predecessors that, when his father died in 1994, he took the opportunity to design a gravesite that deliberately distinguished itself from another architect\u2019s monument, the grave of the great Metabolist architect Kisho Kurokawa, known for the kind of complex and flashy designs that Kuma rebels against, who died in 2007 and is buried \u2014 it feels both literally and figuratively \u2014 in a cemetery that adjoins Kuma\u2019s office. \u201cI saw Kisho Kurokawa\u2019s \u2014 I wanted to do the opposite,\u201d he told me. Kuma is an indefatigable and focused individual, and I often found myself trailing behind him as he dashed from place to place. He practically ran from his office through the cemetery to the Kurokawa site, which was marked by a proud obelisk, slightly larger than the surrounding markers. \u201cI don\u2019t like granite,\u201d he said. He then showed me to his father\u2019s site nearby. It was a simple recessed space, almost like Maya Lin\u2019s memorial to the American soldiers killed in Vietnam \u2014 the opposite of a monument. It was made of ashino stone, a flaky substance quarried north of Tokyo and the same material he used in one his best-known buildings, the Stone Museum, completed in 2000 in the ski resort destination of Tochigi Prefecture, which houses a museum and showcases an interwoven arrangement of ashino structures. \u201cThe color ages naturally,\u201d he said, inspecting the agate-colored grave, which would become darker and redder over time. It was a classic moment for Kuma: The occasion of something deeply personal, the death of a parent, became yet another opportunity to demonstrate his principles, use traditional materials and conduct a surreptitious fight with the architectural past. He had never stopped saying no.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nAMONG ALL THE arts, architecture is perhaps the most susceptible to the vicissitudes of the economy, its health uniquely dependent on the confidence of actors far outside the architect\u2019s control: real estate investors, construction companies and corporate clients, to say nothing of interest rates set by central banks. A skyline registers with unusual acuity the history of boom-and-bust, and, with some allowance made for the delay in which buildings actually get completed, architectural fashions often swell and decline along with those same cycles. For the decades that followed the postwar era, the Modernism of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe dominated cities and even small towns across the world. But the recessions of the 1970s dented the era\u2019s confidence, and subsequently a knowing, sophisticated, and \u2014 at least in its initial phase \u2014 deferential postmodernism took hold. By the 2000s, the deference was gone, and a slick, glass-and-metal neo-modernism \u2014 exemplified particularly by Gehry, Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Sir Norman Foster \u2014 set the tone for much architecture up until the financial crisis of 2008. Despite the ethereal condominium towers sprouting up over the global capitals of the world, there is no question that the Great Recession once again dimmed the profession\u2019s intellectual hubris, and the last eight or so years have been a kind of interregnum. Call it \u201cafter architecture\u201d: a period of still-unfinished searching for a new mode, ethical and stylistic, by its most thoughtful practitioners.\n\nKuma\u2019s particular version of this search seems to have preceded that of most of his international peers, and unlike them he seems to have found a solution. This is partly because of the early collapse of the Japanese economy \u2014 the trauma of the 1990 bubble bursting was harsher for the country than even the effects of the 2008 worldwide crash. No longer would it be assumed, as was common in the 1980s, that Japan would become the world\u2019s biggest economy. Indeed, the country has never truly recovered \u2014 not financially, and, just as significantly, not psychically as well \u2014 and the need to find an architecture appropriate to a sobered world of vastly diminished expectations, one aware of the costs of imposing endless development and construction on an unresilient planet, became more urgent here than it did elsewhere \u2014 at least, it certainly did for Kuma.\n\nIt is nonetheless hard to keep in mind Kuma\u2019s self-addressed injunction to \u201cerase\u201d architecture when viewing his Wooden Bridge Museum, his most recently completed work in Yusuhara. Technically a functional design to integrate Kuma\u2019s earlier hotel with a local bathhouse, the resulting structure is much greater than its ostensibly simple purpose. The gallery rises up several stories and is supported by a single strong central pillar. But most of the gallery\u2019s weight is cantilevered off the hillside thanks to another traditional Japanese beam technique, in which small cross sections of modern laminated veneer lumber are stacked one on top of another, at perpendicular angles, creating a luminous, exhilarating sense of infinity. The effect is less of a craft being renewed than an abstract monument to that craft, and to an architect, too. Despite Kuma\u2019s professed desire to distance himself from his forebears, it clearly resembles Arata Isozaki\u2019s famous but unrealized \u201cClusters in the Air\u201d (1960-62), a plan for housing projects in Tokyo, in which a single pillar supports capsule-like apartments, piled one above the other, like Kuma\u2019s beams. Kuma\u2019s rejoinder might be that his own plan represents the local traditions and materials of the surrounding region, rather than a fanciful object alien to the landscape. But the unmistakable reference suggests that Kuma has never quite abandoned his old combativeness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe use of wood to achieve hallucinatory effects continued into Kuma\u2019s projects outside Yusuhara. His unearthly Bato Hiroshige Museum of Art (2000) in Nakagawa-machi, a semirural town about a three-hour train ride north from Tokyo, employs the thin louvers and pitched roofs he later used in Portland. To enter the museum, you walk through an enormous open entrance: In a characteristic Kuma gesture, a strong, unbroken line connects the city and the lush hillside against which the museum backs up, perforating the museum, making it permeable. Then you turn right alongside a glass wall shimmering with thin wood slats, reflecting the line of bamboo on your left, turn right again into a foyer and then right a third time into the museum itself. The effect of the disorientation is unnerving, dissolving the boundary between surface and depth. Elsewhere in the museum, the louver patterns are reflected directly onto the glass, like a bar code. The superimposition of multiple materials complements the ukiyo-e woodblock prints of Hiroshige displayed inside, with their layers of ink printing, each not quite obscuring the one beneath. Unlike his peers, he told me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to establish a style.\u201d But as with Kuma\u2019s other fights within and against the profession, this one has produced unexpected results: There is no question that a Kengo Kuma building, however much it is designed to disappear, is recognizable from a mile away. In the walls of his Stone Museum, here and there, Kuma has cut out sections of the ashino stone wall and infilled it with translucent marble. The cold light filters through and turns the wall into something that resembles an old IBM punch card.\n\n\u201cArchitecture should go back to fabrication, to using real materials, to using the hand,\u201d he told me. \u201cBefore industrialization, most of the world had that system.\u201d As with many of Kuma\u2019s programmatic statements, this is a principle or self-description designed to be betrayed. Though fond of traditional materials, he is not a fetishist, and seems just as interested in using computational design to create new effects. Later, he took me to the materials room of his lab at Tokyo University, where his students were using computers to come up with new uses for strange materials. All around me were truly bizarre, organic, basketlike shapes. Kuma fingered a loose, perforated canopy strung up by one of his students and discussed it briefly with him. It turned out to be made of coir, the threadlike skin of aging coconut husks. Was this a traditional building material, I asked him? \u201cNo!\u201d he laughed. \u201cAbsolutely not. No one has ever used it.\u201d But, after all, he seemed to be saying, \u201cwhy not?\u201d", "title": "Kengo Kuma\u2019s Architecture of the Future", "authors": ["Nikil Saval"]}

Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Kushner initially failed to disclose scores of those contacts on the standard form required for all prospective government officials, and has since amended his submission, substantially delaying his background check.\n\nThat meant that his background information was not submitted in its entirety until June, after the June 1 cutoff that Mr. Kelly set in his memo.\n\nUnder the new policy, anyone holding interim clearance to see top secret or sensitive compartmented information whose background investigation had been pending since then is to be stripped of that access by Friday.

It cast doubt on the idea that employers would use the money to compensate other workers better.\n\nHeidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department who oversaw the study, said that under standard economic theory, employers were unlikely to pay workers more than needed to attract and retain them, which they are by definition already doing in most cases.\n\nShe predicted that if the regulation took effect and employers decided to share tips with these workers, \u201ctheir base pay would be reduced and there would be no more take-home pay.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department estimated that the rule would affect about one million waiters and waitresses and over 200,000 bartenders. Workers in other industries, like hairstylists and manicurists, would also be affected.\n\nMany tipped workers would not be affected, however, because the law would continue to prevent employers from taking the tips of those who earned less than the minimum wage. The law allows workers to be paid below the minimum wage as long as their tips make up the difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe proposed rule has generated a surprising amount of attention, attracting more than 180,000 comments from the public by Friday.

Here\u2019s some information that could be useful for those who think their children may have been exposed to the contaminated products.\n\nHow can I tell if my baby has salmonella poisoning?\n\nSalmonella is a bacteria that can cause infections like gastroenteritis. Symptoms usually appear eight to 48 hours after a child has been exposed to the bacteria. Telltale signs include sudden high fever, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the stool and possible rectal bleeding. The symptoms can last from a couple of days to a week and may be relatively mild. But several parents in France have reported that their infants had worse reactions and weakened immune systems, requiring further hospitalization.\n\nWhat should I do if I think there\u2019s a problem?\n\nIf your child has salmonella poisoning, gastroenteritis or any other type of serious stomach illness, seek medical advice if her temperature rises suddenly, if she appears drowsy or confused, if she has cramps or is vomiting and can\u2019t keep fluids down. Check her stool for signs of blood. Be sure to double-check which products she has consumed.\n\nWhat Lactalis products were affected?\n\nOver 7,000 tons of Lactalis baby food products suspected of salmonella contamination have been recalled since December, although a full recall from supermarkets, pharmacies and even hospitals took at least a month to play out. It is unclear how many potentially affected products are still on the shelves in countries besides France. The most popular infant formula brands affected were Milumel, Pepti Junior and Picot. Also recalled was Maltodextridine, a milk powder used for industrial production and sold to consumers in Africa and other countries. The full list of recalled products is here.\n\nWhere can I turn for support?\n\nAn organization of French families, the Association of Victims of Salmonella Contaminated Milk, is providing support and information to parents who think or know their children have been sickened by Lactalis products.

Judge Cunningham said on the first day of the hearing that the number of victims who had come forward had risen to 265, some of whom have chosen to remain anonymous.\n\nLast month, more than 150 of them publicly confronted him during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. Among them were Olympic athletes including Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber.\n\nHe was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for the charges in Ingham County, and 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography in a separate federal case.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The case has reverberated far beyond the courtrooms of Michigan, leading to efforts to identify the officials who knew about the abuse and covered it up.\n\nThe New York Times identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by the Indianapolis Star investigation.\n\nU.S.A.

Its longtime president, Lou Anna Simon, resigned last month, and the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president. But Mr. Engler\u2019s appointment was met with student protests, and the trustees are facing a possible no-confidence vote by the faculty, the Lansing State Journal reported.\n\nRachael Denhollander, who filed a police report in August 2016 accusing Dr. Nassar of sexually abusing her when she was 15 years old and became the first woman to be named publicly in the case, described the case on Monday as \u201cthe greatest sexual assault scandal in history,\u201d according to a report by The Associated Press.\n\nThe victims, she added, \u201cwouldn\u2019t be here had the adults and authorities done what they should have done 20 years ago.\u201d", "title": "Larry Nassar Is Sentenced to Another 40 to 125 Years in Prison", "authors": ["Christine Hauser"]}

It was no longer detectable in his blood, meaning it was not active. The autopsy, performed by the Clark County coroner, and its related reports were obtained by The New York Times on Friday, and were first reported on by The Las Vegas Review-Journal, which had gone to court with The Associated Press to secure their release.\n\nThe examination showed that certain sections of Mr. Paddock\u2019s brain contained small spheres that can be seen when the tissue is treated with a stain. The structures, made up mostly of carbohydrates but also containing proteins and other components, are known as corpora amylacea. They studded parts of his hippocampus \u2014 involved in learning and memory \u2014 and the frontal lobes, among other areas. \u201cMost people would have them at that age, but not in that profusion,\u201d Dr. Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a striking exaggeration of an age-related finding.\u201d\n\nThe cause and meaning of the structures remain mysterious, the subject of ongoing research. They appear as people grow older and are found at greater density in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, among other disorders. Dr. Vogel searched for signs of those diseases, but he did not detect them in Mr. Paddock\u2019s brain.\n\nThree scientists who study corpora amylacea said in interviews that the increased presence of the structures was significant. \u201cIf you have high numbers of these, something\u2019s not normal,\u201d said Troy Rohn, a professor of biology at Boise State University.\n\nOther scientists believe the structures are akin to wastebaskets that contain remnants of broken-down cells or even infectious or hazardous substances.\n\nDr. Hyman Schipper, a professor of neurology at McGill University in Montreal, said his laboratory\u2019s studies have found evidence that corpora amylacea can result from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals, which can be unleashed by various stressors. \u201cIt\u2019s telling you something and it could be very important,\u201d Dr. Schipper said of the finding in Mr. Paddock\u2019s brain.\n\nEven so, Dr. Vogel, the Stanford neuropathologist, said the results of his examination should reassure the public that Mr. Paddock\u2019s doctors had not missed diagnosing a tumor or other major brain disorder that could have been treated.", "title": "Las Vegas Gunman\u2019s Brain Exam Only Deepens Mystery of His Actions", "authors": []}

This revelation is interesting on several levels, including a question of what that minority of nearly 9 percent is thinking. Surely those people are aware that the chance of their kicking the bucket is 100 percent. Are we to believe that nothing in their basket of wishes is unrealized?\n\nThe research, published last week in The Journal of Palliative Medicine, was based on a survey of 3,056 people across the United States. Perhaps not surprisingly, those who put stock in religion and spirituality were more likely to compile such a list than those of little faith. The aspiration they listed most commonly is also unsurprising: a desire to travel. Make what you will of the finding that much farther down the scale was a desire to spend quality time with friends and family.\n\nThere is more to bucket lists than mere wishes. There\u2019s a practical side. The study said that doctors might be better able to figure out the best courses of action for seriously ill patients. One of the researchers, Dr. Vyjeyanthi Periyakoil of Stanford University, cited the example of a patient who had inoperable cancer of the gallbladder yet would benefit from radiation treatments and chemotherapy.

It\u2019s ill advised, passionate and doomed. How could it be otherwise? The reader knows from the start that Polly has done something unforgivable: She has walked away from her husband and 3-year-old daughter at the beach, left a note in their holiday rental and hitched a ride into an unknown future, jumping out at Belleville when the driver tried to put a hand on her knee.

This is also true: Ms. Ambrose has one previous musical theater credit, as Ado Annie in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d In high school.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why Ms. Ambrose, older and differently credentialed than a typical Eliza, should vault ahead, Mr. Sher put it simply. \u201cThere is no better actress working in New York right now,\u201d he said.\n\nStill that lack of experience could be a worry. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to start listing worries it\u2019s going to be a long list.\u201d\n\nThen she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actually not worried. I\u2019m super excited. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d\n\nMs. Ambrose never meant to make us wait. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been threatening to be in a musical for hundreds of years at this point,\u201d she said. She started performing early, singing in the choir of her Catholic church in New Haven.\n\nWhen she was 11, she appeared on \u201cStar Search,\u201d bopping in a purple skirt suit and matching hair bow to a sped-up arrangement of \u201cDancing in the Street.\u201d (She lost out to a kid singing the soul-stirrer \u201cGod Bless the Child,\u201d not a fair fight.)\n\nAs a teenager she began classical training, including a stint at Tanglewood. She figured she\u2019d head to a conservatory, like a lot of her friends did, maybe try for a career in opera. But she booked a couple of Off Broadway plays and then the movie \u201cIn and Out\u201d and soon she was in a series and there was never really time \u2014 for a conservatory, for college, for the commitment a musical requires.\n\nIn 2009, when she was in town gigging with her Dixieland band, the Leisure Class, Ms. Ambrose told The New Yorker, \u201cI would love to do a musical. Something old-fashioned, probably.\u201d And two years later she nearly got her wish, when she was cast as Fanny Brice in a Broadway-bound revival of \u201cFunny Girl,\u201d directed by Mr. Sher.

He wanted Ms. Ambrose. \u201cShe could sing it, she could act it. She had all the heart you need,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Ms. Ambrose a giant?

The great actress part. The wonderful performer part. But Ms. Ambrose, who long ago traded Hollywood for a semirural cottage, has always skirted celebrity.\n\nEarly on there were a few attempts to mold her into a starlet, \u201cnarcissism boot camp,\u201d she called it. But she never really went along with it; years ago an agent snapped at her about \u201cnot playing the game,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always just been more of an actor,\u201d she said.\n\nOther actors build brands and shore up celebrity with glossy magazine shoots, social media posts, sponsorships. She doesn\u2019t. Not that she judges anyone who does. \u201cFor real. You might be seeing me on Instagram, holding a mayonnaise jar, in like 10 minutes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe rarely gives interviews. But after hiring some personal publicists \u201cto curate how it\u2019s done in a way that feels O.K. to me,\u201d she agreed to this conversation \u201cbecause I\u2019m proud of this opportunity and excited and I have to do a bunch of stuff anyway for Lincoln Center.\u201d Still, she apologized a couple of times for giving me \u201cnothing to write about.\u201d Once, she unconsciously pushed the recorders away.\n\nYou can plot Ms. Ambrose\u2019s ambivalence on a map.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "The theater, the medium that is closest to Metcalf\u2019s heart, is one of the few art forms left that you can\u2019t see whenever you want to: You can\u2019t watch a play on YouTube or stream it on Netflix. You had to be there, or you can only ever hear tell of it. It\u2019s too late to see Metcalf\u2019s Tony Award-winning performance in last year\u2019s \u201cA Doll\u2019s House Part 2,\u201d Lucas Hnath\u2019s riotous sequel to the original Ibsen play, in which she hilariously and brashly manspread onstage like a cowboy in a corset. Despite 40 years of theater roles, she\u2019s best known for having played the lovably blundering Aunt Jackie in the blue-collar \u201990s sitcom \u201cRoseanne,\u201d a part that made her famous and, in the fashion of hit TV, familiar.\n\nBut it is Metcalf\u2019s role in Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d her first film in nearly a decade, that has lately encouraged us to see her anew. In her Oscar-nominated performance as Marion McPherson, mother of the teenage Lady Bird, she gives a performance so layered, vital and precise that it retroactively casts a spotlight on the meticulous but accessible, methodical but electric work she has been doing for decades. At 62, Metcalf is now being widely recognized for what she has always been, an actress of remarkable power, range and skill, a pre-eminent chronicler of the American working woman. Metcalf would be the first to say that her current tear \u2014 which includes three Emmy nominations in 2016 for \u201cGetting On,\u201d \u201cHorace & Pete\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d; that Tony Award in 2017; the current Oscar nomination; \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d; and a new season of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d the first in two decades, arriving in March \u2014 all goes back to being given such meaty parts at an age when most actresses are being forced into retirement. But she knew exactly what to do with these parts when she got them. \u201cShe is so hard-working,\u201d says Will Frears, who directed Metcalf in a 2015 Broadway adaptation of \u201cMisery.\u201d \u201cShe is extraordinary in her desire to be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nMantello told me that one thing he particularly loves about rehearsing with Metcalf are the moments when she\u2019s engrossed in a scene and hears him laugh: \u201cShe sort of glances out at me and laughs with me. She\u2019s both in it and aware she\u2019s entertaining me at the same time.\u201d I saw this double-consciousness in the rehearsal room, when B, A and C are reminiscing about losing their virginity, and A turns to B and asks if it hurt. Metcalf, kindly, but with a knowing tease in her voice, responded, \u201cOh ... well, a little.\u201d Mantello guffawed. Metcalf locked eyes with him and cackled back. But as her laughter faded, her face settled into something much sadder, nearly tearful. It was impossible to tell when, exactly, she fell back into the character or if she had ever really broken away from her at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first play Metcalf ever appeared in was a high school production of \u201cAuntie Mame.\u201d She had only a few lines, but on the first night, she accidentally got a laugh on one of them. She immediately tried to parse what exactly had happened, so it could happen once more. \u201cI think that\u2019s what hooked me,\u201d she says, \u201cwanting to have that experience again onstage but be in control. It\u2019s a cool, powerful feeling to direct the energy of the room.\u201d\n\nBut Metcalf was too practical and shy to imagine she would become an actor. Raised in Southern Illinois by her mother, a librarian, and her father, a budget director for the state university system, she went to college at Illinois State University and studied anthropology and German. She thought she would become an interpreter, which, as she likes to point out, she did. But she ended up doing a couple of shows in the theater department, impressing Terry Kinney, a fellow student who was pals with Jeff Perry and Gary Sinise. In 1976, Metcalf joined them and five other actors in a theater company housed in a church basement in Highland Park, outside Chicago. The group saved money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated as Steppenwolf.\n\nAustin Pendleton, who became a member of the company in the \u201980s, says working with Steppenwolf was \u201clike opening a broom closet and finding the future of American acting.\u201d Joan Allen, John Malkovich, Glenne Headly and Tracy Letts are just some of the company\u2019s other members, nearly all of whom are recognizable from television, movies or theater. In the beginning, they all had day jobs. Metcalf was a legal secretary who could bang out 120 words a minute. When work was over, they would head to the basement theater and work some more, a commune, an incestuous sibling society (Metcalf dated Kinney first and then Malkovich, before marrying Perry, the father of her oldest child, the actress Zoe Perry). They picked their plays, cast them, directed when they drew the short straw, drank beer, ushered, took tickets, cleaned the bathroom and sold subscriptions. They cast themselves in parts no one else would have let them play. Metcalf was a septuagenarian in \u201cTrue West\u201d and a 14-year-old girl. She stole a show as the ugliest, flirtiest woman in the world, gave a monologue with yarn in her mouth and played Laura from \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d as profoundly mentally ill, a performance that drew critics from Chicago and that the people who saw it still speak of in reverent tones.\n\nMetcalf was in her late 20s when her oldest daughter was born. She left her at home with a sitter every night that she appeared in the 1983 Off Broadway staging of Lanford Wilson\u2019s \u201cBalm in Gilead,\u201d a performance that has become the stuff of Broadway legend. A vast ensemble piece, set around a scruffy New York City diner, it was memorably punctuated by Metcalf\u2019s 20-minute monologue as the inane, sweet prostitute Darlene, who prattles on and on until both she and the audience are in tears. After being cast in \u201cRoseanne\u201d \u2014 during just a two-week visit to California to audition for some movies \u2014 she moved to Los Angeles, where she still lives. She raised three children with her ex-husband Matt Roth, who played her abusive boyfriend on \u201cRoseanne.\u201d Her oldest son is now grown, and Metcalf lives with her teenage son and 12-year-old daughter. When she won the Tony Award for \u201cA Doll\u2019s House Part 2,\u201d she thanked them for allowing her to be away so much.\n\nMetcalf has previously referred to herself as a workaholic, but when I asked her if this was true, she amended: \u201cI can\u2019t even call it work. I\u2019m a creative-a-holic. I love the tearing into new material.\u201d She recalls filming a three-person scene during the first season of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d in which she didn\u2019t have much dialogue. During a break, the director came over and said to her, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to be acting during this part, because you\u2019re not on camera.\u201d Recalling this moment three decades later, she still can\u2019t keep the outrage from her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever heard! What would I do, just drop out? Just pull the plug and go dead for a while as they\u2019re sitting two feet away from me?\u201d\n\nThere is a brawny, brainy populism to her high artistry, reflected in the everyday women she likes to play. Aunt Jackie is a hysterically funny working-class neurotic, lost and searching. In a 20-minute monologue in \u201cHorace & Pete,\u201d Metcalf uses only her face to tell a genuinely erotic tale of middle-aged desire. In HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On,\u201d which ended in 2015, her Jenna James, a geriatric doctor with the bedside manner of a rude telemarketer, is a cringe-comedy buffoon, whom Metcalf gives a soul. In \u201cLady Bird,\u201d Metcalf plays Marion McPherson with enough verve and eye rolls to transcend the clich\u00e9 of the nagging mother, suggesting with her performance that adolescent energy may not fade, so much as age into a more potent vintage. Her characters are high-strung women in the thick of busy lives, whose interiors Metcalf, from the midst of her own busy life, evokes with care, ingenuity and intensity. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to blow out a camera lens or make the audience\u2019s hair go straight back from my sheer volume, sheer energy level,\u201d Metcalf says, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t hold onto your hat.\n\nAt the end of the first week of rehearsal for \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d I met Metcalf in a Theater Row restaurant, the kind that has a mad dinner rush before the shows start at 8. She arrived in a puffy coat and a bright orange hat topped with a grand gray pompom, the same gray cowl neck sweater she wore during rehearsal, jeans and a pair of running shoes. Metcalf is extremely slight and unassuming, yet substantial. Perfectly engaging, she is not, like some actors, \u201con.\u201d She has the slightly Midwestern air of a woman who is politely clocking everything but holding back her judgments until among friends. When the waiter asked us if we would like a five-ounce or eight-ounce pour of red wine, Metcalf emphatically selected the larger. Then she barely sipped it.\n\nShe was both exhausted and full of ideas. \u201cNo matter how many times you\u2019ve done it, the early stages of getting a show up on its feet is very hit and miss,\u201d she said. \u201cThere seem to be thousands of options on every page to discover. All of a sudden, you find yourself like: I\u2019m sitting in the same spot for about 10 pages, and I know that I would be bored looking at this. So now what do I do? I have to challenge myself to figure it out. Try it, try it, try it. Keep trying different things. It\u2019s a big puzzle.\u201d When I asked her when she last tried something that completely failed, she answered immediately: \u201cToday, two hours ago.\u201d", "title": "Laurie Metcalf Was Hiding in Plain Sight", "authors": ["Willa Paskin"]}

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "This is not the first time lawyers have sought to use the courts to question whether marijuana should still be classified as a so-called Schedule 1 drug under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, the most restrictive category reserved for the most dangerous narcotics. Many of those efforts have come in criminal cases, and judges \u2014 including those on the United States Supreme Court \u2014 have routinely upheld Congress\u2019s decision to make marijuana illegal.\n\nThe current legal action is a somewhat rare attempt to use civil claims to legalize weed and has offered some novel arguments as to why its classification has violated the constitutional rights of those who filed the suit.\n\nThe former football player, Marvin Washington, for instance, is contending that the Controlled Substances Act has impeded his ability to transact business in states where pot is legal in contravention of the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The girl with epilepsy, Alexis Bortell, has argued that the law illegally restricts her right to travel with her medicine in states where pot is not allowed or to places controlled by the federal government \u2014 including on airplanes. A third plaintiff, the Cannabis Cultural Association, a nonprofit group created to assist minorities in the marijuana industry, has alleged the law has been used for years to discriminate against them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe suit has made another claim based on what amounts to government hypocrisy: It asks why the government has classified pot as a pernicious substance, when in 2003 the Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on compounds in the drug to protect against brain damage and then in 2015 the surgeon general under President Obama declared in public that pot has medical benefits.\n\nAgainst these claims, lawyers for the government have argued that Congress decided nearly 50 years ago that pot should be a Schedule 1 drug, and if the plaintiffs don\u2019t agree, they should try to change the law. Their suit, the lawyers wrote in one of their filings, \u201cis the latest in a long list of cases asserting constitutional challenges to marijuana regulation under the C.S.A. Those challenges have been uniformly rejected by the federal courts.\u201d\n\nNo matter how the lawsuit ends, the judge who is considering the case, Alvin K. Hellerstein, is clearly taking it seriously. At a hearing in September, Judge Hellerstein said he would give the matter his \u201cprioritized attention,\u201d setting it ahead of all of his other cases.\n\nThe hearing on Wednesday, scheduled to entertain arguments to dismiss the case, is very likely to be marked by a whiff of drama as marijuana activists from across the country are expected to descend on the courtroom. Mr. Bondy said he was also trying to arrange a live-stream of the proceeding so that Alexis, unable to travel to New York, can watch it from her home in Colorado.\n\nIt is not coincidental that the suit was filed at a moment when 30 states have laws legalizing pot in various capacities, spawning a giant industry of growers, distributors and producers of paraphernalia. When Mr. Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that he was rescinding an Obama-era policy that took a laissez-faire approach to the marijuana business in states where it is legal, it was not just the lawyers working on the lawsuit who complained; lawmakers from both political parties \u2014 some from conservative states \u2014 leveled accusations of betrayal and howled with dismay.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe might not have been able to do this 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Mr. Bondy said. \u201cBut the climate is very different now.\u201d", "title": "Lawsuit Takes Aim at Trump Administration Marijuana Policy", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "In the decades since, the massacre at Hue has become a touchstone and a flash point for debates about the war, both within Vietnam and in the United States. It began a few months after the battle when Nha Ca, a well-known South Vietnamese writer, wrote an account of the battle, \u201cMourning Headband for Hue.\u201d It was first serialized in a newspaper and then published as a book in 1969. On the eve of the Tet offensive, Nha Ca had come to her hometown Hue from Saigon for the burial of her father, and she remained there during the battle.\n\nIn the book, she described the atrocities committed by the communists, but also gave examples of their humanity. She showed the dark and bright sides of American and ARVN soldiers, creating a vivid picture of the terrible plight of the civilians. Describing the atrocities committed by the communists, she lamented the plight of her country, the fate of all Vietnamese who found themselves pawns in the power play between the communist and anti-communist blocs. This book was translated and published in English in 2014 (I provided the translation).\n\nFor many Vietnamese, \u201cMourning Headband for Hue\u201d remains one of the key commemorations of the massacre and their loved ones. But not everyone sees it this way. When she wrote in 1969, Nha Ca called on her readers to share responsibility for the destruction of their country. But many former South Vietnamese disagree with her willingness to attribute to her compatriots a shared responsibility for the war, which they see as a result of communist aggression by the former North Vietnam.\n\nWhile the discoveries of mass graves unfolded in Hue, the attention of Americans was diverted to the shocking domestic events of 1968: On March 31, President Johnson announced that he would not run for reelection; on April 4, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, an event that provoked days of rioting in American cities; on June 6, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated; in August, violent clashes between police and protesters accompanied the national convention of the Democratic Party in Chicago; finally, the presidential campaign resulted in the election of Richard Nixon. The fate of the Hue victims did not break through these headlines.\n\nThen, even though in Hue local people continued to unearth corpses of missing people and the number of uncovered bodies was rising into the thousands, the news of another tragedy overshadowed Hue again. On March 16, 1968, less than a month after the events in Hue, American soldiers entered the hamlet of My Lai and killed between 300 and 400 of its inhabitants, including children, old men and women. When they found out in 1969, Americans were rightly appalled by the actions of their countrymen in Vietnam, and the My Lai victims and the American perpetrators pushed the Hue victims and the communist perpetrators out of the American media and, by extension, out of the attention of the American public and of world opinion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Douglas Pike, a journalist who joined the U.S. Information Agency in Vietnam and later as a State Department employee, was one of the first Americans to call attention to the massacre, and cited it as evidence of the dangers of a communist takeover of South Vietnam. Pike\u2019s view was adopted by President Nixon and hawkish members of Congress to justify avoiding a sudden withdrawal from the war.\n\nAntiwar politicians, in contrast, drew on the work of Gareth Porter, a political scientist and journalist, who argued that the killings in Hue were committed on a smaller scale than reported, merely acts of revenge by an army in retreat. Drawing on Porter\u2019s work, Senator George McGovern accused the Nixon administration of using the events in Hue as a pretext to continue American involvement there. He went as far as to refer to the killings in Hue as the \u201cso-called Hue massacre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLack of attention to events in Hue continued after the war. Unlike the My Lai massacre, which is mentioned in most general books about the war and is analyzed in dozens of specialized books published from the 1970s to the present, the events in Hue have not received any serious study and have largely, if not completely, faded from American memory and scholarship.\n\nThe politicization of the Hue massacre extends beyond Vietnam and the United States. No mention of the massacre occurred in the Soviet press or in any other public forum in 1968 or in later years. The only concerned voice on the Soviet side came from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet dissident. The situation has not changed in the Soviet Union\u2019s successor state of Russia.\n\nIn 2012, while giving a presentation on the Hue Massacre and Nha Ca\u2019s account of it at an academic conference in Moscow, I was told that we must focus on the atrocities committed by Americans and by their South Vietnamese \u201cpuppets.\u201d I expressed agreement that we must and will discuss American atrocities, but that we should not overlook what the other side did. No, I was told, the communists fought for the right cause and we must focus on the American perpetrators, an exchange that was reported in the conference\u2019s proceedings. Out of 50 or so people in the room, no one voiced support for my view; later, it was related to me that there was no need for my \u201cWestern objectivity.\u201d\n\nAs a historian, I\u2019ve seen an odd confluence of American and Soviet/Russian academic perspectives on the massacres and a Soviet/Russian-American alliance, if not intentional, in accepting Hanoi\u2019s version of the war. American scholarship has focused largely on either the American side of the war or the North Vietnamese perspective; either way, America\u2019s erstwhile ally has been largely ignored. South Vietnam, whose many citizens fled Vietnam and found a new home in the United States, was pushed to the margins, if not completely off the pages, of postwar narratives, and meanwhile the former enemy was romanticized.\n\nPutting the United States front and center as the only perpetrator of the war denies agency to the South Vietnamese who did not want to live under communists and who fought for this cause, and it simultaneously conceals the fact that expelling Americans was only the first step of bringing the South under the sway of the North. Hanoi always insisted that the unified Vietnam would be a socialist country. Thus, even in the context of the Cold War, it was a civil war between North and South Vietnam for the future of their states.\n\nThe American appropriation of the war translated even to the analysis and representation of atrocities and other wrongdoings. But without discussing the wrongs committed by all sides, no true reconciliation or study of history is possible. To be fair, the situation in the United States has started to change, however slowly, as a new generation of scholars trained in the Vietnamese language and having genuine interest in all sides of the conflict are developing the field beyond the America-centric focus.\n\nThis is a much-needed change for the Vietnamese sides as well. As the United States and Vietnam pursue their reconciliation agenda, it is incumbent on American scholars to probe more deeply the experience of southern Vietnamese during the war. Nor can reconciliation come from the victor\u2019s syndrome as currently practiced by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \u2014 namely, we won, so let\u2019s celebrate our victory and put everything behind. It can come only through a dialogue and discussion of crimes committed by both sides.\n\nMany Vietnamese in Vietnam and in the Vietnamese diaspora still want and need to mourn their loved ones lost in the Hue massacre. They cannot do it in Vietnam. During the war, North Vietnam and the communist forces in the South did not recognize the massacre and did not punish any of the perpetrators. Neither has postwar Vietnam recognized the massacre, preferring to ignore it or call it a fabrication. During commemorative events of the Tet offensive in Vietnam, the Hue massacre does not appear.\n\nThe monopolization of the \u201ccrime zone\u201d by the United States contributes to modern Vietnam\u2019s obliteration of the communists\u2019 own wrongdoings. A sense of history is an important factor in forming a country and maintaining one\u2019s identity, but many students in Vietnam dismiss the study of their own history, at least in part because they understand how limited they are in their access to documents and other resources and how constrained they are in their interpretations of it. This encourages distrust of the government, which will grow as more materials challenging the party-line version of history appear. I grew up in the Soviet Union, and I know firsthand how damaging it was for us to maintain a mandatory veneer in which we could not believe. Given technological advancements, Vietnam faces a more formidable task than did the Soviet Union in keeping its population at bay.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReconciliation and inclusive historical narratives are also necessary for Americans. Many Vietnamese who lost their relatives in Hue and then lost their country are now an integral part of American society. Mourning what happened in Hue reminds us Americans of our self-absorption in how we think about our role in the war and our unwillingness to learn more about \u201cothers,\u201d which even today haunts American policies toward other countries.", "title": "Learning From the Hue Massacre", "authors": ["Olga Dror"]}

He was a member of Community Board 5, which included the theater district, and had his office in the Plaza Hotel.\n\n\u201cHe felt that Times Square was being destroyed, and he wanted to do something about it,\u201d Joyce Pomeroy Schwartz, his sister, said in a telephone interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Pomeroy worked with Actor\u2019s Equity and helped write a report that offered a way to incorporate the theaters in the hotel\u2019s design. The campaign failed, but the city soon conferred landmark status on many remaining Broadway theaters to prevent their destruction. (Another theater in the district was renamed for Helen Hayes shortly afterward as well.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pomeroy was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 19, 1932. His father, Alfred, was a furniture designer who owned a store on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. His mother, the former Florence Greenberg, was a homemaker. \u201cOur father was always full of ideas and wonder,\u201d Ms. Schwartz said, \u201cand we grew up loving design.\u201d\n\nArchitecture fascinated the younger Mr. Pomeroy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the balance between old and new,\u201d he said for \u201cStreet Value\u201d (2010), a book about the Fulton Mall by Rosten Woo, Meredith TenHoor and Damon Rich. He added: \u201cEarly buildings were not done necessarily for utility; architecturally designed buildings were designed mostly because they were symbols, like pyramids and Greek temples.\u201d\n\nHe graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., with a bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture, then earned his master\u2019s from the Yale School of Architecture in 1961.\n\nTwo years later, his firm Pomeroy, Lebduska Associates, designed the privately-financed conversion of a former red-brick mint factory in Downtown Brooklyn to artists\u2019 studios \u2014 earning a Progressive Architecture award for adapting the building \u201cingeniously and sensibly, and with respect for the existing architecture\u201d \u2014 but the conversion was not completed until 1975. Shortly before the renovation was done, Mr. Pomeroy told The Times that the project had been inspired partly by his father\u2019s love of Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cFrom him,\u201d he said, \u201cI inherited an allegiance to the borough and thought this project would help enhance its image.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Fulton pedestrian mall was another Brooklyn project for Mr. Pomeroy, which involved designing street furniture, canopies, vendors\u2019 kiosks, lighting, graphics and signage. His plan to cover the eight-block retail area with a fiberglass canopy \u2014 at one point it was going to be pink \u2014 was not supported by merchants.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea was to create a space that doesn\u2019t exist in New York,\u201d he told the authors of \u201cStreet Value.\u201d\n\nAt the more ambitious Swiss Bank Tower, Mr. Pomeroy designed a 36-story building that gave the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store space to expand. But he also wanted it to be compatible with its famous architectural neighbors. He told The Times in 1990 that he thought of the tower \u201cas having, in form and proportion and material, a dialogue with Rockefeller Center.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to his daughter and sister, Mr. Pomeroy is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Berman; a son, Jeremy, and seven grandchildren.

The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls \u201cchef-driven food,\u201d not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls \u201cmore uptown\u201d than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck rag\u00f9 and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish.

Having closed the much-loved Ouest in 2015 and done a brief stint at Le Cirque, he is opening this neighborhood bistro in the former Cafe Tallulah space.

Mr. Valenti said he is doing a quick turnaround, some cosmetic changes but nothing major. \u201cThe idea of spending months and millions decorating is too difficult these days,\u201d he said. The food will have some signature dishes like salmon gravlax and a fris\u00e9e salad with artichokes and mussels and, occasionally, his braised lamb shank. Also on the menu are a burger, a fried chicken sandwich, seared halibut with cauliflower pur\u00e9e and assorted simply grilled items.

To remember the Holocaust, it\u2019s enough to ride the No. 35 tram through Warsaw. On its voyage from north to south, it passes sites of public commemoration, like the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes; the Umschlagplatz, where Jews from the ghetto were herded into railcars for transport to the death camps; and the Pawiak prison, the main holding place for political prisoners during the Nazi occupation. It also passes by places that have a more personal meaning: the location of what was once my great-grandparents\u2019 house and my grandfather\u2019s grave in Powazki Cemetery.\n\nSome places are public and private at the same time. I don\u2019t know how many relatives left Warsaw for the last time from the Umschlagplatz. Pawiak prison is where my grandfather\u2019s cousin, a Jew trying to survive with Aryan papers, died when the Warsaw Uprising began, on Aug. 1, 1944. One place that always makes me shudder when I pass doesn\u2019t even exist anymore: Ulica Gesia, or Goose Street. During the Nazi occupation, this was the location of the main prison for the ghetto. It\u2019s also where my mother\u2019s aunt Rose was shot to death with 14 other women on Dec. 15, 1941. According to what Rose\u2019s sisters heard after the war, she was caught on the Aryan side of the wall. A 12-year-old boy pointed her out to the Gestapo while she was riding a tram. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s buried under the Arkadia Shopping Mall, a few stops up the line.\n\nWhat to make of this betrayal by a child? Should it be set against acts of kindness or heroism, like that of the Ukrainian who saved my father\u2019s father by helping him cross the Bug River in the fall of 1939, and the similar deeds of thousands of other Poles, Ukrainians and Belarussians who saved Jews? Or should it be paired with the even greater number of horrific acts committed by Polish citizens?\n\nThe history of the Holocaust in Poland is painful and complex. A new law passed by Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice Party aims to make it simple. Signed by President Andrzej Duda on Feb. 6, the legislation imposes punishment of up to three years in prison for those who \u201cpublicly and against the facts attribute to the Polish nation or the Polish state responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi crimes committed by the German Third Reich.\u201d In other words, in Poland it may now be illegal to blame Poles for the Holocaust.", "title": "Opinion | Lessons on the Holocaust, From Warsaw\u2019s No. 35 Tram", "authors": []}

Research instead suggests that they lead to increases in public order, with fewer discarded needles on the street and less drug use on the sidewalk, and have no impact on drug-related crimes.\n\nSuch sites certainly don\u2019t solve the problem of drug overdoses \u2014 Vancouver has had a recent spike in fentanyl-related overdose deaths, for instance. But they\u2019re effective as part of a larger harm-reduction movement, which assumes that no matter how many well-intentioned programs exist to prevent people from starting or continuing to use drugs, there will always be people who shoot up. It\u2019s better for everyone, the thinking goes, if they do that as safely as possible, with clean needles that are discarded properly. If the goal is to get drug users into treatment, the first step is to make sure they don\u2019t die.\n\nSo far, President Trump has advocated the opposite approach, focusing on law enforcement instead of harm reduction and promising to be \u201creally, really tough\u201d on people who deal drugs \u2014 an old idea that hasn\u2019t worked to save lives. The administration\u2019s 2019 budget plan proposed $13 billion over two years to address the opioid crisis, but it didn\u2019t include much detail about what, exactly, that money would fund. In December, the attorney general\u2019s office made its position on safe injection sites clear in response to a proposed facility in Vermont: \u201cIt is a crime, not only to use illicit narcotics, but to manage and maintain sites on which such drugs are used and distributed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, opiate addicts need treatment, not a place to continue using,\u201d the office wrote.\n\nAdvocates agree on the need for evidence-based treatment and services to help homeless drug users find housing or mental health care, but that\u2019s not a reason to prosecute people trying to save lives at safe injection sites.\n\nThere is at least one unauthorized, invitation-only site in the United States that a small nonprofit has been secretly running, in an unadvertised location, for more than three years. Staff members have been able to reverse all eight overdoses that have occurred on-site.\n\nCritics of such sites raise legitimate concerns about normalizing drug use that could be fatal. But so far, the wealth of available evidence shows two things: Most of America\u2019s past policies have failed catastrophically, and the regions that have tried these sites have saved people.\n\nStates and other cities should follow the lead of Seattle and Philadelphia to open safe injection sites. One of the most meaningful things the Trump administration could do to help drug users and their families is to stay out of the way.", "title": "Opinion | Let Cities Open Safe Injection Sites", "authors": []}

Do you put food out there for them?\u201d\n\nI went to the window to look. There are nine bird feeders around my house, but I\u2019ve never seen a robin at a single one of them. In winter, robins do gather in great flocks here in Middle Tennessee, and our yard is always popular with them because we have a birdbath with a heating element that keeps it from freezing. Even in winter, birds need to bathe \u2014 a seemingly counterintuitive behavior that keeps their feathers in shape for maximum insulation.\n\nSo it didn\u2019t surprise me to find more than a hundred robins in our yard on that snowy day. What surprised me was what they were doing. A robin\u2019s usual practice here is to pick earthworms out of the exposed soil churned up by moles in what passes for a lawn at this house, but there are no worms near the surface on freezing days. Instead, these robins were eating dried berries from the brown monkey grass bordering our front walkway. Normally one of our sons mows down the monkey grass in late fall, after the first frost, but our youngest child left for college in August, and this year neither my husband nor I ever got around to cutting it back ourselves.\n\nI have never been a very orderly gardener. In spring I prefer planting to weeding. I like to watch birds pulling seeds from dried flowers, so I let the flowers fall to ruin in summer instead of deadheading them to force the plant to produce new blooms. In fall it has always seemed almost criminal to tidy up the golden windfall of sugar-maple leaves covering the ground like pirate\u2019s treasure in a storybook, so we let them lie until they\u2019re finally brown and brittle. By then there\u2019s no good reason not to bring out the mower and reduce the leaves to shreds so they can feed the trees they fell from.", "title": "Opinion | Let Your Winter Garden Go Wild", "authors": []}

Beyond that, he tweeted, the knowledge that teachers have guns of their own would deter \u201cthe sicko\u201d from heading to a school in the first place. With his usual fondness for capital letters, he added, \u201cATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d\n\nThus did Mr. Trump parrot a tired shibboleth repeated once again on Thursday by Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. \u201cTo stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun,\u201d Mr. LaPierre told a gathering of conservative activists. Actually, it\u2019s hard to tell who was parroting whom.

In the United States, there are about 3.5 million elementary and secondary school teachers in public and private institutions. Arming 20 percent of them, as Mr. Trump suggested, would mean 700,000 or so teachers with Glocks and the like on their hips \u2014 an armed force half as large as America\u2019s real armed forces on active duty.

It was a goal that proved elusive \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t master the Quebecois accent, which was almost inscrutably nasal compared with the Parisian French I learned in high school. I stuttered through one quotidian exchange after another, painfully aware I was marking myself as a clumsy outsider. It was exhausting. Somewhat chastened, I gave up on French and turned my attention to a new language: Celsius.\n\nI gravitated toward Celsius for the same reason I had wanted to learn French: to experience the world through a foreign filter. Besides, I didn\u2019t really have a choice. Montreal is a bilingual city, but it uses just one temperature scale: Celsius. Of course, the same is true in every country aside from the United States and a few other global superpowers like the Cayman Islands and Belize. Using Fahrenheit in Canada was a sure way to brand myself not only as a recalcitrant American but also as a maniac. If you casually tell a friend who thinks in Celsius that it is 65 outside \u2014 nearly 150 degrees in Fahrenheit \u2014 and therefore a good day to go to the park, she will look at you as if you have misplaced your frontal lobe.\n\nMy hope was to internalize Celsius, not just to learn it but to feel it in my American flesh. The first thing I did to acquaint myself with it \u2014 forgoing that impossible conversion formula \u2014 was to memorize relative temperatures scattered throughout the scale so I could extrapolate from them. I was already aware, as most people are, that what I knew as 32 was 0, but I also came up with a few useful way stations: 10 in Celsius was 50 Fahrenheit; 21 was 70; 30 was 86. With this loose constellation of data points, I could safely guess that 15 degrees C, say, was about 60 degrees F, without constantly cross-referencing between the scales.\n\nScientists prefer Celsius because it integrates seamlessly with the metric system, but as a unit of measurement, it\u2019s far less precise than Fahrenheit. This laxity has its merits. For everyday use, it\u2019s an appealingly economical scale because it hovers mostly around 0, each unit packing a substantial punch. Still, it took me a while to regard Celsius as anything but absurd. \u201cSeven degrees outside,\u201d I\u2019d think to myself as I adjusted to the forecast. \u201cBalmy!\u201d Ian McEwan once pointed out that British tabloids like to capitalize on this dissonance, often reporting colder temperatures in Celsius and hotter ones in Fahrenheit, which makes for more sensational headlines.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Celsius", "authors": []}

I had been writing a book about a murder and was poring over autopsy files that I was struggling to understand. No nonscientist had ever taken the course, but I asked the university if I could enroll, too. Nervous before my first class, I took solace in thinking about the people who had offered up their bodies to us. What had once been taboo became a powerful gift.\n\nFor four weeks, in that cold, white cadaver room, we cut the woman on the table to parts. With a scalpel, I sliced open her back, then dropped chunks of her into a white Home Depot bucket we kept under the table, so her remains could be cremated and returned to her family. She had been embalmed less than the other cadavers, an attempt to see if the dead could be left more lifelike, and dissecting her was a struggle. At times I had to rip fascia from muscles with my fingers. Once a piece of her skin hit my goggles. My scrubs dampened with grease stains where my body heat liquefied her fat. At night, stripping off my scrubs, I\u2019d find bits of her embedded in the laces of my Converse sneakers. Was it she? It looked like jelly.\n\nSoon, when Janna and I slid into bed together at night, I could no longer press my face to the back of her neck or wrap my arms around her. When my lips touched the skin of her back, I\u2019d flinch from the memory of carving though the woman in the same place. When I cupped my hand around her and brought it to her breast, I\u2019d remember scraping away the fascia that bound the woman\u2019s chest wall, peeling it back and watching the breasts lift away as well. I had braced my palm between her ear and nose and sawed through her face. The day I lifted her brain, pale pink and quivering, from the back of her skull, I walked the streets alone for an hour after, dazed. Her brain was as soft as Jell-O. My thumb could have gone right through it.\n\nJanna and I broke up almost a year after that summer.

The humidifier whirs; the sky outside the window is pitch black except for the street lamp. The pillow smells of the lavender I\u2019ve sprinkled on it and the sweet sweat at the back of a warm neck.

My bare-bones freelancer health insurance meant that having the operation would have emptied out my bank account, and then some. (I had recently gotten out of debt, and I wasn\u2019t ready to be broke again just to feel a nebulous \u201cbetter.\u201d) I travel a lot for work, and there never seemed to be a right moment to take the six weeks off required for recovery. I, like most people, have a fear of extreme physical pain. But draped over all of those rationalizations was my most powerful and seductive weakness: denial. I was fine! I didn\u2019t even know what anyone was talking about! I was fine!\n\nSo instead I struggled through my existence in partial pain. The symptoms had built up over time, and I had simply grown accustomed to feeling bad. A lot of people spend their lives in pain, often because our upbringing or gender or religion or self-esteem decrees that we deserve to suffer through it, that we aren\u2019t entitled to feel good \u2014 perhaps women more than most. Nearly our entire lives, from the first day we get our periods until menopause, we trade gestures of sympathy over menstrual cramps, a bond that is both heartening and depressing: We\u2019re destined to feel this way forever, so we might as well get used to it.\n\nBut then, through some confluence of events, a mental shift occurred in me. First, I signed a book deal, so I had a little money in the bank. Next, I moved to a new city, got new health insurance and a new doctor. During my first appointment, she felt around inside of me and instantly sensed trouble. \u201cDo you feel ... O.K.?\u201d she asked, before informing me that, among all the other problems of which I was already aware, I had a tipped uterus, which was likely the source of additional pain. Something about a complete stranger\u2019s pointing out even more gynecological issues forced me to admit that in fact I was not O.K. I did not feel good, and I needed to fix it, desperately.\n\nThat week, we scheduled the hysterectomy for just after the new year. Within a month, my uterus was gone. This thing that had tortured me for years had disappeared, in a snap. It took me six months to fully recover, but then, that was it: I hadn\u2019t understood I could just feel better.\n\nAnd then I couldn\u2019t stop feeling better. I felt so good that I nearly forgot what it was like to feel bad in the first place. For years, I\u2019d just accepted there would be times when my emotions and mood could be affected by the pain and hormones. There had often been a haziness that hung between my physical and emotional selves. Now a clearer and calmer version of me was in charge. The problem had been removed. I recognized I had the power to remove other things from my life that I\u2019d held onto for too long for all the wrong reasons, things that no longer worked and caused me pain or trouble. A leased apartment I hadn\u2019t lived in for a few years and had been renting out to a stranger? I closed up shop on it. The love letters I hadn\u2019t read in years but kept just because I liked the idea of being loved? I hadn\u2019t realized they were holding me back, so I tossed them unblinkingly.

A 2015 study conducted in part by James Cutting, a psychologist at Cornell University who chronicles the evolution of Hollywood cinematography, found that filmmakers have adapted their shooting styles to try to keep up with changes in our attention spans. Since the 1950s, the average shot time has dropped to less than four seconds from 12 seconds. Volume and cadence are manipulated to keep our eyes glued to the screen \u2014 think about the dubstep subwoofer beat drop that happens right before the tidal wave hits, or when a superhero performs an elaborate stunt involving an aerial body roll over a flaming vehicle.

But, as my fellow millennials know far too well, an ill-timed frost nips yesteryear\u2019s aspirations in the bud. Now is the time for \u201cWinter,\u201d a composition that, like the season, holds us in a tighter grip.\n\nI first heard \u201cWinter\u201d in 1985, when I was 4. A snow-laced mountain fog had settled over the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia. I sat alone in the living room, watching a cartoon movie called \u201cSarah and the Squirrel.\u201d It was not the lighthearted fare suggested by its title. Sarah\u2019s village is invaded by Nazis, and her family members are captured and taken to a concentration camp. She escapes the slaughter by hiding in a nearby forest. It is under these circumstances of genocide, starvation and exposure to the elements that she befriends (or perhaps hallucinates) a squirrel. In the cartoon\u2019s final frames, Sarah wanders alone and barefoot through the snow. All of these events are set to Vivaldi\u2019s \u201cWinter.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it took the usual route of earworms: Having heard the music, I was desperate to hear it again. Better yet, I wanted to learn to play it myself. I asked my parents for a violin for my fifth birthday. When no violin arrived, I asked for a violin for Christmas. Then again for my sixth birthday. Seventh. There were no violin teachers in our part of West Virginia, my parents explained. Not even Santa could fix this problem. Eventually the VHS of \u201cSarah and the Squirrel\u201d disappeared from the video-rental store\u2019s shelves. Yet \u2014 and to this day I can\u2019t quite explain why \u2014 \u201cWinter\u201d remained in my head.\n\nBefore I fell asleep each night, I mentally played the few notes I could remember. These sounds felt to me like a crucial directional aid, an encrypted message on a map of my future, an aural Polaris. In retrospect, the darkness of \u201cWinter\u201d conveyed something I could not articulate as a child, namely, the peculiar sadness of Appalachia, the isolation and the poverty. Many of my elementary-school classmates faced challenges like Sarah\u2019s: cold, hunger and abuse. In \u201cWinter\u2019s\u201d ominous chords, I heard validation; the world was harsher than suggested by the cheerful, Disneyfied kid-culture of the 1980s. The wild arpeggios of the violin sounded like an unspoken truth: Some good little children die in the snow.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Vivaldi\u2019s \u2018Winter\u2019", "authors": []}

And this project didn\u2019t make Elman popular. Back in the 1970s, being connected to the C.I.A. would not have been a reputation polisher; now it\u2019s largely a career enhancement. In the 1990s, Elman sent me the same photograph, featuring Matthiessen with Richard Wright, that you use as an illustration.

Mr. Bernstein, no one\u2019s idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.\n\nBut those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W.

But you can\u2019t lie to the F.B.I., and you can\u2019t lie to impede an investigation, thereby obstructing justice.\n\nEven aside from the investigation and any talk of collusion or obstruction, Trump is a danger to the nation in a multitude of other ways.\n\nWe have a manipulative liar with autocratic tendencies as the American president. He has enormous power and an enormous ego. He prioritizes his personal feelings and fortunes over the country\u2019s health and stability.", "title": "Opinion | Lie, Exploit and Destroy", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "The \u201cdossier,\u201d Mr. MacLeod explained, wasn\u2019t a leaked internal United Nations report. It was a two-page memo he had written for the British government long after he left the United Nations\u2019 employ, plus the text of an email he had sent to people he hoped would support a new nonprofit he and some lawyer colleagues were founding to work on this issue.\n\nMore important, the terrifying numbers the memo cited were just rough guesses intended to hint at the scale of the problem, not actual measurements.\n\nTake that estimate of 60,000 rapes, for instance. For one thing, it was actually an estimate of the number of victims of all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation, not just rape.\n\nTo arrive at that figure, Mr. MacLeod said, he started with a 2017 report in which the United Nations said it had recorded 311 victims of sexual exploitation by peacekeepers in the previous year. He then made a series of assumptions that led him from 311 reported cases to his headline-grabbing claim of 60,000. But those assumptions were little more than guesses, and Mr. MacLeod freely admits he has no hard data to back them up.\n\nThe first assumption was based on a remark by the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, that the problem of sexual abuse was probably worse on the civilian side of the organization than within the peacekeeping forces. Mr. MacLeod concluded that this meant there must be at least 312 victims of the non-peacekeeping staff \u2014 311 plus 1 \u2014 but to keep his \u201cestimate\u201d conservative, he put the number at 289, to arrive at an even 600 for the year. Needless to say, that kind of rounded guess based on an offhand statement is unlikely to be reliable.\n\nFrom there, Mr. MacLeod estimated that only 10 percent of the assaults were actually recorded, a figure he said was based on reporting rates in the United Kingdom, to arrive at a figure of 6,000 victims annually. But because the United Nations doesn\u2019t have good (or possibly any) data about the rate at which victims report assaults by its staff, there\u2019s no way to know if that was the right multiplier to use.\n\nThen, to arrive at an estimate for the decade, Mr. MacLeod assumed that 2016 was a representative year, so he multiplied 6,000 by 10.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresto: 311 becomes 60,000.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nIn Mr. MacLeod\u2019s telling, he always intended his memo to be an advocacy statement rather than what he called \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d statistical analysis \u2014 essentially a way to say \u201chere is a problem that is very large and very bad\u201d (my phrase), with digits instead of words.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But we aren\u2019t trained statisticians, so we can\u2019t necessarily perform independent checks of every figure experts provide to us. And sometimes numbers manage to enter the news ecosystem so quickly and pervasively that our fact checks can\u2019t keep up.\n\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, for instance, you may have seen the viral statistic that America had experienced 18 school shootings already this calendar year.\n\nIn fact, it turns out, that number was misleading. It came from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control organization, whose definition of \u201cschool shootings\u201d is far broader than the common understanding of the term. It counts every time a person fires a gun in or near a school building as a \u201cschool shooting,\u201d including a suicide in Michigan that took place outside a shuttered, empty school.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, of course, that such events are not upsetting and tragic in their own right. But they are not what people imagine when they hear the term \u201cschool shooting.\u201d So the statistic, without context, was misleading.\n\nThe Washington Post eventually published a careful debunking of Everytown\u2019s figures. But by that time, the number had already been tweeted by Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, and cited by news organizations including MSNBC, the BBC, NBC News, ABC News and CBS News.\n\nThat matters. Numbers, if trustworthy, are a way to make reporting more rigorous and objective, and to show that a story is based on cold hard facts rather than a handful of anecdotes. And when a number is big and splashy, like Mr. MacLeod\u2019s 60,000 victims or Everytown\u2019s 18 school shootings, it can make a point very powerfully.\n\nWhen people see a number in the paper or on a trusted news program, they tend to believe that it\u2019s valid, especially if an expert is cited as the source. They don\u2019t see an advocacy statement. They see rigor and objectivity, even if none actually exist. The result is that a number will often be taken much more seriously than an advocacy statement would be.\n\nThat\u2019s all the more true if the story gets picked up by other news outlets. Mr. MacLeod, who has appeared on television and given other print interviews, seems to be everywhere. And the more he gets quoted, the more authoritative he seems to be.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first problem with that, of course, is that the public is now under the mistaken impression that a reliable whistle-blower investigation has concluded that the United Nations is harboring thousands of predators, when in fact it was just a back-of-the-envelope sketch of the size of the problem. It\u2019s entirely possible that the number of victims is much, much higher. It also might be much lower. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nBut even more worrying is the way that bad information, like bad money, drives out good.\n\n\u201cThose of us who work on this issue know that if we take one misstep, the men who abuse will use it against us to make sure nothing changes,\u201d Sarah Martin, a consultant who wrote a 2005 report on sexual assault and exploitation by members of United Nations peacekeeping missions, said by email.\n\nMs. Martin, who has advised the United Nations and other international aid organizations on gender-based violence, said she and her colleagues feared that Mr. MacLeod\u2019s figures would provide exactly that kind of excuse, distracting from the less splashy but more reliable information that is already available.\n\n\u201cI have heard so many horrific stories from women that I don\u2019t need false statistics waved around,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cIt discredits the very brave women and children who struggle to come forward and then do \u2014 usually to disbelief and disinterest.\u201d", "title": "Lies, Damned Lies, and One Very Misleading Statistic", "authors": ["Amanda Taub", "The Interpreter"]}

In September 2001, they put that house up for sale, hoping to buy a larger one for their growing family and use some proceeds to start their own bakery. But they lost money on the sale and instead moved into a duplex owned by her mother, who also lived there.\n\nThey stayed in the home for 10 years. \u201cWe had little privacy and in retrospect, that was hard on the marriage,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cAt the time that wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d\n\nHow were the early years?\n\nIn 2004 they started their bakery.

Ms. Marchais, a collector of Tibetan and Indian artifacts, built the fieldstone complex and terraced garden next to her home in the style of a Himalayan Buddhist monastery, with rocks handpicked on road trips around Staten Island. She died only months after it opened in 1948. Today the museum offers rotating exhibitions and tai chi and meditation classes that residents enjoy.\n\nJust beyond the neighborhood\u2019s southern border is Historic Richmond Town, a museum complex with about 30 antique buildings and frequent culinary and cultural events. The Amess\u00e9s said they like to round up friends and walk to its tavern concerts and chili cook-offs.\n\nLighthouse Hill is also the beneficiary of the only Frank Lloyd Wright house in New York City.

Mr. Morace and his wife, Allison, spent a year sifting through the sparse housing inventory before they found a way back onto Lighthouse Hill.

Though the streets were laid out in the first decade of the 20th century, when the area was known as Richmond Hill, Lighthouse Hill wasn\u2019t developed in earnest until enough cars came along to move residents comfortably up the slope, said Barnett Shepherd, a local architectural historian. As a result, it has the feeling of a midcentury suburb. Detached single-family homes sit on neatly tended lots when they\u2019re not clinging to the edge of a cliff, and there are few sidewalks along the winding streets.\n\nHere one finds brick-and-shingle ranch houses, Arts and Crafts cottages, baby Dutch colonials and flat-roofed modernist retorts to convention. Several of these last, Mr. Shepherd said, are the 1940s work of an architect named Matthew Leizer, who later moved to Los Angeles.\n\nHistoric homes include the Nathaniel J. and Ann C. Wyeth house, an 1856 Italianate brick cube with a cupola at 190 Meisner Avenue. The original circular driveway remains from the pre-automobile era, when coaches needed to turn around without backing up, Mr. Shepherd noted.\n\nAnd despite scant opportunities for development, new homes are rising, too. A quartet of houses in the Lighthouse Rise Estates project on Lowell Street were recently listed at $1,699,999 each. The homes will have four bedrooms with en-suite baths and 6,800-square-foot lots.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat the neighborhood lacks is any kind of commercial district. Residents drive less than 10 minutes to Clarke Avenue in Richmondtown, where the shops include a NetCost Market that specializes in foods from Russia and Eastern Europe. The Staten Island Mall is less than 15 minutes away.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\n\nMimi Neuhaus, an owner of Neuhaus Realty on Richmond Road and a neighborhood resident for more than 40 years, said the increase in prices reflects rising values everywhere in Staten Island. What is unique, she added, is Lighthouse Hill\u2019s small size \u2014 only 250 families \u2014 which drives up demand.\n\nAccording to data published on the real estate site Trulia, the median sales price of Lighthouse Hill homes as of August 2017 was $785,000, a year-on-year increase of 4 percent, based on 61 transactions and boundaries that extend somewhat northeast of Rockland Avenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs of Feb. 5, four homes were listed for sale, including the three-bedroom house at 340 Lighthouse Avenue that belonged to Jacques Marchais. The 1925 Dutch Colonial-style building, which has stained glass, a terraced garden and a separate one-bedroom cottage, is priced at $1.25 million.\n\nThe Vibe\n\nWith its big sky, big views and ivy-covered tree trunks, the neighborhood benefits from being somewhat remote and wrapped in greenery. Still, a car or a powerful interest in aerobic exercise is advisable.\n\nThe Schools\n\nThe small community lacks public schools, but they are not far away.\n\nP.S. 23, Richmondtown School, approximately a mile south, has about 560 students in prekindergarten through sixth grade.

Eighteen states, including Florida, and the District of Columbia are considering such laws this year, according to a list compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\u201cTo claim, \u2018Oh, well, you should see the signs and tell law enforcement,\u2019 to me is disingenuous unless there is something law enforcement can do,\u201d said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nRed flag laws, she said, \u201cprovide a path to remove guns from somebody in a temporary crisis.\u201d And, she said, even if a family decides not to seek a gun restraining order, the fact that the option exists can prompt frank conversations with struggling relatives.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Trump and Republican lawmakers have long tried to steer the national conversation after mass shootings to the mental health of people pulling the triggers, rather than the weapons they used. That effort is belied by the fact that mental illness is not the root of most cases of gun violence, though it does pose an increased risk for suicide.\n\nAs reactions poured in Thursday, Mr. Trump focused on the suspect\u2019s mental health, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he wanted the Justice Department to study how mental illness and gun violence intersect. He said it would help law enforcement better understand how law enforcement can use existing laws to intervene before school shootings happen.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be denied that something dangerous and unhealthy is happening in our country,\u201d Mr. Sessions told a group of sheriffs in Washington. In \u201cevery one of these cases, we\u2019ve had advance indications and perhaps we haven\u2019t been effective enough in intervening.\u201d\n\nSecretary Alex M. Azar II of the Department of Health and Human Services began a multiagency news conference on the flu epidemic by addressing the Florida shootings. The administration would be \u201claser-focused on getting Americans with mental illness the help they need,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe suspect in the Florida shooting, Nikolas Cruz, 19, had been expelled from the high school, and many former classmates avoided him, convinced he was dangerous. He was also apparently showing signs of depression, having recently lost his mother.\n\nIn an analysis of some 350 mass killers going back a century, about 22 percent were found to likely have had psychosis; the rate in the general population is closer to 1 percent. A much smaller percentage had severe depression; so far there is no evidence Mr. Cruz had psychosis.\n\nFederal law forbids people who have been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital and people found to be a danger to themselves or others from having guns. But the federal government depends on states to report such cases so it can add them to a national background check system, and reporting varies widely.\n\nFlorida has entered 141,042 mental health records into the national background check system, according to the Brady Campaign. Wyoming, on the other hand, has entered four.\n\nThe number of mental health records in the system has grown rapidly, to 5.2 million in 2018 from 234,628 in 2005, the Brady Campaign said.\n\nBut after 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, the Obama administration tried to add some people to the background check system, by requiring the Social Security Administration to submit records of some beneficiaries with severe mental illness.\n\nLast year, Mr. Trump quietly revoked that rule, which was also opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nSome states have tried to create their own databases of people deemed too mentally unstable to carry firearms. New York, one of the most restrictive states in the country, had put 34,500 names on its list by 2014, a figure that raised concerns among some mental health advocates that too many people had been categorized as dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that approach has largely fallen out of favor, with more states turning to red flag laws that focus not on a mental health diagnosis but rather on dangerous behavior.\n\nThey bloomed in several states after the Isla Vista shooting in 2014, in which a disturbed man killed six University of California, Santa Barbara students after his family had tried unsuccessfully to alert the authorities about his troubling behavior.\n\nThe laws typically allow the police or family members to petition a court for a temporary gun restraining order that might last a few weeks. After a hearing in which the person can respond to evidence, a judge can issue a final order that typically lasts up to a year and can be renewed. The restraining orders usually allow the police to seize people\u2019s guns and restrict them from buying new ones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

The police can confine people considered a danger to themselves or others for up to 72 hours as part of an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. And the police are allowed to take their guns when they are detained. But a 2009 advisory opinion by the state\u2019s attorney general said that without an arrest or criminal charge, the police could not hold onto their weapons.\n\nMental health experts said the proposals raised by the sheriff and Mr. Scott provoked concerns.\n\n\u201cTo say no one with mental illness should have a gun \u2014 how do you accomplish that?\u201d said Ronald Honberg, senior policy adviser for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cDoes that mean anybody that goes to a therapist for depression or anxiety should be reported and put in a database and prohibited from purchasing a firearm?

They joke about their age difference \u2014 when she teases him for being a cradle robber, he calls her a grave robber. But while their relationship is playful and affectionate, his stature as a writer complicates Alice\u2019s own literary aspirations.\n\nIn a disorienting shift, the second section, \u201cMadness,\u201d is narrated by Amar Ala Jaafari, a young Iraqi-American economist who is detained by passport control at a London airport on his way to visit his brother in Iraqi Kurdistan. The final segment, \u201cEzra Blazer\u2019s Desert Island Discs,\u201d unfolds as a fictional interview segment on the BBC program, as a journalist asks Blazer about his writing and what music he would take to a desert island. His revealing answers about love, music and literature capture Mr. Roth\u2019s conversational voice perfectly, some people who know the author say.\n\nThere are subtle clues connecting the disjointed narrative strands, and recurring themes that take on new resonance as the novel progresses: the relationship between autobiography and fiction, the power of imagination, and how art can provoke empathy for people whose backgrounds and experiences diverge from our own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Halliday didn\u2019t exactly emerge fully-formed out of nowhere \u2014 she published a short story in The Paris Review in 2005, and forged connections in the literary world through her work as an agent. But she\u2019s had a surprising trajectory, and is something of a late bloomer, having spent nearly two decades working on her fiction largely in private before submitting a book for publication.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe grew up in a working-class family in Medfield, a small town in Massachusetts, where her father worked as a mechanic and repairman and her mother made a living as a seamstress. They divorced when she was 5, and she and her sister moved in with her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend, who started an extermination business together and later married.\n\nThey lived near the library, and in the summer she would spend her days there, reading E.B. White and Laura Ingalls Wilder and then Dickens, Fitzgerald and Edith Wharton. She excelled in school and went on to study art history at Harvard, becoming the first person in her immediate family to go to college.\n\nAfter graduating in 1998, she got a job as an assistant literary agent at the Wylie Agency and was soon promoted. Ms. Halliday became friendly with some of the writers represented by the agency, including the novelist Louise Erdrich, the poet Louise Gluck and Mr. Roth.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cYou know she\u2019s unusual immediately,\u201d Ms. Erdrich said of Ms. Halliday. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who has such precise syntax, it was like she was writing in the air.\u201d\n\nWorking with accomplished writers every day might intimidate some aspiring novelists, but Ms. Halliday found it exhilarating, and began to think about writing fiction.\n\n\u201cPrior to that, I thought there was some sort of magic involved, and that I just didn\u2019t have that magic,\u201d she said.\n\nShe started getting up at five in the morning to write. Mr. Roth\u2019s dedication to writing, the daily act and routine of it, made an impression on her, she said.\n\n\u201cHis example as a hard-working novelist was one of the most encouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of it is showing up even when you feel it\u2019s not working. He\u2019s very good at that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Halliday declined to say much about her relationship with Mr. Roth, beyond acknowledging that they were once romantically involved and remain friends, and she cautioned against reading Alice\u2019s story as autobiography.\n\n\u201cOf course there are details of Alice\u2019s life that overlap with my own, but so much is invented for the sake of the narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cPhilip, more than anyone, knows that\u2019s what writing is like.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Ms. Halliday left the agency to focus on fiction. She did some freelance editing and ghostwriting to support herself, so progress was slow.\n\nShe moved to Milan in 2011 with her husband, who works at an Italian publishing house, and began working on \u201cAsymmetry.\u201d When her agent submitted it to publishers in the summer of 2016, it sparked a heated auction between eight publishing houses.\n\nPublishers\u2019 enthusiasm \u2014 fueled partly, no doubt, by Ms. Halliday\u2019s intriguing back story \u2014 caught her off guard. In the years she spent working on the novel, Ms. Halliday often relied on advice that Ms. Erdrich gave her. \u201cShe said, \u2018write as though you\u2019re writing in secret, as though no one will actually read it\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nNow that her secret is out, Ms. Halliday no longer has the luxury of laboring in obscurity. She\u2019s already writing another novel, set partly in Italy, which explores how conspiracy theories take hold. It tackles a theme that has long preoccupied her: the blurred boundaries between fiction and reality.", "title": "Lisa Halliday\u2019s Debut Novel Is Drawing Comparisons to Philip Roth.

The federal government, which competes with private investors for available funds, plans to borrow almost $1 trillion this year, a big jump from last year\u2019s total of $519 billion, the Treasury said last week. That is a direct result of the decision to cut taxes without reducing federal spending. Indeed, the administration is now pushing for more spending on defense.\n\nMr. Trump also decided last year that he would not nominate Janet L. Yellen for a second term as Fed chairwoman. Instead, he nominated Jerome H. Powell, who was sworn into office on Monday as the market opened for business.\n\nMr. Powell, who had been a Fed governor since 2012, has emphasized continuity. But investors have a long history of anxiety about new Fed chairmen. During Alan Greenspan\u2019s first months in office in 1987, the stock market lost more than 30 percent of its value. And Mr. Powell is a relatively unknown quantity on Wall Street.\n\nStill, some analysts cautioned against overinterpreting the meaning of market movements.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, it is near impossible to figure out what moves the stock market in any given day,\u201d said N.

Anytime I work in Gaza or the West Bank, and must explain why the Trump administration is cutting funding to refugees. Every time I work with a Syrian refugee and must explain why we have a travel ban against Muslims. Over a decade ago, I climbed the stairs to my Baghdad hotel room thinking, how can I ever go home and live in a country that is so dedicated to occupation and regime change?\n\nBut there were other moments. I was walking down Rue de Rivoli in Paris on Sept. 11, 2001, when my phone rang. \u201cSomeone just flew a plane through the twin towers,\u201d a friend told me. The pain and despair I felt in the following days was matched by the private and public sympathy I felt from thousands of Parisians.\n\nWhen I served as the jury president for the prize for war reporting given in Bayeux, the first city to be liberated during the Battle of Normandy, the mayor showed me the expanse of American graves at the nearby military cemetery as a way of demonstrating what America meant to him, his family and his people.\n\nAs a liberal and human rights activist, I am cognizant of the dark times we live in.

The opportunity and social mobility that is more possible than in any other country where I have lived.\n\nWithout getting into Norman Rockwell platitudes, I see a determined pragmatism, a freshness that comes from growing up in America that only someone who spent years away from it can notice.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Eastern Ghouta showed great resilience and embraced innovative ways to survive. People continued growing food on their farms, and that partly helped keep hunger at bay. They found a way to breach the siege by digging a network of underground tunnels, some of which led to neighborhoods in Damascus and were used to smuggle in necessary commodities.\n\nNumerous conversations with friends and acquaintances still living there give me a fuller sense of how they survived. People recycled plastic garbage and extracted fuel from it. They used this fuel for the generators that had been smuggled in through the tunnels. The electricity this generated became essential to connect with satellite internet and the outside world. They ground fodder and used it as flour to bake bread; they toasted oats and used it to make a beverage to replace coffee. They embraced wild herbs, which were untouched in peace, as a staple vegetable. They turned the basements of hospitals and schools into storage facilities in the face of the barrel bombs.\n\nIn a cruel twist, the regime sought to extract profit by doing some business with the besieged populace. Muhyi Eddin Manfoush, a businessman connected to the Syrian Republican Guard headed by Mr. Assad\u2019s brother, Maher al-Assad, was allowed by the regime to sell flour, packaged food, butter, oil, tea and sugar, among other things, in the besieged area, according to several merchants in Eastern Ghouta.\n\nThe deal was that Mr. Manfoush would charge the besieged and impoverished buyers a tax beyond the usual price. For a kilogram of flour, sugar and rice he charged an extra 2,000 Syrian pounds, or about $4; for clothes, shoes and cleaning material he charged an extra 3,000 Syrian pounds, or about $6, according to multiple residents. But medicines, medical equipment, electronics and building equipment were strictly prohibited from entering the besieged area.\n\nThe people of Eastern Ghouta were left with few resources and a terribly depleted capacity to buy anything. The few sources of support were financial aid from a group of NGOs and some religious networks. By 2017, the fourth year of the siege, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces had taken control of many neighborhoods from the rebels. In March, the regime took Barzeh and Qaboun, two neighborhoods in Damascus that were crucial for the survival of the besieged areas. The tunnels that the opposition had dug to bring in supplies led from Eastern Ghouta to Barzeh and Qaboun. Mr. Assad\u2019s forces destroyed the tunnel network and blocked the supplies.\n\nWithin days of the fall of Barzeh and Qaboun, the price of diesel jumped to about $10 per liter from about 63 cents per liter. The season for harvesting crops and planting vegetables was days away. The farmers couldn\u2019t afford the fuel for their agricultural tools \u2014 generators, water pumps, tractors. They simply couldn\u2019t water their lands or even harvest the crops.\n\nThe failure to cultivate and harvest the local produce, the destruction of the tunnel system and the relentless siege pushed the cost of living punitively higher. In October, according to various residents and activists in Eastern Ghouta, a kilogram of sugar cost 2,400 Syrian pounds, or about $5; a kilo of rice was 2,900 Syrian pounds, or about $5; a kilo of lentils was 2,000 Syrian, or about $5; a liter of frying oil was 3,000 Syrian pounds, or about $6.", "title": "Opinion | Living Under Assad\u2019s Siege", "authors": []}

An artist and professional pattern designer and seamstress, she moved to New York in the early 1980s from Toronto, after meeting her husband in the Revolutionary War re-enactment community.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2004, she lost both her husband and her job at a pattern company, where she had worked as a designer. The next few years were difficult.\n\nName: Deborah Woodbridge Age: 62Rent: $0, in exchange for providing tours three days a week from April through November, assisting with events, gardening, and doing basic maintenance and cleaning of the Conference House interiors, among other tasks. Occupation: Ms. Woodbridge is an artist, working mostly in acrylic, gold leaf and gold pen, and does custom sewing projects. Periodically, she also works as a bed stylist for Hollander Home Fashions, a producer of pillows, comforters and linens.Can anyone become a caretaker for a historic house? No. Resident caretakers must have years of relevant skills and experience, be available at all times for house-related issues and display a passion for the property, as well as submitting to a thorough background check and interview process.The Historic House Trust: A nonprofit organization, it works in tandem with the Parks Department to maintain and preserve 23 historic house sites in the city. There are no open positions for caretakers at the present time. Security: Ms. Woodbridge has had two would-be intruders over the years, though they seemed more interested in breaking than entering, she said, and ran off as soon as the alarm sounded. The alarm system, however, took some getting used to. She set it off accidentally shortly after moving in, with steam from a shower, and was shocked when a barrage of police and fire trucks pulled up. That\u2019s when she discovered that the alarm was hard-wired to the fire department. Her historical re-enactment and sewing skills: come in handy every September when the house hosts the 1776 Peace Conference celebration.The kitchen garden: is a replica of an 18th-century kitchen garden, with peppers, potatoes, beans, peas, lettuce and herbs. Visitors sometimes complain that the tomatoes she grows are anachronistic, but they had been introduced here by the end of the 18th century, she said.Living off the last stop of the Staten Island Railroad: While some might have been hesitant to move so far from Manhattan, Ms. Woodbridge has lived in Staten Island since moving to New York in the early 1980s. First she lived in South Beach, by the Verrazano Bridge, before acclimating to the more suburban environs of Eltingville, followed by the somewhat rural ones of Tottenville.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband passed away; I lost a lot of solvency,\u201d she said. \u201cI was not floundering, but I was not in an ideal place. When I moved in here, I found the house and the greater connection to the seasons that I have here to be very stabilizing.\u201d\n\nHer contract, which is renewed on an annual basis, stipulates that she give tours between early April and early December on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, from 1 to 4 p.m. She also gives them by appointment and occasionally by happenstance, if she has the time and inclination. She dusts and vacuums, repairs broken furniture, maintains the kitchen garden and donates what she once calculated to be in the high hundreds of hours each year beyond her duties.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe has, for example, worked with the board to organize a number of concerts, art shows and literary events at the house. Her sewing skills have also come in handy: In the museum\u2019s upstairs bedrooms, she made new bedcovers, hangings and drapes, researching historically accurate fabrics before taking measurements, making the patterns and sewing them.\n\n\u201cBasically, this house comes first, then everything else,\u201d Ms. Woodbridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they particularly say that, but you\u2019re here and given a big responsibility.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe two-bedroom apartment where Ms. Woodbridge lives was a 1740s addition on the back of the Conference House, originally used as a summer kitchen and servants\u2019 quarters. She has a big kitchen and living room on the first floor and two bedrooms upstairs, under the eaves.\n\nWhile her apartment is not part of the museum, she sometimes offers up her bathroom during events held at the house, since the property\u2019s only public bathroom is in the visitor center, a few hundred yards away.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis may have led to a recent decision to remodel her bathroom. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s a table by Kohler in the living room and a toilet in a box,\u201d she said.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "For the bulk of this production, Mr. Eyre and his company, which includes an impassioned Jeremy Irons in a rare West End appearance, hit every note one could wish for on a spectrum encompassing dissolution and devotion, affection and an abiding frustration that has curdled into something resembling rage. (Intriguingly, Rob Howell\u2019s semitransparent set suggests regions unknown, as if the emotions of this particular hothouse cannot be contained.)\n\nFrom the very start, the actors, talking over and across one another, convey a family so attuned to one another\u2019s rhythms that they can anticipate the next sentence. This approach echoes the one taken more than 30 years ago by the director Jonathan Miller in a production that starred a peculiarly cast Jack Lemmon, and it serves the practical purpose of eating away at what can \u2014 in sleepier, slower hands \u2014 result in a four-hour running time. (This production clocks in at three and a half hours, including intermission.)\n\nThere\u2019s a near-Chekhovian sense of self-inquiry to Mary\u2019s ceaseless monitoring of her state of mind, not to mention her gathering panic at her rheumatic fingers. An Oscar nominee for her tight-lipped turn as Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019s sister in \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Ms. Manville has reaffirmed my growing belief that \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey\u201d is Mary\u2019s play \u2014 and one has a feeling that O\u2019Neill wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. (I suspect that he would also appreciate Mr. Irons as the rare James Tyrone who really fits the onetime dashing theatrical titan described so fully in the text.)\n\nThe sense that Mary rules the roost is in no way meant to diminish the company around her, although Rory Keenan and Matthew Beard, playing the variably infirm and combative Tyrone sons, don\u2019t quite deliver the scathing force of their 11th-hour face-off. That\u2019s the defining scene in which Mr. Keenan\u2019s Jamie finds it within himself to advise Mr. Beard\u2019s consumptive and willowy Edmund to beware a wastrel older brother in gathering thrall to drink. Both actors may find a deeper connection with time: They are new to this production, first seen in April 2016 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Bristol Old Vic (Mr. Irons trained at the theater school there).\n\nMr. Beard, a 2015 Tony nominee, has the advantage of looking as if he could be a child of Mr. Irons and Ms. Manville, and he is at his best in Edmund\u2019s revelatory encounters with each parent in turn. As Ms. Manville\u2019s Mary clucks over Edmund like some deeply haunted mother hen, one clocks the affinity between a son on deathwatch and a mother delivering herself into an oblivion that can be said to constitute a living death.", "title": "Loneliness and Loss Made Gloriously Alive in 2 Classic Dramas", "authors": []}

They are considered a better-than-average contender to qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament even as they face new accusations of improper recruiting.\n\nSeveral months ago, Louisville was one of six programs \u2014 and perhaps the most prominently figured \u2014 implicated in a broad bribery and corruption scheme outlined by federal investigators. In one complaint, investigators described a partnership involving Louisville basketball coaches and several other parties, including a former executive at Adidas, the apparel company that sponsors Louisville\u2019s teams, in which they planned to funnel $100,000 to the family of a recruit in exchange for his commitment to the Cardinals.\n\nThat scandal led to the ouster of Pitino and Louisville\u2019s athletic director, Tom Jurich, by the university\u2019s board.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "Sometimes the most clich\u00e9 thing about a romance novel is its cover and title. Take Julia London\u2019s latest: A ripped Lucifer in a kilt smolders darkly from the cover, and DEVIL IN TARTAN (Harlequin) renders the image in blunt syllables. But this is the fine yarn-spinner London here, and what follows is a rollicking seafaring adventure that feels fresh. Talk about meet cute: A perfectly paced farcical sequence puts the sea captain Aulay Mackenzie (he of the kilt) on a literal collision course with a hapless bunch of bootleggers led by Lottie Livingstone, who steps up to lead her clan after her father is gravely wounded. Lottie\u2019s ship is sinking, but rather than let the hero sail to her rescue, this heroine engineers her own. The audacity of her plan propels the plot, but despite the outwardly comical circumstances, the developing relationship is serious from the start. Lottie\u2019s sense of loyalty, justice and responsibility are equal to Aulay\u2019s \u2014 and he honors that equality in his acceptance of the fate that may await her for her crime. That makes the prospect of a happy ending as hard to see as a ghost ship through the Highland mists.

Jane Denning writes young-adult novels, is a Comicon geek and, five years after a bad breakup, considers herself permanently single. On bridesmaid duty, Jane volunteers to keep a close eye on the groom\u2019s bad-boy brother, who has just been discharged from the Army, not honorably, and has shown up to cause trouble, or so the bridal party assumes. Wounded warriors are popular romance heroes, and Cameron MacKinnon makes a credible one. His feminist bona fides can seem piled on for a hypermasculine hero. As Jane obsesses about her weight, Cameron muses about the faults of \u201cthe patriarchy.\u201d But Holiday manages to keep things super-steamy even when Cameron, who has just told Jane that he doesn\u2019t do \u201cdrunk hookups,\u201d continues, \u201cBecause there\u2019s this little thing called consent?\u201d Romance fiction didn\u2019t go carnal until the 1970s, and consent was just a gleam in a good girl\u2019s eye. These days, even if the real world is slow to progress, consent is practically a fixture in the genre.\n\nIn Krentz\u2019s excellent new novel of romantic suspense, PROMISE NOT TO TELL (Berkley), Virginia Troy, a Seattle art gallery owner troubled by the suspicious suicide of a painter she represents, enlists the aid of Cabot Sutter, a private investigator, to look into their shared past as children who grew up in a cult. The psychopathic cult leader who tried to incinerate them at his compound succeeded in killing their parents, and now Virginia and Cabot are teaming up to see if he still lives, but also revisiting the scarring trauma that has stunted both their lives for decades. Yes, even two individuals as damaged as these can win, together. It is possible to be so absorbed by the quickening plot here that you overlook the unfolding of the relationship, which is subtler, gentler than it is in many romances. Most people put up walls of some sort, but Virginia and Cabot share a wall, so they need only each chip away half to reach the other. Consent, once again, is explicit. Virginia\u2019s panic attacks have resulted in several abortive attempts to have sex, but Cabot is the hero you want in this situation: \u201cWe can go this far and stop as often as you want,\u201d he says, a line all too often consigned to fiction.\n\nIf a romance novel must have a happy ending, a corollary is that half of any new batch of romances must feature a duke. Hardly a trope goes unturned in A DUKE IN SHINING ARMOR (Avon) by Loretta Chase. There\u2019s the confirmed rake, the bluestocking spinster, the runaway bride, the runaway dog. But Chase\u2019s dependable wit leads a reader willingly on a merry romp as Lady Olympia Hightower, not a little drunk, escapes her nuptials to one duke only to be pursued by his best friend, also a duke. When the wouldn\u2019t-be bride tumbles out the window, so does the Duke of Ripley\u2019s honor; he\u2019d meant only to retrieve the lady for his friend, not fall for her himself. The tale is on the anodyne side (read the classic \u201cLord of Scoundrels\u201d for the author at her most hilariously inventive); still, Chase\u2019s consistent gift is to gently puncture all the genre\u2019s conventions but one: the one that makes you care about her Regency hero and heroine and their happy ever after.\n\nBut enough of dukes; the prince takes the prize. Alyssa Cole\u2019s A PRINCESS IN THEORY (Avon) is the best new romance I\u2019ve read in a while. In Cole\u2019s contemporary story, Naledi Smith is an overworked epidemiologist studying for her doctorate in New York. She\u2019s an orphan with too much debt, too little sleep and no love in her life. To add to her discontents, some scammer has been emailing her to say that she has been betrothed from childhood to an African prince and that it is past time she fulfill her destiny. She declines to take the bait, but the prince comes calling anyway, just not as a royal. Prince Thabiso of Thesolo, a small African kingdom, masquerades as Jamal, Naledi\u2019s underemployed temporary neighbor who invites her to share the dinner he\u2019s ordered from a meal-kit service. Their relationship blossoms sweetly and sexily. Apart from his big deception, the prince is a near perfect hero to Naledi\u2019s science nerd. This novel checks a lot of boxes \u2014 STEM girls, gaslighting, science deniers, explicit consent in the bedroom, mineral exploitation in Africa \u2014 but it\u2019s more organic than obtrusive. Delightful details abound, especially when the scene shifts from New York to Africa (Segways to scoot around the royal palace, anyone?). There\u2019s even a nod to real-life royals. A redheaded playboy pal of Thabiso\u2019s is suspiciously reminiscent of Prince Harry \u2014 \u201cPrince Johan\u201d was once caught on tape playing strip poker.

{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "One idea addresses an issue that many consider fundamentally unjust: Consumers are increasingly being asked to pay a greater portion of their drug costs, but they don\u2019t get discounts that drug manufacturers offer to health insurers.\n\nThe proposal, first floated by federal officials last November, would give at least a portion of that discount to people in Medicare drug plans at the pharmacy counter. The move could lower out-of-pocket costs for people with high drug bills, but would increase the cost of these Medicare plans, offered by private insurers, for everyone. The idea seems to have the support of the Trump administration, including the new health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, a former Eli Lilly executive.\n\nThe proposal, which does not need congressional approval, represents the latest clash between powerful health care industries that are engaged in a war for the moral high ground over rising drug prices. The pharmaceutical industry, backed by influential members of the Trump administration, has been lobbying hard for the change, betting that it would act as an escape valve for patients\u2019 anger over drug costs while preserving drug makers\u2019 freedom to set any price they want.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy contrast, the insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, which oversee drug plans, are loathe to part with what amounts to billions of dollars in rebate windfalls, arguing that it will lead to higher prices.\n\nThe change could present a tidy solution for Mr. Trump, who has come under fire for doing little to follow through on his pledge to lower drug prices, even as he has installed several former drug industry executives in prominent government roles. But it would cost the government money \u2014 up to $82.1 billion over the next decade, according to its own estimates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his address to Congress last month, Mr. Trump reiterated that lowering drug prices was \u201cone of my greatest priorities,\u201d and promised: \u201cPrices will come down.\u201d\n\nIn a press briefing, Mr. Azar signaled his support of passing on rebates to customers. As a government lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Azar oversaw the launch of the Medicare drug program.\n\nInsurers\u2019 rising use of manufacturer rebates has been a longstanding concern of federal officials, including those in the Obama administration who issued a report on the matter one day before Mr. Trump took office.\n\nAny decision by the federal government is likely to reverberate through the country\u2019s health care system, given that many people with employer-provided health insurance are exposed to the same inflated prices. Already, some private insurers are beginning to offer such rebates to customers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very basic question here about the role of insurance and health care,\u201d said Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who supports the change. \u201cWe are still uncertain in the United States how much the sick should carry their own weight economically, versus the many should chip in financially to protect those who are sick. That\u2019s what this debate is about.\u201d\n\nPatients like Antoinette Lopez are the ones caught in the crossfire.\n\nMs. Lopez, 70, takes Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis, and she\u2019s watched in frustration as her out-of-pocket costs have risen along with the drug\u2019s list price. In 2015, she paid $4,547 for 10 months of Enbrel. This year, she expects to pay $5,941 for the same period.\n\nBut the insurer that oversees her drug plan, Humana, is pocketing hundreds of dollars every time she fills her prescription from Amgen, which makes Enbrel. Ms. Lopez will never see that money \u2014 the rebates are instead applied across the board to keep premiums low for all of the people enrolled in Humana\u2019s Medicare plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gouging,\u201d said Ms. Lopez, a retired nurse administrator from Athens, Georgia who blames insurers and drug makers. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But everyone would pay higher premiums, which Medicare estimates would increase anywhere from $14 to $44 a month.\n\nMark Merritt, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the trade group for pharmacy benefit managers, dislikes the proposal and believes the Medicare coverage is a \u201csound program.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to destabilize the program or inadvertently make things worse,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even as Medicare\u2019s drug coverage gets high marks, those who rely on expensive medications are exposed to spiraling drug prices.\n\nHigher prices have led insurers to push more of the cost onto consumers, by imposing high deductibles or requiring that people pay a percentage of a sale price at the pharmacy, not what the insurer pays for the drug after discounts. The administration is expected on Monday to propose placing a cap on out-of-pocket spending in Medicare drug plans, because without one some people pay tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThere is a yawning gap between the list price of a drug, which is close to what the consumer typically pays, and the net price, which insurers pay, that is getting larger.\n\nThis has led to a huge increase in the amount of the rebates collected by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nWhile insurers contend that most of the rebate money is used to lower premiums, the middlemen also pocket a percentage of those rebates, increasing their profits grow as the list price rises.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built this incredibly complex, hard-to-understand machine,\u201d said Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, a research firm. \u201cEveryone in the system benefits from this pricing strategy, but it\u2019s not necessarily sensible or sending the right price signals to the consumer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry says the growing share of rebates is evidence they are working to keep drug costs low. \u201cWe are lowering the prices through greater and greater rebates and discounts, and they\u2019re not giving those to patients,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group.\n\nMark Hamelburg, the senior vice president of federal programs for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group, said the new proposal is little more than a smoke screen by the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of that general effort to change the focus away from the true problem,\u201d he said.\n\nMany who oppose the idea point out that it won\u2019t help everyone because not every drug comes with a large rebate. Many new cancer treatments, as well as products that treat rare diseases, are not discounted at all.\n\nMany of those offering Part D plans say they do not want to raise premiums for everyone to lower the costs for a few. \u201cMandating rebates be applied at the point of sale would increase costs for the vast majority of seniors in Part D, taxpayers and the government, while benefiting drug manufacturers,\u201d said Carolyn Castel, a spokeswoman for CVS Health, one of the largest pharmacy managers, in an email.\n\nSome large employers have already begun experimenting with offering employees rebates at the pharmacy counter. Despite its opposition to the Medicare proposal, CVS is offering such rebates to commercial clients, like large employers, and has offered the rebates to its employees since 2013.\n\nMs. Lopez, meanwhile, said she would appreciate some help. Amgen raised the list price of Enbrel by 9.7 percent in January. \u201cI think anything that would make the total costs of high drug costs go down, even if the premiums went up a little bit, would offset it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the solution seems like \u201csome sort of Band-Aid, or temporary, feel-good fix,\u201d she said.", "title": "Lower Drug Prices: New Proposals Carry Lots of Promises", "authors": ["Katie Thomas", "Reed Abelson"]}

Ms. Durham was referring to how the $806,000 teapot had been entered by a longstanding private client who had acquired it in 2016 with a speculative online bid of about \u00a315, or $20, at an antiques auction in Lincolnshire, England. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for that internet bid, it probably would have ended up in a bin,\u201d Ms. Durham added.\n\nSubsequent research by Ms. Durham revealed that the teapot\u2019s Chinese-style \u201cman on the bridge\u201d decoration exactly matched that of two saucers in a six-piece tea service sold at a regional auction in England in 2002. Then cataloged to be by the Isleworth factory in England, they were later identified as being by Bartlam, based on comparison with porcelain fragments excavated in South Carolina. At least five of those pieces have now been acquired by American public and private collections. One of them was a tea bowl, which resold at Christie\u2019s in New York in 2013 for $146,500.\n\nBartlam gave the printed decoration of the teapot a distinctively American slant by including two sandhill cranes beneath a Sabal palmetto tree, both of which are indigenous to South Carolina. It remains a mystery, however, as to why the only surviving items of Bartlam porcelain discovered so far have been found in England. Ms. Frelinghuysen, the Met curator, and others have suggested that a Bartlam tea service might have been sent to England for promotional purposes.\n\n\u201cIn America they would have thrown away old porcelain, but in England it would have had novelty value,\u201d said Mr. Jellicoe, the successful bidder. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why someone hung onto it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rest of this 342-lot Salisbury ceramics auction was truer to the form of the mainstream Western porcelain market, in which huge quantities of antique pieces sell for relatively modest sums, if at all. Five lots before the Bartlam teapot sold, a blue and white teapot of about the same date, retaining its lid, but made in Worcester, England, rather than in America, sold for \u00a3500, or about $700. A dozen lots of 18th-century Bow porcelain figures, with estimates ranging from \u00a3400 to \u00a31,500, failed to sell.\n\n\u201cThe market has changed,\u201d said Michele Beiny, a specialist dealer in rare European porcelain who is based in New York. \u201cCeramics were more widely collected 50 years ago, and prices were higher.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerceptions that old ceramics were \u201cgranny\u2019s taste,\u201d a minimalist abhorrence of clutter and a decline in formal dining at home have all contributed to porcelain\u2019s falling out of fashion among collectors.\n\nBut specialists are hoping that the Met\u2019s $800,000 acquisition of the Bartlam teapot, and Christie\u2019s coming auctions in the spring of the collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller, will reinvigorate the market. Estimated to raise at least $500 million for Rockefeller charities, the sale will include more than 350 lots of opulent European porcelain.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Rockefeller had a taste for porcelain services, particularly those decorated with flora and fauna. These were bought mainly in the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s from dealers such as the Antique Porcelain Company, founded by Ms. Beiny\u2019s grandfather Hanns Weinberg and J. Rochelle-Thomas. They were used for dinners at the Rockefeller houses in New York City and Pontacino Hills, N.Y. according to Peter Johnson, the Rockefeller family historian.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen it came to porcelain, David had a lot of trouble controlling himself,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWhen he bought paintings, he was more judicious.\u201d The porcelain was purchased \u201cto be part of their daily lives,\u201d Mr. Johnson added, recalling that Henry Kissinger and the Shah of Iran were among the luminaries who ate off the Rockefellers\u2019 plates from prestigious factories such as S\u00e8vres, Meissen, Spode and Chelsea.\n\nMore than 60 services will be offered by Christie\u2019s. Estimates reflect current market values, rather than the prestige of the former owners, said Jody Wilkie, Christie\u2019s co-chairman of decorative arts. \u201cWe want the porcelain to raise money for Rockefeller charities,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most obviously desirable of these lots is a 28-piece S\u00e8vres \u201cMarly Rouge\u201d service made for Napoleon I, circa 1807-1809. Painted with the butterfly and insect motifs much loved by David Rockefeller, this is officially estimated to sell for $150,000 to $250,000. Even this seems a relatively modest valuation, given the ever-enduring cult surrounding Napoleon. In November, a single plate from the emperor\u2019s so-called Quartiers G\u00e9n\u00e9raux service sold for 40,000 euros, or about $49,000, at the French auction house Osenat at Fontainebleau, near Paris.\n\nBut elsewhere in the auction, Christie\u2019s estimates are revealing about porcelain\u2019s fall. Back in 1951, the Rockefellers paid $1,260 at J. Rochelle-Thomas for a 39-piece Derby gold-ground dessert service, dating from around 1815-20. In that same year, the New York gallerist Betty Parsons was selling Jackson Pollock paintings for less than $900. Christie\u2019s has given the service a current valuation of $10,000-$15,000. That doesn\u2019t buy much Pollock nowadays.\n\n\u201cEverything in our world comes in cycles,\u201d Ms. Wilkie said. \u201cThe idea that you can have pretty things to entertain your friends is coming back round.\u201d\n\nIn relative terms, there has probably never been a cheaper time to do this.

Kennedy. It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no \u201csporting purpose.\u201d It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales.\n\n\u25a0 After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers.

However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole.\n\n\u25a0 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it.\n\n\u25a0 In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33.

Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control.\n\nAccording to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths.

In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller.\n\nSince then, however, the United States\u2019 highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn choosing to not hear those cases, \u201cthe justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them,\u201d wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times.\n\nBut to what effect?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has \u201csuccessfully built in ineffectiveness\u201d to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy,\u201d Mr. Winkler said. \u201cThe laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals.\u201d\n\nThe gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place.\n\nChristopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.\n\n\u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\nMs. Feinstein\u2019s claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no anti-mass shooting law to test,\u201d said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIn terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test.\u201d", "title": "Major Shootings Led to Tougher Gun Laws, but to What End?", "authors": ["Linda Qiu", "Justin Bank"]}

Thompson, who teaches sociology at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Tex. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount for an individual, especially if you have other financial obligations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd the cost has gone up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe addition of destination bachelorette parties in particular has had an impact; there can be huge variations depending on if you\u2019re a local bridesmaid, or if you\u2019re from out of town.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an undeniably large cost, especially, as Dr. Thompson says, \u201cfor what amounts to four or five hours of a friend\u2019s life. It\u2019s a big commitment to ask of someone.\u201d\n\nMs. Blum says that couples often try to shoulder some of these costs to ease the burden. \u201cThere are so many variables on who pays for what,\u201d she said. \u201cShould you pay for the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses?

Or have them walk down the aisle and sit down. Do readings.

Both couples note that their close friends were neither hurt nor surprised by their decision to forgo a wedding party.\n\nSince getting engaged, Mr. Rosen and Ms. Safon have planned many details of their upcoming wedding \u2014 they\u2019ll be married on June 3, 2018 at the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park \u2014 but are still sorting out the ways in which they\u2019ll get their friends involved.

He had simply put the wine into one-gallon glass jugs, covered them tightly with white cotton cloth and left them on top of his refrigerator for an entire year.\n\nSo last spring, I got myself a one-gallon stoneware crock with a spigot. While doing a modest bit of online research, I noticed references to a vinegar mother, something akin to a sourdough starter, that would get fermentation going and speed the vinegar along. A timeline of a few months seemed more attractive than Tony\u2019s patient year.\n\nMany online references point to Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, which is bottled unfiltered, with the mother, as a good starter. But a mother for red-wine vinegar was not as easy to find. Luckily, Kevin Pike, a wine importer who also makes vinegar, pointed me in the direction of Supreme Vinegar, which sells mothers for wine vinegar. Problem solved.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith great anticipation, following directions from Supreme Vinegar, I combined eight ounces of the mother with the same amount of water and 16 ounces of red wine to make a test batch. But that seemed not enough wine, so I doubled the amount. I covered the top of the crock with cheesecloth, stretched a rubber band around the rim and left it in a dark corner of our Manhattan apartment. The directions advised leaving it for six to 12 weeks. I was imagining gifts of holiday vinegar for my friends.\n\nI gave it five weeks before checking. An enormous amount, maybe half, had evaporated, and the mother had formed a firm crust over the top. The vinegar smelled powerfully acetic and tasted overwhelmingly harsh. Thinking it needed to be diluted, I added another bottle and a half of red wine. Then I left it for another five weeks.\n\nMore evaporation. What remained was indeed vinegar, but it still tasted overpowering rather than gentle and lilting, like Tony\u2019s.

And I tried, but it was hard to be optimistic. For one thing, if I was in the vicinity of the crock, I could smell it. And the smell was as potent as ever. The acid aroma mocked me, eating away at my confidence.\n\nThen, in November, eight months from the start, I decided I needed to move it along. I lifted the crock from its corner and was surprised to find underneath it a thick, dark, crusted patch, as if a spill had occurred. Putting the crock in a sink, I removed the cheesecloth. The vinegar was practically all gone, except for the thick, matlike crust of the mother.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt could not have leaked. Had it evaporated? Had somebody accidentally spilled it? My wife and I had recently engaged a house cleaner who had left a trail of broken light bulbs and cracked soap dishes as evidence of her efforts.

I was determined to try again, though with Tony\u2019s laissez-faire approach. I scraped away the mother crust, rinsed the crock with wine and filled it.

If we took all of these stimulants away, would we still be able to think for ourselves, or would we lose the motivation to do so? This theme is one at the forefront of Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel, \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which I recently read for my Literature class. The story examines a dystopian society where books have been banned completely. The average people in this story seem to lack emotional complexity; they have no desire to read because they have been taught that books made people upset. In the novel, there are a few people who question the status quo, but the majority of people live in a state of blissful ignorance. Though the novel is meant to depict a contemporary society that Bradbury could not have predicted, there are elements of its narrative that are uncannily similar to our world. Specifically, the mindset of our leaders. Following the mandate from the president disallowing the use of seven scientific words by the CDC in budget documents, I read an article in the New York Times called \u201cThought Control, Trump-Style\u201d published on December 18, 2017. The Trump administration has almost completely erased any trace of the LGBT+ community on government websites and banned the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d from use by the Department of Agriculture. This virus has infected so many establishments that its ban on seven words in budget documents pales in comparison. Why are our leaders seeking to control the media we consume? Even the controversy of \u201cfake news\u201d is an attempt to restrict the press we see to only one side of the story. Our government has become a Mind Flayer of sorts: it sees itself as a superior race of thinkers and feels a need to dominate other beings to the point of mind control. This evil and fantastical government is what Ray Bradbury was trying to warn against in his novel. Complacency only breeds complacency. Congress will surely be more effective in passing legislation that Republicans are in favor of if the only news consumed by the American public leans to the far right, but what good does it do us as a society to all agree? American democracy is predicated on freedom of speech and the desire to seek knowledge. The very idea of precluding this information is a threat to our republic. It is scary to think that Bradbury saw signs of today\u2019s society almost seventy years ago. Perhaps even scarier is how many people in today\u2019s society have failed to become Guy Montags. It would be difficult to find someone who does not agree with the dangers presented in this book, but, unfortunately, it is not hard to find someone who agrees with the thought control of America\u2019s own Mind Flayer. If complacency breeds complacency, will deliberate minds produce deliberate actions?\n\nSamantha Jones, 16, Concord Carlisle Regional High School: \u201cWalden\u201d and \u201cDropping Out of College Into Life\u201d\n\nIt is fairly well known that Henry David Thoreau ventured off into Walden Woods to live in solidarity for two years. The purpose of this endeavor was not only to rid himself of society\u2019s frivolities but to see what the woods could teach him. Thoreau\u2019s philosophy on education was a central theme to his books, and details that learning through experience is far more beneficial than in a classroom. This belief parallels in Rainesford Stauffer\u2019s \u201cDropping Out of College Into Life,\u201d which accounts for her decision to leave college and why it was crucial to her education. In the article Stauffer explains school does not prepare students for failure, and instead teaches them to avoid it at all costs. From this, students develop a complex fear of failure early on in their academic careers.\n\nStauffer\u2019s story begins her freshman year of college, when she remembers this paralyzing fear. She recalls going from a confident student; optimistic about the year, to a terrified, voiceless wreck. Her high school education had prepared her for the coursework but not the reality her actions impacted her future, and could possibly mean failure. Stauffer became so petrified that she stopped eating and participating in classes, dropped courses, lost weight, and eventually dropped out of college altogether. She\u2019d failed, and her worst fear had become a reality. Yet, somehow this wasn\u2019t as crushing as she thought it would be. Stauffer moved home, and inadvertently started seeking out education the same way Thoreau did: through experience. She found that the hands on experience of ballet and yoga studios and a nonprofit organization furthered her education more than any college course ever could. Eventually Stauffer found a way to finish her degree at the New School, a collection of universities that offered credit for real-life experience instead of academic courses. She went from the lowest point in her life to one of the highest, and all she had to do was fail. The moral is clear: there are gaps in our education system, and because of these gaps students aren\u2019t adequately prepared for their own futures. In his book Walden, Thoreau elaborates on the ideas Stauffer touches on in her article. As stated before, he believed learning through experience was exponentially better than a in classroom. When a rigid curriculum with expectations is set in place, students aren\u2019t given the same hands on learning as they would be without one. Just as Stauffer embraced this learning style in the New School, Thoreau did so in Walden Woods. For that is all Walden really is; Thoreau learning from nature by immersing himself in it, instead of seeing it on the pages of a book. A quote from Walden most fitting is as follows, \u201cWe boast of our system of education, but why stop at schoolmasters and schoolhouses? We are all schoolmasters, and our schoolhouse is the universe\u201d (Walden 10/15/1859.)\n\nLily Langrind, 17, Concord Carlisle High School: \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d by Peggy McIntosh and \u201cChecking My Male Privilege\u201d\n\nMost of the literature I have explored in my English classes have been novels and plays with sophisticated language and complex storylines, but this semester we read an eye-opening essay about racism\u2013 \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d by Peggy McIntosh\u2013which finally made me realize that what my teachers say is true: the things we read and discuss do apply to the real world. I read Charles Blow\u2019s editorials regularly. The effect of his words is sharp and impactful. When I came across \u201cChecking My Male Privilege\u201d after the deluge of sexual harassment accusations came out in Hollywood and Washington, the connection was obvious.In \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d McIntosh emphasizes how in our society, white privilege is so lethal because its beneficiaries are \u201ccarefully taught not to recognize [it].\u201d How can racism be eradicated if the people with advantages don\u2019t even know they have them? Unless white people recognize all the ways our quality of life can be so much higher simply because of the color of our skin, we will forever have this invisible pack full of assets and protections secured tightly on our backs. If we apply the same logic McIntosh uses in her essay to our discussions about sexual harassment in America, it\u2019s easy to see that most men are also conditioned to evade any blame whatsoever for the injustices so many women face. Just like the white people who attribute their success to their own merit and turn a blind eye to their privileges, the men who focus on the \u201cgood guys\u201d who don\u2019t grope or whistle or slap are choosing to overlook the privilege of physical dominance. It seems simple, but men can enjoy the luxury of knowing that a vast majority of the time, women don\u2019t have the physical superiority to victimize or overpower men for unwanted sexual behavior. In cases of both sexism and racism, privileges hurt both those without and with the privileges. White people might not condone racism, but their blindness to privilege leads them to believe that racism may not be as bad as the underprivileged make it seem. As Blow writes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to understand how bad something is if you never experience it firsthand, and so listening to people with fewer privileges is one of the best tools we can use to evaluate the state of discrimination black people and women are immersed in.\n\nAlicia Li, 16, Livingston High School: \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d by F. Scott Fitzgerald and \u201cWill America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?\u201d\n\nBeneath the shimmery surface of American ideals, from John Winthrop\u2019s iconic imagery of the country as a \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d to the twentieth century metaphor of a \u201cmelting pot\u201d accepting all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities, recent events reveal the underlying racism of a nation claiming to be \u201cpost-racial.\u201d In George Yancy\u2019s \u201cWill America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?\u201d the professor illustrates how Trump\u2019s offensive and racist statements pertaining to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations highlight America\u2019s deceptive fa\u00e7ade as a beacon for civil liberty. A classic piece of American literature, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald unveils the flaws of high society during the Roaring Twenties, a period of both economic prosperity and unrivaled income inequality, through the narration of Nick Carraway. Reflecting current news, \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d showcases how harsh reality is often hidden under a superficial exterior. After moving to Long Island, Carraway optimistically believes in the American dream of working hard to be rewarded and achieve upward mobility. However, his encounters reveal the faults of the rich whose lifestyles and wealth are so widely admired. Tom Buchanan, a Yale graduate from a prominent family, has more than enough wealth to transport his polo ponies across the country while owning an elaborate mansion framed by French windows and half an acre of fresh roses. Despite Buchanan\u2019s dignified appearance and prestige, Carraway uncovers the truth of his racism, domestic violence, and immorality. At his own dinner party, Buchanan recommends a book claiming the importance of the dominance of the white race. That same night, a woman reveals his infidelity and the fact that everyone in town is aware of it. Not only is the man unabashedly unfaithful, but he frequently leaves bruises on his wife and breaks his mistress\u2019s nose during a disagreement. Meanwhile, the vanity of his wife and mistress is undeniable since Buchanan\u2019s exuberant wealth was the subject of their attraction. The sole genuinely magnanimous rich character, Jay Gatsby, is delusional and dependent on illegal means to maintain his lavish lifestyle. Although written nearly a century later, Yancy\u2019s op-ed examines the same theme of reality contradicting American ideals. Ever since the Declaration of Independence affirmed equality for all men and the United States emerged as the land of liberty, the nation claimed to be a republic of moral justice and equality. Yet on January 11, President Donald J. Trump revealed the contradictory truth when he made a racist and derogatory statement condemning immigrants from several nonwhite countries. The representative of the United States allegedly using \u201cshithole\u201d to describe the homelands of foreign immigrants is contemptuous and clearly inconsistent with America\u2019s image of acceptance and tolerance. In \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Fitzgerald warns readers against accepting society at face value, a lesson that Yancy emphasizes as well. To learn from the misplaced optimism of Nick Carraway, Americans today must remain unaffected by the country\u2019s idealistic rhetoric of freedom and equality to speak out against our president\u2019s bigotry, rather than silently accepting the unjust reality of racism.\n\nKatherine LoBue, 16, Mamaroneck High School: \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d by Mark Twain and \u201cThe Other Inconvenient Truth\u201d\n\nMark Twain was friends with abolitionist Frederick Douglass, yet he permitted grotesque drawings of escaped slave Jim in \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d Twain was a benefactor for African American students, yet he depicted Jim as helpless and inferior in the \u201canti-slavery\u201d satire. Twain clearly had conflicting views regarding African Americans. In his New York Times op-ed, \u201cThe Other Inconvenient Truth,\u201d author Charles Blow states, \u201cJust because one abhors violence and cruelty doesn\u2019t mean that one truly believes that all people are equal\u2026 Entertaining the notion of imbalance-that white people are inherently better than others in any way- is also white supremacy.\u201d Blow invents the term \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d to describe these beliefs. This concept offered me a way to navigate Twain\u2019s puzzling attitudes towards African Americans in Huck Finn. When reading Twain\u2019s classic with my AP English class, I was confused as to why the text wasn\u2019t resolutely anti-slavery. In the novel, protagonist Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi to escape their lives in St. Petersburg, Missouri. It takes over 300 pages for Huck to realize Jim is a human being, and even then Huck infantilizes Jim by offering the grown man \u201chelp.\u201d In the book\u2019s last ten controversial chapters, Jim becomes subservient to Huck and Tom, refusing to stand up for himself even when made to complete ridiculous tasks. Jim\u2019s behavior in these chapters led me to suspect Twain believed slaves were too unintelligent and submissive to stand up to adolescents. Although Twain depicted Jim as a true human being, giving this book its \u201canti-slavery\u201d reputation, subtleties in Huck\u2019s and Jim\u2019s attitudes make me wonder if Twain \u201centertained notions of imbalance\u201d even though he didn\u2019t openly show it. Most importantly, Blow showed me that \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d still plagues our current times, most notably in the executive branch of our government. In 2011, Trump said President Obama needed to show his birth certificate to prove he was American-born. When announcing his Presidential candidacy, Trump stated Mexicans were drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. Trump said of the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville that violence had taken place \u201con many sides.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t openly support the supremacists, but yes, he didn\u2019t really condemn them either. Recently, Trump called Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d actively belittling her and Native Americans simultaneously. I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Blow speak on January 7th and his words continued to enlighten my understanding of white supremacy. Passive white supremacy, he said, is more deadly than open white supremacy because these feelings can increase exponentially when sparked. Those who turn a blind eye to hateful events are the ones who allow extremism to grow. I was disappointed that in the end of Twain\u2019s novel, Huck knows his Southern society has the wrong views about slavery yet he decides to turn his own blind eye. Huck\u2019s choice to escape to the West and ignore these issues on the final page is symbolic of the actions many in our country take today.\n\nAyden Nichol, 17, Concord-Carlisle Regional High School: \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d and \u201cLouisiana\u2019s Big Step on Justice Reform\u201d\n\nIt can be a terrifying thing to see decades of the pent-up rage of an oppressed person finally let out against their oppressor. This is the case in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d when the Jewish moneylender Shylock brings his nemesis and lifelong tormentor, the Christian merchant Antonio, to court over an unpaid loan. The punishment, as agreed upon between the two men as a condition of the deal, is that Shylock may remove a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh. But before Shylock exacts this cruel retribution, a friend of Antonio\u2019s makes a fascinating appeal in his favor. Portia claims that the true sign of strength is not the ability to take revenge, but to show mercy. Mercy, she says, \u201cblesseth him that gives, and him that takes \u2026 \u2018tis mightiest in the mightiest\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.183-84). In June of 2017, half a millennium after Shakespeare\u2019s fictional court case, the Louisiana state legislature seemed to realize the same thing as Portia when they passed a series of unexpected but widespread criminal justice reform laws which aim to dramatically reduce the prison population and lower recidivism rates. Both instances show that the ability to have mercy gives the person in power an unparalleled opportunity to do good, and ultimately, to benefit themselves. At its surface, the Louisiana reform package could appear purely as an act of mercy: an attempt to help those who have fallen victim to the state\u2019s brutal justice system. On some level, this is all it is; surely there were legislators for whom this was their sole motivation. But whether intended or not, Louisiana stands to receive enormous gains from this package \u2013 it truly is \u201ctwice blest.\u201d As well as expanded parole and prison alternatives, which aim to help those convicted, the state expects to see an improvement in public safety and save over $180 million. The monetary benefits from this merciful outreach will help the state in ways that would never be thought of as connected to improving an inmate\u2019s life. However, conservative politicians, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, fail to see this link. They maintain that the best way to keep law and order among their constituents is to wield their power like a sword, striking down any who violate that peace. But Portia reminds us that mercy is what makes a ruler truly powerful; she calls it \u201can attribute to God himself\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.190). Sessions and others must reject this easy show of power by way of force and cruelty in the justice system, choosing instead a path that will benefit disadvantaged citizens and show the people that they are worthy of the power we grant them. In this time of political distrust, the American people could use an indication that our politicians are capable of the \u201cawe and majesty\u201d that Portia speaks of (Shakespeare IV.i.186). I am certain that if they chose to show mercy, we would know beyond a doubt that they are worthy of leading us.\n\nIsabella Picillo, 17, Oceanside High School: \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees\u201d\n\nI stumble upon a New York Times article, \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees,\u201d that makes me wonder if Hawthorne, the literary genius, is wrong. The article explains a recent case in which a judge, James Robart, lifted a Trump administration ban after hearing a compelling argument that Muslim refugees struggle to reunite with family members who have already legally settled in the U.S. due to discriminatory policies of the U.S. refugee program. Governmental lawyers counter-argued that the ban was necessary because it was in interests of national security. I sit at the breakfast table wondering if xenophobia was always that pronounced in the United States. It appears to me that xenophobia underlined the governmental lawyers\u2019 arguments; an attorney called the ban \u201creasonable and appropriate.\u201d I do not understand how a ban that targets certain groups, specifically Muslims, can be \u201creasonable.\u201d I ask my father, who grew up in an Italian immigrant household if he recalls facing immense oppression. He says no. I often hear people casually declaring that Muslims should not be allowed in the U.S. because they will bomb our cities. When did Muslim refugees become synonymous with terrorism? The answer: recently. How may you ask? The death of our shadows. Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d explores the concept of the shadow-self. The character Pearl is praised because she possesses no shadow. Hawthorne suggested that our world would be a better place if we did not have shadows, meaning our dark parts would be exposed to society. We live in Hawthorne\u2019s world, and it is not one of sublime beauty, rather it is one of chaos and disgust. With recent changes in administration, more people have become comfortable vocalizing xenophobic, along with homophobic, racist, and sexist, thoughts. It has become more common to witness politicians share their dark, most discriminatory, comments to gain support. Those thoughts are normalized, causing the death of our shadows. Shadows barricade impertinent comments and prevent xenophobia from manifesting itself into discriminatory policies like the ban seen in the New York Times article. Although Judge James Robart partially lifted the ban, part of it still exists, along with other similar policies. He\u2019s combating xenophobia, while others do little to eradicate discriminatory policies. By doing nothing, a shadow-less world exists. Perhaps if we had shadows, a ban would not exist to prevent Muslim families from reuniting. A Muslim father can watch his daughter blow out the candles on her birthday cake, and a Muslim mother can applaud when her son receives his high school diploma. But they can\u2019t. Hawthorne is wrong. His envisioned world has its perils. It allows xenophobia to persist, causing the unjust discrimination of certain groups like the Muslim refugees mentioned in the article \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees.\u201d We can live again in Hawthorne\u2019s imperfect world, where shadows exist, even finding it to be not so imperfect. A shadow can only exist with light; there is no light in a shadow-less world.\n\nSayali Shelke, 19, Texas A&M University: Stereotype threat and \u201cCareers for Women in Technology Companies Are a Global Challenge\u201d\n\nIn the New York Times article, \u201cCareers for Women in Technology Companies Are A Global Challenge,\u201d writer Alina Tugend discusses the similarities and differences for women around the world working in the tech field. Tech companies in the United States suffer from a male-dominated, \u201cbro\u201d culture that gives a cold shoulder to female coworkers. In other places, such as the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, the problem lies with class differences, leading to the alienation of middle-class and poor women. The article sums that, while the execution of these issues vary around the world, the underlying effect is still the same: women have a much harder time entering and remaining in the tech field. The lack of female representation in STEM is not new. While there are many factors that lead to this problem, the one with the deepest consequence is negative stereotypes planted at a young age. In psychology, we learned about the idea of stereotype threat: a phenomenon in which people are reminded of negative stereotypes of a group they belong to and hence perform on given tasks conforming to those stereotypes. In 1997, researcher Steven Spencer applied this idea to classrooms and discovered that equally intelligent women performed worse on a math exam than their male counterparts after being told that the test showed gender differences. This characterization evoked the negative stereotype of women\u2019s lack of math skills and led them to under-perform on the exam. In contrast, he found that if, before the test, participants were led to believe that both parties performed equally, women\u2019s scores were similar to the men\u2019s. Additional research post Spencer\u2019s experiment has further supported this idea, proving that negative stereotypes in gender as well as race and ethnicity reduces the performance of individuals. This institutionalized idea that women are not as capable of performing mathematical or technical tasks as well as men is deeply rooted in our culture, starting in elementary schools all the way to professional work settings. Learning about stereotype threat was eye-opening because it allowed me to see the deeper effects of the way we teach children about careers and how it differs in males and females. Dr. Spencer\u2019s experiment involved one math exam; however, the negative stereotypes about women\u2019s lack of technical skills are prevalent universally. The most corrosive part of this narrative is that men are lead to believe these same ideas, so in the future they are equally as unwelcoming of women, a disheartening reality reflected in our companies today. It is vital that we start debasing these myths and start encouraging women from young ages to be open about any career. Most importantly, we need to teach both men and women such values, so that men can also live in a world where the idea of women being empowered to work in any field is a standard, a world in which creativity and innovation need no gender classification.\n\nRunners-Up", "title": "Making Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today", "authors": []}

For one thing, he was appalled by the way many people went into hock to buy vehicles they couldn\u2019t possibly afford: \u201cSo often, haven\u2019t you seen people making $5,000 a year and driving a car that cost 6,000?

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "No matter the venue, the mission is the same: to distill the data to its essential themes as quickly as possible. The trouble is, the report doesn\u2019t always make that easy.\n\nTo understand why, it helps to know a bit about the jobs report. For one thing, it\u2019s really two reports stitched together. One, based on a survey of employers, provides information on jobs: how many were created (or eliminated) the previous month and how much those jobs pay. The other, based on a survey of households, focuses on individuals: how many are working or not working, along with information on their age, race, education and other characteristics.\n\nOver the long run, the two surveys tend to tell pretty much the same story. Both, for example, show that the labor market has experienced a slow but remarkably long-lasting recovery over the past eight years. But in any given month, the two sources can diverge, sometimes significantly.\n\nTake the jobs report from October. The business survey from that report showed that the United States lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first net decline in seven years. But the survey of households found that the number of Americans who were employed actually increased by more than 900,000, and that the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent.\n\nIt gets worse. The numbers released on jobs day are preliminary, and often get revised significantly. That 33,000 loss of jobs in September? It has since been revised up to a modest 38,000-job gain. And even when revisions are less pronounced, the month-to-month swings in the numbers are often more noise than signal, the result of one-off events and statistical quirks. September\u2019s hiring numbers, for example, were depressed by the month\u2019s hurricanes, which disrupted workplaces across the Gulf Coast. The one-month slowdown revealed little about the longer-run path of the economy.", "title": "Making Sense of the Jobs Report: It\u2019s Not Always Easy", "authors": []}

When scientists experimentally remove the cache, the spiders will spend time searching for the stolen goods in proportion to how many separate items had been taken, rather than how big the total prey mass might have been.\n\nSmall fish benefit from living in schools, and the more numerous the group, the statistically better a fish\u2019s odds of escaping predation.

Francesco D\u2019Errico, an archaeologist at the University of Bordeaux, described his team\u2019s analysis of a 70,000-year-old hyena femur from the Les Pradelles site in France.\n\nThe leg bone fragment is incised with nine parallel, nearly identical notches, which look far too regular to be the incidental result of butchery with stone tools or an early attempt at artful decoration. \u201cThis fits with the idea that the incisions are a form of numerical notation,\u201d Dr. D\u2019Errico said. \u201cWe see the beginnings of externalizing our numeric sense, of taking it outside the body.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAttitudes about animal numerosity have changed dramatically since the mid-twentieth century when many researchers believed only humans had enough gray matter to think quantitatively. They cited as an object lesson the 1907 case of Clever Hans, the horse that supposedly could solve arithmetic problems and would tap out his answers by hoof; as it turned out, he was responding to unconscious cues from the people around him.\n\nSince then, researchers have approached the field with caution and rigor, seeking to identify the specific evolutionary pressures that might spur the need for numeric judgments in any given species.\n\nSocial carnivores like spotted hyenas, for example, live in fission-fusion societies, collectively defending their territories against rivals but in ever-shifting groups of widely roaming members. \u201cYou can never predict who you\u2019ll find in which group,\u201d said Sarah Benson-Amram, an assistant professor of zoology and physiology at the University of Wyoming. \u201cYou might be alone or in a group of ten.\u201d\n\nBecause hyena jaws can pulverize zebra bones, encounters between competitors can prove deadly; every spotted hyena must have a good sense from moment to moment of how many there are of us versus how many of them. Dr. Benson-Amram and her colleagues tested hyena numerosity skills in the field, playing back the recorded whoops of spotted hyenas living in South Africa and Namibia to hyenas in Kenya.\n\nThe Kenyan carnivores reacted to the whoops of strangers as predicted, approaching the hidden source of the sound when they had a home team advantage, retreating when they heard a few too many distinctive voices in a row. Or sometimes, when the local hyenas were outnumbered, they\u2019d call for backup.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always loved it when the hyenas would whoop and others would come running in,\u201d Dr. Benson-Amram said. \u201cIt was very dramatic, very aggressive, and I appreciated this ability to recruit other group members to the cause.\u201d\n\nChimpanzees are social scorekeepers, episodic warriors and number ninjas, too. They can be taught to associate groups of objects with corresponding Arabic numerals up to the number 9 and sometimes beyond \u2014 three squares on a computer screen with the number 3, five squares with 5, and so on. They can put those numerals in order.\n\nMore Reporting on Mathematics\n\nThe numeric working memory of young chimpanzees is astonishing: Flash a random scattering of numerals on a screen for just 210 milliseconds \u2014 half an eye blink \u2014 and then cover the numbers with white squares, and a numerically schooled young chimpanzee will touch the squares sequentially to indicate the ascending order of the numbers hidden beneath.\n\nDon\u2019t bother trying to do this yourself, Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto University, said at the scientific meeting in London on which the themed journal was based. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBy the look of it, cerebral property in humans once dedicated to numeric memory has, in the six million years since we diverged from chimpanzees, been co-opted for grander purposes, like the ability to judge whether a sentence like this is true: \u201cThere is no non-vanishing continuous tangent vector field on even dimensional spheres.\u201d\n\nStanislas Dehaene, a psychologist at the University of Paris, and his colleagues presented evidence from brain scans of professional mathematicians that the neural circuitry for advanced mathematical thinking is an elaboration on the archaic number sense we share with other animals.\n\nIt is distinct from our everyday language pathways, even when that math-related challenge involves words rather than numbers \u2014 like the true statement above.\n\nYet our inborn numerosity hardly guarantees mathematical proficiency, and can sometimes work against us. Psychologists Rochel Gelman of Rutgers University and Jennifer Jacobs Danan of the University of California, Los Angeles, have studied how often reasonably well-educated people miscalculate percentages.\n\nWe hear that the price of something rose by 50 percent and then fell by 50 percent, and we reflexively, mistakenly conclude, \u201cOh good, we\u2019re back to where we started.\u201d Our natural number sense adds and subtracts whole numbers, whole chucks, guppies and hyenas.

The lead civilian prosecutor, Mark Miller, denounced the defense for what he called \u201ca scorched-earth strategy to obstruct the proceeding by any means, however frivolous, however cynical.\u201d\n\nThe judge, Air Force Col. Vance Spath, ordered the defense back to court in October. When they refused, he ordered a Marine general in charge of the defense to force them back. The general also refused, and was confined in a trailer next to the razor wire-ringed court in November for contempt. At the most recent hearings in late January, Judge Spath was still trying to compel the lawyers to appear, so far without success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a federal court, appointing a new experienced lawyer would be straightforward, but Guant\u00e1namo is no federal court. Few lawyers qualified to take death penalty cases have both the requisite top secret security clearance and the willingness to work with the special military tribunal rules created by Congress in 2009 for Guant\u00e1namo, said Navy Cmdr. Brian Mizer, who in the past has represented multiple detainees at the tribunals.\n\n\u201cThere is a perception that the tribunals are like tilting at windmills,\u201d he said. \u201cMany lawyers don\u2019t want to go near it.\u201d\n\nMr. Mizer and others said it could take at least a year for a new lawyer to be appointed and get caught up on the case.\n\nExperienced counsel in a case like Mr. Nashiri\u2019s is critical, Commander Mizer said, because the thicket of charges stemming from a series of attacks is complicated further by evidence gathered through years of torture at C.I.A. black sites.\n\nBut after Mr. Kammen left, Judge Spath ruled that learned counsel were required only \u201cto the extent practicable,\u201d and pushed forward with pretrial hearings with just the lieutenant at the helm.\n\nLieutenant Piette, who grew up in Texas and Wisconsin, said he was not easily swayed by long odds. He enlisted in the Navy right after high school in 1997, inspired by his grandfather, who had been a decorated commando during World War II. Despite limited swimming skills and no experience with weapons, he soon graduated from the notoriously punishing SEAL selection course in a year when nearly 90 percent of the class dropped out.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was assigned to a cold-weather warfare team and deployed to Kosovo.\n\nAfter the U.S.S. Cole and the World Trade Center were attacked, he thought the team would be sent to hunt terrorists. Instead he was deployed again to Eastern Europe. He finished his enlistment without seeing combat. With a young family at home and a growing frustration at the lack of action, he left the Navy at the end of 2003.\n\nFor years after, he said, he was dogged by regret. SEAL teams began deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. Three friends were killed in combat. Men he knew shot Osama bin Laden, he said. He worried he had fumbled his chance to make a difference.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Everything I had learned about training and preparation and perseverance \u2014 it clicked.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating in 2012, he spent five years as a Navy lawyer, working criminal cases at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Last April he was hired to work on the Nashiri case. He had barely started when his whole team quit.\n\nIn January, the judge repeatedly fumed at the missing defense team, calling it a strategic tactic intended to undermine the trial.\n\n\u201cNever have I seen such open and notorious rejection of orders from a court,\u201d the judge told the court.\n\nLieutenant Piette stood before him, respectful but unwavering. As a SEAL member, he said later, he was used to being yelled at.\n\nDuring hearings over several days in January, the prosecution called witnesses and moved to introduce photos and bags of blast fragments from the attack, which killed 17 sailors. Lieutenant Piette sat silently, spinning his pen in seeming frustration, but passed up dozens of chances to object and cross-examine.\n\nHe felt staying nearly silent was the only effective strategy for his client, he said. Over the course of two days, the judge asked 37 times for the defense to comment on the admission of evidence. Each time the lieutenant stood and responded, \u201cDefense takes no position other than to object to these proceedings continuing without learned counsel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough he wanted to argue at length, challenging the very idea that evidence could be admitted without a jury present, he said he knew it would be unethical to even try, and could sink the case. He hoped his refusal to participate would preserve an issue for appeal. Whether it will upend the trial or be a mere footnote in the tribunals will likely not be known for years.\n\nThe prosecution declined requests for an interview, but in court, an Air Force major on the team denounced Lieutenant Piette\u2019s objections, calling them \u201cshameless, disingenuous and conceited.\u201d\n\nThe same day, though, Abbe Smith, a law professor at Georgetown who taught Lieutenant Piette criminal defense, put his photo up in her ethics class as an example of a \u201ccourageous and ethical representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty gutsy. This legal train is in motion and he steps out in front to protect his client,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know that all lawyers would do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Kammen said discussions with Lieutenant Piette about staying were \u201ccomplicated\u201d and he was not convinced his most junior lawyer did the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf we are obligated to withdraw, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Mr. Kammen said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine lawyer, but this is way beyond what he can do.\u201d", "title": "Many Say He\u2019s the Least Qualified Lawyer Ever to Lead a Guant\u00e1namo Case.

I\u2019m a math teacher. I hope the sight of the six trig functions didn\u2019t trigger PTSD (Post Trigonometric Stress Disorder) in any solvers out there. Math seems to be the most visceral subject in the high school curriculum \u2014 even long after high school. When I meet adults for the first time and they find out what I do for a living, I usually get a response like \u201cOh, I really [past tense verb] math!\u201d Your two Mad Lib choices for the past tense verb are \u201cloved\u201d or \u201chated.\u201d I\u2019d say the ratio of those two verbs is about 10 to 1. I\u2019ll let you guess which way. I like that the revealer is LEFT RIGHT, as the trig functions kind of march down the grid in a left-right manner. I even considered constructing the grid so that the trig functions were pushed up against the sides of the grid, but CSC wouldn\u2019t play along. I also considered taking out LEFT RIGHT altogether, as it made the fill in the center a little strained. That triple column of RETOW/VIRNA/ENIAC probably has a favorable/unfavorable rating of 200 to 1. Again, I\u2019ll let you guess which way. After this puzzle was accepted, I found out that AXL ROSE anagrams into a rather salacious phrase. Am I the last person on the planet to learn this?

My favorite clue that made the cut is [Where S is \u2026] for MORSE CODE. I hope some folks interpreted the dot-dot-dot as an ellipsis, and stopped to scratch their heads for a moment.

He has castigated the Trump administration for its handling of Russia and threatened to vote down Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s nomination, only to back away from the confrontation. After advocating a comprehensive immigration overhaul under the Obama administration, Mr. Rubio opposed a bipartisan immigration deal this month, saying that it did not do enough to bolster enforcement.\n\nMr. Rubio maintains that he has demonstrated independence from the G.O.P. by consistently defending Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election, and been openly critical of the federal government\u2019s initial response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. His reaction to the Parkland shooting, in his view, has built on his longstanding gun policies, now informed by lessons law enforcement and schools officials have learned in the first few days since the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High.\n\nOn the Democratic side, a mood of cynicism tends to pervade discussions of Mr. Rubio: Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat who joined Mr. Rubio in the Wednesday town hall and whose district includes Stoneman Douglas High, accused Mr. Rubio of favoring only \u201clegislation that the N.R.A. can live with.\u201d\n\nStill, some Democrats welcomed Mr. Rubio\u2019s apparent openness to new legislative options.

He suggested that addictive pain medication wasn\u2019t the only problem and that many heroin addicts start out \u201cwith marijuana and other drugs.\u201d\n\nThere is a relationship between cannabis and opioids, but Mr. Sessions has it backward. Marijuana isn\u2019t a gateway drug to opioid addiction; it\u2019s a safer alternative to pain medicines. Mr. Sessions\u2019s vow to crack down on marijuana will only make the opioid epidemic worse.\n\nWe know that 40 percent of all opiate overdose deaths involve a prescription opiate. So having legal access to cannabis as another option for pain relief may actually reduce consumption of opiates.\n\nI know it sounds counterintuitive, but consider the evidence. To start, a large study assessed the effect of medical-marijuana laws on opiate-related deaths between 1999 and 2010 in all 50 states and reported a 25 percent decrease in opiate overdose mortality in states where medical marijuana was legal, compared with those where it wasn\u2019t.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "The achievement of Robinson\u2019s novels has been how elegantly she folds questions of faith, ethics and eschatology into fiction, and presents them to us as human dramas, in language bright and bare as bone. She has been compared to the Dutch masters for her sense of silence and light, for the quality of patient attention that gilds the most modest moments. But she also has a gift for wit and metaphor that turns the ordinary on its head.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn nonfiction, Robinson approaches her quarry directly, with frank combativeness (or ranting, as her critics have it). She worried about this once: \u201cMy writing has perhaps taken too much of the stain of my anger,\u201d she wrote in \u201cMother Country,\u201d her 1989 study of nuclear pollution. No more. She opens the new collection telling us: \u201cI am too old to mince words.\u201d\n\nShe is democratic in her censure, flaying the left for its \u201cslick, unreflecting cynicism,\u201d the right for its \u201cunembarrassed enthusiasm for self-interest.\u201d She upbraids the religious for their fear and willful dismissal of science; scientists for their juvenile understanding and dismissal of faith.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut back to the original question.

As a child, her teachers told her, \u201cYou have to live with your mind your whole life\u201d; they taught her the value of building it, making it worthy. It was, she has said, the most important lesson she ever received. She kept at it, following the publication of \u201cHousekeeping,\u201d with one of the more interesting silences in American letters. She published no new fiction for 24 years, devoting herself instead to deep study of Marx, Darwin and the history of political thought.\n\nIn many ways, \u201cWhat Are We Doing Here?\u201d is a response to those years of study, a repudiation of Marx and Darwin, of powerful ideologies of any stripe that simplify the world. \u201cOur ways of understanding the world now, our systems and ideologies, have an authority for us that leads us to think of them as exhaustive accounts of reality rather than, at best, as instruments of understanding suited to particular uses,\u201d she writes. No argument here. But when she says that ideologies are to be avoided because they come with conclusions baked into them, I begin to fidget. This sounds an awful lot like some of Robinson\u2019s own nonfiction. For a book that so espouses the virtue of mind interrogating mind, there\u2019s not much evidence of it in this book. Her arguments unspool neatly, like silk off a spindle, because they are frequently arguments she has made before.\n\nWhen Robinson warns against historical amnesia, her regular readers will know exactly where she\u2019s heading: to the Puritans \u2014 caricatured as \u201ccankered souls\u201d but actually \u201cthe most progressive population on earth through the 19th century at least.\u201d I was very persuaded by the case she makes for their importance. I was even more persuaded by it when I first encountered it in her 1998 essay collection, \u201cThe Death of Adam.\u201d\n\nMost of the essays in this new book were delivered as speeches, and some repetition is inevitable. But so too is our desire for more \u2014 for the refinement of her ideas instead of the rehashing \u2014 especially since the final essay, which takes an unexpectedly personal turn, delivers like no other.\n\n\u201cSlander\u201d is the story of Robinson\u2019s strained relationship with her mother. \u201cWith a little difficulty we finally reached an accommodation, an adult friendship,\u201d she writes. \u201cThen she started watching Fox News.\u201d Her mother and her fellow retirees began to share \u201csalacious dread over coffee cake,\u201d fretting over the rumored \u201cwar against Christmas.\u201d \u201cMy mother lived out the end of her fortunate life in a state of bitterness and panic, never having had the slightest brush with any experience that would confirm her in these emotions, except, of course, Fox News,\u201d Robinson writes. The essay brings all the abstractions home, makes real and painful the cost of ceding an independence of mind. It\u2019s composed in a rare register: mourning and fury counterpoised by humor and a refusal of despair.\n\nRobinson tells us that old scholars would speak of being \u201cravished\u201d by a text. \u201cI think they were held to their work by a degree of fascination, of sober delight, that we can no longer imagine,\u201d she writes.

Though she was wary of overromanticizing India, she was immediately taken with what appeared to be an Indian attitude toward romance itself. \u201cIn Mumbai, people seemed to practice a showy, imaginative kind of love,\u201d she writes in \u201cThe Heart Is a Shifting Sea.\u201d She wondered if there was wisdom to this brand of passion: \u201cWhen I arrived in Mumbai after my dad\u2019s third divorce, the city seemed to hold some answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Heart Is a Shifting Sea\u201d is the culmination of Flock\u2019s search for those answers: a heavily reported work of nonfiction centered on three couples. There\u2019s Maya and Veer, Marwari Hindus; Sabeena and Shahzad, Sunni Muslims; and Parvati and Ashok, Tamil Brahmin Hindus. Maya pursues Veer brazenly after spotting him at a wedding; Maya\u2019s parents object to the union, so they elope. Sabeena and Shahzad meet just once before their engagement. Parvati and Ashok find each other through a matrimony website with the help of their concerned families.\n\nLike Katharine Boo \u2014 who synthesized hours of research into a cinematic account of slum life in \u201cBehind the Beautiful Forevers\u201d \u2014 Flock writes about her subjects with omniscient authority. But unlike Boo, who was working across formidable economic and linguistic barriers, Flock has embedded herself among educated, English-speaking, middle-class Indians. Flock\u2019s subjects read novels by Chimamanda Adichie and Jeffrey Eugenides, and watch \u201cFriends\u201d reruns.\n\nMarriage is hard for these couples in the ways that it can be hard for couples anywhere. They fight over money and work, overbearing in-laws and traffic stops. They struggle with infidelity, infertility, miscarriages, anxiety and depression, and the trauma of childhood abuse. But their lives are also difficult in culturally specific ways. As writers like Siddhartha Deb and Akash Kapur have explored, the rapid global economic growth of the 21st century has upended nearly all aspects of Indian life. What this looks like is Maya, armed with a master\u2019s degree, cooking elaborate meals for the in-laws who have confiscated her mobile phone. Or Ashok, an aspiring novelist, telling his father that while it\u2019s true his peers have largely abandoned arranged marriage, he\u2019d still like his parents\u2019 help finding a spouse.\n\nPhoto\n\nIndia, like rural America, has the dubious honor of being perpetually discovered anew by wide-eyed journalists. One of Shahzad\u2019s side-hustles entails offering foreigners a tour of Mumbai; its highlights, Flock notes, include a stop at a slum (where they \u201ccould feel a mix of pity and awe at all the poor, resourceful people and take photos\u201d) and a trip to a Bollywood studio (where \u201cthe foreigners laughed at the dance numbers\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFlock strives mightily to avoid clich\u00e9, with mixed success. (Take her opening line: \u201cIn Mumbai, people say the monsoons make everyone fall in love.\u201d) And for all its sophistication, the book feels compelled to remind readers of the basics: that caste divisions were said to have originated in ancient India, that Gandhi was father of the nation and so on.", "title": "Marriage Can Take Many Forms in India", "authors": ["Mythili G.

There was also a discussion about whether hospice or hospital was preferred.\n\n\u201cDo you believe we\u2019re looking at the beginning of a dying situation here?\u201d I had asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at a change of status, and it could go either way.\u201d\n\nI do think it\u2019s the beginning of the end for my mother \u2014 not this week or even this month, but I do see a sharper downward trajectory. My mother is sleepier these days, more likely to zone out, more anxious. We do not discuss her death, but I know she believes in some sort of afterlife. I do not.\n\nStill there seems to be an image associated with death, of an ascension upward, which many people share. I experienced it years ago myself. I had had an abortion, the psychological aftermath of which was not as simple as I thought it would be, and when I got home, sleeping off the anesthesia, I dreamed of a large cinder, a life that had been snuffed out before it had the opportunity to happen, shooting through space.\n\nWhy was that image of a snuffed-out life moving through space? Why wasn\u2019t it buried in the ground? I understand that nobody wants to dwell on the decay and rot that is a certainty, but why does so much death imagery have to do with moving skyward? One could almost believe there was a biological memory dating to the big bang:\n\nWowza! Did you see that magnificent galactic explosion?

That traditional Jewish burial was what I figured Ma would want for herself.\n\nIt occurs to me now, however, with Ma\u2019s Mars fixation, that she might, when the time comes, enjoy being cremated and shot into space. \u201cEnjoy\u201d probably isn\u2019t the word, but you know what I\u2019m saying.", "title": "Ground Control to Major Mom", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "His rapid rise caught the magpie eyes of all of Europe\u2019s grandest teams. Manchester United, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all rolled out the red carpet for Odegaard, but in January 2015, Real Madrid snared him. He would be the jewel in the crown as the club set about buying up all of the best young talent available.\n\nHe was registered for Real\u2019s B team, at the time under the oversight of Zinedine Zidane, but trained most often alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and the rest of the club\u2019s senior-team stars. In May of that year, Odegaard made his debut for Real\u2019s senior team. It made him the youngest player to play for the European champions, too.\n\nThat buzz has long since abated. All of the noise that surrounded Odegaard for a year has disappeared. Soccer, impatient, has moved on to other prodigies. As Odegaard \u2014 still just 19, still baby-faced \u2014 dutifully signs autographs and poses for pictures on a bitterly cold night in this city in the north of the Netherlands, it is impossible not to think that he is a long way from Real Madrid, a long way from where he was meant to be, and to wonder whether moving to the biggest team in the world was too much, too soon.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to answer that question,\u201d Tore Pedersen, a former Norwegian international defender, said when asked whether Odegaard could have found a more direct route to his goals by choosing another of his suitors. Pedersen, now an agent, consulted on Odegaard\u2019s moves to both Madrid and Heerenveen.\n\nOf far more significance \u2014 to Odegaard and to those concerned with his career \u2014 is that he is, now, in the right place to nurture his talent. In two years at Real Madrid, he made only one start for the first team, in the Copa del Rey. Carlo Ancelotti, the club\u2019s former manager, dismissed his signing as a \u201cPR stunt.\u201d\n\nZidane, who coached him on the B team, would not go that far, but he also did not draft Odegaard into the senior team when he was named manager. In January last year, Odegaard decided he needed an \u201cintermediate step,\u201d the chance to play competitive games somewhere.\n\nPhoto\n\nA loan to Heerenveen was deemed the best option. \u201cIt was a good chance to play,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cThe culture is similar in Holland to Norway, so it easier to settle, and Heerenveen has a good record with Scandinavian players.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt would be a home away from home, the thinking ran, a more natural progression into the senior game. Morten Thorsby, one of several Norwegians on Heerenveen\u2019s roster, contacted Odegaard to persuade him.\n\nThe Netherlands, too, seemed to offer the right environment to allow him to flourish. \u201cThere is a little bit more space, a little bit more time,\u201d said Stijn Schaars, Heerenveen\u2019s captain, of the style of play in the top division, known as the Eredivisie. \u201cIt is good for young players to grow, to develop the game and the body, before moving on to other leagues.\u201d\n\nThat is not to say it was easy. Odegaard\u2019s first day at the club brought more television cameras than Heerenveen\u2019s manager, Jurgen Streppel, had ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s what you expect for a European Championship final,\u201d he said. Despite the otherworldly vibe that Odegaard seemed to bring, though, he was still just a teenager, unaccustomed to the stresses and strains of elite soccer. By his own admission, he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about his first six months. He passed on a request to be interviewed for this article.\n\nHeerenveen kept its faith. Odegaard asked to be given the coveted No. 10 jersey last summer, and his wish was granted. Streppel promised him he was one of the four key players in his plans for this season, but asked that he try to be more decisive in games.\n\n\u201cHe has to be able to make a difference in Holland in game after game,\u201d Streppel told the Norwegian newspaper VG. \u201cOnly that will be good enough if he is to succeed in a really top team.\u201d\n\nThis season has brought an improvement. Odegaard has scored just one Eredivisie goal in 15 league appearances, and created only one other, but nobody at Heerenveen plays more key passes per game. He is learning, too, to be more vocal. \u201cHe is not a guy with a big mouth,\u201d Schaars said. \u201cBut he is a smart player. Smart players have more vision than normal players, so if you see something, say it.\u201d\n\nThat is why Odegaard is here: to mature, on the field and off it. He has passed his driving test \u2014 when he first arrived, the club issued him a bicycle to help him get around \u2014 and he now lives on his own, after his father, who had lived with him for six months, returned to Norway. He intends to go back to the Bernab\u00e9u as a man, rather than a boy.\n\nThat has always been the aim: to win a place at Real Madrid. He has not forgotten why he is here, and his parent club has not forgotten him, either. Real Madrid is in regular contact with Odegaard, his father and Heerenveen, to monitor his progress. Video of his games is regularly sent back to Madrid, and every so often a scout comes to see him in the flesh.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgainst Sparta, an observer would not have seen a player who looks ready to displace Ronaldo, or Isco, or any of the other superstars on Real\u2019s books.

What Tetsu does differently is to put away the luxury ingredients that are so central to Masa\u2019s experience and image. At last, New York has a chance to see just how good Mr. Takayama is when he isn\u2019t hiding behind truffles and caviar.\n\nHe can, in fact, make less expensive seafood taste as precious as sturgeon roe. During the bay scallop season, which has an annoying habit of ending before I have eaten enough of them, Tetsu seared them with skinny lengths of asparagus and sent them out with garlic-anchovy oil and lime juice, simmering in a hot bowl. I will be marking this on the calendar so I don\u2019t miss it next winter. For now there is a similar dish that operates on the same principle: tender, palm-size whole octopus sizzled in butter and lime with garlic, chopped cilantro and strands of a green Korean chile.\n\nThe biggest surprise was how much I liked the salads. The menu calls them slaws, which goes a long way toward repairing some of the injuries that word has absorbed over the decades. There is a superb one with fresh kale and fried burdock in an unexpectedly Southeast Asian lemongrass dressing, and another of cabbage and roasted duck stirred with, yes, mayonnaise. (No supermarket mayo, it\u2019s flavored with fresh orange juice and sherry vinegar.) If there was yuzu in the yuzu-daikon slaw, though, it had walked off the job the night I tried it.\n\nItems from the robata, supposedly the heart of the restaurant, were more variable than you would hope. My table went quietly wild for the soy-marinated quail eggs and the pink pork sausage with flecks of yellow and green Thai chiles. Skewered coconut shrimp received polite nods.\n\nWhen you get the menu, though, your eyes will automatically go straight to the raw seafood, and they probably should. It appears twice, the first time in chilled appetizers that can share some of Masa\u2019s delicacy and subtle use of spice. Speckles of finely minced jalape\u00f1os dot little pearly pink bites of hamachi; in a more ordinary case, wasabi has been quickly grated over hunks of yellowfin tuna with a spoonful of simple guacamole.\n\nRaw seafood reappears at the end of the menu as hand rolls and nigiri. Here I have a confession to make: Almost all of my outer-stratosphere moments at Masa happened before the barrage of sushi that ends the meal. Near the end of the game comes a mesmerizing hand roll stuffed with meltingly fatty tuna belly, but the nigiri on its own it would probably not land Masa in my top tier of sushi destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat is roughly my feeling about the sushi at Tetsu. Although the contrast there is less extreme, its nigiri can be inconsistent and is best employed as a short and satisfying last stop, not as the main event.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShould you forge on to dessert, you\u2019ll find that the pastry chef (Matthew O\u2019Haver, who doubles as the service director) does outstanding work: a plate-wide slice of grilled olive oil cake next to a thick stripe of tangy mascarpone; a brownielike chocolate cake made with black-sesame paste and topped with a powerfully appealing miso-caramel sauce; a green-peppercorn ice cream that clamps fire and ice together in a single rich scoop.\n\nAt lunch, the menu is snipped from two pages to one. A little bit is subtracted from each category and two new ones are added: burgers and bowls of squiggly yellow ramen. The ramens are a little smaller and more refined than usual, which may not be top priorities for the average ramen fiend. But given how low in salt and fat they were, relatively speaking, I was impressed by how much flavor made its way into the miso ramen with chashu and the shoyu ramen with very, very good braised short rib.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I have not seen it, but it sounds like an iron maiden for the stovetop. The spikes are supposed to heat the interior, but the two burgers I\u2019ve had were very rare with a notably dark sear. But the results were very different. I had an immediate, lingering, intensely positive reaction to the lamb burger under melted taleggio, but I would not order the underseasoned and pulpy beef burger with Cheddar again.\n\nThe kitchen may also need more practice on the skinny fries \u2014 \u201cTetsu fries\u201d. Once they were gold and cooked to a fine crackle; another time they were ghostly pale and limp.\n\nThe lunch service is new and still fairly quiet. Dinner, though, can be a racket. If it\u2019s just you, or you and a friend, sitting at the long counter made from a single plank of bubinga wood offers the best shot at privacy. Placed at one of the communal tables in back one night, I ended up next to a group that kept rowdily showing off its expensive wines.\n\nViva Manhattan, I guess?\n\n\u2605\u2605", "title": "Masa\u2019s Chef Comes Out From Behind the Truffles, at Tetsu", "authors": ["Pete Wells", "Restaurant Review"]}

As a result, data usage is a very important consideration, as each gigabyte must be paid for. Fortunately, we have 4G speed, but how much data do services like Instagram or Spotify use? How can one tell how much a YouTube video will consume? Obviously, one can go to a free Wi-Fi locale to see some content, but there are the security issues.\n\nA. The amount of data consumed by sharing and streaming photos, audio and video varies with the quality and size of the files, but quick estimates from a data calculator (like the ones on the AT&T or Verizon Wireless sites) offer a rough idea. Your cellular provider may have its own measures. Nationally, both AT&T and Verizon Wireless estimate uploading a good-quality photo to a social media site like Instagram uses 5 megabytes of data. In comparison, streaming video can chew up 500 to 700 megabytes of data an hour \u2014 and that is for files in the lowest \u201cstandard definition\u201d picture quality.\n\nData usage for streaming music depends on the audio fidelity and service, but plan to use at least 51 megabytes an hour.

For many people, that means the simple luxury of steak and potatoes. Instead of going to a crowded restaurant, you can easily pull off this meal at home \u2014 and use the money you save by splurging on an expensive, top-quality cut like rib-eye or tenderloin or strip steak.\n\nOf the three choices, I prefer the rib-eye. It makes the most succulent steak, richly marbled and very tasty. (In France, this cut is called c\u00f4te de boeuf, and considered very special.)\n\nNot to dismiss the milder tenderloin, sliced into filets mignon, but to me those are best pan-fried in butter with a lot of pepper. They are delicious, but not as meaty. Strip loin, or New York strip steak, can be quite lean and thus a bit chewy, but some swear by it. I find it makes a good roast beef, cooked whole.\n\nBut we digress. Assuming you\u2019re going for a high-end steak, you\u2019ll want to stop in a real butcher shop if you can. Or, order from a source you trust. It will cost you, but will still be cheaper than dinner out for two. Rather than buying two pieces for two people, get one large steak, about two inches thick. It will produce juicier, more flavorful meat. Cover it with generous dashes of salt and pepper, a little sliced garlic and some roughly chopped rosemary, then leave it for a while to absorb the seasonings. (You\u2019ll remove the garlic before cooking, as it would burn immediately in the hot skillet.)\n\nPhoto\n\nStart the steak in a scorching hot cast-iron pan on the stovetop, to brown one side well.

It is a culinary common thread that runs through albondigas, polpettini, boulettes, kofte \u2014 all spherical morsels of finely chopped meat.\n\nThe origin of the meatball is hardly a mystery. When an animal is butchered, there are a limited number of primal cuts, the tender parts that are turned into chops, steaks and roasts. The rest of the beast is used for stewing or put through the meat grinder to become burgers, sausages, meatloaf or meatballs. For many cooks and diners, the bite-size meatball is the most appealing.\n\nAll meatballs begin the same way. Freshly ground meat is mixed with seasonings and a bit of bread or rice before being rolled into balls. (Nearly all recipes advise forming them with wet hands.) They are then browned on the stovetop or in the oven, to be eaten as is, simmered in a sauce or added to a soup.\n\nThis recipe, made with ground lamb, has a Turkish feel, spiced with cumin, coriander, cinnamon and a touch of cayenne. The meatballs are browned in olive oil \u2014 though flattening them into patties to be griddled or grilled would be another good choice \u2014 and served with a traditional yogurt sauce.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome cooks braise their meatballs after browning, which renders them exceedingly moist, soft and tender. In this rendition, I like them straight out of the frying pan, crisp on the outside and juicy inside.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe warm, tart yogurt sauce adds tang and richness, especially when made with whole-milk yogurt.

The Russians did not just go after Hillary Clinton in the general election. They also undertook efforts primarily intended \u201cto denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio,\u201d according to the indictment. If it wasn\u2019t clear before today: The threat to our country includes Russia\u2019s attempts to sow discord among Americans in general, and to shape the Republican primaries. We all stand to lose by being robbed of our democratic choices.\n\nTrying to get beyond partisan politics, it was a wise move to have Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, a Republican, publicly announce the indictments by Mr. Mueller, a Republican, for Russian activities not only to hurt Hillary Clinton but also Republican candidates for president. It was also a good symbol to elevate the public\u2019s understanding of the seriousness of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s charge and why he has such great confidence in Mr. Mueller.\n\nAnd yet Friday\u2019s indictments cover just one part of the multiheaded Russian operation. They detail the Russians\u2019 use of social media platforms to shape preferences and to engineer political rallies. A separate F.B.I. team is investigating Russian agents for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the election. Mr. Mueller is reportedly keenly interested in Russian agents\u2019 offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton to campaign associates of Mr. Trump. And then there\u2019s still the issue of Russian collaboration with WikiLeaks. As with his previous indictments, Mr. Mueller kept the rest of his hand closely guarded.\n\nIt is the case that this round of indictments may help build a future case for any Americans who aided and abetted or conspired with the Russians in any of the Kremlin\u2019s different operations to interfere in the election. Mr. Mueller obviously now appears to have not just intelligence information but also sufficient evidence for a criminal trial. And he has that evidence to prove a Russian conspiracy in \u201cimpairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.\u201d That\u2019s a mouthful, but it captures the scope of the criminal case.\n\nThe indictment tells us that some Trump campaign associates, especially at the grass-roots level, cooperated with the Russians \u201cunwittingly.\u201d That makes sense. As Mr. Rosenstein explained, in answer to a reporter\u2019s question, these parts of the operation depended on Russians\u2019 disguising their identities and duping innocent Americans. According to Mr. Mueller\u2019s other criminal court documents, that was certainly not the case when it came to Russian overtures to more senior levels of the Trump campaign, for example, in offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails.\u201d\n\nBut let the chips fall where they may. If Americans deliberately assisted the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America,\u201d we need to know about it \u2014 at the very least as part of a counterintelligence investigation. If these Americans were \u201cunwitting,\u201d it is important to know how the Russians exploit such vulnerabilities and for Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation to educate the government and the public.", "title": "Opinion | Message to Trump: Let Mueller Do His Job", "authors": []}

Mr. Barone said that the new system would not likely need to be taken offline for updates.

After stating his opposition to same-sex marriage and anti-discrimination laws that protect gay people, his campaign website addressed the Ryan White Care Act, which provided federal funding for H.I.V./AIDS patients:\n\nCongress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\n\nThat was widely interpreted as signaling his support for conversion therapy. Representatives for Mr. Pence did not respond to emails seeking comment this week. But in January, a spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, responded to Mr. Rippon, telling USA Today, \u201cThis accusation is totally false and has no basis in fact.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a spokesman, Marc Lotter, denied that Mr. Pence supported conversion therapy and said his campaign website proposed federal funding for \u201cgroups that promoted safe sexual practices.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Lotter declined to explain what Mr. Pence meant when he referred to groups that \u201ccelebrate and encourage\u201d activity that spreads H.I.V.

But he was careful not to criticize Mr. Rippon.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s communications director, Jarrod Agen, denied that he ever requested a meeting with Mr. Rippon, and said that the USA Today report was \u201cjust not accurate.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

The group has carried out similar attacks in the Indian-administrated portion of Kashmir, particularly along the Line of Control that divides Kashmir into two parts, held by India and Pakistan.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack this weekend, however.\n\nThe attack began around 4:55 a.m. Saturday as four militants dressed in army uniforms and armed with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades descended on Chenni, a small village on the outskirts of Jammu City, said Abdul Rehman Veeri, the parliamentary affairs minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The village is among those closest to the de facto border with Pakistan.\n\nThe militants entered the family quarters of the army officers, gunning down two soldiers and injuring at least nine other people, including women and children, army officials said.\n\nThe militants were cornered and later killed in a residential complex of the camp when the army deployed Special Forces that engaged in a bloody firefight that lasted more than 24 hours, an army spokesman in Jammu, Lt. Col. Devender Anand, said.\n\n\u201cThe militants entered into the residential quarters where they targeted the family members of the army personnel. A junior commissioned officer and a noncommissioned officer were killed in the attack,\u201d the police said.\n\nThe death toll stood at 10 people: five soldiers, four militants and the father of a soldier, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe operation is still in progress,\u201d Colonel Anand said. \u201cWe are still evacuating the trapped family members of the forces.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, army helicopters hovered over the Sunjuwan military station, and the Indian Army chief, Gen. Bipin Rawat, arrived in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIndia\u2019s home minister, Rajnath Singh, said from Delhi that he was monitoring the situation closely.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

New Delhi has often blamed militant groups in Pakistan for sponsoring militant attacks in the region.\n\nAttacks on army bases have become common in the disputed region after the Indian Army killed a charismatic militant leader, Burhan Muzaffar Wani, in July 2016. Protests in the predominantly Muslim valley have increased since then. And more people have joined the fight against Indian rule.\n\nJammu City is in the southern part of Kashmir Valley, at the heart of the dispute between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n\nMore than 200 militants were killed last year, the largest number in seven years, according to the director general of the Jammu and Kashmir police, Shesh Paul Vaid. And the chief minister of the state, Mehbooba Mufti, said last week in the State Assembly that 71 civilians and 49 police officers had been killed over the past two years.\n\nThe police chief for Jammu, Shiv Dev Singh Jamwal, told reporters on Saturday that a sentry had noticed suspicious movement near the camp before the assailants began firing.\n\n\u201cA high alert has been sounded in Jammu, and security beefed up in and around the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state government closed schools and several shopping complexes within a three-mile radius of Chenni and the military station.\n\nMohammad Ashraf Mir, whose son was one of the soldiers killed in the attack, said, \u201cHe died serving his nation.\u201d\n\nThe father, a resident of Kupwara, in northern Kashmir, said: \u201cPeople are getting killed every day. India and Pakistan should come together and resolve there differences.\n\n\u201cToday it is my son; tomorrow it will be someone else\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cSomething should be done to stop this bloodshed immediately.\u201d", "title": "Militants Storm Indian Army Base, Killing Soldiers and a Civilian", "authors": ["Sameer Yasir"]}

I\u2019ve started to cut down on my excess spending.\n\nZach: What\u2019s the best and worst financial advice you\u2019ve received?\n\nEmily: I knew it was going to be bad advice when my mother prefaced it the first time with, \u201cSo, I know I\u2019m a boomer and that means that you think that I don\u2019t know anything but \u2026\u201d and then she started pushing me to start looking for at least a condo to buy, or a house, even saying the classic phrase, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your money paying your landlord\u2019s mortgage.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cO.K., but then when the laundry machines stop working the same month that the heat goes out and they have to replace everything, it\u2019s also not my checkbook.\u201d\n\nMorgan: The best advice I got was not dumping out my retirement fund to pay for my year living in London, because now I still have that.

And it\u2019s not just about the Social Security rug getting pulled out from under us. It\u2019s about our own personal habits. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re putting less into our personal savings than previous generations, but we don\u2019t have pensions to fall back on in the way that they did, and if it\u2019s all on our own behavior and our own responsibility, I think a lot of us are going to be in trouble.\n\nEmily: What if you work a 9-to-5 making a decent salary but you\u2019re a contract worker with no access to benefits? A huge percentage of people our age are in contract positions. They\u2019re like internships. You may get to 28, 30, 35 and you\u2019re building up work history, but you\u2019re structurally not given 401(k)s or things like that.\n\nTravis: I think it\u2019s a good idea that we do the work, but I also think it\u2019s a good example of how millennials are being told that we\u2019re lazy because we\u2019re not doing this work that no one else had to do before us. It\u2019s something that people have to get angry about and start organizing around, that all of these systemic protections are being taken apart. It\u2019s really easy to play into this narrative that millennials are doing everything wrong and they\u2019re not planning, but there\u2019s limits to individual behavior.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 Milorad Dodik would like to make two things clear at the outset: that he is the president of a legitimate state, rather than an ethnically cleansed territory in a country with internationally recognized borders; and that, at 58, he can still shoot hoops like a pro.\n\nOn basketball, he has a point. He plays regularly, and although he never played professionally outside the former Yugoslavia, once an international powerhouse in the sport, he showed good game on a court in St. Petersburg last summer when he joined a veterans\u2019 team, led by the Russian former NBA star Andrei Kirilenko, against Moscow old-timers.\n\nHe is wrong on the presidency, though. Despite his determination to break from the Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Dodik remains the president of the Serb autonomous region, a slice of territory nearly the size of Belgium. The region likes to call itself the Republika Srpska \u2014 a name given to the blood-soaked land by Mr. Dodik\u2019s predecessor, Radovan Karadzic, the convicted war criminal serving a 40-year sentence for genocide against Bosnia\u2019s Muslims.\n\nDuring his two terms as president of the Republika Srpska \u2014 and two more as prime minister \u2014 Mr. Dodik has ruffled more than a few feathers. Despite warnings from the international community, and in violation of a ruling from Bosnia\u2019s highest court, he pressed for a referendum in 2016 on whether to celebrate Jan 9 as a national holiday, the day in 1992 Mr. Karadzic declared a Serb-only state in Bosnia, unleashing a genocidal war.", "title": "Milorad Dodik Wants to Carve Up Bosnia.

A quick internet search will likewise confirm that, for all the fears about how he\u2019d cope with the length and athleticism he\u2019s now seeing daily as the N.B.A.\u2019s oldest rookie \u2014 especially given his well-chronicled defensive shortcomings \u2014 there is no shortage of Teodosic highlights in a Clippers jersey.\n\n\u201cHe still has his razzle-dazzle going,\u201d Dekker said.\n\nNot long after the Clippers saw their All-Star point guard Chris Paul force his way to Houston last June, they signed Teodosic to a two-year deal worth $12.3 million. On a Basketball Without Borders junket in Israel on behalf of the league in August, Dekker found himself being regaled by Israeli reporters with tales about the uncommon vision and flair he was about to be exposed to.\n\n\u201cMy immediate reaction,\u201d Dekker said, \u201cwas that I better go look this guy up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a true shame that N.B.A. assistant coaches overlooked Teodosic in the voting for the annual Rising Stars game featuring first- and second-year players that gets All-Star Weekend underway in earnest next Friday night. The All-Star festivities are in Los Angeles this season and Teodosic belongs in that game not only as a showman supreme who sports the bonus of local ties but because of his impact for the better-than-expected Clippers, who are 17-8 when he\u2019s in uniform and 11-18 when he\u2019s out. Heading into Monday night\u2019s game in Brooklyn, L.A. is also a meaty plus-5.8 points per 100 possessions better this season when he is on the floor compared to when he sits.\n\nTeodosic, though, doesn\u2019t feel slighted in the least.\n\n\u201cBeing in All-Star any way is something big and good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m 30 years old. Maybe some younger guys should go there and feel this feeling.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he was 26, Teodosic was courted hard in free agency by the Memphis Grizzlies. He came close to accepting their offer in the summer of 2013, only to decide he couldn\u2019t bear to leave for the United States until he won a Euroleague title. He never expected that it would take another three years, but his European critics were finally hushed when Teodosic led CSKA Moscow to the second-most prestigious club basketball championship in the world in 2016.\n\nThe expiration of his second three-year CSKA contract after the 2016-17 season then set him up, at last, to make the leap to sample N.B.A. life and try to quiet the critics on both sides of the Atlantic who would have branded his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 incomplete without a stint on U.S. shores.\n\nTeodosic said it felt \u201cweird\u201d to be branded a rookie, after winning Euroleague Most Valuable Player honors as far back as 2010 and unexpectedly steering Serbia into the gold medal game against the mighty United States at both the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. \u201cBut I am happy they don\u2019t treat me like a rookie,\u201d Teodosic said of his fellow Clippers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat means no fetching bagels or doughnuts to bring to practice. No transporting of the veterans\u2019 luggage or singing on teammates\u2019 birthdays with the other first-year players. He arrived with too much hoopla to be assigned rookie chores, especially when, as Dekker put it, Teodosic \u201cknows the game better than most of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel sorry if I didn\u2019t come here,\u201d Teodosic said, admitting that he, too, felt something was missing in his career without an N.B.A. adventure. \u201cI want to show myself I can play here with all these guys. I just feel sorry that I didn\u2019t win Euroleague earlier and came here earlier.\u201d\n\nYet he\u2019s the first to say that they are largely two different games. In Europe, Teodosic capitalized on the smaller court, shorter games and lighter schedule, relying on his pick-and-roll guile to deal with all the bodies in the paint. In the N.B.A., there is more space to cover, far more nuance in the defensive assignments and, most crucially, less time to get shots off.\n\nThe superior quickness he encounters on the perimeter as a Clipper has surely contributed to Teodosic\u2019s shooting struggles (38.2 percent from the floor), but health has been his biggest issue so far. Teodosic has started all 25 games he\u2019s played, earning an unforeseen spot in Coach Doc Rivers\u2019 first five in place of Patrick Beverley, who was his former teammate at Olympiacos in Greece and is not expected back this season after recovering from November knee surgery. But Teodosic, himself, has missed 28 games because of a nagging case of plantar fasciitis in his left foot.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski was so entranced by Teodosic\u2019s floor leadership during multiple battles while Krzyzewski was guiding Team USA that he declared during the Rio Games: \u201cI love him. We\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\nEttore Messina, now an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs after coaching Teodosic at CSKA Moscow for two seasons, said he used to call the point guard Vincent van Gogh in their CSKA days.\n\n\u201cHe is creativity, he is fantasy, he is an artist,\u201d said Messina, who went on in the same conversation to refer to Teodosic as \u201cthe Pete Maravich of European basketball.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think more like a coach, of course, more rational. So we had our clashes,\u201d Messina said. \u201cBut he can see things most of us don\u2019t see. As a coach, you are used to anticipating the play \u2014 you know where the ball will go most of the time. Teo is one of the few players that can surprise you.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers stunned Teodosic and the rest of the league when they dealt the star forward Blake Griffin to Detroit on Jan. 29, but the departure of the most potent and decorated assist target on the roster came with a consolation prize: Teodosic\u2019s longtime national-team colleague and former roommate, Boban Marjanovic, was one of three Pistons acquired in the trade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarjanovic is a fast-talking, 7-foot-3 fan favorite whose hulking presence can only increase his fellow Serbian\u2019s comfort level. Griffin and Teodosic, meanwhile, will always have their memories of that September car ride with Dekker in San Diego, when they pulled into McDonald\u2019s on the way to a team-bonding workout in search of some morning sustenance.\n\nAs Dekker tells it, Teodosic asked for two cheeseburgers when it was their turn in the drive-through and was disconsolate when informed that the full menu wasn\u2019t available at that hour.\n\n\u201cThe person in the speaker was like, \u2018Yeah, we don\u2019t serve those yet,\u2019 \u201d Dekker said. \u201cMilos was so confused. He wanted cheeseburgers so bad.\u201d\n\nTeodosic insists it was \u201clike a joke.\u201d\n\nThe idea of cheeseburgers for breakfast, mind you, fit in well with the narrative of lazy defense and suspect conditioning that dogged Teodosic throughout his European career. But Teodosic, according to Dekker, has never complained once about Dekker\u2019s tweet and how it didn\u2019t exactly enhance his reputation for off-court discipline.\n\n\u201cHe did not care,\u201d Dekker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of guy Milos is. He doesn\u2019t care what people think about him. He\u2019s going to go out and do his thing. He\u2019s going to come out with the beard and the floppy hair, looking like a Beatle.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way. Teodosic said it took him \u201ca long, long time\u201d to learn how to tune out unflattering gossip.\n\n\u201cI used to feel sad,\u201d Teodosic said. \u201cThen you realize that people are there to talk and talk and talk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about things people are talking about me outside of the court \u2014 good or bad.\u201d\n\nHe also rarely interacts with the American news media after spending so long in a world in which reporters are never granted locker-room access, which made the opportunity to spend a morning with him even more intriguing. We talked soccer; Teodosic loves A.C. Milan and Liverpool. We talked Serbian basketball history; Dejan Bodiroga, who could never bring himself to give the N.B.A. a shot, is one of his all-time favorites. And we talked about why he\u2019d rather pass than score.\n\n\u201cBecause you make two people happy,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it should be noted for posterity that Teodosic held up his breakfast sandwich a bit like a trophy when it arrived. \u201cYou see? No cheeseburgers,\u201d he announced with a smile.", "title": "Milos Teodosic Is for Real, Even if That Cheeseburger Story May Not Be", "authors": ["Marc Stein", "On Pro Basketball"]}

Given this blasphemy, where is the conservative revolt?\n\nThe typical conservative cycle runs from backlash to embrace to disappointment \u2014 and we are right on schedule. After opposing government expansion and social change under Democratic presidents, conservatives typically give new Republican presidents the benefit of the doubt. By the time of the next counterattack against a new Democrat, historical revisionism sets in: Republican leaders are seen as part of the problem, being too accommodating to liberalism and selling out their principles.\n\nThe cycle is born of the infeasibility of conservative goals, especially the American right\u2019s attempt to reverse the growth of the welfare and administrative state (which even the world\u2019s most right-wing parties accept) and its tendency to start unwinnable culture wars against inevitable change (a typical conservative foible). The public shares conservatives\u2019 broad desire for limiting government growth and social upheaval, but that does not translate into support for specific policies to achieve those goals. The international and historical norm is that the size and scope of government grow over time and new social changes are codified; conservative resistance slows this liberal policy drift but does not reverse it.\n\nEach conservative cycle begins with a backlash against liberal acceleration. Just as in 2010, the midterm elections of 1966, 1978 and 1994 brought Republican surges reacting to the policies of new Democratic presidents. Each insurgency was more conservative than the previous version, but they lacked realistic and popular proposals to rein in government or reverse social change; they focused mostly on stopping Democratic action.", "title": "Opinion | Missing Conservatism?

In those times, getting by on moisturizer alone can be a challenge. Fortunately, a new breed of hybrid beauty product has emerged to subtly minimize imperfections without requiring layers of foundation or heavy powders.\n\nBehold the modern primer. Of course, these fluids have been around for decades, employed as a first step to even out skin tone, fill in pores and smooth the surface of your face to prep it for foundation. But the formulas of the past were light on any lasting benefits, and often left a white-ish cast on the complexion.\n\nThe latest iterations, however, have smart technology \u2014 soft-focus filters, breathable textures \u2014 and skin-care-level ingredients, making them function as highlighter, serum and moisturizer in one tube. In fact, you might find that they flatter your complexion well enough that you can wear them alone \u2014 as a base, in lieu of makeup \u2014 and not regret that decision later.\n\n\u201cThe new formulas have skin-enhancing qualities, so they give you the most natural of glows,\u201d says New York City-based makeup artist Hannah Murray, who is partial to Dr. Barbara Sturm\u2019s Glow Drops ($145), a milky lotion that contains active natural ingredients (including anti-inflammatory purslane) and mineral pigments to illuminate and hydrate dull skin. Tatcha\u2019s The Silk Canvas ($52) is inspired by the traditional geisha ritual of pressing melted bintsuke (Japanese wax) over the face to protect it from makeup; this modern spin utilizes botanicals to fend off the damaging effects of pollution. Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s Brightening Youth Glow ($55), meanwhile, pairs trendy wellness ingredients, like revitalizing chlorella and nourishing vitamin B, with high-tech pearlized particles for a creamy gel that \u201cinstantly blurs, evens imperfections and corrects redness,\u201d Tilbury explains. When worn on its own, she finds, the primer gives skin a \u201cgorgeous\u201d effect.\n\nRather than quick fixes, many of today\u2019s primers are formulated with long-term anti-aging in mind (and have price tags that rival those of expensive creams). La Prairie\u2019s Cellular Radiance Perfecting Fluide Pure Gold ($550), for example, pairs collagen-boosting peptides with finely milled flecks of gold to scatter light across the face while also firming it over time. Or consider Sisley-Paris\u2019s Instant \u00c9clat ($90): Its plant extracts replenish skin\u2019s natural \u201cwater cushion\u201d for a plumped result that lasts after the soft-pink lotion has melted into your skin.\n\nStill, if dryness is an issue, it\u2019s best to apply these primers over traditional moisturizers. Murray often works them in with a mini-massage technique. \u201cI like to apply with my fingers, smoothing from the center of the face outward and then patting in with the palms of my hands,\u201d she says, adding that this helps \u201cstimulate blood flow and plump the skin.\u201d Will you still need a touch of concealer to cover up under-eye circles or a blemish? Perhaps, but you will need far less. And that can translate into a more realistic radiance.

Mr. de Blasio has pledged not to choose someone from outside education, as Mr. Bloomberg did twice, and the committee is focusing on people who have previously run urban districts. Given the makeup of the city\u2019s schools, which are nearly 70 percent black and Hispanic, many expect a new chancellor who looks like the student body.\n\nMaking things harder, the job is relatively low paid. Ms. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s current salary is $234,569. The superintendent in Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second largest district with more than 640,000 students, makes $350,000.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s relationship with the teachers\u2019 union has led some to suggest that Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and former president of the city union, will have veto power over the choice. Ms. Weingarten said she had \u201cnot had one conversation with the mayor about this,\u201d though she said some candidates had called to consult with her before being interviewed.\n\nMs. Weingarten said that she was \u201cnot pushing for anybody\u201d but that she believed Kelvin R. Adams, the superintendent of the St. Louis public schools, could do the job. When Dr. Adams was appointed in 2008, the state board of education had revoked the district\u2019s accreditation and given control to an appointed board. Since then, the district, which serves close to 22,000 students, roughly 80 percent of them African-American, has improved significantly, and its accreditation was restored last year.\n\nAsked through a spokeswoman whether he had been interviewed for the job, Dr. Adams declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s spokesman, said on Wednesday that Mr. de Blasio would make a decision soon.\n\nPaul Hill, a professor at the University of Washington and the founder of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, said that there was a cyclical nature to the leadership of school systems, where the aggressive innovations of an outsider like Mr. Klein lead to demands for \u201can insider, somebody that educators identify with,\u201d like Ms. Fari\u00f1a, who had been a teacher and principal in New York.\n\nHe said that New York was due now for another outsider, if perhaps one less confrontational than Mr. Klein.

It was the first decline in overall civilian casualties since 2012.\n\nThe report also says that despite a stepped-up pace of aerial bombardments aimed at the Taliban and Islamic State militants under President Trump\u2019s new strategy for the war, civilian casualties from airstrikes rose only 7 percent. The United Nations credited better targeting in the American-led air campaign, compared with previous years.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s response to the airstrikes, however, has been ferocious, indicating that what Afghan officials openly call a Pakistani-backed insurgent group is hardly a spent force.\n\nThe report put a spotlight on \u201ccomplex attacks,\u201d a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, United Nations officials say. These involve two or more commandos with suicide vests seizing a building or taking hostages, fighting for hours and detonating their explosives only when security forces close in.\n\nSuch attacks have recently become a hallmark of the war.

After a while, dieters returned to their old habits and regained the lost weight, often more than they had lost in the first place.\n\nAs Dr. Livingston stated, \u201cProviding patients with the false hope that if they only reduce one class of foods or another (e.g., carbohydrates or fats) they will lose weight can become frustrating, and may in part explain the failure of most diets.\u201d Even reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (which provide no nutrients beyond sweet calories), he wrote, \u201cis not likely to influence obesity at the population level,\u201d which has continued to increase even as soda consumption has declined.\n\nRather than a soda tax, Dr. Livingston endorsed taxes based on the calorie content of foods, and using the revenue generated \u201cto subsidize healthy foods to make them more affordable.\u201d Noting that \u201cthe common denominator for all successful diet plans is calorie reduction, irrespective of how that is achieved,\u201d he said that a slimmer American populace can be achieved only if attention is paid to the entire food supply.\n\nThat attention is unlikely to be paid anytime soon by either the processed food industry or government regulatory agencies, so it is up to consumers to take matters into their own hands, eyes and mouths.

According to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, of the 5.5 million Americans who report playing tackle football, 596,000 \u2014 or 10.9 percent \u2014 are female.\n\nIt is notable that more girls want to play even as annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations reported that participation in high school football went down 3.5 percent over the past five years.\n\nValerie Palmer-Mehta, a professor of communication at Oakland University whose work focuses on women and rhetoric, said the change is evidence of larger cultural shifts.\n\n\u201cWe can thank a constellation of cultural forces for women\u2019s involvement in football today, from Title IX to the women\u2019s movement, to strong female athletes who have persisted in pursuing their athletic dreams despite a lack of broader cultural support,\u201d Dr. Palmer-Mehta said.\n\nPhoto\n\nTeam sports like football provide well established social, physical and psychological benefits. But a Boston University study released last year found that kids who played tackle football before age 12 may be at higher risk for emotional and behavioral problems later in life. Another study took MRIs of the brains of kids before and after a single season of tackle football, removing from the study anyone who had a diagnosable concussion. Those researchers found that there was a change in the brain\u2019s white matter after just one season of play.

And Dr. Stern noted that it is not possible to say whether the research \u2014 which looked only at boys \u2014 can be generalized to include girls because in an all-girls league, the force of the hits could be different.\n\nBut several studies have found that in sports with comparable rules between girls and boys, the rates of concussion are actually higher in women. Not only that, a 2012 statement from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine highlighted research showing that female athletes sustain more concussions than their male counterparts, report more severe symptoms and have a longer duration of recovery than men.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to female athletes\u2019 participation \u2014 regardless of age \u2014 we\u2019re lacking in truly understanding their experience around head injury,\u201d said Donna Duffy, co-director of the Female Brain Project, a research team at the University of North Carolina Greensboro studying head injuries in female athletes. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of this; there\u2019s a growing body of literature suggesting that biological sex hormones may be impacted or disrupted when a head injury is sustained.\u201d\n\nBut while Dr. Duffy cautions more research is needed, she agrees with other researchers that prepubescent kids should avoid playing tackle football.\n\nParents whose daughters want to play football may feel they have a difficult decision to make. Several programs suggest flag football as a healthier option for both boys and girls, because they learn the strategy of the game and develop agility skills without risking the injuries of tackling.\n\nLast month, the Concussion Legacy Foundation, composed of doctors and former N.F.L. players, recommended that no children play tackle football before age 14. They\u2019ve created the Flag Football Under 14 program to encourage kids who want to play football to start with flag football until they\u2019re older, and Chris Nowinski, the foundation\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, says those guidelines apply to both boys and girls.\n\nThe N.F.L. has also been promoting its flag football program, which partners with U.S.A. Football to allow kids who play flag football to sport the uniform and logo of an N.F.L. team. The N.F.L.

What they are buying are often special-edition, fully loaded models, like Mr. Victorian\u2019s Raptor, that sell for as much as or more than BMW\u2019s flagship 7 Series sedan.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing it,\u201d said Tom Libby, an auto industry analyst at the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThere is movement from luxury cars to luxury trucks.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 GMC brand \u2014 which sells only trucks and S.U.V.s \u2014 accounted for 11.3 percent of domestic sales of models with an average price of $60,000 or more in 2017, according to data from Edmunds.com. Five years earlier, the brand made up a mere 0.1 percent of those sales.\n\nFord and Chevrolet saw similar but smaller jumps, driven by increasing high-end truck and S.U.V. sales. At the same time, the portion of over-$60,000 sales for luxury brands including Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Jaguar and Cadillac shrank.\n\nAccelerating, and Sometimes Passing The rapid growth of the luxury truck and sport-utility vehicle segment has substantially increased United States automakers\u2019 share of domestic sales of models with an average price of $60,000 or more. % 20 15 10 5 0 Porsche Mercedes-Benz Lexus GMC Ford Chevrolet 2012 2017 % 20 15 10 5 0 Porsche Mercedes-Benz Lexus GMC Ford Chevrolet 2012 2017 % 20 15 10 5 0 Porsche Mercedes-Benz Lexus GMC Ford Chevrolet 2012 2017\n\nThat is providing a tailwind for the Detroit automakers when overall new-vehicle sales in the United States are slowing. General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, with its Jeep brand, dominate in trucks and S.U.V.s, and now they\u2019re scrambling to roll out more high-end versions.\n\nIt\u2019s a competitive \u2014 and crucial \u2014 segment. With demand for cars shriveling, the Detroit three and even some foreign manufacturers acknowledge they are now losing money on many of the cars they sell. But a $60,000 truck can generate tens of thousands of dollars in operating profit.\n\nAt a recent investor conference, G.M. outlined a plan to produce more of the pricey Denali versions of GMC S.U.V.s and trucks. The company showed data indicating that the Denali line had an average sale price of $56,000 \u2014 more than the average price of a BMW, a Mercedes-Benz or an Audi.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis thing,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Dan Ammann, said of the Denali line, \u201cis a money machine.\u201d\n\nThe other Detroit carmakers are heading in the same direction.\n\nIn October, Ford began making new versions of its eight-passenger Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size S.U.V.s, and already has decided to make 25 percent more this year than it originally planned. In January, Navigators sold for an average of $77,000, thanks to strong sales of the top-of-the-line Black Label edition.\n\nFiat Chrysler is preparing to add more Jeep models, including a pickup and a full-size Grand Wagoneer.\n\nIn 2017, S.U.V.s and crossovers made up 41 percent of the market in the United States, up from 30 percent in 2013, according to Autodata. Luxury cars have gone in the opposite direction: They made up 5.4 percent of the market last year, down from 7.5 percent four years earlier.\n\nAnd the priciest S.U.V.s and trucks are selling fastest. The high-end Lariat, King Ranch and Raptor models make up more than half of all F-150 sales, up from one-third a few years ago. Denali editions account for 29 percent of GMC\u2019s sales, up from 21 percent.\n\nLow gasoline prices are one reason that sales of high-end trucks are rising. Years ago, pickups and big S.U.V.s often traveled only 11 or 12 miles on a gallon of gas. Today, their fuel economy is often double that.\n\n\u201cThe complaint that S.U.V.s are horrible on gas is not such a roadblock anymore,\u201d said Mark Scarpelli, owner of two Chevrolet dealerships and a Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep franchise in Illinois.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, automakers have appointed special-edition S.U.V.s and trucks with the same kinds of advanced technologies and comfort features that consumers once found only in luxury cars. Want an interior trimmed in African mahogany? You can get it in the Black Label Navigator. Want an S.U.V. that accelerates like a Porsche (and isn\u2019t a Porsche)?

In 2017, for example, BMW\u2019s sales to individual customers at dealerships in the United States fell more than 5 percent, according data shared among automakers.

Indeed, Mr. Tsvangirai seemed to settle into a more comfortable relationship with him, built on the privileges of office.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2012, after Mr. Tsvangirai celebrated his second marriage with a glitzy party attended by guests arriving in Bentleys, Mercedes and BMWs, some of his followers were aghast at the ostentatiousness of the display and questioned who had paid for it.\n\nBy the time elections were held the following year, Mr. Tsvangirai was greatly weakened. He accused Mr. Mugabe of rigging the election and challenged him in the courts. But Mr. Mugabe claimed victory with 61 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Tsvangirai, and it seemed that Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s brush with high office was over. That was certainly Mr. Mugabe\u2019s view.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have thrown the enemy away like garbage,\u201d Mr. Mugabe said. \u201cWe say to them: You are never going to rise again.\u201d\n\nFor all that, Mr. Tsvangirai appeared in recent months to be attempting a comeback, even as he made frequent trips abroad for colon cancer treatment.\n\nIn 2017, he was part of a so-called united front with other opposition groups, including the Zimbabwe People First movement, which is led by Joice Mujuru, a former vice president and onetime guerrilla fighter who was ousted by Mr. Mugabe in 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn 2013, we don\u2019t know what hit us,\u201d Mr. Tsvangirai said last year, finally conceding that he had been beaten in the polls that year. \u201cWe were defeated. But this time, we will refuse to be defeated.\u201d\n\nThe intention behind the alliance with Ms. Mujuru was to challenge Mr. Mugabe in elections in 2018, but that strategy was eclipsed by the military-backed intervention last November that brought Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former ally of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s, to power.\n\nAfter Mr. Mugabe was overthrown, there was fevered speculation that Mr. Mnangagwa would seek a more inclusive form of rule than that of the leader he had just ousted. Instead, Mr. Mnangagwa lauded Mr. Mugabe and announced a government of his own supporters, including the military.\n\nEven as he fell ill with cancer, however, Mr. Tsvangirai failed to groom a successor, and he left behind a fractured party with no obvious leader to challenge Mr. Mnangagwa in the elections expected this year.\n\nThe eldest in a family of nine, Mr. Tsvangirai was born on March 10, 1952, in the Gutu district of Masvingo Province, in central Zimbabwe. The family was poor, and Mr. Tsvangirai abandoned formal schooling early to start work, first as a textile weaver and then as a plant foreman in a nickel mine.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1978 he married Susan Mhundwa, with whom he had six children before her death in a car accident in 2009. (Mr. Tsvangirai was injured in the crash, with a truck near Harare, as was the car\u2019s driver.) He married Elizabeth Macheka three years later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis personal life at the time raised eyebrows. While he was planning to marry Ms. Macheka, another woman claimed to be his wife from a traditional ceremony in 2011. A court ruled in her favor.\n\nA third woman also filed court papers claiming that she had been engaged to Mr. Tsvangirai. He eventually apologized publicly to his supporters.\n\n\u201cI had no intention to hurt anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a genuine search\u201d for a new wife.\n\nLike Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Mnangagwa, Mr. Tsvangirai was a member of the dominant Shona ethnic group. But while they chose armed resistance from exile in the so-called front-line states bordering what was then Rhodesia, Mr. Tsvangirai became a labor union leader, defending workers\u2019 rights and rising through the ranks. He was elected secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions in 1988.\n\nHis political roots in the labor movement set him apart from those like Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Mnangagwa, who drew their legitimacy from the seven-year war against white minority rule. Initially an ally, he became a thorn in the side of Mr. Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut as the president\u2019s intolerance became more evident, the gulf between the two men widened.\n\nFamed for his vicious criticism of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government, Mr. Tsvangirai was twice detained during his time as a labor leader, the first time in 1989 after he voiced concern over rising state repression.

That meant millions of new textbooks, which initially were printed in Pakistan. But as relations with that country soured, the government steered those textbook contracts to a few major Afghan publishers.\n\nForeign aid underwrote the school system, so the textbook business jump-started the book publishing industry. Because millions of textbooks had to be printed in a short period of time, Aazem and a few other companies invested in their own presses, which went largely idle once the school publishing season was over. Then the new publishers began translating Western books from English into Dari and Pashto, the country\u2019s two main languages.\n\nOther publishers sprung up, renting the bigger companies\u2019 presses.\n\n\u201cThere was such a curiosity and thirst to know about the world and how people think about Afghanistan,\u201d said Davood Moradian, director general of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, a research organization whose picturesque ancient campus, the Fort of Nine Towers, is a favored venue for book parties. \u201cThe book industry is a growing phenomenon to try to satisfy that thirst.\u201d\n\nThe first locally published books were nonfiction titles about Afghanistan, by Western authors, and they sold so well, there was a rush into the business.

In 2014, it broadcast daily highlights from the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, although none of its athletes competed there. That makes the absence of Olympic broadcasting in the North all the more conspicuous this year.\n\n\u201cThe last thing the North Korean authorities want is for its people to envy the South,\u201d said Jung Gwang-il, a North Korean defector.\n\nLike its former socialist allies, North Korea has recognized the role of sports in reasserting what it calls the country\u2019s ideological superiority. When its athletes returned home with golds, it honored them with car parades and rewards, like new apartments. The most celebrated example was Jong Song-ok, who won the World Championships marathon in Spain in 1999.\n\nMs. Jong famously said she won because while running, she imagined Kim Jong-il, then North Korea\u2019s leader, \u201cbeckoning me from the finish line.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim, the father of the current leader, made her a \u201chero of the republic,\u201d the highest honor in the country, for lifting the morale of his people still, in the grip of a devastating famine.

The International Olympic Committee granted the 22 North Koreans at the current games last-minute exemptions to compete in five sports in Pyeongchang, including a dozen who joined the South Korean women\u2019s ice hockey squad to create the first inter-Korean Olympic team ever.

That created an opening for Mr. Kim to engage in what critics called a \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim sent hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians and singers to the Games to supplement his meager sports contingent. They stole much of the show on the sidelines of the games. He also sent the most unusual Olympic guest: his sister, whose visit to the South, including meetings with President Moon Jae-in, created a media frenzy.

They told North Koreans that their arts troupe performed to \u201cpacked audiences\u201d in the South. They also reported the North Korean cheerleaders rooting for the joint Korean ice hockey team but did not mention that it lost 8-0 to Switzerland and Sweden.

Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about their contacts with Russians or intermediaries but not to criminal acts related to collusion.\n\nJohn M. Dowd, the president\u2019s private lawyer, pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s cooperation with the investigation as evidence that he had nothing to hide.

He rode on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plane and served as liaison to the Republican National Committee. After the election victory, he joined the transition as a right hand to Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the president\u2019s close friend who ran the inaugural operation.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Gates was allowed to plead guilty to just two relatively lower-level charges indicated to legal experts that he must have something of value for Mr. Mueller. The presumption in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle is that Mr. Gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against Mr. Manafort, who in turn could threaten Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Manafort participated in a meeting in June 2016 along with Donald Trump Jr., the candidate\u2019s son, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer on the promise of receiving incriminating information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of Russia\u2019s government.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Starr.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the current case, the targets so far have included not just a \u201ccoffee boy,\u201d as Mr. Papadopoulos was described by an adviser to Mr. Trump, but the president\u2019s top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Mr. Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Mr. Manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that he was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s chairman.\n\nMoreover, it remains unclear why he volunteered to work for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressure.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation, accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled by a former British spy hired by investigators working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nTo the extent that Mr. Mueller is exploring whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey, the president\u2019s defenders contend that under the Constitution, he has the power to dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work. They also point to testimony by Mr. Comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impeded.\n\nTherefore, they argue, the original order appointing Mr. Mueller was itself invalid and should be revoked.\n\nIn the meantime, they are left to interpret the clues from Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions just like everyone else. David B. Rivkin Jr., a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Reagan and President George Bush, said the totality of Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions still did not add up to a threat to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to unfold piecemeal an indictment of Russian entities and Russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case. It makes no logical sense,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, at least, what he\u2019s done does underscore that there\u2019s no collusion there. That leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which I think is constitutionally flawed and isn\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Wittes said Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions could be seen as building a pyramid \u2014 establishing that there was a Russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses. But the special counsel has not tipped his hand yet.\n\n\u201cThe basic contours of the puzzle is that he\u2019s constructed his actions in a way that we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s leading,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s on purpose.\u201d", "title": "Mueller Is Gaining Steam.

Rather than acknowledge the meeting\u2019s intended purpose \u2014 to obtain political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government \u2014 the statement instead described the meeting as being about an obscure Russian adoption policy.\n\nThe statement, released in response to questions from The New York Times about the meeting, has become a focus of the inquiry by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller in recent months have questioned numerous White House officials about how the release came together \u2014 and about how directly Mr. Trump oversaw the process. Mr. Mueller\u2019s team recently notified Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers that the Air Force One statement is one of about a dozen subjects that prosecutors want to discuss in a face-to-face interview of Mr. Trump that is still being negotiated.\n\nThe revelation of the meeting was striking: It placed the president\u2019s son and his top campaign officials in direct contact with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and an email to the president\u2019s son emerged saying that the information was part of Russia\u2019s effort to help the Trump campaign. The special counsel is investigating how those revelations were handled in real time in part because the president was involved in his administration\u2019s response.\n\nSome lawyers and witnesses who have sat in or been briefed on the interviews have puzzled over Mr. Mueller\u2019s interest in the episode. Lying to federal investigators is a crime; lying to the news media is not. For that reason, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers argue that Mr. Mueller has no grounds to ask the president about the statement and say he should refuse to discuss it.", "title": "Mueller Zeros In on Story Put Together About Trump Tower Meeting", "authors": []}

Because however much time was devoted to the subject at school, your son needs more: at least enough to stop segregationist games of tag. I also don\u2019t buy that he doesn\u2019t \u201creally know what he did.\u201d He is plenty old to understand the cruelty of excluding others, and given the copious classroom conversations, the special cruelty of his behavior here.\n\nNews flash: Kids can be mean. Yours was awful. Don\u2019t make excuses for him. Your son clearly owes his classmate an apology. While I applaud your reaching out to these other parents for guidance, they are under no obligation to provide it. (I wouldn\u2019t be roaring to get on the phone with you, either \u2014 especially if your message downplayed your son\u2019s awareness of wrongdoing.) The good news: As an adult, you can supervise your son\u2019s apology all by yourself.\n\nConsider making it a written apology (dictated by Sonny, if needed). This may impress upon him the gravity of his error. And when the other boy brings the note home, his parents may be impressed, too. Now, if I was wrong about the ironic cast of your email (and it was merely florid), I apologize. But there\u2019s nothing children pick up on faster than cues from their parents that a problem is really no problem.", "title": "My Kindergartner Is Not a Racist, I Swear!", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "Eight days later, just before midnight on June 23, a sentry detected movement just outside our perimeter. One of us opened fire, and we soon received a rocket-propelled grenade from the enemy in response. Fortunately the grenade hit a dirt mound, absorbing the explosion.\n\nBut all of this was just a distraction. The enemy was there that night to plant an anti-vehicle mine. The next morning a personnel carrier approaching our position hit that mine, flipping in the air with such force that it landed back on the crater created by the explosion. It was maybe 300 feet from our position.\n\nGeoff and I cleared our way to the flipped vehicle, with me using the mine detector and Geoff prodding with his bayonet. We were looking for the anti-personnel mines the enemy usually laid, aimed at the men they knew would be rushing to the aid of the casualties. All of a sudden, there I was, doing stuff I was sure only experts would do.\n\nOnce we reached the vehicle we could see that the crew commander and the driver were the only ones on board, and they were both dead. The head of one of them had been crushed flat. I\u2019d never seen a dead person before, and I still remember my shock that the human body could be so distorted and devastated.\n\nOn July 4 \u2014 10 days later \u2014 at around 9 p.m., Geoff and I heard an explosion nearby, which Geoff recognized immediately as the sound of an M16 mine. We soon learned that the battalion\u2019s 7 Platoon had hit the mine, and that about half of the 24-man platoon were casualties. Geoff knew that one of our fellow tunnel rats, Sapper Robert Earl, known as Yogi, was the No. 1 of the team attached to that platoon.\n\nThirty minutes later we soon heard another explosion, from the same direction. \u201cThe poor bastards have hit another M16 mine,\u201d Geoff said, and at around 10 p.m. he was told we were to be taken out to the mine incident by helicopter, along with another tunnel rat, Rod Crane, plus some medics and infantry.\n\nAfter we all scrambled aboard the chopper it eased off the ground in what was to be my very first chopper ride \u2014 then plopped straight down again. The pilot said the load was too heavy and that two or even three guys had to get off.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

In my na\u00efvet\u00e9 and inexperience, I would have been a liability out there that night. In the darkness, amid the scene of human carnage created by the two mine explosions and with who knows how many live mines still in the area, my chances of making a mistake were high.\n\nOn arrival at the site, Geoff and Rod immediately got to work. Yogi Earl had been wounded by both mine explosions \u2014 in the shoulder by the first, then severely in the legs by the second. Despite his wounds, he continued to clear mines, helping to ensure the survival of his comrades. Out of the 24 men, three were dead and 15 wounded, 10 of them seriously enough to be evacuated to Australia.\n\n\u201cYogi was just amazing,\u201d Geoff recalled later. \u201cBits were hanging everywhere off his legs, and he\u2019d lost a lot of blood \u2014 a real lot of blood. He couldn\u2019t move, but as soon as he saw us he starts telling us which areas are cleared, which areas are unproven and how the safe lanes were marked. This enabled us to safely direct the infantry who\u2019d arrived with us into positions where they could effectively protect the platoon while we got on with our job.\u201d\n\nYogi was evacuated by chopper to the 36th Evacuation Hospital, at Vung Tau, and subsequently sent home to Australia. He was \u201cmentioned in dispatches,\u201d an honor for bravery in combat in the Australian military \u2014 which was nevertheless an appallingly inadequate recognition for the courage he showed that night.\n\nGeoff returned the next morning, and he didn\u2019t really discuss what had taken place out at the mine incident. It was all just treated as part of the job. It was a seemingly effective self-preservation mechanism, but one with long-term costs in the form of repressed memories.\n\nDuring the final days of the operation, we heard how several other elements of the regiment and their tunnel rats had also been involved in mine incidents. Even today, Operation Esso remains infamous in Australian military history for the high casualty rate, largely from mines.\n\nGeoff and I arrived back at our Nui Dat base camp on July 15, and we were greeted with the news that a troop barbecue would be held the following night. The first thing I noticed at the festivities was how the guys who had been in country for six months or more had a special bond. It wasn\u2019t anything overt, but there was this underlying trust and confidence among them. They shared a sharp, seemingly cruel sense of humor, using phrases totally foreign to us new guys. We would soon learn that only hard time in this place could direct your humor into those dark spaces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike most young adults of the era I had done my share of drinking, but I\u2019d never seen anything like the barbecue that night. Everyone was freshly showered and in brand new, army-issue pants and shirts, but within a short time, virtually every shirt had been ripped to shreds, with some guys having little more than a collar left. It was evidently a longstanding ritual. We ate the steaks and sausages, but the crabs and the salad were ammunition in a food fight, eventually engulfing the entire troop and leaving us all splattered with crab guts, lettuce leaves and tomato remnants.\n\nIt was all good-natured, and obviously a means of coping. I\u2019m sure a psychiatrist could explain it in technical terms, but it was fairly obvious that the alcohol, the behavior and the special comradeship enjoyed by the \u201cold hands\u201d were all a means of shutting away the nasty stuff, enabling us to get on with the continuing task in the months ahead.\n\nFor me that first operation seemed to be one hell of an introduction to my tour in Vietnam, though I had no idea whether what took place was typical, and no way to measure whether I\u2019d had a rough time of it or had actually gotten off lightly. I would come to learn it was the latter.\n\nOur tunnel rat unit was small, with at most 120 men in the country at any time, and a total of around 700 who served from 1965 to 1972. During that period 36 of us were killed and around 200 were wounded, giving us a casualty rate of 33 percent, high even by Vietnam War standards. One in three of us was either killed or wounded during our tour.\n\nGiven what we were engaged in, it\u2019s a wonder that number wasn\u2019t higher. I didn\u2019t realize it then, but I survived largely unscathed thanks to the instructors and the education I received at the School of Military Engineering. From raw recruits they produced hundreds of men who did extraordinary things in this job \u2014 things totally foreign to the civilian lives we\u2019d so recently left behind.\n\nThe last thing I remember about my time in Vietnam was the pills. When I reached the point of having only 10 days to go in my tour, I knew I was safe. The medics put me on a course of pills designed to flush out any tropical bugs and diseases lurking in my system. Despite the medication\u2019s devastating laxative effect, troops called them \u201chappy pills.\u201d The ever-practical army figured it was best that I not move too far away from a decent toilet during this treatment, so I was confined to base. It was the end of ambushes and patrols beyond the wire. I would be heading home in one piece.", "title": "My Life as a Tunnel Rat", "authors": ["Jim Marett"]}

Crema was a proud part of the Republic of Venice for three and a half centuries. The marble lions of Mark the Evangelist, Venice\u2019s patron saint, still grace the town hall and the Torrazzo, the main gate leading into the Piazza del Duomo.\n\nAnd now, thanks to this movie, many foreigners will discover that Italy is not one gigantic Tuscany, a soft drug peddled in predictable packages, such as hills in the sunset, olive groves, lemon trees and white wine. Crema has none of that. Our land is flat; we grow wheat and corn, not olives; and our wine comes in bottles from Piedmont or Veneto. In Crema you will not bump into an American on every street corner. In Cortona, you do. Sorry, Frances Mayes \u2014 there are too many foreigners under the Tuscan sun.\n\nCrema offers the right mix of mild unpredictability and sensory reassurance. Every spring and summer we have friends stay, and they are all enchanted. You may think I\u2019m being too romantic, or even biased. But I do believe that a town like ours represents the stunning, ordinary charm of Italy better than those world-famous cities. Rome, Venice and Florence are unique and breathtaking, but overwhelming. Crema takes you by the hand and slowly teaches you what Italy is about: its old houses and waterways, the deep green and lighthearted conversation, the ripe fruit (the sexual potential of peaches and apricots is fully explored in Mr. Guadagnino\u2019s movie).\n\nWe know the pleasures of pausing and observation in my country. We don\u2019t look at people, we see them.

Luigi Barzini Jr., some 40 years later, in his book \u201cThe Italians,\u201d tried to explain the reasons behind the attraction: \u201cThe art of living, this disreputable art developed by the Italians to defeat regimentation, is now becoming an invaluable guide for survival for many people.\u201d\n\nA half-century on, those assessments still ring true. Last summer, when an English friend, enjoying her aperitivo under our huge magnolia tree, asked me to sum up Italy in a sentence, I said, \u201cItaly can have you fuming and purring in the space of 100 meters or the course of 10 minutes.\u201d \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d may or may not end up as best picture, but it will convince you that I\u2019m right.", "title": "Opinion | My Simple Italian Town Is at Risk of an Oscar", "authors": []}

As more Americans move away from consuming sports on traditional televisions, the streaming operation has become vital.\n\nJust seven days into the Pyeongchang Games, the number of streamed minutes was poised to double the 420 million from Sochi four years ago. NBC has since announced that Pyeongchang streaming has tripled the Sochi numbers. At the lowest point, usually 4 a.m. to 5 a.m. Eastern, the streaming levels are the same as NBC sees for a decent English Premier League game, while at the end of the workday they match those for \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just lose track of time because the audience is so high,\u201d said Eric Black, the digital chief technology officer.\n\nThat is doubly true for those in the highlights factory, a large room full of interns sitting at rows of computers, each decorated with a different country\u2019s flag.

Fox won the bidding to show it for the next five seasons.\n\nNBC said it expected $500 million in advertising revenue from the Super Bowl, where commercials were sold for about $5 million for each 30-second time slot.\n\nBut the importance of this Super Bowl to NBC went beyond ratings and any revenue it took directly from ad sales. The Winter Olympics are coming \u2014 the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is Friday, and the Games end Feb. 25 \u2014 and NBC is the first network to broadcast the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics in the same year since CBS did so in 1992.\n\nThe network persuaded many advertisers to buy package deals of commercial time during both the Super Bowl and Olympics, and, as you might have noticed (and then noticed again and again), NBC used the Super Bowl as a giant platform to promote the Games.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Pyeongchang, not exactly a familiar location, is also in an unfavorable time zone for NBC, 14 hours ahead of the East Coast. NBC used its captive Super Bowl audience to try to excite people about some of the athletes and events they will see over the next three weeks.\n\nThe network\u2019s pregame show featured almost as much talk about the Olympics as it did for football, and a 60-second ad featuring the American skier Lindsey Vonn aired during halftime.\n\nOne familiar face will be absent from his usual perch at the Games: Bob Costas, who has been the prime-time host of every NBC Olympic broadcast since the Barcelona Games in 1992. The network lured Mike Tirico away from ESPN in 2016 as Costas\u2019s long-term replacement, and last year decided he would be the face of the Pyeongchang Olympics.\n\nCostas was still expected to host Super Bowl coverage with Tirico already in South Korea, however, but that job instead went to Dan Patrick and Liam McHugh. Costas told SportsBusiness Journal last month that he has \u201clong had ambivalent feelings about football\u201d and that the game should be hosted by someone who is \u201cmore enthusiastic\u201d about the sport.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCostas has indeed been vocal in recent years about his discomfort with the connection between playing football and head trauma. Those concerns were borne out in stark fashion during the Super Bowl, when Patriots wide receiver Brandin Cooks was ruled out of the game after suffering a brutal, but legal, helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter.\n\nWhile concerns about concussions are most likely one of the factors that have led to the N.F.L.\u2019s regular season ratings decline, the fact that the Super Bowl viewership drop was less severe than the regular season decrease drives home the fact that the N.F.L.\u2019s problem is the frequency with which hard-core fans watch rather than casual fans turning off the television.\n\nAccording to Mike Mulvihill, Fox Sports\u2019 head of research and planning, while total N.F.L. viewership has dropped 19 percent over the last two seasons, the league\u2019s reach \u2014 meaning the total number of people watching some part of a game \u2014 has declined just 4 percent.\n\nPeople are watching less football, but they still tune in for the big events.", "title": "NBC\u2019s Super Bowl Win (Everyone Knows About the Olympics Now, Right?)", "authors": ["Kevin Draper"]}

But a member of the eight-person hiring committee was aware of one episode and raised it to human resources: A woman said Mr. Oreskes had left her multiple voice mail messages late at night asking to discuss his book while they were at a conference.

Around the same time, a woman told NPR\u2019s legal team that Mr. Oreskes had kissed her without her consent when he was employed by The Times.\n\nHe was suspended on Oct. 31 after the Washington Post article was published.

Powell, the new Federal Reserve chairman, who arrived in that role as a relative unknown, will make his public debut on Tuesday morning when he testifies before the House Financial Services Committee.

Mr. Powell has said that he plans to continue the Fed\u2019s gradual retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, slowly raising interest rates and slowly reducing the Fed\u2019s bond portfolio. While the economy is gaining strength, Mr. Powell is likely to emphasize that so far, stronger growth is increasing the Fed\u2019s confidence in its plans, rather than giving it a reason to move more quickly.

Economists are skeptical of the cause and effect, noting that the low unemployment rate is also putting pressure on companies to raise pay. But whatever the reason, the bonuses are real \u2014 and could show up in data that the Commerce Department will release on Thursday. The report, which covers Americans\u2019 income and spending in January, won\u2019t capture the direct effects of the tax cuts, which mostly didn\u2019t show up in workers\u2019 paychecks until February. But it could show the impact of bonuses and pay increases, as well as any extra spending they might have generated. Don\u2019t expect a big bump, however: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg said both income and spending probably grew more slowly in January. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will be watching the report for any signs that inflation is picking up.

The advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, includes many tycoons and other business leaders and will start meeting on Saturday. The Legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, will start meeting the next Monday and is expected to stay in session for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe congress typically starts with the annual work report of the premier, Li Keqiang. That is followed by the rubber-stamp approval of a long list of government initiatives \u2014 a couple of constitutional amendments are expected this year to cement the primacy of President Xi Jinping. Perhaps most important is that the congress will confirm a new slate of government ministers after the twice-a-decade Communist Party national gathering in Beijing last October.

She said she understood that, for many in her caucus, the deal was \u201ctoo good\u201d to vote against.\n\nBut the leader had also made personal commitments to the Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program called DACA, for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

Ryan into scheduling a free and open debate on immigration, as Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, did in the Senate.\n\nMr. McConnell is giving the Senate a week to debate any immigration issue that senators wish to bring up; rather than put a measure on the floor, he has taken the highly unusual step of introducing a shell bill that senators may amend and shape as they see fit.\n\nIn effect, he is allowing the Senate to build an immigration bill from scratch; no one has any idea how it will turn out.\n\nMr. Ryan has refused to follow suit, though he has pledged to take up an immigration bill at some point, so long as it is one the president supports. And now that the spending bill has been adopted, Democrats in the House may have lost whatever leverage they had to demand protections for the Dreamers.\n\n\u201cWe would like to have had a commitment from the speaker, but we\u2019re not stopping,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.\n\nThat is unlikely to mollify her critics on the left, who say she did not work hard enough to force Speaker Ryan\u2019s hand.

Her first movie role was as a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth I (Bette Davis) in \u201cThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\u201d (1939). In that and the two other film dramas she made that year, she was billed as Nanette Fabares. She changed the spelling of her surname after too many public mispronunciations.\n\nMs. Fabray had one notable film success: the Comden and Green musical \u201cThe Band Wagon\u201d (1953), directed by Vincente Minnelli.

Ms. Fabray recalled that her other childhood job was ironing lodgers\u2019 shirts.\n\nShe attended Los Angeles Junior College and studied acting with the Austrian-born director Max Reinhardt, but she had academic difficulties because of an undiagnosed hearing problem. The problem was eventually corrected by surgery, and she became a spokeswoman and advocate for the hearing-impaired.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Fabray was 21 when she appeared in her first Broadway show, \u201cLet\u2019s Face It,\u201d (1941), a musical comedy, starring Danny Kaye and Eve Arden, about three married women who hire soldiers as escorts. She left the show in 1943 to take a small replacement role in Rodgers and Hart\u2019s \u201cBy Jupiter.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter appearing in two short-lived shows, \u201cMy Dear Public\u201d and \u201cJackpot,\u201d Ms. Fabray replaced Celeste Holm in 1945 as the star of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg\u2019s \u201cBloomer Girl,\u201d a musical comedy set in the 1860s. Two years later she married one of the show\u2019s publicists, David Tebet. They divorced in 1951, and in 1957 she married Ranald MacDougall, a screenwriter.\n\nMr. MacDougall died in 1973. Besides her son, Ms. Fabray is survived by two grandchildren.\n\nAlthough she continued to work on Broadway after her Tony win, Ms. Fabray began concentrating on television. Her first credited appearance was on \u201cThe Chevrolet Tele-Theater\u201d in 1949, but she had already been involved in demonstrations of the new medium.\n\nAfter the Caesar show, Ms. Fabray attempted a sitcom of her own, but \u201cThe Nanette Fabray Show\u201d (1961), also known as \u201cWestinghouse Playhouse,\u201d lasted less than a season. She went on to four decades of television movies and guest appearances on series, including \u201cLove, American Style,\u201d \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d (as Ms. Moore\u2019s mother), \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d (as Bonnie Franklin\u2019s mother) and the 1990s sitcom \u201cCoach,\u201d on which she played the mother of her real-life niece Shelley Fabares.\n\nPhoto\n\nBack on the New York stage in 1963, she received a Tony nomination for her role as a fictional first lady in \u201cMr. President,\u201d Irving Berlin\u2019s last Broadway show. Her final Broadway appearance went less well: \u201cNo Hard Feelings,\u201d a 1973 comedy that also starred Eddie Albert, closed after opening night.\n\nMs. Fabray continued to do stage work (in 2007 she appeared in \u201cThe Damsel Dialogues\u201d in Sherman Oaks, Calif.), but said more than once that live television was her first love. As she told a reporter for The New York Times in 1955, \u201cIt involves a form of insanity that reminds me of make-believe games that you played as a child.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about her career, she declared that comic ability was unteachable but acknowledged one factor in her success. During her third Broadway show, she told the Archive of American Television in 2004, things changed because \u201cI fell in love with the audience, and I fell in love with performing.\u201d", "title": "Nanette Fabray, Star of TV and Stage Comedies, Dies at 97", "authors": ["Anita Gates"]}

The author, Leila Slimani, had quickly become a celebrity in France, reportedly pursued by president Emmanuel Macron to become the minister of culture. In advance of the book\u2019s publication in this country, she was profiled in The New Yorker.\n\nSince the arrival of \u201cGone Girl,\u2019\u2019 six years ago, we have been living through a long, peak moment of the domestic thriller, and yet \u201cThe Perfect Nanny\u2019\u2019 has failed to enjoy the reception here that it has had abroad. A.J. Finn\u2019s \u201cWoman in the Window,\u2019\u2019 a novel about a former child psychologist abandoned by her family, who spends her hours drinking wine and staring out of her Harlem brownstone at a mysterious family across the street, made its debut in the No. 1 spot on the New York Times best-seller list. \u201cThe Perfect Nanny,\u2019\u2019 despite the expectations surrounding it and strong reviews, did not achieve similar recognition.\n\nIn the quarters where it might have had created the most commotion, among mothers in Brooklyn for instance, it seems to have made little impact at all. At first I wondered whether this had to do with the book\u2019s exploitative nature, but we consume cultural products that take advantage of real and recent suffering all the time. The 2016 film, \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u2019\u2019 is clearly a work of art inspired by the Christmas Eve fire, a few years earlier, in which a Connecticut mother lost her three daughters and her parents. It was seen and analyzed endlessly.\n\nIn novels like \u201cGone Girl\u201d and its imitators \u2014 \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d among them \u2014 the heroines are drunks and nuts; they are in other words, not like you. Myriam, the mother at the center of \u201cThe Perfect Nanny,\u201d more artfully composed than many of the books in its genre, is an urbane lawyer, knocked off balance by motherhood but only to the point of a very recognizable disturbance. She is in other words, very much like you.\n\n\u201cMila\u2019s tantrums drove her mad, Adam\u2019s first burblings left her indifferent,\u201d Ms. Slimani writes of Myriam\u2019s reaction to her children. \u201cSometimes she wanted to scream in the street like a lunatic. They\u2019re eating me alive, she would think.\u201d The honesty with which Ms. Slimani writes about maternal ambivalence coupled with the fact that Myriam is relieved of the burdens of motherhood in the most horrific way give the novel a darkness that is, perhaps to many tastes, best left unexplored.

Officials said she had stolen more than $28,000 worth of belongings from the family to pay off debts, including jewelry and watches, and that the family had lent her more than $18,000.\n\nMs. Mo started the fire by lighting books in the living room, officials said. When it grew out of control, she fled the apartment, leaving the children, including two boys and a girl, along with their mother, Zhu Xiaozhen.

We have no way of knowing whether the investigations will exonerate the mayor or reveal improprieties that are unacceptable in a public servant. Unlike her political opponents, I prefer to wait for their findings before forming an opinion about whether she should resign.\n\n\u201cPlease know that I\u2019m disappointed in myself but also understand that I\u2019m a human and that I made a mistake,\u201d Ms. Barry said in her news conference. Many people here are upset with their mayor and angry about the way she has squandered their hopes for her political future. But I think most Nashvillians heard that statement with real compassion.\n\nThis mayor has been beloved because she\u2019s so human, because she works impossible hours and seems to be everywhere at once, sharing in our happiness and in our heartbreak, wearing her own happiness and her own heartbreak on her sleeve. How shocked should we be to learn that the mayor we love for her humanity is human enough to make this kind of mistake?\n\nI know I sound na\u00efve. In truth, we don\u2019t know if Megan Barry\u2019s affair was only an error of human judgment. We don\u2019t know if it was different in any substantive way from the kind of behavior that has already brought down so many other public servants. All we know for sure is that this is a particularly fraught moment in American history for a person in a position of power \u2014 male or female \u2014 to reveal an affair with a subordinate.\n\nPredictably, Twitter is aflame with outraged conservatives who believe Nashville liberals are giving Ms. Barry a pass simply because we share her politics. That\u2019s a fair point to ponder. When religious conservatives in Alabama had no trouble voting for a credibly accused pedophile during December\u2019s special Senate election, I voiced the same accusation.\n\nPeople here may be keeping an open mind until the official investigations are complete, but that\u2019s not the same thing as giving our mayor a pass.

The same cannot be said of, for example, the president of the United States.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo tsunami, the conservative coyote pack is howling that liberals would be calling for the mayor\u2019s head if she were a Republican man instead of a Democratic woman. But so far, at least, there is absolutely no evidence that Sergeant Forrest was subject to any form of coercion.

We know this because, as my colleague David Leonhardt points out, traffic deaths have fallen much more in other advanced countries, which have used evidence-based policies like lower speed limits and tightened standards for drunken driving to improve their outcomes. Think the French are crazy drivers? Well, they used to be \u2014 but now they\u2019re significantly safer in their cars than we are.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s a lot of variation in car safety among states within the U.S., just as there\u2019s a lot of variation in gun violence. America has a \u201ccar death belt\u201d in the Deep South and the Great Plains; it corresponds quite closely to the firearms death belt defined by age-adjusted gun death rates. It also corresponds pretty closely to the Trump vote \u2014 and also to the states that have refused to expand Medicaid, gratuitously denying health care to millions of their citizens.\n\nWhat I\u2019d argue is that our lethal inaction on guns, but also on cars, reflects the same spirit that\u2019s causing us to neglect infrastructure and privatize prisons, the spirit that wants to dismantle public education and turn Medicare into a voucher system rather than a guarantee of essential care. For whatever reason, there\u2019s a faction in our country that sees public action for the public good, no matter how justified, as part of a conspiracy to destroy our freedom.\n\nThis paranoia strikes both deep and wide. Does anyone remember George Will declaring that liberals like trains, not because they make sense for urban transport, but because they serve the \u201cgoal of diminishing Americans\u2019 individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism\u201d?

Gray, an anthropologist who was the lead author of the survey report. \u201cThey want to know if this person is a good fit, and this may be one way to assess whether someone is telling the truth and is the right fit in a large, anonymous society.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting finding from the Match.com survey was that roughly two-thirds of respondents over all said they would judge their date based on how he or she responded to their own pet. \u201cThat people might let a cat or a dog influence the most important close relationship in their life \u2014 that\u2019s phenomenal,\u201d said Justin Garcia, an associate professor of gender studies at the Kinsey Institute, who is also a scientific adviser to Match.com and a co-author on the paper.\n\nBut as more young adults postpone marriage and children and remain single for longer, he said, they may view their pets as one of the more stable and long-lasting aspects of their life.\n\nWhether dog owners truly are more empathetic and nurturing than those who don\u2019t own pets is harder to ascertain. In a series of studies, two Canadian researchers, Anika Cloutier and Johanna Peetz, showed that pet owners certainly believed their pets had a positive effect on their romantic relationships. They also found a correlation between pet ownership and higher relationship satisfaction.\n\nMs. Cloutier acknowledged that it\u2019s hard to know what comes first, the dog or the personality traits that make someone likely to commit to a relationship, and that the links could reflect reverse causality. \u201cIt could be that couples who are more committed and already feel very positively about their relationship are those that decide to invest in the relationship to the pet,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd beware the cynics who might misuse this information.

It was unclear whether other lawmakers would follow: Mr. Hazan is better known for headline-grabbing stunts than for influencing his fellow lawmakers.\n\nMr. Netanyahu was already embattled, after the police recommended a week ago that he be prosecuted for accepting what they said were bribes worth nearly $300,000 from wealthy businessmen seeking government favors.\n\nWith this latest round of allegations he will come under even greater strains, accused by his critics on the left of saber rattling over Iran and pressured by the right to accept its agenda of expanding settlements and annexing the West Bank in return for its support.\n\nLate Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu released a video denying the newest allegations, calling them \u201challucinatory\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d and part of a \u201ccampaign of persecution against me and my family that has been going on for years.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s enemies have begun seizing on Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s legal predicament: In Munich on Sunday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, pointedly alluded to Israel\u2019s \u201cdomestic corruption\u201d problem in accusing Mr. Netanyahu of \u201caggression\u201d to distract attention from his political troubles.\n\nBack at home, opponents from the Israeli left and center are demanding that Mr. Netanyahu resign or declare himself \u201cincapacitated\u201d: Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid party, calling in vain for a no-confidence vote, said Monday that Mr. Netanyahu should appoint a temporary prime minister from within his own party.\n\n\u201cIsrael deserves a full-time prime minister who is not engaged in anything else,\u201d Mr. Lapid said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s main challengers, Avi Gabbay of Labor, said that the prime minister had \u201cbecome a liability for the citizens of Israel.\u201d Mr. Gabbay lamented Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u201csickly obsession for \u2018what will people say\u2019 and what will be written about him in the media,\u201d adding, \u201cEvery day that he stays in office is damage to the country.\u201d\n\nYet, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition appears solidly behind him. On Tuesday morning, even as reports were first surfacing about the allegations of an attempt to bribe a judge, the prime minister\u2019s coalition allies were loudly denouncing the police commissioner as biased and unprofessional, while accusing him of leaking like a sieve about the various Netanyahu-related inquiries.\n\nAt the center of the two new allegations is a close adviser to the prime minister, Nir Hefetz, a veteran Israeli journalist and political operative who in recent years has bounced back and forth between editing jobs and tending to the public image of the prime minister and his family. In 2015 he was a top strategist for the Likud Party\u2019s successful election campaign.\n\nLate that year, according to the police and Israeli news reports, Mr. Hefetz, working as the Netanyahu family\u2019s media adviser, passed a message through an intermediary to Israel\u2019s commissioner for prosecutorial oversight, Judge Hila Gerstel: Would she drop a corruption case against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, in exchange for being named attorney general?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe case was not dropped, and Judge Gerstel did not become attorney general. Avichai Mandelblit, who did get the job, announced in September that he intended to indict Sara Netanyahu on fraud charges, accusing her of misusing some $100,000 through her management of the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem. Mr. Hefetz resigned as the Netanyahu family\u2019s spokesman in October.\n\nThe family\u2019s current spokesman, Ofer Golan, denied any attempt by Mr. Hefetz to sway the judge\u2019s actions. \u201cNir Hefetz never offered this hallucinatory proposal to the prime minister and his wife,\u201d Mr. Golan said in a statement. \u201cHe was never asked to make such a proposal, and we do not believe that Hefetz even raised such a thing.\u201d\n\nHe added sarcastically, \u201cThe Netanyahu couple will soon be accused of murdering Arlosoroff,\u201d referring to the Zionist leader Chaim Arlosoroff, who was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s aides are suspected of trading favorable treatment by the Communications Ministry, which regulates the company, for favorable coverage by the news site.

Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).\n\nPhoto\n\nA cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.\n\nNetflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d\n\nLook at just the past few months of Netflix programming. There\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d a BBC-style historical drama. \u201cWormwood,\u201d an Errol Morris docudrama. \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a 21st-century reboot of a 1970s network TV multicamera sitcom. \u201cDirty Money,\u201d a \u201cFrontline\u201d-esque documentary anthology. \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d a risqu\u00e9 romantic comedy. \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction,\u201d a David Letterman interview series. Oh, and why not \u2014 let\u2019s throw in a \u201cCloverfield\u201d sequel and a Will Smith movie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSomething for everyone \u2014 that was the ethos of broadcast TV in the old three-network era. The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.\n\nBut, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.\n\nThat business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, is breathtakingly broad and microscopically niche at the same time. It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.\n\nNetflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.\n\nWhat Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d\n\nShe might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIs all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.\n\nWhat I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.\n\nAnd I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?\n\nIn its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)\n\nA more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.\n\nIt may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.\n\nBut if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried. It\u2019s hard to be groundbreaking when your whole purpose is to take people where they\u2019ve already been.", "title": "Netflix Is Getting Huge.

MAKING THE MONSTER By Kathryn Harkup. (Sigma, $27.) Could Victor Frankenstein actually have succeeded in 1818, building a man out of spare parts? That was the year that Mary Shelley published her classic novel, and Harkup looks at the science behind the 19th-century culture of experimentation with dead bodies to which it was responding.

The high pressure keeps the larger and heavier oxygen atoms stacked in a fixed crystal alignment \u2014 a solid \u2014 while the hydrogen nuclei, or ions, flow through \u2014 a liquid.\n\nThat makes it a conductor of electricity like a metal, but the current is carried by positively charged ions instead of negatively charged electrons.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as though the water ice is partially molten,\u201d said Raymond Jeanloz, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the Nature Physics paper.\n\nIn the new experiment, scientists at Lawrence Livermore first squeezed water between two pieces of diamond with a pressure of 360,000 pounds per square inch. That is about 25,000 times greater than the air pressing against you here on the surface of Earth, and the water is squeezed into a type of ice known as ice VII, which is about 60 percent denser than usual water, and solid at room temperature.

Here, Dr. Millot and his colleagues were able to capture the optical appearance of the ice. If electrons were moving around, it would have been reflective. (That is why metals are shiny.) Instead, the sample was opaque. That pointed to the movement of ions instead, indicating a superionic ice.\n\nThe superionic ice melted into a liquid at about 8,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\u201cIt is a rather amazing experiment and the results are consistent\u201d with theoretical and computational predictions, said Roberto Car, a chemistry professor at Princeton.\n\nThe superionic ice could help explain the lopsided, off-center magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune, the solar system\u2019s seventh and eighth planets that are known as ice giants and were visited briefly by NASA\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s. Instead of Earth\u2019s magnetic field generated at the core of the planet, the fields of those icy bodies may originate, in part, within shells of superionic ice inside their mantles.\n\nDr. Jeanloz said the agreement between experiment and prediction offered promise that scientists are beginning to understand the basic physics of how molecules in general behave under changing temperatures and pressures well enough for practical use.\n\n\u201cAs one starts validating those kinds of predictions, it gives a hope that one could start thinking about engineering new materials,\u201d Dr. Jeanloz said, \u201cwhere you tell me what properties you want, and someone can use a computer now to figure out what kind of material, what kind of elements you have to put together, and how they\u2019d have to be packed together to come up with those properties.\u201d\n\nDr. Car, one of the scientists who have explored superionic ice in computer simulations, has suggested that there may be several types of superionic ice, with oxygen atoms rearranging in different crystal structures at even higher pressures. That will not be easy to test. But he\u2019s impressed that the theory has been tested at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always surprised by the ingenuity of the experimental people,\u201d in devising ways to both create the extreme conditions that produce something like superionic ice and the tricky measurements to verify the result, he said.", "title": "New Form of Water, Both Liquid and Solid, Is \u2018Really Strange\u2019", "authors": ["Kenneth Chang"]}

The fashionable new surface was making its professional tour debut (it had previously been used in the Laver Cup exhibition last year) and most players seemed to like it.\n\n\u201cI wish more tournaments would use it,\u201d said Artem Sitak of New Zealand, who lost in the doubles final with Wesley Koolhof of the Netherlands. The doubles winners were Philipp Oswald and the veteran Max Mirnyi, who was playing in his 100th ATP final. Mirnyi, a 40-year-old Belarusian, won the United States Open doubles tournament twice and spent time in New York training when he was a teenager. Being back in the region, he said, was a thrill.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed waking up and having a New York bagel,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many great memories.\u201d\n\nAt least one other player did not share\u2019s Mirnyi\u2019s enthusiasm. Adrian Mannarino of France, the No. 4 seed, lost to Querrey in a semifinal and then blasted the suburban isolation.\n\n\u201cHappy my girlfriend was here, otherwise I would have killed myself,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBeing in the middle of nowhere, not doing anything during the day, only playing tennis, is not the thing I really like.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If he doesn\u2019t want to come back, he doesn\u2019t have to. Everyone else seemed to think it was great.\u201d\n\nThe clash between Young and Harrison also marred the event. During the first set of their match Monday night, the two players, who have an acrimonious rivalry, yelled at one another \u2014 including challenges to meet outside and fight \u2014 until they were separated by the chair umpire.\n\nAfter the match, Young told an ATP official that Harrison had made a racially insensitive comment toward him during their altercation, and Young later made a similar, vague accusation on his Twitter account. Harrison denied it and an ATP investigation found no evidence to support Young\u2019s claims. A witness, one of the ball persons on the court at the time, said he had heard the entire exchange and corroborated Harrison\u2019s account.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong the biggest names to attend were Querrey, John Isner, Kei Nishikori and Anderson, who made it to the U.S. Open final last September before losing to Nadal. His win on Sunday pushed him to No. 9 in the ATP rankings and cemented his affection for the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had two good outings the last two times I\u2019ve been in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I definitely look forward to coming back next year.\u201d\n\nAnother player who enjoys playing in New York is Noah Rubin, the former Wimbledon juniors champion who grew up a 10-minute drive from the coliseum, in Merrick, N.Y. Ranked 234th in the world, Rubin was given a wild-card entry and lost to the fifth-seeded Nishikori in the first round on Tuesday. That match was fairly well attended, once people settled into their seats.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got on court and looked around I was worried,\u201d Rubin said of the crowd, \u201cbut then it filled in and it was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nNot necessarily a jungle, but a decent first-year showing.", "title": "New York Open Stays Out of the Way in Tournament\u2019s First Year", "authors": ["David Waldstein"]}
{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "The state prison system, which is directly under the governor\u2019s control, has itself come under fire in recent years for systemic abuses, specifically a pattern of assaults by guards against inmates and a scourge of racism on the part of correction officers. But Rikers, according to the Commission of Correction, remains a particular blight on New York\u2019s criminal justice system.\n\nThe report highlighted \u201csignificant incidents,\u201d including deaths, escapes, fires and group actions, noting that in almost every category, there were more incidents at Rikers Island facilities than at all the county jails, even though the average daily inmate population for Rikers was half that of all county jails in the state combined.\n\nGang and individual assaults involving inmates at Rikers were more than double the corresponding totals at the county jails, and attacks between inmates and personnel were 10 times more frequent. And many categories of serious incidents rose from 2016 to 2017, including fires (up 200 percent) and gang assaults (up 160 percent).\n\nThe report also focused on deficiencies across categories ranging from security and supervision to discipline and visitation, exposing \u201cconditions that are unsecure, unsanitary and dangerous, for staff and inmates alike.\u201d\n\nInvestigators found broken pieces of metal and glass, as well as holes and divots, in the exercise yards at the Anna M. Kross Center, a 40-acre unit at Rikers that houses male detainees. At the Robert N. Davoren Complex, another male detention unit, they found that prisoners requiring constant observation were being supervised by officers of the opposite gender, while inmates were able to \u201cpop open\u201d secured cell doors.\n\nAnd across the complex, there were instances of unmanned security posts, poor record-keeping, papered-over security cameras, rodent infestation, water leaks, sagging floors and expired fire extinguishers. Even the basic requirements for laundry services were not being met, with inmates washing their personal clothes in buckets in their cells and hanging them to dry, obscuring sight lines of correction officers.\n\nJonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the state\u2019s highest court who is chairman of the independent commission on Rikers, also spoke at the mayor\u2019s news conference, cautioning against a tit for tat between Albany and New York City over the timing of the Rikers closure.", "title": "New York State May Move to Close Rikers Ahead of City\u2019s 10-Year Timeline", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "The ATP-sanctioned men\u2019s tournament is making its New York debut after four decades in Memphis, and it is the only tour-level indoor tournament in the United States. Qualifying rounds begin Sunday, and the main draw starts Monday. John Isner, Sam Querrey, Kei Nishikori and Kevin Anderson have committed to compete on the unusual courts, which were manufactured in Germany and carefully laid in place over two days last week.\n\nNormally, hard-surface tennis courts are green or blue. Clay courts can be green or red, though the Madrid Open once tried them in blue. So far natural grass has only one known color, but two weeks of Wimbledon sometimes affect that as well. The New York Open opted for a bold color scheme its organizers say has never been used in a tour event.\n\nVideo\n\nLast September, the Laver Cup, an international team exhibition held in Prague, also used black courts manufactured by Haro, the company that built the ones for the New York Open. Ripple said he had been mulling the idea of using a black court for several years, and when he saw one at the exhibition in Prague, he made the decision to install them in New York.\n\n\u201cIt looked like they were playing on a Broadway stage,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are two perpendicular courts built atop the cement floor of the arena, the former home of the Islanders: a stadium court tucked into one end and a grandstand at the other. The courts are separated by a 26-foot viewing structure; the arena will have room for 6,000 fans.\n\nThe slightly larger stadium court is made up of 460 plywood panels that lay atop a half-inch of foam to create a 10,020-square-foot black court. The surfaces of the wood were pre-painted in Germany with about 230 gallons of gritty black paint, and the cost of each court, including shipping (in 56 crates) and installation, is about $140,000.\n\nAccording to Ripple, the surface is medium to fast, designed to help the top seeds advance into the later rounds. It is common practice for tournaments to customize the court according to its field of players. The amount of grit in the paint determines the speed: the more sand, the slower the surface.\n\nAt the New York Open, the first ATP Tour event in the state since the Hamlet Cup in Commack in 2004, a few of the high seeds \u2014 Isner, Querrey and Anderson \u2014 are big servers who do well with fast courts. But Nishikori, Ripple said, likes it a little slower, so the medium-to-fast finish was chosen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat should enable everybody to be competitive while at the same time supporting some of the players we would like to see progress through the course of the week,\u201d Ripple said.\n\nFranz Fasold, the president of Ace Surfaces, which installed the courts, said the wooden courts were used frequently in Europe and provided more cushioning for the players.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe wood itself, with the cement-like paint on top, provides a true bounce of the ball. The foam panels underneath help disperse impact.\n\nIn addition to the two courts at the arena, Fasold\u2019s crew installed two more courts at a local club for the players to use for practice.\n\nJared Donaldson, who practiced on the courts on Friday, said he was 0-4 on wooden courts in European competitions, but none were black.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I think it\u2019s good for our sport, not only to have different court surfaces, but also different court colors.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for the black courts, Fasold said, is keeping them black. A combination of dust, foot marks and enhanced lighting (the black surface absorbs light) can make them appear to lighten as the tournament goes on.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the Laver Cup, they looked more of a charcoal shade than straight black,\u201d Fasold said. \u201cBut that is mostly an optical illusion.\u201d\n\nOnce the tournament is over, the courts will be dismantled, packed back into the crates that brought them to New York and then sent out on the road again. One of them will be trucked out to San Jose, Calif., for Roger Federer\u2019s charity exhibition match against Jack Sock in March. The other will be used at Madison Square Garden for a women\u2019s one-day tiebreaker event on March 5.\n\nThen it will be dismantled again and carted back to Nassau Coliseum, for storage until next year\u2019s New York Open.", "title": "New York Tennis Tournament Tries a Distinctive Style: Not-So-Basic Black", "authors": ["David Waldstein"]}

Some blame ice melt, which can leave an oily residue when tracked in from the street. Others have suggested car exhaust or discarded fried chicken grease.\n\nWe asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nShams Tarek, a spokesman, said the slippery floors are from the combination of rain and snow tracked in from the street, other substances brought in on shoes, and high humidity in stations that traps moisture.\n\nThe buildup on the subway floor \u2014 from shoes, trash, spills and exhaust \u2014 contains substances that dissolve in water, like salt and sugars, along with oily compounds, which don\u2019t, explained Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University.\n\nYou just don\u2019t notice the oily stuff until it rains or snows because it\u2019s caked together on the subway tile with everything else.\n\n\u201cOnce you add water, whatever didn\u2019t dissolve is going to be oily,\u201d Professor Kumar said.

They wait stoically at home for a store delivery promised for some time between 10 a.m. and never. They waited nearly a century for a Second Avenue subway line \u2014 and even then got only a few stations.\n\nSo it is not surprising that New Yorkers wait calmly for their governor and mayor to move forcefully on two important transportation ideas with a potential to transform travel in the city. One is congestion pricing, the other a streetcar line that would connect Brooklyn and Queens along their shared waterfront. But patience is not infinite. The two leaders would do well to hear a tapping of feet that signals the public\u2019s desire for action.\n\nOn congestion pricing, nearly six weeks have passed since a task force handed Gov. Andrew Cuomo its recommendations to make drivers pay to enter the overcrowded core of Manhattan: $11.52 for cars, $25.34 for trucks, and per-ride surcharges of $2 to $5 for taxis and app-based services like Uber, Lyft and Via. The twofold goal is to ease strangling traffic and raise money for mass transit \u2014 as much as $1.5 billion a year by the task force\u2019s estimates.\n\nGranted, six weeks isn\u2019t an eternity. But the congestion pricing concept is years old, and making it a reality is long overdue. Mr. Cuomo is said to have begun leaning on wary lawmakers, and he has taken a few preliminary steps in his executive budget to get the ball rolling. They amount, however, to dipping toes in the water. Even while recognizing the political delicacy of these proposals, especially in a state election year, we\u2019d like to see him plunge in deeply.

Roberts, a longtime correspondent.\n\nIn 1970, Mr. von Hoffman raised a storm of protest with a column that referred to American prisoners of war in Vietnam as a political issue involving \u201cjust 1,500 men.\u201d Angry letters from prisoners\u2019 families and support groups flooded in; many were published, along with a Post editorial disagreeing with the column but defending the author\u2019s right to his opinion.\n\n\u201cMy life would have been a lot simpler had Nicholas von Hoffman not appeared in the paper,\u201d the publisher, Katharine Graham, wrote in her 1997 memoir, \u201cPersonal History.\u201d But, she added, \u201cI firmly believed that he belonged at The Post.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. von Hoffman, a thickset man, sometimes let his prematurely gray hair get a bit long. But he hardly looked the part of a radical. He wore spectacles, dressed casually in sports jackets and jeans, smoked a pipe and looked cool, smiling and relaxed, even when caught up in a dispute on national television.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he became a familiar commentator on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d paired on the \u201cPoint/Counterpoint\u201d segment with the conservative James J. Kilpatrick. Don Hewitt, the producer, fired Mr. von Hoffman in 1974 after he called Nixon, on the air, \u201ca dead mouse on the kitchen floor that everyone was afraid to touch and throw in the garbage.\u201d\n\nNicholas von Hoffman was born in New York City on Oct. 16, 1929, to Carl von Hoffman and the former Anna Bruenn. His father was an immigrant Russian cavalry officer. After graduating from Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx in 1948, Nicholas went to Chicago, intending to enroll at Loyola University. Instead, he took a research job at the University of Chicago, and in 1954 joined Mr. Alinsky as a field organizer in black and Hispanic communities on the South Side.\n\nHis marriage to Ann C. Byrne in 1950 ended in divorce in 1968. She was also a social activist in Chicago and was later a dean at the University of Rhode Island. She died in 2015.\n\nBesides Alexander, Mr. von Hoffman is survived by two other sons from his first marriage, Constantine and Aristo, and two grandchildren. A second marriage, to Patricia Bennett, also ended in divorce.\n\nMr. von Hoffman\u2019s first book, \u201cMississippi Notebook\u201d (1964), grew out of his civil rights coverage for The Sun-Times. Early on at The Post, on the education beat, he wrote a book, \u201cMultiversity\u201d (1966). In cultural affairs, he explored San Francisco\u2019s hippie drug scene and wrote another book, \u201cWe Are the People Our Parents Warned Us Against\u201d (1968).\n\nFinally given latitude as a columnist, he hit his stride. At the 1969 trial of the Chicago Eight , the leftist radicals charged with inciting to riot at the Democratic National Convention the previous summer (they became the Chicago Seven after one defendant\u2019s trial was severed), he depicted a theatrical parody of jurisprudence.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe defendants were portrayed as part of the satire: Abbie Hoffman was the \u201cstreet theater social critic,\u201d David Dellinger was \u201cthe old-line pacifist-socialist who\u2019s only recently dared to grow sideburns,\u201d and Jerry Rubin was \u201ca freelance wild man.\u201d Judge Julius J.

Anthony Lukas of The New York Times.\n\nBut even the more objective reporters found rare spectacles to write about: The Black Panther Party activist Bobby Seale, whose case was severed, called the judge \u201ca fascist dog,\u201d \u201ca honky\u201d and \u201ca pig.\u201d When he refused to be silenced, the judge ordered him bound and gagged in court. Two defendants, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman, appeared in court wearing judicial robes. They complied with an order to remove them, revealing Chicago police uniforms underneath.\n\nAfter leaving The Post, Mr. Hoffman wrote syndicated freelance columns for King Features for decades. He also wrote book reviews and magazine articles for The Times and contributed to The New Republic, Esquire, Vogue, The Nation, Harper\u2019s, The New York Review of Books and other publications.\n\nHe collaborated with the Doonesbury political cartoonist, Garry B. Trudeau, on two books, \u201cThe Fireside Watergate\u201d (1973) and \u201cTales From the Margaret Mead Taproom\u201d (1976). He also wrote two novels, \u201cTwo, Three, Many More\u201d (1969), on the campus disruptions of the 1960s, and \u201cOrganized Crimes\u201d (1984), about gangland Chicago in the Great Depression.\n\nHis most successful book was \u201cCitizen Cohn,\u201d which was on The Times\u2019 best-seller lists for eight weeks in 1988 and inspired a 1992 movie of the same title starring James Woods. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in a review for The Times, called the biography a \u201cricher, more rounded, better balanced view\u201d than Sidney Zion\u2019s contemporaneous book, \u201cThe Autobiography of Roy Cohn,\u201d based on interviews with Mr. Cohn, who died in 1986.\n\nMr. von Hoffman broadcast 250 commentaries on public affairs in the 1980s for the syndicated Cato Institute radio program \u201cByline.\u201d From 1993 to 2008, he wrote columns for the weekly newspaper The New York Observer, and from 1996 to 2007 he contributed to Architectural Digest.\n\nHe also wrote for The Huffington Post, and composed the libretto for Deborah Drattell\u2019s 2003 production of \u201cNicholas and Alexandra\u201d by the Los Angeles Opera.\n\nMr. von Hoffman also wrote \u201cHoax: Why Americans Are Suckered by White House Lies,\u201d (2004), and \u201cRadical: A Portrait of Saul Alinsky\u201d (2010), based on his recollections of his years working as a community organizer with Mr. Alinsky.\n\nAnother of his mentors, Benjamin C. Bradlee, the executive editor of The Post, offered perhaps the highest praise for his former reporter and columnist, calling Mr. von Hoffman\u2019s work \u201clandmarks in the early, timid years of the new journalism: personal, pertinent, articulate, vital glimpses of man trying to make it in a more complicated world.\u201d", "title": "Nicholas von Hoffman, Provocative Journalist and Author, Dies at 88", "authors": ["Robert D.

In the class, he was quiet and not disruptive, Mr. Gard said.\n\nBut he recalled that school administrators became concerned last year about Mr. Cruz\u2019s behavior and alerted the faculty. \u201cWe received emails about him from the administration,\u201d Mr. Gard said in an interview, adding that he did not recall the specific issues.\n\nAfter the shooting on Wednesday, Mr. Gard said that several students told him that Mr. Cruz was taken with a girl at Stoneman Douglas High School \u201cto the point of stalking her.\u201d\n\nIn the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were saying that it would be him,\u201d the student told WFOR-TV. \u201cThey would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.\u201d\n\nBrandon Minoff, a student at Stoneman Douglas High School, said in an interview with CNN that a teacher assigned him to work with Mr. Cruz on a group project two years ago. Mr. Cruz was quiet in class but opened up during their project, Mr. Minoff said, telling him that he had been kicked out of two private schools, had been held back twice and aspired to join the military.\n\n\u201cHe was always to himself and never tried to associate himself with anyone,\u201d Mr. Minoff said. \u201cAs far as I know, he didn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\n\nSchool officials declined to say why Mr. Cruz no longer attended Douglas High School. But Amanda Samaroo, whose daughter, Elizabeth, attended the school while he was a student there, said he had been expelled for bringing knives on campus. \u201cHer friends have said he was known to always be mentally ill and would kill animals,\u201d Ms. Samaroo said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Their adoptive father died some years ago, she added.\n\nMs. Pasciolla said that the boys\u2019 mother, Lynda Cruz, had regular problems with their behavior. On occasion, she said, the mother would resort to calling the police to have them come over to try to talk some sense into her sons.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think she wanted to scare them a little bit,\u201d Ms. Pasciolla said. \u201cNikolas has behavioral problems, I think, but I never thought he would be violent.\u201d\n\nWhen she saw his picture on TV on Wednesday after the shooting, Ms. Pasciolla said that she thought to herself, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s the kid who lived down the street.\u201d\n\nSheriff Israel said that the authorities did not yet know the motive for the killing, but were learning more about Mr. Cruz through his social media pages, which he described as \u201cvery, very concerning.\u201d\n\nScreen shots of an Instagram page said to belong to Mr. Cruz show many photos of a man holding firearms and ammunition used in a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. One photo shows several guns, including rifles with scopes, lying on a bed. Another appears to show a frog that had been killed.\n\nAfter Mr. Cruz left Douglas High School, he took a job at a Dollar Tree store about a mile and a half from the school. A person who answered the phone at the store on Wednesday evening said that Mr. Cruz worked as a cashier and was well liked by his colleagues.\n\n\u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d the person said.\n\nHe added that he last saw Mr. Cruz about a year ago before he transferred to another Dollar Tree store closer to his home.\n\nAnother student at Douglas High School, Ocean Parodie, told The Daily Beast that he visited the store after Mr. Cruz was expelled to check on him. \u201cHe said he was expelled and was happy that he was thrown out,\u201d Mr. Parodie said. \u201cI felt bad for him.\u201d", "title": "Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Described as a \u2018Troubled Kid\u2019", "authors": ["Matthew Haag", "Serge F.

But his childhood was certainly troubled.\n\nHe spent much of it in a subdivision called Pine Tree Estates, on a lush, narrow street dotted with tropical plants and the occasional driveway basketball hoop. Mr. Cruz and his brother, Zachary, had been adopted, and were raised largely by their mother, Lynda Cruz, especially after their father, Roger P. Cruz, died suddenly in 2004 at the age of 67. Ms. Cruz died in November, and people who knew Nikolas said he had taken the loss hard.\n\nPaul Gold, 45, said he lived next door to the Cruzes in 2009 and 2010 and stayed in touch with Lynda Cruz over the years.\n\n\u201cHe had emotional problems and I believe he was diagnosed with autism,\u201d Mr. Gold said of Nikolas Cruz. \u201cHe had trouble controlling his temper. He broke things. He would do that sometimes at our house when he lost his temper. But he was always very apologetic afterwards.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe would sometimes be hitting his head and covering his ears. One time, I sent him home because he was misbehaving at our house and he took a golf club and smashed one of my trailers.\u201d\n\nHe said that Mr. Cruz at one point had gone to a school for students with special needs. \u201cKids were really picking on him and would gang up on him and beat him up a little,\u201d Mr. Gold said. \u201cThey ostracized him.

Helen Pasciolla said Lynda Cruz had called sheriff\u2019s deputies to the house numerous times in an effort to keep Mr. Cruz in line. Craig Koblitz, 62, a yacht repairman who lives across the street, said some neighbors had suspected him of burglarizing a nearby house a few years ago.\n\nAbout six years ago, Mr. Koblitz returned to his home to find Mr. Cruz scooping the fish from the pond in his palm-shaded front yard.

In last week\u2019s column, for instance, which argued that the #MeToo movement should turn its ire against pornography, I decided not to bore my readers with research papers and simply appealed to moral intuition and recent cultural experience, which make as strong a case as any study for the viciousness of porn.\n\nBut now that the massacre in Florida has made mass murder the week\u2019s pressing subject, Andrews\u2019s essay also offers a useful way of thinking about some of the problems with the gun control debate \u2014 on both sides, but particularly among conservatives like myself, who often pick apart specific weaknesses in liberal gun control proposals, relying on studies and experiments that show the limits of prohibition, taking a clinical and somewhat bloodless approach to an issue that rouses liberal zeal.\n\nThere is value in clinical critiques, as there is in the rebuttals to my porn argument that emphasized the problems with enforcing smut restrictions. But technical issues and practical concerns are not the heart of the gun debate.

Warmbier, the college student from Cincinnati who fell into an irreversible coma after being detained in Pyongyang, and died soon after being returned to his parents.\n\n\u201cIt was important to be here today to sit with defectors who have escaped the most tyrannical regime on the planet and hear their stories, and see the tears in their eyes and also to see the aftermath of the militarism that was once again on display in Pyongyang yesterday with one more military parade,\u201d Mr. Pence said.

But that would have set up another resonant image: Mr. Moon in his box with Ms. Kim.\n\nWhile Mr. Pence chatted with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts, officials noted that the North Koreans sat by themselves, though Mr. Moon made a point of shaking hands with Ms. Kim.\n\nHandshakes \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 have long played an outsize role in diplomacy. In 1954, a year after the end of the Korean War, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles refused to shake the hand of the Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, at a conference in Geneva. For decades, Mr. Zhou nursed bitterness at the slight \u2014 a breach that was only fully healed when President Richard M. Nixon clasped his hand in Beijing in 1972.\n\nMr. Obama made an art of shaking hands with American rivals: Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya in 2009; Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba in 2013, at the funeral of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. In 2013, however, Mr. Obama failed to shake hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran at the United Nations General Assembly, in a near miss that carried echoes of Mr. Pence\u2019s nonencounter on Friday.", "title": "No Handshakes as Pence Avoids Kim Jong-un\u2019s Sister at Olympics", "authors": []}

The virus is not typically serious for otherwise healthy adults or teenagers, although it can cause several days of misery and dehydration.\n\nSevere dehydration can endanger people unable to take in fluids by themselves, such as young children, the elderly and people with underlying conditions. The most common symptoms of the gastrointestinal disease are nausea, diarrhea and stomach pain, along with fever, headaches and body aches.\n\nIt is spread by touching contaminated surfaces, caring for sick people or eating uncooked food that people with the illness have touched. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is the leading cause of outbreaks of food-borne illness in restaurants and salad bars in the United States.\n\nMost of that is from food contaminated by human hands before serving, but fruits and vegetables can be contaminated by sewage in water used to grow them, and oysters or other shellfish can pick it up from sewage.

And now North Korea seems closer than ever to becoming a real nuclear power (some say it already is).\n\nNo matter who shoulders the blame for the North\u2019s nuclear status and the tensions that have arisen as a result, the fact remains that Pyongyang is a difficult regime to deal with, one that is quick to take offense and doesn\u2019t hesitate to rain artillery fire on the South. Young South Koreans, who have little sense of connection to the North, tend to see only these current realities.\n\nEnthusiasm for unification is waning. A report last year by the Korea Institute of National Unification, a state-funded think tank, revealed a big gap in how the young and the old approach unification (and North Korea by extension): Nearly 50 percent of respondents under 30 didn\u2019t think being a single people required a single state, while only 20 percent thought unification was necessary. Among those 60 and older, the answers were the other way around, with almost 50 percent saying there should be one state for one nation.\n\nAnd a study published by the institute on Jan. 30 showed that more than 60 percent of respondents in their 20s said \u201cunification is not an immediate goal.\u201d Across all age brackets, respondents greatly prioritized the economy over unification.\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s government has appeared to be blind to this critical shift in popular sentiment, instead promoting the idea, to take a line from a presidential office Facebook post, that \u201cWe are one\u201d with the North.\n\nAs Mr. Moon pushed the one-nation rhetoric, his approval ratings took a dive, falling 10 percentage points in January, which coincided with inter-Korean dialogue on the Olympics (some say his attempt to regulate the cryptocurrency trade, a hot topic in South Korea, is another reason for his decline in favorability).\n\nHis popularity has eroded even more among voters in their 20s \u2014 usually the more progressive segment of the population \u2014 dropping 14 percentage points between the second week of January and the beginning of this month.\n\nEven as a clear majority of South Koreans seem supportive of North Korean participation in the Games, different polls indicate that people are divided about flying the Korean Unification Flag, with one survey putting the public opposition at nearly 50 percent.", "title": "Opinion | North Korea Comes to the Olympics", "authors": []}

Last month, Ms. Hyon ignited a frenzy among local media when she visited South Korea to inspect venues for the performances.\n\nPerhaps because of the buzz surrounding her visit, South Koreans appeared to be more excited about the Samjiyon Orchestra concerts than the actual Olympic events, which so far have had rather lackluster ticket sales. Last week, more than 150,000 people entered a lottery for a chance to win one of more than a thousand free tickets to Samjiyon\u2019s performances in Gangneung and Seoul.\n\nOne of those lucky winners was Keum Sun-hee, 49, who traveled to Gangneung from the eastern province of Gyeonggi with her 18-year-old daughter to see the concert. \u201cI always thought the culture between the North and South had been severed, so it was very moving to see the performance,\u201d said Ms. Keum.\n\nIt is not the first time the North has engaged in so-called music diplomacy. In 2000, when the two Koreas were moving toward reconciliation, North Korea\u2019s State Symphony Orchestra held a joint concert with the South\u2019s Korean Broadcasting System Philharmonic in Seoul.\n\nThen, in 2008, North Korea hosted the New York Philharmonic \u2014 a first for an American cultural organization. More recently, in 2012, the North\u2019s Unhasu Orchestra performed alongside the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, in Paris.\n\nBut in recent months, the North has ratcheted up its bellicose rhetoric, effectively undermining much of the good will it has built up through such cultural exchanges.

When North Korea agreed last month to participate in the Winter Olympics in the South Korean city of Pyeongchang, it also agreed to send the troupe as part of Olympic-related cultural events.\n\nThe ferry is expected to dock near Gangneung, on the east coast of South Korea, where the North Korean artists are to perform on Thursday, the eve of the Winter Olympics.

During a 2006 speech at Pusan University, the South Korean president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, recounted the story: The mayor of Pusan was worried that the 2002 Asian Games, hosted by his city, would be poorly attended. The mayor brought up the possibility of North Korean athletes\u2019 participating as an attention-grabbing ploy; Kim Dae-jung did him one better, sending a special envoy to the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-il, to ask him to send not only athletes but cheering fans as well.\n\n\u201cMake sure the cheerleaders are pretty girls,\u201d Kim Dae-jung said. Kim Jong-il complied, sending over 288 just such women. The students broke into applause when Kim Dae-jung concluded his account by saying how pleased he was with the outcome: The girls were pretty, the games were a success, and the city of Pusan made money.\n\nThe South\u2019s fascination with North Korea\u2019s cheerleaders is an extension of its attitude toward North Korean women in general: It views them as exotic, enigmatic, charming in their na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nDuring past visits, the South Korean media have showered praise on the women for their \u201cpure, innocent beauty,\u201d as if they were farm girls from the hills and not the elite from their country\u2019s capital. Plastic surgery is among South Korea\u2019s biggest industries; these Northern women are held up, by contrast, as representatives of natural Korean beauty \u2014 despite the presence of plenty of plastic surgery among the North Korean elite as well.\n\nOn Wednesday, within hours of the cheerleaders\u2019 arrival, photos of them had begun appearing on South Korean news. But there are some signs that North Korea\u2019s lipstick diplomacy isn\u2019t as effective as it once was. Thirteen years since the cheerleaders\u2019 last visit to the South in 2005, some of their exoticism has worn off. Over 30,000 defectors now live in South Korea, and they\u2019ve helped remove some of the sense of mystery.

That is their beauty. You don\u2019t stand with allies at the Games. There are no allies and enemies. Just athletes.

Its human rights violations are deplorable. In that I agree with Mr. Pence. But for the 16 days of the Games, politics should be put aside.

So when the South hosted the Summer Olympics in 1988, it was no surprise that the North tried to do it one better in 1989.\n\nWhat followed was one of the biggest boondoggles in North Korean history, one that played a part in the economic catastrophe that soon engulfed the country, according to analysts and North Korean defectors.\n\nBy some estimates, the North spent $4 billion on the World Festival of Youth and Students, a kind of socialist quasi-Olympics and cultural extravaganza. It expanded its airport in Pyongyang, the capital. It laid new streets, built one of the biggest stadiums on Earth and started work on a hotel meant to reach more than 1,000 feet into the sky.\n\nAll of this was done at a time when the North\u2019s centrally planned economy was already shrinking. The spending \u2014 directed by Kim Jong-il, then the country\u2019s leader in waiting \u2014 would leave North Korea even more dismally prepared for the coming collapse of Soviet Communism, which deprived it of economic aid and trading partners, and for a string of droughts and floods that wiped out its agriculture.

The government agreed to delay his removal until the court can decide whether his rights have been violated.\n\nHis case was one of a growing number in which federal judges have ruled to halt both individual and mass deportations. Last week, a judge in a New Jersey district court temporarily stopped the deportation of Indonesian Christians, longtime community members in Highland Park, N.J., who had been swept up by immigration agents. A day earlier, in Boston, a judge made a similar ruling in the case of 50 Indonesian Christians, and in December, a Miami judge halted the deportation of 92 Somalis. In June, a judge in Detroit halted the deportation of more than a hundred Iraqi Christians, and then expanded the ruling to cover a class of as many as 1,400 people.\n\nThese federal judges are not deciding immigration cases, over which they have no jurisdiction, but rather giving people time to fight in the immigration courts.

In her March 1996 review of \u201cUnlocking the Air and Other Stories,\u201d Francine Prose meditated on the beloved science-fiction writer\u2019s legacy and allure. Below is an excerpt.\n\nMy favorite story by Ursula K. Le Guin purports to be a journal of an all-female expedition to Antarctica, a venture mounted in 1909-10, after Scott\u2019s failure to return from the South Pole and before Amundsen\u2019s success. Along the way, the women run across the filthy, littered bachelor den where Scott\u2019s party stayed. One woman goes into labor. They name the mountain ranges, but \u201cnot very seriously,\u201d because they have agreed to tell no one that they beat \u201cMr. Amundsen\u201d to the pole: \u201cHe would be terribly embarrassed and disappointed. There is no need for him or anyone else outside the family to know. We left no footprints, even.\u201d\n\n\u201cSur,\u201d which appeared in Ms. Le Guin\u2019s 1982 collection, \u201cThe Compass Rose,\u201d typifies what she does best: construct a lightly ironic, playful and more or less fantastic fiction of ideas, with an interest in formal narrative considerations, the nature of female experience and the different methods by which men and women apprehend and respond to the world.\n\nHer work may not move or engage us in conventional ways, yet we stay with it because we trust that by the end it will have delivered a highly particular chill. So, in this new collection, a story called \u201cThe Professor\u2019s Houses\u201d \u2014 about a man who inhabits his daughter\u2019s dollhouse \u2014 ends with a haunting line that echoes back to the very beginning of this fictional investigation of the desire for order, privacy and control.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

Cook reviewed Vogt\u2019s \u201cRoad to Survival,\u201d an eloquent treatise on earth\u2019s future that Mann argues birthed modern environmentalism. Read an excerpt below.\n\nAny historian who survives to tell the tale will probably label this the age of the two chain reactions. One of these is no longer news \u2014 if the threat of sudden global extinction can ever cease to be bad news. But only a few experts realize that a biological chain reaction is tearing the soil from the five continents, draining the earth of life-giving groundwater devastating the forests on which our civilization, even our survival, depends. This is the subject of William Vogt\u2019s disturbing \u201cRoad to Survival.\u201d\n\nAs Bernard Baruch points out in his introduction, \u201cThis is no dry-as-dust study. It deals with the raw stuff of living, how more than two billion men and women, including you and me, are to be fed, sheltered, and clothed \u2014 and whether or not we will live in peace tomorrow, and next year, and in the year 1975.\u201d \u201cRoad to Survival\u201d pulls no punches. It is eloquent, sometimes grim, but always vivid. It combines literary excellence with sound scholarship. There are detailed references to the technical literature, and an excellent index. Vogt\u2019s book is essentially an eloquent plea that we start using all of our senses to understand the complex, interrelated forces whose end product he calls \u201chuman ecology.\u201d\n\nRead \u201cRoad to Survival.\u201d It will shock you, and it may infuriate you. But it is a preview of things to come as seen by a courageous, honest, competent scientist. He makes you actually feel the declining fertility of the land, the shrinking of our natural resources equated against that relentless explosive growth in human numbers.

In 1947, Margaret Mead reviewed \u201cSex in Our Changing World,\u201d by John McPartland, a blunt meditation on the history of sex in the United States.\n\nThe general thesis of the book is essentially sound, if heavily weighted on the seamy side. This book deals for the most part with wide social pathologies \u2014 the divorce rate, growing sexual inversion and prostitution rather than courtship, marriage and parenthood. Tackling these social pathologies, sometimes with a detail and frankness to which the American reader is only just accustomed, Mr. McPartland illustrates his main theme, that since World War I America has changed drastically from a sex-shy, inhibited people to a hedonistic, cynical people, openly in search of pleasure, and that our old ethics of home and family have rotted away, leaving nothing except a few sporting rules. There are vivid descriptions of the sordid divorce mills, and other institutions which exploit broken lives. But primarily this is not a source book, but a long ethical essay, with considerable gaiety, humor and a refreshing time perspective. ...\n\n\u201cThere have been carnal people before and they were the ancestors of most of us.\u201d\n\nOne of the most illuminating discussions in the book centers around the idea of \u201cadult orphans,\u201d individuals who have lost the capacity to exist as parts of that complementary human group which we call the family and who, if they marry, merely beget and rear other adult orphans. On a different level of social analysis and seriousness is the amusing chapter headed \u201cLove of Women,\u201d which discusses the way some mysterious occult agreement among women changes the styles in men (when the men aren\u2019t looking), so that the poor male who has just got himself finally organized to be a \u201cRaftish character given to black hats, dark looks and contempt for women\u201d finds that the style has shifted and women are giving \u201cthe unpurchasable look to good-natured athletes, broad-shouldered and broad-minded.\u201d\n\nThe book ends by suggesting three alternatives for the future: an America which becomes increasingly degenerate, an America which becomes increasingly over-controlled with science assisting the state in keeping sex in its place, and a more endearing picture of an America which will \u201cprofit by our new careless freedom, use our new understandings of the working of body and mind and will achieve a sexual code that will be free without being careless.\u201d", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

In a 2004 essay, Banville reflected on his youthful encounters with Dublin and James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d Read an excerpt below.\n\nVery many years ago, when I was growing up in the town of Wexford, on the southeast coast of Ireland, I dearly wished to get hold of a copy of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d I had read \u201cDubliners\u201d and \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\u201d and had even written, on a big black Remington borrowed from my Aunt Sadie, a number of lugubrious short stories in what I thought was the Joycean manner, mainly devoted to the subject of death and all centered on a neurasthenic young hero whom no one truly understood, whose soul was much given to swooning and who went under different names but was always me.\n\nJoyce liked to boast that \u201cUlysses\u201d was so detailed a portrait of Dublin that if the city were to be destroyed \u2014 an eventuality that in his darker moments of Hibernophobia he would probably have welcomed \u2014 it could be rebuilt brick by brick, using his book as a model. In his essay \u201cThe Precession of Simulacra,\u201d the French savant Jean Baudrillard recalls the story by Jorge Luis Borges in which the Empire\u2019s cartographers spend years drawing up a map so detailed that when it is done it covers exactly the territory of the Empire, and imperial decline is plotted by the fraying of the map until only a few shreds remain. If we were to revive the fable today in our media-dominated world, Baudrillard suggests, the map would have engendered the Empire, and \u201cit would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map.\u201d\n\nDublin, even well into the 1960\u2019s, when I came to live there, was in many respects still the city that Joyce had known and that he celebrated with maniacal exactitude in \u201cUlysses.\u201d All now is changed.

So wonderful to hear what she did in the role, and what Mr. B. asked her to do. We will cherish these last two days forever!!!!\u201d One of the hashtags is #baiserdelafee.\n\nThese happy words require a few layers of explanation for nonspecialists. They also open up one of the biggest issues around City Ballet today. \u201cLe Baiser de la F\u00e9e\u201d (\u201cThe Fairy\u2019s Kiss\u201d) is a four-scene ballet composed by Igor Stravinsky in 1928. And \u201cMr. B\u201d is the choreographer George Balanchine, who first staged \u201cBaiser\u201d in 1937. In 1972, he choreographed the score\u2019s dance suite, \u201cDivertimento From \u2018Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e,\u2019\u201d for New York City Ballet; and in 1974 he added the finale from the complete \u201cBaiser.\u201d This version had no scenery, no fairy and no kiss; it has remained in repertory ever since.\n\nBalanchine made its lead roles for Ms. McBride and Helgi Tomasson, who danced them into the 1980s. Ms. Fairchild and Mr. De Luz, longtime City Ballet principals, have been dancing \u201cDivertimento From \u2018Le Baiser de la F\u00e9e\u2019\u201d for a number of years. And here\u2019s the crucial issue: Why have even senior City Ballet dancers been deprived for so long of interpretive wisdom about this (and many other) Balanchine ballets? When Peter Martins was ballet master in chief (1983-2018), Ms. McBride was among the many creators of Balanchine roles who \u2014 as if in exile \u2014 were seldom if ever invited to coach their roles at City Ballet.\n\nMr. Martins retired under pressure on Jan. 1 after allegations of physical and sexual harassment. Over the decades, no single feature of his artistic policy has caused more grievance than this disinclination to bring in Balanchine alumni.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDancers can learn their roles from various sources: videos, teachers, fellow interpreters of the same repertory. Many testify, though, that real illumination comes from those who studied roles with the choreographer, in particular with those who were part of his or her creative process. With the understanding that these teachers can pass on, steps can be transfigured by motivation, atmosphere, nuance.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Martins\u2019s departure and the recent deaths of the ballerinas Violette Verdy and Karin von Aroldingen, who both, like Mr. Martins, created roles at City Ballet for Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, remind us that direct links to Balanchine\u2019s and Robbins\u2019s foremost dancers are growing fewer. In recent years, there have been multiple occasions when the Balanchine or Robbins flames have burned more brightly and truly with other companies \u2014 Pacific Northwest Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Ballet Arizona, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet \u2014 because the artistic direction kept the style truer, often with coaching from those who helped to bring the ballets into being.", "title": "Nuggets of Ballet Wisdom From Bodies Trained by Balanchine", "authors": ["Alastair Macaulay"]}

And the paintings I create aspire to express these attributes.\u201d\n\nAmong the prominent figures who turned out for the ceremony were Steven Spielberg, the filmmaker, and his wife, the actress Kate Capshaw, who helped fund the commission of the portraits. Also in attendance were several former members of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, including Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general; David Axelrod, the former senior strategist; Jay Carney, the former press secretary; and Sam Kass, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior policy adviser for nutrition (who sat with his baby in his arms). \u201cWe miss you guys,\u201d Mr. Obama told them, in his remarks.\n\nMr. Wiley\u2019s work often features African-Americans in the regal poses of emperors and kings, his own distinctive riff on historic portraiture. The Obama portrait, too, has its own majesty. But the former president is also depicted in a chair, with his hands crossed and elbows on his knees \u2014 a posture of informality and intimacy.\n\nThe two men paged through Mr. Wiley\u2019s collection of art history books and thought about \u201cthe grand tradition of presidential portraits,\u201d Mr. Wiley said, in an interview after the unveiling. \u201cThen we decided very quickly that we were just going to strike out a path of our own and try to create a type of singular narrative surrounding what this picture looks like \u2014 discarding history but also embracing it at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narrative had to do with accessibility, the narrative had to do with a language of openness,\u201d Mr. Wiley added. \u201cThere were no ties, it\u2019s an open collar, it\u2019s a much more relaxed body language \u2014 the sense of repose yet at the same time a kind of radical vigilance in the eyes.\u201d\n\nMs. Sherald\u2019s portrait of Mrs. Obama similarly conveys a certain casualness. But, dressed in a flowing white patterned gown, the former first lady also projects what Ms. Sherald called \u201ca quiet, strong presence,\u201d one in keeping with Ms. Sherald\u2019s own restrained style.", "title": "Obama Portrait Artists Merged the Everyday and the Extraordinary", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLansdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "title": "Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics, and Fact and Fiction", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

Some may even see it as a turning point in American history. And, this portrait captures this wonderfully. But, it does more than that by showing Obama as being troubled by something. Given a president\u2019s job, there could be many things that would be troubling him. And this allows me to empathize with him in a way that it\u2019s difficult to do with most other portraits.

But I think that context is important to consider. Here is the first black president, an excellent human being and dignified leader and he\u2019s sitting in the bushes. I definitely want something that shows his poise, integrity and valor. I think something more stately would be more ennobling. JOSE MORENO\n\nFor whatever reason, I was taken aback when I first saw President Obama\u2019s portrait with the floral background. The more I look at it, the more I love it. However, I have to agree with those who say that Michelle\u2019s doesn\u2019t closely resemble her, but does it have to do so. The overall sense of the picture is of peace, elegance and intellect. JENNIE VINSON HLAVACEK\n\nArt definition: the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.

JUDITH SALYER\n\nIt\u2019s \u2018all about the dress.\u2019\n\nThe portrait of Michelle appears to be all about the dress. Mrs. Obama, with her caring, strength and true inner beauty, is not there.

The initial discussion of Pennsylvania\u2019s new congressional map \u2014 including my analysis \u2014 emphasized \u201cpartisan balance\u201d: the idea that the map would make the partisan split of House seats similar to the split in the popular vote. A party that wins about half the vote will win about half the seats.\n\nEmily Bazelon of The Times argues that this is the wrong point to emphasize. The bigger priorities in the new plan seem to be creating competitive congressional races and keeping existing geographical boundaries (like county lines) intact. That\u2019s no coincidence. Most states require congressional maps to respect geographic boundaries, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has specifically said the state\u2019s new map should respect boundaries for the sake of promoting competitiveness.\n\nPartisan balance is a bit different. It\u2019s a perfectly admirable goal. In fact, it should probably be the No. 1 goal in drawing congressional districts. But it\u2019s not a court-approved reason to throw out a current map. Which would explain why Pennsylvania\u2019s new maps focus on keeping counties intact and creating a bunch of close races.\n\nFor more, read Bazelon\u2019s tweets or a piece by Rick Hasen, a law professor who specializes in election law.

Both medics said that the sergeant had never spoken to Ms. Danner, and that the police had moved to subdue her while Ms. Mullings was still talking to her. Both remembered one of the officers saying \u201cReady!\u201d before they moved as a group toward Ms. Danner\u2019s bedroom.\n\nBut four of the officers who were present testified that the E.M.T.s had never entered the apartment.\n\nOfficer Rosario, who had initially taken the lead in talking to Ms. Danner, testified that Ms. Mullings did come into the apartment and tried for a time to cajole Ms. Danner into laying down the scissors.

Officer Rosario said he had explained to Sergeant Barry that Ms. Danner had the scissors and was refusing to go to the hospital.

Research has shown some may fall as much as 1,000 calories short of their body\u2019s daily needs. As a result, it is important that they keep up the same eating routine on their days off to make up the deficit.\n\nThe problem, said Ronsen, is that many athletes feel full before they have entirely replaced the energy loss of training. \u201cWhen you train you take a lot of energy from the muscles,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you are replacing that, you\u2019re using your stomach and gut to process the food before it\u2019s brought back via circulation to your muscles.

Recent precedent for states leading the way in health care include the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and even the structure of the Affordable Care Act, both of which were rolled out in states before becoming federal law.\n\nHistorically, the federalist philosophy of states taking the policy lead has resonated with political conservatives. And some current drug pricing reforms have a distinctly free-market flavor. More than a decade ago, Massachusetts adopted the health care program that would later influence President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act while the state was governed by a Republican, Mitt Romney. Now Massachusetts, governed by another Republican, Charlie Baker, is asking the federal government to allow its state Medicaid program to increase price competition among drugmakers by excluding some high-priced medicines from coverage if an identical cheaper version is available. Last week, Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, John Kasich, urged President Trump to give similar authority \u2014 and the negotiating clout that comes with it \u2014 to all states.\n\nIn Utah, a Republican state representative from Provo, Norman Thurston, is sponsoring legislation to allow the state government to engage in wholesale re-importation of medicines from countries like Canada. \u201cYou have manufacturers who are willing to sell the same drugs we use for far lower prices in other places,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are their biggest customer, so where is our volume discount? This is a violation of basic free-market principles.\u201d\n\nThurston\u2019s bill passed the Utah House on Feb. 18, and similar proposals are pending in other states. A federal bill that would allow patients to personally import medicines has attracted the support of conservatives like Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.\n\nProposals like these reveal an ideological fault line in the longstanding cozy relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans. Prescription drug makers are not paragons of the free market. Their business model relies on government-imposed monopolies of patents \u2014 even when the drugs\u2019 discovery was made possible by federal funding \u2014 followed by restrictions imposed by the government on itself on negotiating down the cost of the medicines it purchases. The Medicare program, for example, is barred by federal law from using its bulk purchasing power to get discounts.\n\nLast year, President Trump\u2019s accusation that drug companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d earned headlines. But his follow-up comments at that news conference may be more important. They advanced a free-market remedy that resonates with many of his fellow Republicans. \u201cWe\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don\u2019t bid properly,\u201d Trump said then.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Our most popular writing prompt this week was \u201cAre Emotional-Support Animals a Scam?\u201d\n\njulius berti from Wilmington, N.C., thinks some people are just selfishly working the system:\n\nI truly believe emotional support animals are a scam. From the evidence shown in this article it seems like people are just abusing the system currently in place. Its unfair to people on flights who are allergic of dogs unless you have a PHYSICAL disability such as being blind or having diabetes. These peoples lives actually depend on their animals. People need to stop being so selfish and pay the fee to bring their dog on a plane. Airlines should also decrease the price of flying the dogs to avoid people scamming them.\n\nBut Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts knows from experience that social and emotional disabilities are valid:\n\nI taught hippotherapy classes for around two years (maybe more, maybe less. Anyone who knows me knows I have a terrible perception of time. But, I digress). Hippotherapy is a form of therapy where a child or adult with a social, emotional, or physical disability learns to ride horses. I learned one lesson time and time again over those two years - animals have power. Emotional-support animals are not a scam. Tell that to the countless clients I have worked with. Tell that to the client who threw their arms around their horse, but got anxious when they were around people. Tell that to the mostly nonverbal kid who told their horse, \u201cwooahhh!\u201d. I hold these stories close to my heart because they make me realize that yes, humans can do a lot for humans, but there is something about an animal that speaks to someone in a way that another person cannot. Unfortunately, there are scammers out there. There will always be people with selfish ambition, who see a system set up for someone who is not them, and who take whatever they can get. But, you never know. There are disabilities that you cannot see - remember, I did say \u201csocial and emotional\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing, friends. You and I do not have the right to sleuth around and see if someone has a disability. It is not our job to validate someone\u2019s disability. Someone with anxiety does not need a sticker for their emotional support dog that says \u201cMy anxiety has been confirmed! Don\u2019t worry, I can have an emotional support dog!\u201d\n\nBetzabeth4D from YC CLIP saw both sides:\n\nI agree with Mr. Leonhard\u2019s argument, because people is taking advantage cheating the system. If the people wants to bring their pets with them, everybody should pay the fee as the law said, because is very selfish of them that people who has disabilities which really needs a Service Animal will have to pay the consequences of the other people actions making more complicated their lives. Personally, I do not have so much knowledge about Services animal\u2019s, bud I do believe that animals could be helpful for people, I have seen people with disabilities who used horses for therapy\u2019s, they said that is very good for them and they make them feel better. I also think for someone blind as well having a training dog can be very helpful. Therefore, I do not think emotional support animals are Scam at all; the scam is made by the people who use them to break the rules in their own benefits.\n\nBrooke from Wilmington, N.C., makes a distinction others made, too: \u201cEmotional-support animals are not a scam, it\u2019s the people who use this label for their selfish ulterior motives that are the scammers.\u201d\n\nThere are many studies, as Mr. Leonhardt said, that show how many people with mental and physical disabilities do in fact function better with a trained animal accompanying them. These people aren\u2019t the problem and should not be punished by airlines and other public establishments for following the law. It is their constitutional right, as stated in a 1986 law, to not be discriminated for being handicapped air travelers. It\u2019s the people that game the system by buying their dog or pig or monkey or cat a $30 EMOTIONAL SUPPORT animal vest so they can avoid the $100 fee for boarding an animal. These people think that they are \u201cgaming the system\u201d when in reality they are making it harder for the people who ACTUALLY need an emotional support animal to travel with their service animal. It is sad that we as a society that are to driven by our own selfish motives that we can\u2019t see how our actions are affecting others negatively. Airlines need to have stricter rules and regulations for people travelling with emotional support animals by asking for official licenses to prove these emotional support animals authenticity.\n\nTanya Bolick from North Carolina believes we can\u2019t operate on the basis of trust alone:\n\nWhile trusting people to tell the truth about whether or not the pet is an emotional-support animal or not is a good thought I don\u2019t think that it is possible in this day and age. As said in the article, it is easy to get a red vest for animal and call them an emotional-support animal, this makes it almost impossible to know who is telling the truth and who is not. Sadly I think it is necessary for people to provide papers that prove their animal is certified. I think that some time in the future these problems will be resolved and thing can go back to a trust basis. But until people take responsibility for their actions and stop lying the rules will have to increase.\n\nAnd Brandon Brodwater from Wilmington, N.C., made a good point about animals on college campuses:\n\nMr. Leonhardt certainly makes a good argument against emotional-support animals as a whole, especially when considering the tight confinement of a commercial flight. However isn\u2019t the environment of a college campus different? The way I see it, the majority of the issues with animals flying arise from the small space allowed to passengers, as shown by the mauling case from the San Diego flight. The man was not able to escape or defend himself due to the lack of space in the plane. Yet an attack like this is certainly unlikely on any college campus or classroom, given larger amount of room for escape or self-protection. ...Aside from their location, I believe that to be qualified as a therapy pet, the animal at hand must have proper training and pass certain tests and requirements. If only well trained animals are eligible to be therapy pets, issues associated with them will lessen significantly.\n\n_________", "title": "On Emotional-Support Animals, Cheating in School, Movies and Climate Change: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

I\u2019ve naturally always gotten good grades and at first I never really thought about it, but over time I started to become obsessive with the amount of studying I put in and the outcome of my work. I definitely put pressure on myself and set extremely high standards. Since last year I\u2019ve known that I wanted to be a neurologist. I began to research the career even more and set the goal of getting amazing grades for the rest of high school so I can get into a credited college and later on medical school, to prepare myself for the rest of my career and life. So, me being my overachieving self, I\u2019ve put in a lot of work into my schoolwork and make sure it\u2019s perfect and worthy of a good grade. I often work myself too hard to the point where I have a mental breakdown. Recently my english teacher gave us an assignment of choosing one word we\u2019d like to represent the person we want to become this year. I want to become less of a perfectionist (but still reaching most of my goals) and become less stressed and confident in my abilities, so I chose the word faith. Since I started the assignment, I\u2019ve noticed a tremendous change and already see my extreme perfectionist tendencies vanishing. I learned the hard way that being a perfectionist can be beneficial and build you up, like getting good grades, but can also tear you down and consume you in a sea of stress.\n\nReagan O\u2019Shea from Boston, Ma., similarly described the mental and emotional toll of perfectionism:\n\nGrowing up in a world in which the pressure to succeed and stand out is at its peak, it is difficult to not fall victim to being a \u201cperfectionist\u201d. Though being a perfectionist can be a positive attribute, I for one feel as though it is an exhausting attribute that most often leads to disappointment. No matter how well a \u201cperfectionist\u201d does, their performance never seems to be good enough. As a perfectionist, I hold very high standards and goals for myself, and when I fail to meet those standards, the disappointment that I feel is incredibly overwhelming. \u2026 What people fail to understand is that such achievements do not come without a substantial cost: the overwhelming burden that one feels through many stages of life is sometimes unfathomable.\n\nCatherine Smer from Wilmington, N.C., however, has let go of the idea of being perfect:\n\nNo, I am not a perfectionist at all. I don\u2019t believe that any one thing can be truly perfect. However I do believe in trying my best. I know that whatever I do at my age can\u2019t be perfect but as long as I have given it the best that I have got then I don\u2019t stress over it. I value the opinions of my family, teachers, and classmates, they all influence how good or bad my work is, but the only opinion that matters the most when counts is my own. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I try hard in school and sports and I want a good future for myself, but setting standards for everything as high as \u201cperfect\u201d can cause stress and anxiety that I don\u2019t need.\n\nMonalene Delo from Wilmington, N.C., thinks social media adds to the many young people\u2019s anxiety:\n\nOften on social media we find our selves scrolling through our feed wishing we had the life that our friend had, or that we had this amount of likes or \u201cWow, her life must be perfect!\u201d Social media has provided a mask to our actual lives that we are living \u2026 Sometimes we just need to remind ourselves that people aren\u2019t living the perfect life that we think they are and that we\u2019re doing the best we can.\n\nAnd, like many other students, Emily Lane Player from Hoggard High School, felt pressure from her family to be successful:\n\nI would not label myself as a perfectionist, I always try to do my best and go with the flow. However, I do strive to work hard and get good grades, but I know if I get one B it won\u2019t be the end of the world. I try to find a balance between schoolwork and just being a teenager. My dad is a lot like me in this way, we\u2019re both very type B. However, my sister is the total opposite. She is the definition of a perfectionist. She doesn\u2019t just strive for A\u2019s, she strives for A+\u2019s, in classes 2-3 grades above her grade level, and if she doesn\u2019t meet her goal she constantly beats herself up about it. On top of this, she dances for 4-5 hours a day. She has a really hard time letting go of things if they aren\u2019t absolutely perfect. She is a constant stress-ball, like my mom. My mom is a perfectionist as well, as she projects this onto me with her high expectations. Often, I feel they\u2019re way too high, and I just can\u2019t do enough to please her. Whenever I do accomplish something I\u2019m proud of, like getting an A on a really hard test, I rarely rewarded because that\u2019s just what\u2019s expected of me. She often treats me how she would treat herself, and I\u2019m not a perfectionist so her standards seem impossible.\n\nSeeing the advantages and disadvantages of perfectionism, Juliet Hoven from Nazareth, Pa., suggested some strategies for managing it:\n\nBecause of my perfectionism, I do not take many breaks. I always seem to be running somewhere or spending an obsessive amount of time improving something that does not necessarily need to be perfect. As a student, I study for long periods of time and do a lot of homework. In fact, I do not socialize as much because my standards push me to exceed. To manage the muddle my high standards create, I have tried to create a schedule to manage my time and make myself available for what I enjoy doing, and for my grades and community. I also make different study methods for my own benefit. When I get stressed or overwhelmed, I try to relax and take a break such as listening to music or watch a quick TV show. Overall, high standards can be both beneficial and detrimental.\n\n_________", "title": "On Happiness, Social Media, Collecting Things and Olympic Sports: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.\n\nBut Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don\u2019t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company\u2019s mistakes have been.

He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook\u2019s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia\u2019s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was not a primary goal of Russia\u2019s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia\u2019s interference from outside researchers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of Mr. Goldman\u2019s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia\u2019s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?\n\nMore than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far \u2014 such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers \u2014 would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 \u2014 including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators \u2014 would be just as effective today.\n\nIn a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook\u2019s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they\u2019d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company\u2019s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook\u2019s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.\n\nWe may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn\u2019t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.) But it\u2019s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform\u2019s problems and protecting our democracy.", "title": "On Russia, Facebook Sends a Message It Wishes It Hadn\u2019t", "authors": ["Kevin Roose", "The Shift"]}

In December, Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American memoirist who lives in Germany, repeatedly reported to Twitter at least four accounts impersonating hers. \u201cThey have my photos, they tweet things from my books,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of them seems to be selling things.\u201d\n\nYet each time Ms. Dumas reported them, emails show, Twitter\u2019s support team told her the accounts did not meet its definition of abusive impersonation.\n\nA Times investigation last month found that many real accounts are copied and turned into automated \u201cbots\u201d sold by companies like Devumi, a firm now based in Colorado that is under investigation by attorneys general in Florida and New York.

Since the Times investigation was published, dozens of Devumi\u2019s most prominent clients \u2014 actors, reality TV stars, authors, business executives and others seeking to buy followers and retweets \u2014 have lost more than three million followers. Close to 55,000 impostor accounts sold by Devumi have been restricted or suspended.\n\nTwitter has declined to say whether Devumi\u2019s bots violate its impersonation policy, or how many of its employees are focused on rooting out impersonation. The company\u2019s first line of defense against impersonation is the countermeasures that flag accounts that run afoul of Twitter policies on spam \u2014 violations that can be easier for the platform to identify and stop at large scale.\n\nBut impostor accounts are still relatively easy to find on Twitter. The Times identified hundreds more of them through Twitter\u2019s own automated \u201cwho to follow\u201d feature: When a user views a known impostor account, Twitter routinely recommends other impostor accounts to follow.\n\nOne real Twitter account, belonging to Jasmine Artis, a health care worker from North Carolina, was cloned dozens of times. At least 75 of those impostor accounts still exist \u2014 though some have recently been restricted \u2014 each using her picture, her name and a brief bio that refers to the school she was attending when her account was copied.

Ms. Artis said she had not been aware of the accounts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven Twitter\u2019s \u201cverified\u201d users, many of them well known, are being impersonated. There are active fake accounts impersonating the Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and the journalist April D. Ryan. None appeared to be obvious parodies. Instead, each posted content that mimicked what the real account might tweet.\n\nBoth Facebook and Twitter rely in part on their users to report impostors and abuse. But the companies\u2019 enforcement decisions can seem arbitrary. In January, Antonia Caliboso, a social worker in Seattle, discovered an impostor Facebook account using her name, biographical information and a photo, all lifted from a 2013 news release about a fellowship she had won.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Caliboso and dozens of her friends reported the fake account to Facebook over a period of weeks. But Facebook representatives repeatedly told her the account did not violate the company\u2019s impersonation policies, she said. Eventually, to protect herself, Ms. Caliboso deleted her real account.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t risk that a client or employer \u2014 past, present or future \u2014 might find that profile,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, Facebook reversed its position: The account was shut down, according to an email Ms. Caliboso received on Feb. 10, \u201cbecause it goes against our community standard on identity and privacy.\u201d\n\nSocial media companies succeed in the marketplace by amassing as many active users as possible, so most make it relatively easy to create new accounts. Neither Facebook nor Twitter requires proof of identity to open a new account, but both require it when reporting impostors. Decisions about whether to take down or suspend an account are automated wherever possible, or farmed out to teams of low-level employees and contractors around the world.\n\nAs a result, on most social media platforms it is far easier to build a bot than to kill one.\n\n\u201cThe reason that they\u2019re so bad at this is that it conflicts with their business model,\u201d said Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and technology expert at the University of North Carolina. \u201cThey try to come up with one set of rules that applies to two billion people, and then simplify it so that a contractor in a warehouse in the Philippines can go click-click-click and apply the policy.\u201d\n\nMs. Mason, the data scientist, eventually took matters into her own hands. After she filed dozens of impersonation reports to Twitter in 2015, the company suspended many of the impostors, but left dozens untouched.\n\nSo she created more than 100 bots of her own, using as many variations of her name as she could think of. Each linked back to her real account, with the message \u201cthe real hmason is over there.\u201d Eventually, Ms. Mason\u2019s homegrown bots, and Twitter\u2019s own efforts, seemed to overwhelm the impostors, she said, and the surge in fake accounts stopped.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWith Twitter, it was easy\u201d to make bots, Ms. Mason said. \u201cI was shocked by how easy it was.\u201d", "title": "On Social Media, Lax Enforcement Lets Impostor Accounts Thrive", "authors": ["Nicholas Confessore", "Gabriel J.X.

Left-wing publications such as Glenn Greenwald\u2019s \u201cThe Intercept\u201d have gone out of their way to make excuses for the regime and treat its critics as Washington stooges. Jeremy Corbyn, who could yet be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, memorialized the late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013 for his \u201cmassive contributions to Venezuela & a very wide world.\u201d\n\nEven today, the criticism is amazingly muted. If Klein has seriously come to terms with Maduro\u2019s tyranny or Venezuela\u2019s catastrophe, she has not done it in The Nation, The Guardian, or anywhere indexed by LexisNexis or Factiva. Corbyn\u2019s response to Maduro\u2019s repression has been to voice his condemnation of \u201cthe violence that\u2019s been done by any side, by all sides\u201d \u2014 a piece of obfuscatory equivalence worthy of Donald Trump\u2019s Charlottesville remark. Penn and Glover seem to have moved on to other causes, like bashing Trump. Such courage.\n\nThat leaves the cause of Venezuela\u2019s deliverance from evil in the hands of \u2026 Mike Pence. The vice president may not be the ideal spokesman for the rights of a Latin American country, at least in the eyes of the typical undergraduate political activist. And some of the Trump administration\u2019s policy prescriptions, such as broad sanctions on the Venezuelan economy, may do more to tighten Maduro\u2019s grip than to crush it. (More effective are U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan government officials, which target the guilty and spare the innocent.)\n\nStill, it says something about the moral dereliction of too many liberals that Pence has been a clarion voice of attention and outrage at the unfolding catastrophe, while they mostly remain silent. When you\u2019ve ceded the moral high ground to the Trump administration, you\u2019ve ceded a piece of your soul.\n\nIt would be nice to suppose that Venezuela\u2019s agonies will soon be at an end, on the theory that it can\u2019t go on like this much longer.

It feels like the beginning of something bad. Although I immediately admit that when the Democrats were working on expanding the safety net, I pooh-poohed the whole deficit issue.

Just think of Donald Trump\u2019s business career.\n\nThat\u2019s probably a bit glib, but I really do think the deficit is not much of a problem so long as investors, foreign and domestic, continue to have faith in the economy. Among the ingredients in that faith are the prospects for economic growth, the ease of doing business, the predictability of legal and regulatory frameworks, the attractiveness of the culture, society and environment, and so on.

{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "Our most-commented-on post this week was, unsurprisingly, \u201cWhat Is Your Reaction to the Deadly Shooting at a Florida High School?\u201d Students unanimously expressed sadness, disgust or horror. There was a wide range of views from students as to the root of the problem of mass shootings in schools, but most commenters mentioned stricter gun laws as a partial solution.\n\nBEATTY from SHS Swamp\u2019s comment garnered a \u201cReader\u2019s Pick\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s obviously not right what he did and what all the other school shooters did. The government needs to actually do something instead of showing their \u201cgrievance\u201d about the topic. After the Columbine Shooting every town had to have a security guard or a resources officer but as we can all see that has done absolutely nothing. The Florida high school had multiple guards at the school yet he still got in the school, pulled the fire alarm, shot multiple students/ teachers, AND pretended to be one of the students that were trying to escape. The fact that he was able to buy an AR-15 LEGALLY is not good at all. It shows how easy it is to get an AUTOMATIC weapon even with the mental troubles that he as a child and into his teenage years. The US needs to do something about this \u201cepidemic\u201d and they need to do something about it quickly.\n\nAnna Marston from Swampscott High School in Swampscott, Mass., said she was going to march in protest:\n\nWhen I received the notification from my iPhone\u2019s \u201cNews\u201d app that this shooting took place, my heart sank as I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine the fear rushing through the minds of the parents, teachers, and students whose lives were in jeopardy. While my school has not faced any gun violence, I do recall a time in middle school where a student brought a bullet in their backpack to school \u2014 I was petrified. In seventh grade after the Newtown incident, I was too scared to go to school for a few days. Guns \u2014 ARs in particular \u2014 absolutely terrify me and it blows my mind how it takes this many gun-related deaths to heed attention of the country. My school has practiced lockdowns and mentioned the training of ALICE drills but we have not been trained, and this scares me because I would freeze up and not know what to do in the case of an active shooter. I do not believe there are enough school security precautions nor counseling resources in my high school. Honestly, I don\u2019t feel safe in school anymore. My town is incredibly safe and the \u201codds\u201d might be low of a school shooting, but this does not mean that we\u2019ll be free of any gun violence as this has been the 18th massive school shooting in 2018 alone. I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a problem with my school but more a larger political/cultural/governmental problem in the United States, because schools did not face these same acts of violence in earlier years. I am hoping to attend the March For Life on March 24th in Boston Common to protest.\n\nJianwei Li from Philadelphia said no place was safe until stricter gun laws are in effect:\n\nThe problem with the school shooting isn\u2019t necessarily that the school isn\u2019t safe or that it has bad security. This is happening again and again and nothing is changing. How do we expect to prevent this if we\u2019re the ones letting it happen? Anyone can be a victim and any school could be the next potential site for another shooting. What we need right now is change. The government needs to make stricter gun laws to prevent dangerous people getting their hands on a gun. If you look at statistics from other countries where they have stricter laws, there are less incidents happening. If a 19 year old with a mental illness can get a semiautomatic rife, how safe really is our country?\n\nSLM from Philadelphia had some concrete suggestions:\n\nThe gun control laws in this country are horrific. No one else has this many mass shootings or as many guns. Australia hasn\u2019t had a mass shooting since 1996. Why is a nineteen-year-old allowed to have a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle? That just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. How many casualties need to happen until someone actually does something about it? No civilian needs a weapon like that. People always say that gun control laws shouldn\u2019t be written because of the second amendment. But you know what, when the second amendment was written, we didn\u2019t have these semi-automatic weapons. If you have psychosis or are prone to manic depression, you shouldn\u2019t have a gun! What if you become sad or angry, and to feel better, you pull out your guns, and start shooting innocent people? That\u2019s not okay! Going to school should not be a thing that makes you nervous or terrified that you are going to be shot.\n\nDexter M from Durham N.C., said there were several issues at once:\n\nThis is an issue that is deeply rooted in American culture that does not seem to have a single solution. While the FBI has prevented many people inspired by these terrible events. There is always a black market for nearly anything. So banning certain guns will not stop a highly motivated individual, however, I am not opposed to banning certain guns such as the AR-15 or Tech-9 (or any sort of semi-automatic gun capable of firing multiple shots in a couple of seconds). Banning these guns would cease the production of them, and therefore reduce their availability. Another form of gun control that could be implemented is required fingerprint activation. Therefore only the legal owner (or whoever else they put on it) can fire a shot. This would most likely help reduce the mass shooting rates, as most of the firearms used are stolen from parents\u2019 closets or friends\u2019 houses. In this case, the 19-year-old legally purchased a firearm that \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 should not be legal in the first place. Preventative measures could also be taken on the mental side, as it is not JUST about the firearms used, it\u2019s also about the mental health of wielders. Offering free counseling and mental help nationwide would be a great help. Personally, I do not feel safe going to school knowing these events happen on a (near) weekly basis. While there has never been any gun-related issues at my school that I am aware of, I feel the government does little to prevent these events but give their condolences.\n\nAndrew Derushia from Wilmington, N.C., said now was the time to act:\n\nWhat happened Wednesday was horrific, and a serious sign that we need gun law reform. 18 lives were taken from this world at the hands of a murderer who should have never been able to grasp the weapons he used to cause this destruction. Along with the many who agree with this idea, there are also ignorant opposers who suggest the guns have nothing to do with the problem and it is all the person\u2019s fault. Accept these exact same people are raged when background checks and mental evaluations are mentioned as solutions. Contrary to what these pro-gun people say, guns have allowed 18 school shootings to occur before the end of February. On average \u201c6 children or teens are killed per day by guns in the U.S.\u201d Semi-automatic guns which were made for the sole purpose of killing humans shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be handled by everyday people. The gun used in the recent shooting, an Ar-15, can empty up to 800 rounds per minute leaving tens of people dead in seconds. If these guns of horrible mass murder were never allowed into the hands of the public these shootings could have been stopped without such large casualties, and maybe even prevented. The time for gun reform is NOW, the time for change is NOW, the time to act is NOW. For the sake of children and adults across America SPEAK UP.\n\nDoug O\u2019Neal from Kentucky said we shouldn\u2019t blame guns:\n\nIt is a nightmare that no one needs to ever experience, no one should ever have to go through, but I can\u2019t help to feel that the problem doesn\u2019t so much lay with gun control laws than parental control and a failure of the so called system that doesn\u2019t work for the underprivileged or a health care system that sucks. Before the late 80\u2019s stuff like this was rarely ever heard of, but once kids were allowed to play video games where there is uncontrolled violence, prayer removed from schools, and music talking about killing people who have made someone mad, that\u2019s when things started happening. The issues ahead of us is not going to be corrected by stricter regulations on gun control, \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people,\u201d the question is why? Lawmakers and legislators should look closer at the real issues and stop trying to blame a tool instead the users and the so called systems that have allowed our children to slip through the cracks of society and become a tool for their political views. The idea of tougher laws on guns isn\u2019t the answer, fixing a broken system is a better start. When our children suffer at the hands of a drunk driver are automobiles blamed? Children are products of their environment and when legislators and lawmakers want to blame guns for the problems we face today all I can say is look a little better at the real issues and stop trying to place blame on an object that can not do anything unless it has someone to use it.\n\nrey Hicks from New Orleans agreed:\n\nI don\u2019t think guns are the problem here. I think that the customer should be checked out and observed closely and tested by certain individuals with no mental illness. Then it can be decided whether they can pay for it, or they have proper training and all that jazz. This is a sad subject and I wish for the best of the victims of this incident but I wish that you don\u2019t blame guns.\n\nLandon Elizabeth from Florida said other countries don\u2019t have mass shootings:\n\nI am 15, and I now fear for my safety at school. The first problem is the gun laws itself, we need gun control laws in place, so no unstable 19 year old can go purchase an assault rifle. It\u2019s actually so mind blowing how money hungry congressmen are that they\u2019d rather receive and collect money from the NRA, than do what they signed up for, which is to run and protect this country.\n\nAsal Al Mohamed from Wolfeboro, N.H., said guns are illegal in his home country, Oman:\n\nFirst of all, being an international student from Oman, we never have lock down drills or safety precautions because these mass shootings never happen in my country. Guns are illegal in Oman which means that no one owns guns and I\u2019ve also never heard of a shooting in Oman. However, studying at a boarding school in the U.S introduced me to the idea of lock down drills. My school has some safety precautions to prevent possible shootings. Just like fire drills, we have lock down drills that prepare us for this type of incident. We also have good security and doors that are only accessed by students and faculty key cards. So yes, I feel safe in my school.\n\nb from Wilmington would like to abolish guns completely:\n\nI am afraid. When I walked into school on Thursday I couldn\u2019t help but think of what I would do if someone started shooting up my school. Would I live or die? Would my friends survive? Would I have the courage to help injured people? What would I do. It\u2019s terrible that I and a lot of other people had thoughts like these running through our heads the mornings and weeks after these continuously occurring tragedies. What\u2019s even worse is the innocent lives lost. People with so much to live for gone in an instant. People who would still be alive today if our government would pay attention and DO SOMETHING about it. I\u2019m not saying that I have all the answers and that my opinion is the solution to this epidemic but I know that something needs to be done. If I had it my way I would do away with guns. I know that this is an unpopular opinion and that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all the guns in the United States but that\u2019s what I would do if I could. At the very least we should do with automatic assault weapons, which by definition are used for infantry use, and have better mental health screenings for people trying to license their guns. I hope that as a nation we have a revelation and make an effort to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening again by snuffing out this epidemic from the source.\n\nAndy G from North Carolina thinks guns are analogous to some drugs:\n\nI would like to start off by sending out prayers to the families that lost a close one in their lives, but making guns illegal won\u2019t help. Think of it this way; many drugs are illegal and people still get them, so if guns become illegal people will still find ways to get them. If I could make a solution it would be to give more in depth background checks.\n\nFrancesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., is exhausted:\n\nThere are so many things I want to say about this tragedy. There is so much grief, so much anger inside of me that inundated every other sense I felt on Wednesday. So many words I want to say to the gunman, to the high school students who were all irreversibly affected by him, to Congress. But I feel like I can\u2019t anymore. I am so exhausted. So inexplicably tired of the needless and terrifying violence that has gripped America, that we\u2019ve become despicably desensitized to because it happens so often. So tired of just \u201cthoughts and prayers,\u201d and idleness, when already over a dozen school shootings have occurred since the beginning of 2018. So tired of mass shootings being chalked up to mental illness, when mental illness is an issue globally, yet the U.S. is still the only nation where this regularly happens. So tired of hearing \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people,\u201d when we should be fixated on the fact that people are being killed in the first place. So tired of seeing that an amendment that was written over 200 years ago is being protected over the lives of children who didn\u2019t deserve this. So tired of every single victim of gun violence being overlooked, not given justice, and forgotten about because our government puts them on the back burner. I am tired, and ashamed of this country and the people who run it. Weapons should not take priority over people any longer. Things need to change. And they need to change now.\n\nOlivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., wants her children to grow up in a world where gun violence is a thing of the past:\n\nIn America, mass shootings have become an epidemic. What is the appropriate response to an epidemic? Eradication. When smallpox was an issue, we did all in our power so that no one could get smallpox ever again. Vaccines weren\u2019t given to a select few, they were given worldwide so that absolutely no one would suffer from it, and there hasn\u2019t been a case of smallpox since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980. Action was taken by those in power to eliminate the disease, real action, not just their \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. The phrase \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d should be used in cases of unpreventable destruction, such as an earthquake, and not the destruction that could be solved by the passage of legislation by Congress, preventing such deaths. Banning all semi-automatic guns and assault rifles at the very least would prevent the mass shootings we see all-too-often today. Another phrase that gets tossed around often in the wake of a mass shooting is \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people do.\u201d While this is true in a sense, you could kill a lot more people at once with an AR-15 than with a knife.\n\nRennat Hosley from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the Second Amendment is out of date:\n\nI have to start off by saying this was very tragic event that happened on Valentine\u2019s Day, I give my prayers to the families whose loved ones passed during the shooting. The way people obtain guns need to be restricted, or harder to obtain, I know the 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, and people take that law very seriously, but nowadays we really don\u2019t need the weapons. Also many people use the weapon for bad uses like murder, or intimidating people and that\u2019s increasing many crimes. According to the article it says the man was using an AR-15 assault rifle and according to the laws of gun control you can purchase an AR-15 when you\u2019re at the age of 18 with a license but you have to be the age of 21 to purchase a handgun. That doesn\u2019t make much sense from the fact that an AR-15 can be more deadly than a handgun. I hope someday we can fix this problem happening in America.\n\nManuel Garza from Los Angeles focused on the Florida students\u2019 experience:\n\nI heard that students were Snapchatting their experience during the whole thing. And that people are calling them out and saying that what they were doing was stupid. Which is very insensitive since the students didn\u2019t know what else to do. One student said that they were all calling 911 and 911 told them to stop calling.\n\nAmber M from South Carolina relayed personal experiences:\n\nA couple years ago there was a gun incident at my brother\u2019s school \u2014 a kid brought a gun to show off to his friends, it accidentally went off. It was chaos for awhile, people didn\u2019t know if it was an accident or not. All my family knew was that a shooting had occurred at my brother\u2019s school, everyone was so worried. At my old school, a kid brought a gun to school this year and went running through the halls with it. He didn\u2019t shoot anyone, but he escaped campus and caused a big police chase. A lot of fear in both of those incidents when families were still figuring out what was going on. Every year we have to watch videos on what to do if a shooting occurs, and they always remind us of the genuine danger that schools can present these days. It\u2019s frightening to have to worry about friends and siblings whenever there\u2019s an incident. Especially in my state, where guns are really easy to obtain, there\u2019s a lot of worry.\n\nLuiza Sulea from Philadelphia replied to Amber M and took issue with some schools\u2019 gun policies:\n\nWow, that is so scary. I think that if something like this happened in my school, I\u2019d be too panicked to breathe. Even in these \u201cnonviolent\u201d gun situations, it just shows how terrible and how easy it is to sneak a weapon into school. I read something a while ago that a student wrote. She said that it was against her school\u2019s policy to wear a tube top, but the students were allowed to carry a weapon under 4 inches. I don\u2019t necessarily know if this is true, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it with all the weapon and gun violence that has been happening recently.\n\nDeana Perera from Bryant, Ark., suggested things schools can do:\n\nThe school shootings that periodically erupt all over the United States are terrible and my heart is filled with sorrow at the thought of so much suffering. May God please bless all those suffering from the shooting yesterday. Thankfully at my high school we have not had to suffer through any shootings recently. I believe that tightening gun laws will only solve half the problem because I feel that schools can do more on their part in taking good security measures. Some pretty good security measures that all schools might want to consider are resource officers and student IDs. The resource officers not only intimidate any one who poses a threat from outside the school, but their presence also effectively discourages violence within the school. Threatening disciplinary action to anyone walking around without a student or administrator\u2019s ID, all schools can be very careful about who they let on campus. Another step schools can take is an alert system that connects to all administrators\u2019 phones so that if there is a threat to the school, all administrative personnel can be immediately notified without having to spread the information through the intercom system and also alerting the shooter. The awful shootings are heart-wrenching and devastate many lives. We need to do everything we can to help each other and keep our schools safe. These precautionary steps aren\u2019t always the cheapest, but can anyone really put a price on how much people\u2019s lives are worth?\n\nOliver D. from Central Texas knows what to do in the event of an active shooter, thanks to a teacher:\n\nWith the influx of school shootings this year, I feel like the schools in my area are growing less and less safe. A year or so ago, one student made a threat against the school on social media, claiming he would blow up the gym during a pep rally. The next day, after the comments had been posted, the school looked like a ghost town. Parents kept their kids home and kids skipped collectively. We did not address the issue in school, just went on after we realized the threat was empty. The panic of that day, of not knowing if some upset student would come in and target me and my friends or if we were afraid for nothing. My health science teacher, of course, was my savior when it came to situations like this, having given my class a semester of CERT (Civilian Emergency Response Training) I know what to do, where to go, and how to get my classmates out. The ONLY solution is gun control\n\nBorad Manuch from Texas reacted to the shooting with \u201cbitter acceptance\u201d:\n\nMy reaction to the Florida shooting was actually just solidly passive and bitterly accepting. \u201cIt was another school shooting, nothing shockingly knew,\u201d I thought. You\u2019d think that at this point in time, after so many school shooting cases, that the higher ups that run our country would have already taken care of it. But as everyone can see now this isn\u2019t the case. While I do understand that the having the right to bear arms is part of the American identity but as a collateral to having that much power in a person\u2019s hand, then there should be strict ways to obtain a gun. I don\u2019t have the slightest idea on how to effectively prevent a school shooting but that is not up to me to decide neither it is my responsibility to do so. But I do know what thing for sure and that is to obviously do something to prevent school shootings.\n\nRonald Zigler from Lansdale, Pa., made an analogy to a myth:\n\nI am reminded of the story of the Minotaur, or of any ritual from ancient legend in which children were sacrificed as a form of tribute. The parallels to our contemporary world are only too clear. For far too many politicians and gun-worshippers, periodic human sacrifice is the necessary tribute that sustains their devotion. As Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley and Joseph Campbell would have each pointed out, our modern civilization is but a veneer, that is often quite transparent.\n\n_________", "title": "On the Shooting in Florida, Student Activism, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and the Olympics: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

It\u2019s so bad.\u201d\n\nOnce one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal boosters \u2014 she told a \u201cFrontline\u201d documentary crew before the election that \u201cevery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump\u201d \u2014 now said she wouldn\u2019t vote for him again, \u201cin a million years, never.\u201d\n\nHer confession was punctuated by the kind of distant-thunder soundtrack that played during boardroom smackdowns on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nIt was a Frost/Nixon interview for the Trump era, when politics and reality TV have become inseparable and indistinguishable. Television, from \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in the morning to \u201cBig Brother\u201d at night, is now a fourth branch of government.\n\nIn a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview in December, after she was escorted off the White House grounds after reports of clashes with senior staff, Ms. Newman made only a tepid reference to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d situations on the job.\n\nBut she opened up in the company of her peers. One of them, the actress Keshia Knight-Pulliam of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d was also once a contestant on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d where she was fired by Mr. Trump for not having called Bill Cosby to help with a challenge.\n\nWhen Ms. Knight-Pulliam criticized Ms. Newman for standing by \u201cthe hate that that campaign kind of incited,\u201d Ms. Newman compared her loyalty with Ms. Knight-Pulliam\u2019s supporting Mr. Cosby through numerous accusations of rape. \u201cOnly you know the inner workings of your relationship with Mr. Cosby,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the same thing with me and Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nI would not have pegged \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d as the show where, in the Trump and #MeToo eras, America would work through the ethics of enabling powerful men accused of abuses. But here we are.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is a kind of literary symmetry to Ms. Newman\u2019s smiting her former boss with the very tools he taught her to use. Omarosa was the villain of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but she played the game in the most Trumpian way.\n\nShe recognized that the show was a contest not of business acumen but of getting and leveraging attention. She created conflict in the belief that chaos yields opportunity. She denied mistakes even when she\u2019d made them on camera. She didn\u2019t win the season, but she won the greater prize of fame.\n\nShe was so successful that Mr. Trump had her back two more times and also produced, and appeared on, a TV One dating show for her \u2014 \u201cDonald J. Trump Presents the Ultimate Merger\u201d \u2014 all before hiring her for a White House position whose duties few people were able to describe.\n\nA few caveats are in order about Ms. Newman\u2019s \u201cWelcome to the Resistance\u201d moment. Reality shows are edited for maximum sensation. Her warnings were dire but unspecific. As a contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d she learned that drama is what saves you from the editing room floor. She might be interested in making a book deal, or simply in repairing her public brand. As Mr. Mathews put it: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real. Would you trust her?\u201d\n\nThose might have been stronger rebuttals to Ms. Newman\u2019s comments than what the deputy White House press secretary, Raj Shah, offered Thursday to a reporter from \u2014 of course \u2014 CBS.\n\n\u201cOmarosa was fired three times on \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 and this is the fourth time we\u2019ve let her go,\u201d he said. It was a boomerang insult that suggested that the Trump administration is part of the same long-running narrative as \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and raised the question of why she was hired in the first place.\n\nBut to suggest that Ms. Newman might have been playing to the cameras would have required the administration of Mr. Trump \u2014 who campaigned on the decisive-leader image that \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d stage-managed for him \u2014 to recognize that reality TV can convey an inaccurate impression of people.\n\nHow much more Ms. Newman has to say, and how much time she\u2019ll have to say it, is yet to be seen. But she\u2019s safe from being voted out of the house for now, having conveniently won immunity from the first ejection.\n\nThe network, if not the White House, must be happy. The Wednesday premiere of the three-week series was the highest-rated show of the night. During the 2016 Republican primary, the CBS chairman Leslie Moonves said of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was more right than he knew.", "title": "On \u2018Big Brother,\u2019 America Gets the Reality-TV Politics It Deserves", "authors": ["James Poniewozik"]}

Because \u201cGood Girls\u201d suggests that when pushed too far, women push back.\n\nPhoto\n\nJenna Bans, the show\u2019s creator, is a longtime writer and producer on several Shonda Rhimes shows and has also created \u201cThe Family,\u201d a domestic potboiler, and \u201cOff the Map,\u201d a sultry medical drama. Despite \u201cawesome feminist parents,\u201d she has spent most of her life as a self-proclaimed good girl, learning early on \u201cnot to ruffle feathers, not to rock the boat, to do what was expected of you,\u201d she said. (Ms. Bans was speaking by telephone from Los Angeles, where she was busy doing what was expected of her, finalizing the script for the season finale.)\n\nThe impetus for this series came a month or so before the 2016 election, when an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, recording Donald J. Trump\u2019s lewd remarks about women. Surprised by the overt sexism on display, she called her mother, figuring her reaction would be the same. But as Ms. Bans described it, her mother, \u201ca salty, hilarious, practical woman from the Midwest,\u201d just said, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\nThat conversation made Ms. Bans want to honor women like her mother, who have kept going when the playing field was anything but level. Eventually, that tribute became a compensatory fantasy, showing what might happen if women did rock the boat, if they did ruffle feathers, if they did take what they want. When we meet the characters of \u201cGood Girls,\u201d they\u2019re struggling, they\u2019re powerless, they haven\u2019t reaped the rewards they\u2019ve been promised. A few ski masks, a handful of toy guns, an \u201cAll right, everybody be cool and nobody gets hurt\u201d and those rewards start coming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not the best choice,\u201d Ms. Bans said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a responsible choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a bold choice to shove a climactic event like the heist into the pilot, rather than build up to it over many weeks, but Ms. Bans seemed unconcerned that viewers won\u2019t stick around. \u201cWe\u2019re never really struggling for lack of a story,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually we\u2019re trying to prune story out of our episodes because they\u2019re too overstuffed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Girls\u201d has a punchier, more comedic feel than the Shondaverse of \u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cPrivate Practice\u201d (series on which Ms. Bans worked), but shares some of those shows\u2019 D.N.A. As Ms. Bans said, Ms. Rhimes imbued in her \u201ca sense of risk-taking, of not keeping it safe, of pushing your characters to do things that scare them.\u201d\n\nHere, doing things that scare them allows these suburban moms to finally own their smarts, skills and mettle. As Ms. Hendricks\u2019s Beth says in the pilot, \u201cWe have accomplished way harder than this. I once made 300 damn cupcakes in one night and they were both nut- and gluten-free.\u201d So what\u2019s a little crime?\n\nThe crimes on \u201cGood Girls\u201d might not stay little, but they will rarely push the women too far off their moral centers. Last fall, Mike Hale in The New York Times noted that if television seems finally to have entered the age of the antiheroine, showrunners seem reluctant to create a heroine \u201cwho freely practices evil and is, at least in dramatic terms, celebrated for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s a reluctance \u201cGood Girls\u201d shares and won\u2019t apologize for. \u201cWe really want to protect their sense of right and wrong,\u201d Ms. Bans said. \u201cWhen they make what is a morally gray choice, they really struggle with it.\u201d\n\nTruly amoral women, like Claire Underwood of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or Cersei Lannister of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d probably don\u2019t get invited out for 2-for-1 margarita night, but as for the women of \u201cGood Girls,\u201d \u201cI really feel like they\u2019re my friends,\u201d Ms. Bans said. She wants viewers to feel the same way.\n\nSo these women won\u2019t break bad. But they will definitely break not nice. And if they were on cable, Ms. Bans thinks they would probably swear a lot more, but she promises that this is the only compromise.\n\nMs. Hendricks said she hopes that the show will encourage viewers to examine their own sense of right and wrong. \u201cFollowing these women around, you ask yourself questions like, \u2018What would you do for your family? What\u2019s the sliding scale in your life? Would you do something a little illegal? Would you do something a lot illegal?\u2019\u201d Beth will commit multiple felonies, but will still slide a coaster underneath a soda can, so that\u2019s her line in the sand.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf the show is asking its audience to rethink its own choices, it\u2019s also encouraging its lead actresses to make some new ones. Ms. Whitman, usually cast as wised-up teenagers on \u201cParenthood\u201d and \u201cArrested Development,\u201d is playing a deeply unwise adult. Retta, a comedian best known as Donna Meagle, the assured office manager and coiner of the phrase \u2018Treat yo self\u201d on \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d has a dramatic role. Ms. Hendricks, the office femme fatale of \u201cMad Men,\u201d is a neglected mother of four.\n\n(Kathleen Rose Perkins of \u201cEpisodes\u201d played Ms. Hendricks\u2019s character in an earlier pilot, but as the story changed, the role was recast. As Ms. Hendricks, who had her own role on Cameron Crowe\u2019s \u201cRoadies\u201d recast, said, \u201cHappens to everyone.\u201d)\n\nNone of these characters is flawless. None of these characters is simple. As Retta, drinking a La Croix in her trailer between scenes, joked, \u201cI get to have it all \u2014 kids and a husband and an illegal job.\u201d Ms. Whitman, resting in the neighboring trailer, described \u201ca weird sick excitement on my part to play somebody who isn\u2019t perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood Girls\u201d asks what would happen, what could happen if girls and women stopped angling for perfection. \u201cIt\u2019s sad and funny to think about,\u201d Ms. Bans said.

In 2016, Ms. Young highlighted the city\u2019s surplus as evidence that Mr. de Blasio did not need any more state support; on Monday, she returned to that theme. In 2017, Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn brought a loaf of bread and a carton of eggs to mock the mayor\u2019s proposal to charge a five-cent fee for plastic bags. (Mr. Felder reassured Mr. de Blasio on Monday that he had not brought any props this time.)\n\nLegislators also berated Mr. de Blasio for poor conditions in the city\u2019s public housing complexes and for his refusal to enact a property tax cap to which other municipalities statewide are subject. Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Staten Island Republican who ran against Mr. de Blasio in November, made a show of examining her own property tax records against Mr. de Blasio\u2019s, noting that she paid nearly $2,000 more in property taxes each year even though his home was worth nearly three times more.\n\nFor his part, Mr. de Blasio criticized parts of the executive budget that would shift financial responsibility for charter schools to the city, and that would cut funding for special education and affordable housing. The mayor has been open in his criticism of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposed budget, even lumping together fiscal threats from Albany with those from Washington.\n\nAfter the hearing, the mayor and the governor, who are famously at loggerheads, met privately for nearly an hour and a half.

They are demanding a more robust debate over a series of gun initiatives, notably what they call a \u201cuniversal\u201d background check system that would cover all gun transactions in the country. That plan is opposed by the gun lobby but was seemingly endorsed by Mr. Trump, putting him at odds not only with the gun advocacy group that strongly backed him, but with many congressional Republicans, as well.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and an author, with Mr. Cornyn, of the more limited background check bill, equated taking up his own legislation without allowing consideration of alternatives to \u201cslamming the door in the face of all these kids who are demanding change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is imperative that we rise to the moment,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nMr. Trump told lawmakers they should use a broader bipartisan background check measure that failed in 2013 after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., as the basis for a comprehensive measure that could take in many proposals, including the Cornyn plan, new mental health provisions and added security for schools. He urged backers of a renewed ban on assault weapons to make their case to the authors of the legislation and said he would welcome the opportunity to enact one sweeping bill to combat mass shootings. But Congress has for years been unable to make even incremental headway on new gun buying limits, let alone the type of multifaceted plan called for by the president.\n\nDemocrats would like to persuade Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow votes on major gun control proposals, a plan that could throw the Senate into a full-blown showdown over competing initiatives. But Mr. McConnell is never one to rush into a fight that divides his own party if he can help it. While Mr. McConnell has been quiet about his intentions, Mr. Cornyn opened the door to that possibility of a wider debate provided it could get to passage of his bill at a minimum.\n\n\u201cWe can set up a situation where they can vote on those amendments,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is leave here this week and go back home to Texas and say we failed to do anything to try to address these tragedies.\u201d\n\nAs lawmakers quibbled about how to proceed, some of the multiple proposals promoted by Mr. Trump were falling by the wayside.\n\nRepublican lawmakers seem uninterested in plans to raise the age to buy all guns to 21.

Among plans circulating that could draw bipartisan support was a measure that would prevent those on federal no-fly lists from buying guns, though that approach has met Republican resistance in the past.\n\nHoping to skirt a divisive debate, Republicans preferred to focus on other remedies, like improving general school safety, while pointing to law enforcement failures surrounding the Parkland shooting.", "title": "Once Again, Push for Gun Control Collides With Political Reality", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "Many series for fledgling readers feature mischievous girls and their grade-school exploits: Ramona Quimby, Junie B. Jones and Clementine, to name a few. Others, like the Magic Treehouse books, send children on fantasy adventures. Abby Hanlon\u2019s marvelous Dory Fantasmagory series, featuring the plucky heroine Dory, also known as Rascal, combines the two. As Dory herself puts it: \u201cMy two worlds swirl together like a chocolate and vanilla ice cream cone. Real and unreal get mixed up in one crazy flavor.\u201d On every page, Hanlon\u2019s charming illustrations \u2014 if you squint, they resemble a child\u2019s drawings \u2014 mix things up as well, interweaving layers of visual and narrative storytelling to invite us in to Dory\u2019s active imagination.\n\nThe fourth and latest book in the series, DORY FANTASMAGORY: Head in the Clouds (Dial, $15.99, ages 5 to 8), will have fans rejoicing that Hanlon\u2019s hybrid formula is still going strong. Dory faces obstacles both mundane and enchanted, and surmounts them all. She dumps an objectionable winter coat and devises a pretend game to captivate a weepy friend. After losing her first tooth, she recognizes the Tooth Fairy, shopping incognito, and chases her through a grocery store. And in perhaps her greatest triumph in the series so far, she foils the evil plan of her imaginary nemesis, Mrs. Gobble Gracker, to take over that benevolent spirit\u2019s nightly visits.\n\nThroughout the series, Dory deals with conventional problems \u2014 handling scornful older siblings, starting school, making friends, learning to read \u2014 in unconventional ways. In the first book, she faces her kindergarten fears by inventing Mrs. Gobble Gracker, an even more intimidating foe. With her looming stature and witchy features, she recalls James Marshall\u2019s illustrations of Miss Viola Swamp, \u201cthe meanest substitute teacher in the whole world,\u201d in \u201cMiss Nelson Is Missing,\u201d by Harry G. Allard Jr. Dory\u2019s everyday world is populated with other magical and comic figures, like Mary, her monster, and Mr. Nuggy, her (male) fairy godmother. And while many stories for children send their protagonists back to the real world for good \u2014 Wendy grows up and can\u2019t return to Neverland; Lucy leaves Narnia; Jackie Paper abandons Puff the Magic Dragon \u2014 Hanlon does not champion maturity as the answer to adversity. A former first-grade teacher, she recognizes the value of coping strategies that are particular to children. Rascal becomes resilient, resourceful and adventurous thanks to the permeable boundary between reality and fantasy, not in spite of it. \u201cTry not to imagine things,\u201d Dory\u2019s sister, Violet, tells her when she heads off to kindergarten. But it is Rascal\u2019s imagination that allows her to adapt to new surroundings, practice new skills and make new friends.\n\nIn \u201cHead in the Clouds,\u201d Hanlon once again shows an unerring sense of what distresses children (that \u201cbunchy\u201d winter coat), what excites them (candy canes discovered in pockets), and what they fear (a tooth fairy delivery gone astray). There is, as always, much to laugh over. We see Luke\u2019s and Violet\u2019s frustrated memories of life with infant Dory. We learn the contents of the Tooth Fairy\u2019s purse (like Beyonc\u00e9, she carries a certain condiment).

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "La Rochefoucauld was born in September 1923, and was 16 when France surrendered in June 1940. From the beginning he hated the Germans with a deep passion, and he was determined to fight them. Unlike many in France who collaborated with Germans and accepted the collaborationist Vichy government, La Rochefoucauld fled to Spain, taking the dangerous journey to London so he could meet Charles de Gaulle in person. In Spain, he was recruited as a member of the British Special Operations Executive, the S.O.E., Britain\u2019s army of saboteurs, and sent back to France to, in Churchill\u2019s words, \u201cset Europe ablaze.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis La Rochefoucauld did, winning a Croix de Guerre, made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur and awarded other medals. After parachuting into France, he joined a Resistance network and trained r\u00e9sistants in the use of explosives to blow up power plants and railroads, then sabotaged the factory the Germans used to repair them. While guiding two British pilots toward freedom, La Rochefoucauld was arrested by Spanish police agents and sent to a prison camp. In time, he was flown back to London, where he was trained in sabotage and silent killing, and was given arduous physical training. Eventually, he was parachuted back into France and, in 1943, arrested, and sent to Auxerre prison.\n\nA warning: This section of \u201cThe Saboteur\u201d is very explicit in its description of the tortures \u2014 beatings and water boardings among them \u2014 endured by prisoners at Auxerre. In time, he was sentenced to death, but La Rochefoucauld was not prepared to die, and decided to take his chances and escape, jumping off a truck on his way to an execution site, but then he realized he was about to run past Gestapo headquarters: \u201cLa Rochefoucauld decided to continue down the street, despite his heart\u2019s drumming in his rib cage. He walked as casually as a man trying to escape his execution could walk. As he approached the building, he saw a Citro\u00ebn sedan with swastika pennants on the fender, parked nearby. He stole a glance inside the car \u2014 keys in the ignition. He looked around and saw a driver, maybe 30 feet away, pacing back and forth, waiting for someone to emerge from the building. Just then La Rochefoucauld heard distant shouting, The truck! Now \u2014 he had to decide now. He moved closer to the car, swung the door wide and threw himself in.\u201d\n\nThis is first-class adventure writing, which, coupled with a true-life narrative of danger and intrigue, adds up to all-night reading. There are hundreds of books about the French Resistance, some fictional, some based on actual experience. Again and again, one meets heroic people who will not give in to the forces of evil. These works are morality plays about courage and determination. Kix puts it this way: \u201cThe boys talked about how France had lost her honor. \u2018I didn\u2019t have much good sense,\u2019 Robert said, \u2018but honor \u2014 that\u2019s all my friends and I could talk about.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese many narratives, about holding dear to one\u2019s honor in the face of persecution by a powerful enemy, will never go out of style. The reason they remain popular and widely read today is this implicit question: What would you have done? Hard to answer, but it\u2019s a question that, given the political circumstances of the world we live in, sadly needs to be asked. Reading \u201cThe Saboteur,\u201d one understands how a certain person at a certain time answered it. La Rochefoucauld faced torture and death, yet he carried on. There is inspiration in his example, and that makes \u201cThe Saboteur\u201d well worth reading.", "title": "One of the Men Who \u2018Set Europe Ablaze\u2019", "authors": ["Alan Furst", "Paul Kix"]}

On a more immediate note, however, I asked our Poland correspondent, Marc Santora, for some actual tips from the front line. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cForget layers. A proper winter coat is much better and easier to leave at a coat check. Boots are essential, especially indoor/outdoor boots that are water resistant but not arctic boots. All that said, the malls here have most essentials, so no need to stress. And come spring I am told it is all sundresses and shorts. When the sun arrives they soak up every minute.\u201d\n\nFor the boots I\u2019d check out Sorel if you don\u2019t have some already; throw in a few pairs of pants and some sweaters; make sure your coat is water-resistant (not wool); and then take a few sundresses (which you can also wear over tights and under sweaters in winter), shorts and shirts, sneakers and ballet flats. Plus a transitional jacket, like a pea coat or lightweight trench, and a couple of scarves. Then add a tote bag or backpack, shoulder bag and pochette that can double as an evening clutch, and you should be in good shape.\n\nA final tip: Before you pack, stand in front of your closet and think very carefully about what you actually wear, as opposed to what you have. It can be both enlightening and liberating. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "title": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "authors": []}

I need something light and warm for the chilly Los Angeles nights and for when I spend five weeks in N.Y. in the fall. I wear a lot of sweaters that come down to my mid thighs. I am a 70-year-old artist and I am looking for something interesting (but no belts, please!) \u2013 Eileen, Santa Monica\n\nA: Take it from this similarly belt-adverse person: yes, absolutely. In fact, fashion has developed something of a thing for puffers. I literally just saw a puffer wrap on the Michael Kors runway, and some pretty great shearling trimmed puffers at Tory Burch.\n\nThose won\u2019t be in stores til August though, so for some more immediate gratification, I asked T\u2019s style director, Malina Joseph Gilchrist, what she would recommend. Here\u2019s what she said: \u201cLook at Moncler and Marques\u2019 Almeida for more fashionable options. Moncler cuts for women where the waist is taken in and gives a more \u2018fashionable\u2019 shape, sans belt. Marques\u2019 Almeida has been incorporating puffer coats on the runway. Other good options are Norma Kamali\u2019s sleeping bag jacket, which was stylish in the \u201880s and is still good today. Or try Uniqlo, and opt for their knee-length quilted thinner down jacket.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d also add another Italian brand that is less expensive than Moncler (though not cheap), as an option. I was standing outside a show the other day and chatting to another critic when I started admiring her puffer \u2014 silky, with a wide turtle neck \u00e0 la Audrey Hepburn \u2014 and asked where it was from: Herno was the answer.

Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: I am a 28-year-old professional working in construction engineering, and I am extremely petite \u2014 about 4-foot-10 and less than 100 pounds. My office is very informal, daily jeans and a blouse is fine, but I am often mistaken for a college intern. I am already in a male-dominated \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d industry, and regularly being assumed to be nearly 10 years younger than I am does not do me any favors when I am trying to be taken seriously. I am at a loss on how to appear fashionable, professional, knowledgeable, and look like I am nearly 30, all at the same time. I can\u2019t realistically wear the high heels I would wear during non-work hours all day long. \u2014 Kaitlin, Boston\n\nA: This is a tough one. I know how frustrating it can be to have people not take you seriously because of how you look (or tell you how happy it will make you when all your peers look their age and you still look young). While we get a lot of complaints about fashion not catering to plus-size or very tall women, very petite women have the same problem.\n\nMy first suggestion would be Brooks Brothers\u2019 boys department, which makes great blazers and button-down shirts (as a bonus, they are the same quality and cut as adult sizes, but at a lower price). I had a friend who used to wear skin-tight pants with boys\u2019 shirts that were a size too small to black tie events, and she pretty much laid those who saw her on the floor. Pair them with girls\u2019 leather riding boots, which should come in all sizes and have the comfort you need, but look chicer than sneakers or ballet flats.\n\nT\u2019s style director, Malina Joseph Gilchrist, also had these ideas: \u201cTry Stitch Fix, a members service where you have the luxury of trying on a style box of goodies in your own home. Reformation also has a special petite department that has cute dresses to wear with a blazer.\u201d Another possible solution: tunics, which you can get tailored down into shift dresses without too much hassle.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll remind the designers I meet on the road that they are missing a part of the market.

He was upset after the Trump administration used the civilian criminal justice system to handle two new terrorism suspects \u2014 an apparent Islamic State sympathizer who ran over people with a truck in New York, and a man suspected of participating in the 2012 attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, who was captured in that country.\n\nGovernment lawyers had maintained that there was no clear legal authority to place either man in military custody because there was insufficient evidence that either was part of a group covered by Congress\u2019s Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBut Mr. Graham argued for a less restrictive interpretation that would permit such newly captured suspects to be held in military custody for a period of interrogation without defense lawyers. He met separately in December with Mr. Sessions, Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly to argue that the administration was keeping the Obama-era approach, which he saw as misguided, and was promised that the Trump team would start a policy review.\n\nMr. Graham is also said to have proposed one alternative procedure: using Guant\u00e1namo to hold new terrorism suspects when they are captured abroad, and using the military brig in Charleston, S.C., for future terrorism suspects arrested on domestic soil. It remains unclear what policy Mr. Mattis will recommend.\n\nOne problem with using Guant\u00e1namo is the legal risk that would be created by sending an Islamic State suspect there, as opposed to the Qaeda and Taliban suspects sent there years ago. It is contested whether the A.U.M.F. can be legitimately interpreted to cover the war against the Islamic State, as the government contends. Guant\u00e1namo detainees have the right to file habeas corpus lawsuits challenging their detention in court, so sending an Islamic State suspect there would give a judge an opportunity to rule against the government \u2014 jeopardizing the legal basis for the broader war effort.\n\nIn theory, Congress could solve that problem by specifically authorizing the use of military force against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind that idea, saying, \u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201d (It was then that Mr. Trump ad-libbed his line that many would now go to Guant\u00e1namo.)\n\nBut Congress has been debating since 2014 whether and how to enact an Islamic State-specific A.U.M.F.

Choose a topic you care about, gather evidence from sources both within and outside The Times and write a concise editorial (450 words or less) to convince readers of your view.\n\nBecause editorial writing at newspapers is a collaborative process, you can write your entry as a team effort or by yourself. When you\u2019re done, submit it using the contest form below by Thursday, April 5, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern. Be sure to read the rules, also below, before posting.\n\nOur judges will then use this rubric (PDF) for selecting winners to publish on The Learning Network.\n\nAs teachers know, the persuasive essay has long been a staple of high school education, but the Common Core standards seem to have put evidence-based argumentative writing on everybody\u2019s agenda. You couldn\u2019t ask for a more real-world example of the genre than the classic newspaper editorial \u2014 and The Times publishes, on average, two of them a day.\n\nAnd at a time when breaking out of one\u2019s \u201cfilter bubble\u201d is more important than ever, we hope this contest also encourages students to broaden their news diets by using multiple sources, ideally ones that offer a range of perspectives on their chosen issue.\n\nSo what issue do you care about? Gun violence? Sexual harassment? Social media? You decide.\n\nGood luck, and please post any questions you might have in the comments. We\u2019ll answer you there.\n\n_________\n\nNote: The submission form has been removed from this page. The contest is closed.\n\n_________\n\nVideo\n\nTo help with this challenge, Andrew Rosenthal, in his previous role as Editorial Page editor of The Times, detailed seven pointers in the video above. And we have published related lesson plans, including \u201cFor the Sake of Argument: Writing Persuasively to Craft Short, Evidence-Based Editorials,\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So: Writing Effective Counterarguments\u201d and \u201c10 Ways to Teach Argument-Writing With The New York Times,\u201d that offer additional teaching ideas.\n\nWe have also culled a list of 401 prompts for argumentative writing organized by category, to help inspire you \u2014 although, of course, you are not limited to those topics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe encourage you to look at both our comments on last year\u2019s winners and the winning essays themselves.

Use at least one Times source. You can write your editorial about any topic, as long as you use at least one source from The Times. That should pretty much open the whole world to you, as you may be surprised how much you can find in The Times.\n\nBe advised that nytimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have access to five free articles each month, but after that you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. The Times also offers K-12 digital subscription plans for schools. But all Learning Network activities for students, including our daily writing prompts, as well as Times articles linked from them, are free, so you can access them without exceeding the five-article limit.\n\n2. Use at least one non-Times source. But make sure that the source you use is a reliable one. We encourage you to find sources that offer different perspectives on an issue.\n\n3. Always cite your sources. Our submission form contains a required field for entering your citations. We include an example as well, though you can use M.L.A. or A.P.A. styles, or just list the website URLs. Even if you use a print source or an expert interview, you must provide a citation. Readers (and judges) should always know where you got your evidence.\n\n4. Be concise. The editorial must not exceed 450 words. Your title and list of sources are separate, however, and do not count as part of your 450-word limit.\n\n5. Have an opinion. Editorials are different from news articles because they try to persuade readers to share your point of view. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a stand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n6. Write your editorial by yourself or with a group. If you are working as a team, just remember to submit all of your names when you post your entry. But please submit only one editorial per student. If you\u2019re submitting as part of a team, you should not also submit as an individual.\n\n7. Be original and use appropriate language. Write for a well-informed audience, but include enough background information to give context. Be careful not to plagiarize: Use quotation marks around lines you take verbatim from another source, or rephrase and cite your source.\n\n8. Submissions must be from students who are 13 to 19 years old, and they may come from anywhere in the world. Unlike in previous years, students can now use their entire name if they want.\n\n9. All entries must be submitted by April 5 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern using the contest form above. If you have questions about the contest, feel free to post them in the comments section, and we\u2019ll respond to you there.\n\n10.

Built in 1961, it originally was home to Union Carbide. The bank currently has about 6,000 employees crammed into the 52-story tower, which was built for 3,500.\n\nThe building is not protected by landmark status from demolition. But some architects and preservationists are upset about the prospect of a wrecking ball tearing through it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A 13-story wing of the building is linked to the tower by a narrow, transparent bridge.\n\nChase has renovated the 57-year-old tower several times to make it more accommodating.\n\nFour years ago, it went further, exploring construction of a two-towered $6.5 billion headquarters on the Far West Side of Manhattan. But a potential deal fell through, partly because the city rebuffed a request to provide roughly $1 billion in tax breaks and cash, on top of the $600 million in property tax breaks the bank already receives.\n\nIn the meantime, the de Blasio administration spent three years negotiating over new zoning for what was called Midtown East with real estate interests, community groups and churches and other institutions in the Grand Central area that have unused development rights.\n\nDevelopers and corporations argued that the old zoning in the densely built neighborhood hobbled their ability to build modern, space-efficient towers. Elected officials, community groups and the city wanted to ensure that improvements were made to the area\u2019s transit system and streetscape if any new towers got built.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder the terms of the rezoning, public projects across East Midtown would be funded by a minimum contribution from developers of $61.49 per square foot or 20 percent of the price of air rights or unused development rights. Chase plans to buy as much as one million square feet of air rights from other property owners in the district.\n\nUnder a separate rezoning done earlier, the developer SL Green is building a massive tower known as 1 Vanderbilt, next to Grand Central, in exchange for $220 million in improvements to subway corridors and platforms.\n\nYet, when the city adopted the East Midtown rezoning last August, some real estate executives were skeptical that the zoning would lead to new construction anytime soon, because so much of the area is already densely built. But if JP Morgan could not build on Manhattan\u2019s West Side without subsidies, one bank executive said, the new zoning, as well as the fact that Chase already owned the Park Avenue land, made the new project possible.\n\nThe bank first contacted Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen in early December, and the plans moved quickly.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly exciting and a ringing endorsement of three years of intense work we went through to get the right framework,\u201d Ms. Glen said, \u201cto get one of the largest financial services companies to make an enormous investment.\u201d", "title": "Out With the Old Building, in With the New for JPMorgan Chase", "authors": ["Charles V.

With the trial looming, both sides acknowledged growing uncertainty.\n\nProsecutors noted that there was \u201clittle direct precedent, if any,\u201d of a conviction for removing a plug from a kayak. Tests had found that removing the plug from the kayak was not enough in itself to cause the kayak to capsize, prosecutors said, and Mr. Viafore was not wearing a life jacket or a wet suit and the couple had alcohol with them on the trip. And in a case that would have largely turned on Ms. Graswald\u2019s vacillating statements, prosecutors also said that her admissions did not add up to a direct confession.\n\n(Prosecutors declined to address the case last week. \u201cThe case is over and as such we have no further comment,\u201d said Christopher P. Borek, the chief assistant district attorney.)\n\nMs. Graswald maintained her innocence, but she said she had \u201cno faith in the system whatsoever.\u201d Over the summer, she weighed the prospect of life in prison if she were convicted against being released by the end of the year, if she pleaded guilty. (By pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide, she acknowledged that she knew of the missing plug, rough weather conditions and his lack of safety gear, but that she did not intend for him to die.)\n\nShe left prison just days before Christmas after being detained for about 32 months.\n\nMs. Graswald, a native of Latvia, came to the United States after finding a job as a nanny in Greenwich, Conn. She was a university student studying English and German, hoping to become a teacher or translator, and taking some time off. But she ended up staying.\n\nShe met Mr. Viafore in 2013. He was outgoing, and their interests overlapped: They liked hiking and shooting pool. They both led active social lives. They became engaged in February 2014. His proposal was spontaneous, she said; they were at a hibachi steakhouse, and the ring was a slice of onion from the grill.\n\nThe two of them fought over the sexual acts that she felt pressured to do. When she told investigators she felt relieved, she said, she was not referring to his death. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI felt relief that the pressure was over.\u201d She said they were looking forward to their wedding, set for Aug. 15, 2015 \u2014 exactly 15 years after she came to the United States.\n\nMs. Rice, Mr. Viafore\u2019s sister, said she knew the couple fought. She said she did not know the details of their sex life, but added that there were other sources of friction in their relationship and that Ms. Graswald had a temper. Ms. Rice said that Mr. Viafore was frustrated that Ms. Graswald was not working and that he had to support her. He had called off the engagement but continued supporting Ms. Graswald, Ms. Rice said. She believed her brother was close to ending the relationship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Rice also said that the family believes Ms. Graswald should have spent more time in prison, but ultimately, she supported the agreement because of the toll the case has taken. Still, it is not over: The family has sought to keep Ms. Graswald from receiving the life insurance money. (Ms. Graswald said the money, if she gets it, would pay for her legal expenses.)\n\n\u201cWe have to keep going through this,\u201d Ms. Rice said.\n\nMs. Graswald declined to say where she was living after her release. But she described her life as being in a \u201chibernating state.\u201d She goes to church and visits with friends, she said, and does little else. She is on parole and her immigration status is unclear, meaning she could be deported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of just living day by day for now,\u201d Ms. Graswald said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect.

But now we need to move away from the personal stories of survivors and take practical steps, steps toward prosecuting the Islamic State militants responsible for these crimes and toward reconstructing Yazidi areas in Iraq so that displaced Yazidis can begin to go back to their homes.\n\nMy lawyer, Amal Clooney, and Yazda, a global Yazidi rights organization, helped me to plead our cause at the United Nations and to put pressure on the Iraqi government and urge the international community to act. In September, the United Nations Security Council finally passed a resolution to establish an international investigation into these crimes. We hope this investigative team will be deployed soon and that it will carry out the long overdue inquiry into the crimes of the Islamic State, including by exhuming the 94 mass graves of the group\u2019s victims that have been found in Iraq.\n\nWe continue to collect evidence of the genocide and are working with prosecutors around the world to get more cases heard. The lawyers helping us are working pro bono and with few resources.\n\nThe conditions in the Yazidi areas of Iraq remain bleak. Land mines and homemade bombs planted by the Islamic State litter the region. An overwhelming majority of the buildings in the Sinjar area have been destroyed; basic services such as sanitation, electricity and water are lacking. Access to the area, which is controlled by Iraqi Kurdish forces, remains extremely difficult both for humanitarian organizations and for the Yazidis wishing to return.\n\nWe are very grateful to President Emmanuel Macron of France, who pledged to help demine the Sinjar region. And together with the French government, we are working on starting the Sinjar Action Fund, a trust fund to rebuild Sinjar. But we need more help. I call on governments, international organizations, private entities and individuals to contribute to the Sinjar Action Fund and help us return home and rebuild our lives.\n\nOne day, I want to marry and have children.

In Ohio, Mr. Cordray unveiled a more stringent gun violence platform last week amid criticism from Mr. Kucinich of his past relationship with the N.R.A.\n\nMr. Cordray said in an interview that the Parkland shooting had prompted a reassessment of existing policies even among people who back broader gun rights. He has called for greatly expanded background checks and said lawmakers should \u201crethink\u201d regulation of assault weapons, stopping short of demanding an outright ban. Mr. Cordray also cautioned that there are many voters in rural areas who \u201cfeel strongly about the Second Amendment and their right to have guns for hunting, for self-defense.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, Gwen Graham, whose primary political calling card has been her ability to win over Republican voters, wasted no time calling for new gun regulations after the Parkland shooting, including a suspension on sales of AR-15 rifles. But Ms. Graham, who previously represented a conservative stretch of the state\u2019s panhandle in Congress, will surely face scrutiny in her primary for making more pro-gun comments when she was a congressional candidate facing opposition from the N.R.A.\n\nEven before the Florida shooting, however, the ranks of staunchly N.R.A.-aligned Democrats had dwindled to the point of near-extinction. After the party\u2019s losses in the 2010 and 2014 elections, only a small group of Democrats from rural, solidly Republican areas remain in Congress. Of the five Senate Democrats who voted against a 2013 bill to expand background checks for gun purchasers, just one \u2014 Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 is still in office.", "title": "Parkland Massacre Thrusts Guns Into the Midterm Spotlight", "authors": []}

What I mean by that was that I got to have an extended policy discussion without once mentioning the name T****.\n\nAnyway, one of the issues that came up was the recovery in Europe, which is real and in some ways a bigger story for the world economy than the continuation of the Obama expansion here. An obvious question, which Anil raised, was whether this recovery calls for a reconsideration by Euroskeptics like myself. And my answer is no and yes: No, the economics of the euro look about as bad as we expected. Yes, we underestimated the political cohesion of the single currency, the willingness of political elites to suffer enormous economic pain in order to stay in the monetary union.\n\nI think I can illustrate all of these points with the case of Spain, which is in some ways at the heart of the euro story. During the good years money poured into Spain, fueling a huge housing bubble. This fed inflation that made Spanish industry uncompetitive, leading to a huge trade deficit. When the music stopped, Spain saw unemployment soar; it then went into a painful process of \u201cinternal devaluation,\u201d slowly squeezing down unit labor costs while costs in northern Europe gradually rose. And eventually this worked: Spain resumed fairly rapid growth, boosted by surging exports of autos and other manufactured goods.", "title": "Opinion | Paroling the Spanish Prisoner (Wonkish)", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "Tricky Clues\n\nNot only did I find a lot of theme answers difficult, there was also a lot of fiendish fill today that, to put it mildly, discouraged my powers of deduction. I\u2019m referring to, among others, ITLL DO, FT LEE, HOT MIC, IBOOK and IN B. Also of note:\n\n5A: Before you get your 21st-century guff up over this quote, the quotee is Oscar WILDE, and his relationship to women was definitely too complex for one tweet.\n\n53A: I took the clue (\u201cStick for breaking things\u201d) too seriously and the grid not seriously enough, and figured maybe we were supposed to squish \u201ccudgels\u201d in there but the answer is CUES, which \u201cbreak\u201d the racked-up balls to start every game in pool.\n\n61A: Mizzen rang a bell, and it does sound pretty nautical (part of either a ship or a loom, I always say, and people don\u2019t cry from the tops of looms). So I figured \u201cland ho\u201d was instant filler. Instead it\u2019s SAIL HO, the opposite and a puzzle debut. Just as the former means that land was in view, \u201cSail ho!\u201d means that someone else at sea is somewhere in sight. Shiver me timbers.\n\n99A: Two very early writing systems, Cretan hieroglyphics and LINEAR A, are still considered undeciphered \u201cmissing links\u201d to European language systems. There are profuse writings available from ruins in Crete, but no Rosetta Stone with known languages to compare Linear A to, and the wide array of symbols that make it up create a complex mystery. There are references to commerce, religion and possibly puns.\n\n118A: Looking for a \u201cTrix alternative\u201d had me thinking about cereals; what Mr. Ginsberg wanted was another feminizing suffix, ETTE. One of my favorite terms is from \u201cThe Crying of Lot 49,\u201d by Thomas Pynchon, when the protagonist Oedipa Maas becomes the executrix of the Inverarity estate and the whole thing spins out from there. What a word! And it\u2019s been in the puzzle, but just once.\n\n39D: \u201cWack\u201d is not the same as \u201cwhack,\u201d even though we\u2019re doing these homophonic puns today. We usually think of it as \u201cbad,\u201d as in one of the \u201980s seminal phrases, \u201cCrack is wack\u201d. But it also helps make a wackjob, and has also been occasionally clued to mean crazy, or NUTSO. Confusingly enough, so has whackjob, meaning both \u201cnut\u201d (in 2010) and \u201chit man\u2019s hit\u201d (in 2003).\n\n102D: I suppose that there are space fans who already knew this (and how could it really have been anything but TANG?) \u2014 but I was surprised to learn that Buzz Aldrin didn\u2019t like it and that he even said so, as it seems like such a minor thing to notice in zero gravity. It turns out this gripe is one Mr. Aldrin didn\u2019t mention until very recently and then just as an unfavorable comparison to delicious Red Bull (I kid).\n\nConstructor Notes (with bonus puns!)\n\nThis was such a fun puzzle to make; I hope it was as much fun to solve! Since everything is a word, Dr. Fill rips through it with no mistakes in a few seconds. Will was very kind to my clues this time, using the vast majority of them and, as always, I found some of his changes interesting. I had gone with the slightly edgier [Bridgegate locale] for 19D and with [Death of a telethon host?] for 35A. Not sure what people will think of those. Will also removed my slightly political [Company that recalled 18 million products after outsourcing production to China in 2002] for 40A. I had clued 9D as [Start of something big] and was sorry to see that changed. I never know where to clue fill as an abbreviation. So, for example, my clue for 100D involved a couple of actresses. 110D was [Am partner] and 106A was [Baby / pigeon commonality]. I\u2019d love to hear what people think of these changes and I\u2019ll hopefully learn something! Mostly, though, I had a great time finding the ever-so-painful puns and then subjecting everyone where I work to them. Hopefully all of you groaned as much as they did.

On May 21, 1985, Ms. Frustaci delivered four boys and three girls by cesarean section, about 12 weeks premature. Intense news coverage ensued, with many outlets calling the birth the largest in the United States, even though the seventh child, a girl named Christina, was stillborn.\n\nThe six surviving children all had heart problems, jaundice and hyaline membrane disease, a respiratory ailment. They were whisked into intensive care, where a team of neonatal doctors struggled to save them. One of the babies, a boy named David, died about three days after he was born.\n\nMs. Frustaci spent more than a week in the hospital recovering. She got to hold her surviving children in the neonatal intensive care unit before she left the hospital in early June.

Dr. Marik contended that Ms. Frustaci had been negligent in failing to obtain the ultrasound treatments he had recommended.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe suit was settled in 1990 for a one-time payment of $450,000 and a monthly care payment for each of the three surviving septuplets, who needed extensive physical therapy and medical treatment. The Frustacis\u2019 son Joseph said that the family still received the payments, and that the total amount paid so far had exceeded $1.5 million.\n\nThe difficulties of raising her family did not dissuade Ms. Frustaci from adding to it. In 1990, after undergoing further fertility treatments, she gave birth to healthy twins, Jordan and Jaclyn.\n\nShe was born Patricia Ann Jorgensen on Nov. 19, 1954, at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Her father, Richard, was in the Air Force and later ran an advertising agency; her mother, the former Bonnie Palfreyman, was a homemaker.\n\nMs. Frustaci received a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Brigham Young University in the mid-1970s and went on to earn a master\u2019s from California State University, Fullerton. She married Mr. Frustaci in 1981, and they soon tried to start a family.\n\nThe news media coverage of the septuplets opened the Frustacis to some criticism. \u201cOne baby is excellent,\u201d Dr. Heather Irwin, a gynecologist and fertility specialist, told The Miami Herald in late May 1985. \u201cTwo is acceptable. Anything more than twins is bad medicine.\u201d\n\nThe Frustacis felt compelled to defend themselves. \u201cBy no means did we set out to have twins or triplets or more than one child,\u201d Mr. Frustaci told The Times, adding, \u201cWe were not out to set any records.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Joseph Frustaci said that the media attention, and the criticism, had made it even harder for his mother to deal with the loss of her children.\n\n\u201cReally, all she wanted was to be a mother, and I think the media got in the way, for a time, of her being able to be a loving and nurturing mother,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ordeal took a toll on the family, and particularly on Ms. Frustaci, who had bipolar disorder. She and Mr. Frustaci, an industrial equipment salesman, were divorced in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn addition to her son Joseph, she is survived by her other children; her mother; three sisters, Julie Lindahl, Susan Ahlman and Joyce Wilson; three brothers, Richard, David and Scott; and five grandchildren.\n\nJoseph Frustaci said that even through the difficult years his mother \u201cwas really the strength of the family.\u201d All three of the surviving septuplets are doing well, he said.

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "And yet, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges, tight labor markets are only part of the solution. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns \u2014 and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don\u2019t carry the power they used to.\n\nA 1999 study by the economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University estimated how far the unemployment rate needed to decline to prevent wages from falling. From the mid-1970s to the late \u201980s, they found, an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent or lower would keep wages at the bottom tenth of the pay scale from declining. By the 1990s, however, unemployment had to dip to 5.7 percent to prevent wage losses at the bottom.\n\nJosh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute replicated the exercise for the economic expansion that ended with the demise of the housing bubble in 2007: Unemployment, he found, had to fall below 4.6 percent to keep workers in the bottom 10 percent from losing ground.\n\nAt this pace, unemployment will soon have to hit zero for workers at the bottom to get a raise.\n\nSo what else can be done? There is obviously a role for training and education to help workers meet employers\u2019 rising demand for skills, especially at the beginning of their career. Fatih Guvenen of the University of Minnesota notes that the income of 25-year-old men starting their careers has declined sharply since the early 1970s and is now about where it was in the late \u201950s.\n\nBut a strategy focused on education will not tip the balance. As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute points out, the list of remedies is long. It includes raising the minimum wage, increasing unionization, banning mandatory arbitration for employment claims, ending arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling, and ensuring that companies that subcontract their low-wage work remain in some way accountable for the workers.\n\nOr how about restoring competition to labor markets? Mr. Krueger and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago write that the government could stop companies from forcing low-pay workers to sign noncompete covenants, which bar them from better-paid jobs elsewhere. It should also ban no-poaching arrangements of dubious legality among franchisees of the same company, which also close off workers\u2019 options.\n\nOver the last 50 years, employers have been allowed to exercise ever more sway over their workers. The share of private-sector workers covered by unions has dwindled to a sliver. Businesses have grown to imposing heft. All along, executives and policymakers have sold this rebalancing of power as a boon for competitiveness, efficiency and economic growth.", "title": "Paychecks Are Getting Bigger.

According to the consumer agency, it has pursued more than 20 public enforcement actions against small-dollar lenders, many of which have resulted in large settlements.\n\nThe crackdown has had an effect. According to data from the Center for Financial Services Information, annual payday lending revenue dropped to $5.3 billion in 2017, from $9.2 billion in 2012. The number of payday loan stores dropped from a peak of 24,043 in 2007, to 16,480 in 2015, according to a recent report published by the consumer bureau.\n\nThe industry has long been a presence on Capitol Hill, but it spied an opening after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the Republican takeover of Congress. The industry pushed lawmakers to repeal the consumer bureau\u2019s 2017 payday lending rule by using the Congressional Review Act to essentially kill it. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has sponsored such a resolution, though its viability remains uncertain. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the payday lending lobby has also made its voice heard at the consumer bureau, flooding the agency with comments expressing opposition to the payday rule.\n\nAnd lenders have poured money into the coffers of influential Republican lawmakers. Lobbying donations peaked in 2012, when the bureau began to make payday lending a priority and have leveled off in the last year. Among the biggest recipients have been Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nIn December, Mr. Hensarling, who has long accused the consumer bureau of overreach, said that \u201cno unelected Washington bureaucrat\u201d should be able to stop Americans from taking out the short-term loan that they wanted.\n\nPayday lenders have also looked for inroads with the president. A lender based in Ohio, Community Choice Financial, was one of the first clients of Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s first campaign manager, who started a Washington consulting business last year. Over the summer, Mr. Lewandowski called on Mr. Trump in a television interview to fire Mr. Cordray.\n\nIn the spring, the industry will spend four days networking at the Trump National Doral Golf Club, which has event spaces like the Donald J. Trump Grand Ballroom and the Ivanka Trump Ballroom. Mr. Shaul said his group began looking at the Trump property as a potential site for its spring meeting well before the 2016 presidential election and ultimately chose it because it was cheaper than other East Coast resorts.", "title": "Payday Rules Relax on Trump\u2019s Watch After Lobbying by Lenders", "authors": []}

In September, that office was moved into the National Economic Council and placed under the purview of its director, Gary D. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs investor whose more conventional views on trade have contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Navarro.\n\nThe White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.\n\nWhite House trade policy has been rocked in recent weeks by the departure of Rob Porter, a former aide accused of domestic violence, who had organized regular meetings for the trade staff. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.\n\nAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt is unclear what new responsibilities Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion could bring, or whether the president could change his mind. But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.\n\nMr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nMr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.\n\nAs Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.\n\nMr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.\n\nFrom a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.\n\nIn the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.\n\nIn an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.", "title": "Peter Navarro, a Top Trade Skeptic, Is Ascendant", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

The outreach will also include support for education, housing preservation and minority business development.\n\nOne of the groups, the Mount Vernon Manor Community Development Corporation, expects to share $3.1 million of the total, said its executive director, Michael Thorpe.

The streak won\u2019t end any time soon.\n\nASTROS Houston teams don\u2019t win much \u2014 but when they do, they win big. When the Oilers won the first A.F.L. title, in 1960, they repeated the next year. The Rockets won the N.B.A. crown in 1994 and did it again the next June. The Comets of the W.N.B.A. captured four titles in a row from 1997 through 2000.

They\u2019ve made it back just once in eight seasons since Guerrero left \u2014 but this is their run, such as it is. With just three more seasons before Mike Trout becomes a free agent, they\u2019ve added Shohei Ohtani, Ian Kinsler, Zack Cozart and Justin Upton since August in an effort to make something of it.\n\nGIANTS It\u2019s easy to look at the Giants\u2019 roster and remember how great all those players once were. It\u2019s harder to predict how much they have left. Except for Joe Panik, all of their projected everyday players will be older than 30 by the end of April, including the newcomers Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutchen. Two of their top starters, Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija, and closer Mark Melancon are also over 30, and all struggled last season as the Giants staggered to 98 losses.

The team responded by sliding to 76-86 and has spent the winter adding complementary players like Randal Grichuk, Yangervis Solarte, Aledmys Diaz and Curtis Granderson. That\u2019s discouraging, but it underscores the trepidation of a front office that would probably love to rebuild, but it owes its fans an honest effort to win. The Blue Jays have a chance if their rotation is healthy \u2014 but only if they hit, and last year they scored only 693 runs, a 20-year low.\n\nMARINERS When the Buffalo Bills made the playoffs last month, it meant that Seattle took over the dubious title of the team with the longest postseason drought in the four major sports. The Mariners haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2001, and they\u2019ve been trying hard to get back since signing Robinson Cano in December 2013.

Now, with the help of software typically used by professors to nab cheating students, two writers have discovered an unpublished manuscript they believe the Bard of Avon consulted to write \u201cKing Lear,\u201d \u201cMacbeth,\u201d \u201cRichard III,\u201d \u201cHenry V\u201d and seven other plays.\n\nThe news has caused Shakespeareans to sit up and take notice.\n\n\u201cIf it proves to be what they say it is, it is a once-in-a-generation \u2014 or several generations \u2014 find,\u201d said Michael Witmore, director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington.\n\nThe findings were made by Dennis McCarthy and June Schlueter, who describe them in a book to be published next week by the academic press D. S. Brewer and the British Library. The authors are not suggesting that Shakespeare plagiarized but rather that he read and was inspired by a manuscript titled \u201cA Brief Discourse of Rebellion and Rebels,\u201d written in the late 1500s by George North, a minor figure in the court of Queen Elizabeth, who served as an ambassador to Sweden.", "title": "Plagiarism Software Unveils a New Source for 11 of Shakespeare\u2019s Plays", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "In the hours after last summer\u2019s white power rally in Charlottesville, Va., erupted into violence, the planners of the protest mounted a defense: While much of the country may have found their racist chants and Nazi iconography deplorable, they claimed that they had a First Amendment right to self-expression, and that none of the bloodshed was actually their fault.\n\nSix months later, that narrative of blamelessness, which started on the airwaves and the internet, is now being tested in the courthouse. In a direct assault on the so-called alt-right movement, a sprawling lawsuit contends that the leaders of the Charlottesville gathering engaged in a conspiracy to foster racial hatred, and are legally responsible for the 30 injuries and the death of a woman, Heather Heyer, that occurred.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing about this case that should be made crystal-clear at the outset,\u201d the suit maintains. \u201cThe violence in Charlottesville was no accident.\u201d\n\nThe case, known as Sines v. Kessler, was filed in October in Federal District Court in Charlottesville, and reached a crucial stage two weeks ago when the 15 individual defendants and the groups they represent finished filing motions to dismiss the case. In hundreds of pages of impassioned argument, the court submissions indicate that a bitter legal battle will soon be underway.", "title": "Planners of Deadly Charlottesville Rally Are Tested in Court", "authors": []}

Ms. Doe could not be reached for comment, and has not spoken about it to other news outlets. Her lawyer did not respond to messages Tuesday.\n\nProfessor Dauber said that, with Ms. Doe\u2019s support, she proposed placing a plaque at the site of the assault and that the university agreed to do so in September 2016.\n\nMs. Doe\u2019s lawyer, Professor Dauber and university officials discussed the potential engraving, Ms. Lapin said, but they could not agree on which quotation to use from Ms. Doe\u2019s statement.\n\nIt has been three years since Ms. Doe was sexually assaulted outside near a garbage collection structure by Brock Turner, a Stanford swimmer, on the school\u2019s campus in January 2015.\n\nMr. Turner was found guilty of three felony counts of sexual assault and served jail time for three months of his six-month sentence. He was released in September 2016. The sentence, far short of the maximum 14 years, spurred protests and calls for the judge in the case to be recalled. Professor Dauber, the chairwoman of a committee to recall the judge, has been central to that effort.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Gender Letter A weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.

After the school refused that quotation, it also refused her second choice, Professor Dauber said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the second quote that Emily provided to Stanford met all their criteria,\u201d Professor Dauber said. \u201cIt was not graphic in any way and emphasized the importance of using her own voice.\u201d\n\nProfessor Dauber said the quotation had been published in widespread news reports \u201cand had come in some ways to be emblematic of the entire victim impact statement.\u201d\n\nSome Stanford students are gathering signatures for a petition asking the university to install the plaque with Ms. Doe\u2019s preferred quotation.\n\nLast fall, the Dumpster area outside the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, near where Ms. Doe was assaulted, was replaced with a garden, two benches and a fountain (it can be seen in this photograph from The Stanford Daily in October).\n\nProfessor Dauber proposed the marker in part to remind students that \u201cthese events are happening just steps from the back door of their residence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reminds them that two students intervened but that many didn\u2019t even notice, perhaps prompting them to be more aware of what is happening around them.\u201d\n\nTwo Stanford graduate students, who were bicycling, saw the assault, according to court records. Mr. Turner fled. They tackled him and held him until the police arrived, court documents said.\n\nMs. Doe was unconscious at the time, she said in court, and said she learned what happened from news reports after waking up in the hospital.\n\nIn court, Ms. Doe described her anguish in the widely shared statement.\n\nStanford proposed three alternate quotations from Ms. Doe\u2019s statement that were \u201cconsistent with the purpose of the garden,\u201d Ms. Lapin said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey were:\n\nYou are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m O.K., everything\u2019s O.K., I\u2019m right here.\n\nBut, Ms. Lapin said, \u201cEmily Doe\u2019s lawyer did not accept any of the quotes proposed by the university, did not state a reason, and informed us that Emily Doe is no longer interested in a plaque.\u201d\n\nAs a back-and-forth ensued over the plaque last fall, Mr. Turner\u2019s lawyer was making plans to file an appeal. In December, his lawyer filed a 172-page brief arguing that Mr. Turner did not get a fair trial.\n\nConcerns about Mr. Turner\u2019s sentence led to a grass-roots effort to remove the judge, Aaron Persky of Santa Clara County. Last month the county registrar announced that a petition to remove the judge had qualified for the June ballot, after drawing more than 94,000 signatures. The county Board of Supervisors was expected to decide soon whether to put the recall on the ballot.", "title": "Plans at Stanford Fall Apart for a Plaque at Site of Sexual Assault", "authors": ["Christina Caron"]}

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "But when complexities arise, you can still find yourself fretting over Internal Revenue Service rules, as I did with the broken-pipe home-office deduction. The programs are like a global positioning system app on a smartphone \u2014 helpful but not perfect. Most of the time, the tax programs send you in the right direction, and if you know roughly where you\u2019re headed, you\u2019ll arrive much faster. If not, you can end up wandering hither and yon. And the Internal Revenue Code is scarier than a dark wood when you\u2019re lost in it.\n\nI\u2019ve been reviewing tax software since 2010. When I started, TurboTax had the slickest technology, Block gave the best tax guidance and TaxAct was a bargain. These days, TurboTax and Block are mostly interchangeable \u2014 at least they were for my household\u2019s return. They\u2019re easy to use and give access to ample help options. Both also disappointed me in surprising ways this year: A document upload didn\u2019t work with TurboTax, and a Block human helper failed to follow up. More on those problems below.\n\nTaxAct is still a bargain, the cheapest of the three. While it\u2019s a fine choice for a typical return, I find its technology a little less robust than that of TurboTax and Block. Another firm in this niche, TaxSlayer, is even cheaper \u2014 its top offering was $55 in February, compared with $59.95 for TaxAct Premium. Beyond the price, my tryout revealed no standout benefit; I couldn\u2019t see a reason to switch to it from the better-known outfits, if you\u2019re already satisfied.\n\nMore Toil This Year With TurboTax\n\nThis year, I opted to try TurboTax\u2019s most expensive online offering, TurboTax Live, which was $149.99 for a federal return in mid-February. Prices from each of the providers can change throughout the tax season, and, for many filers, each state return is typically about $37. (All three offer free filing for folks with simpler returns. And some banks and brokerage firms offer credits toward the purchase of the programs.)\n\nTurboTax Live gives access to human helpers while you\u2019re working on your return and a review by a tax expert before you file. If you skip the help, TurboTax\u2019s top-shelf online option for my situation is Self Employed, which cost $89.99 in February.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlmost as soon as I plunged into my return, TurboTax asked how I was feeling. The options I could click were \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t ask.\u201d I wanted to check \u201cI\u2019m not looking for therapy.\u201d (Note to TurboTax: Better options for next year might be \u201cethical,\u201d \u201cangst-ridden\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve already set up a tax shelter in Panama.\u201d)\n\nOne of my first substantive steps with the program was a stumble: I tried to upload a PDF copy of our previous-year return and failed. An error message said the file was either not a PDF or was corrupted. It was a PDF, and Block and TaxAct later pulled it in without problem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was a disappointment, as an upload fills in many of the entries on a return, saving time and toil. The problem might have been me. I\u2019m the sort of simpleton who remains mystified by the controls of our car\u2019s electronic displays, six months after my wife, Mary Ellen, bought it. I only recently figured out how to change the radio station.\n\nThe next step \u2014 electronic import of wages and investment income \u2014 worked as easily as ever. Mary Ellen\u2019s W-2 data and our investment information flowed right in. Just out of curiosity, I deleted the W-2 and tried to import it via a smartphone photo. That worked, too.\n\nI\u2019m self-employed and must file Schedule C, where I tote up my business income and expenses. Entering income is just a matter of typing in the information from 1099 forms. Expenses \u2014 and the deductions they provide \u2014 are where a tax-preparation program really helps.\n\nAs do Block and TaxAct, TurboTax asks lots of questions about the likely outlays of a wayfarer in the gig economy \u2014 insurance, equipment, supplies, business use of a car and a home office. The program makes clear that, under I.R.S. rules, a home office must be used exclusively for business. But what does that mean for my bathroom?\n\nTurboTax pointed out that, if you have a home office, a portion of repair and maintenance expenses can be allocated to it. My office accounts for 7 percent of the square footage of our house, which makes 7 percent of some expenses deductible.\n\nThat sounded straightforward. But then I started thinking. First, the bathroom isn\u2019t attached to my office. It\u2019s across another room. Second, it\u2019s not just for my business. I don\u2019t turn off the water at the end of the workday. After reading the guidance embedded in TurboTax, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, taxwise, about the frozen-pipe repair.\n\nI tried checking the I.R.S. website, but to my untutored eyes, the instructions seemed to have been written in Sanskrit, a language that, sadly, I can\u2019t read. I called TurboTax\u2019s help line and was connected to a person who identified himself as Anthony. (I didn\u2019t say that I was a reporter and didn\u2019t insist on his full name.)\n\nHe asked a few questions and, within five minutes, advised me I could deduct part of the repairs \u2014 7 percent of about $5,000, which comes to $350. Once I hung up, I found myself worrying \u2014 would the I.R.S. care that the bathroom isn\u2019t exclusively used for my business? Then again, doesn\u2019t an office have to have a bathroom?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI clicked through the rest of the return without trouble. I couldn\u2019t actually file it, but that wasn\u2019t TurboTax\u2019s fault \u2014 Mary Ellen and I hadn\u2019t received all of our tax documents. That also meant that I couldn\u2019t try the expert review.

Three years later, just after the Red Army had withdrawn and the Wehrmacht had invaded the town, Jedwabne\u2019s Jews, including Mr. Piekarz\u2019s parents, were murdered by their Polish neighbors. In 2000, the historian Jan Tomasz Gross published a book about the massacre; what followed was the most important debate on the Holocaust to take place in post-Communist Europe. Mr. Piekarz (by then Rabbi Baker) died in 2006. In 2013 Ms. Muller visited his daughter in New York; she gave Ms. Muller her father\u2019s letters, photographs and the passport with which he had left Poland in 1938.\n\nThe museum now has over 13,000 donated artifacts like Father Sklodowski\u2019s medallion and Rabbi Baker\u2019s passport.

At that time, the Polish historian Dariusz Stola protested against the abdication of responsibility: \u201cIf neither groups of nor individual Polish citizens had anything to do with these crimes, then why all the ado about the iniquities of the Communist regime?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter all, everything bad was done by some alien creatures, most likely Martians.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, the Polish courts declared the original law unconstitutional on technical grounds.

Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve accompanying my mother to the store, where she exchanged food stamps for the groceries our family needed. In those days, food stamps came in paper form, so she had to perform a ritual at the checkout counter, tearing each voucher from its booklet.\n\nThese days, electronic cards called E.B.T.s, which can be used like credit cards at checkout, eliminate the awkward process of fumbling with booklets. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less painful to be so poor that you need help paying for food. Being poor means getting shamed and criticized for each minor decision you make, both by politicians and your neighbors standing in line behind you at the grocery store.\n\nFederal guidelines already dictate what can and cannot be purchased with food stamps, yet poor people are subjected to endless commentary and condemnation from cable news pundits to Facebook friends over their grocery selections. Are they picking items with enough nutrition? Are they choosing products that are more expensive, or more enjoyable, than they deserve?\n\nAmericans of all income levels occasionally make food choices that aren\u2019t the healthiest or most economical, but it\u2019s the poor \u2014 who often have few other ways to indulge themselves and their children \u2014 who are judged most harshly when they do so.\n\nAs a result, poor people are constantly required to explain their circumstances, and justify their every choice. This is especially true for parents who must rely on social programs to feed their children. The proposed Harvest Box further reinforces the notion that low-income parents can\u2019t be trusted to determine what\u2019s best for their own children. The implication is that wiser authority figures should dictate what these families should and can eat.", "title": "Opinion | Poor People Deserve Better Than Food in a Box", "authors": []}

A New Orleans pianist and a Havana-born percussionist, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Martinez are two former prodigies who hail from opposite sides of the Gulf of Mexico. Both have high, enchanting singing voices, and each of them upholds a traditional style while drawing broad connections. Mr. Crawford inherited the robust piano acrobatics of Professor Longhair and Henry Butler, pulling it into contact with the broader American R&B tradition. Mr. Martinez built his musical backbone in Santeria ceremonies and Havana watering holes, and his svelte playing on the congas and the sacred bat\u00e1 drum has made him a sought-after side musician, as well as a bandleader of growing renown.\n\n212-475-8592, bluenote.net\n\nAMIR ELSAFFAR AND RIVERS OF SOUND at N.Y.U.

Mr. Hart is a slow burner with no particular interest in clean resolution, and he\u2019s long produced engrossing work as a bandleader who lives by those principles. In the past dozen years, he has led this esteemed quartet, performing his own dusky compositions and those of his younger band mates: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Cheeky, importunate and canny, Ms. Jordan\u2019s voice is one of the great standard-bearing instruments of midcentury jazz. Now 89 and a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, she still has that mix of sagacity and ingenuous charm that endeared her to discerning listeners in the 1960s.

{"date": "2018-02-25 00:00:00", "text": "The party\u2019s move comes as Mr. Xi has proclaimed an era of China\u2019s greatness, when the country, he says, will take what he sees as its rightful place as a top global power. Already, it is establishing military bases in the Western Pacific and Africa, building infrastructure across Asia, parts of Europe and Africa, and running what Mr. Xi hopes will be the world\u2019s No. 1 economy within two decades or sooner.\n\n\u201cChina feels it is on the road to great power status and they want to perpetuate the trajectory they are on,\u201d said David Finkelstein, director of China Studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.\n\nSome analysts outside China said they worried that allowing Mr. Xi one-man rule might worsen an increasingly tense relationship between the United States and China.\n\nAfter years of efforts by the United States to engage China on issues from market reform to climate change to human rights, the Trump administration turned on Beijing last December and called China a strategic competitor in its first national security document.\n\nWashington policy makers are preparing plans to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports, limit Chinese investments in the United States, particularly in technology, and spend more on the United States military to sustain its big advantage over the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nIn congressional testimony earlier this month, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, described China as \u201cnot just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump may well see Mr. Xi\u2019s consolidation of power as part of a global trend toward increasingly influential leaders, in which he might include himself along with Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader, said James Mann, the author of \u201cThe China Fantasy,\u201d which contradicted the popular view that increasing prosperity would lead to political liberalization in China.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing he will not deplore the lack of democracy in China, because that\u2019s the sort of thing he rarely if ever does,\u201d Mr. Mann said of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Mann also said Mr. Trump might not have much problem with what Mr. Xi had accomplished.\n\n\u201cOver the past 14 months in office, Trump has almost never voiced the sort of support for our constitutional system that has been a staple in the statements of past presidents,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cHe does not respect the dignity or integrity of political opponents. He does not express support for the independence of the courts or the freedom of the press.\u201d\n\nSo if anything, he said, \u201cI think Trump is probably jealous.\u201d\n\nFrom Clinton to Bush to Obama, the prevailing belief was engagement with China would make China more like the West.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead, as Mr. Mann predicted, China has gone in the opposite direction.\n\nShi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said Mr. Xi most likely did not care how the world would interpret his designation as a potential ruler in perpetuity.\n\nWith an unlimited term in office, Mr. Xi would almost certainly be in office beyond 2024, the year Mr. Trump would leave the White House if he won a second term.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And nationalists cheered the decision, describing Mr. Xi as a singular force who could restore the glory of the nation.\n\nBut as the news spread, readings of Hannah Arendt, who wrote about the evils of totalitarian rule, and passages from George Washington, who retired after two terms as president, were discussed on social media in Chinese legal circles.\n\nDouglas H. Paal, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the sudden move, before Mr. Xi even starts his second term next month, suggested that things were not \u201cnormal\u201d within the Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis looks like forced marching, not normal order, so something is going on,\u201d Mr. Paal said. \u201cXi is winning, but it will take sleuthing to find out what. These are not ordinary times.\u201d\n\nA series of visits by senior Chinese officials to Washington in the past month to try and persuade the Trump administration to slow down plans to introduce punitive measures that could result in a trade war had failed, Mr. Paal said.\n\n\u201cThis could get complicated when controversial U.S. initiatives meet unconventional times in China,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Xi is popular in many areas \u2014 his fans affectionately call him \u201cUncle Xi\u201d \u2014 and his brand of folksy nationalism wins accolades, especially in rural areas. Experts said Mr. Xi would probably benefit from the perception in China that the rest of the world is chaotic.\n\n\u201cWith a population amazed at the incompetent mess in much of the rest of the world, and intoxicated by nationalism, for Xi to effect this change will be seen as reasonable,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King\u2019s College, London.\n\nBut Mr. Xi\u2019s assumption of unfettered power may not work out the way he thinks, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and a former senior Australian defense official.\n\n\u201cThe risks to his personal fortunes are huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if the People\u2019s Liberation Army decides he should be cut loose?\u201d And, he added, \u201cWhat if growth slows more than expected?\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Xi comes under pressure at home or abroad, he could become unpredictable, and even dangerous, Mr. Jennings said. The reach for more personal power could be the start of his downfall.\n\n\u201cThe West can take no comfort in that because Xi\u2019s situation means he may take more risks in the South China Sea or over Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has nothing to lose and everything to gain by engaging in more Putin-like brinkmanship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, he added, \u201cWhere does one ever see the \u2018president for life\u2019 model end well?\u201d", "title": "President Xi\u2019s Strongman Rule Raises New Fears of Hostility and Repression", "authors": ["Jane Perlez", "Javier C.

A motion of no-confidence called by the Economic Freedom Fighters has been scheduled for a vote in Parliament on Feb. 22.\n\nThat, too, would put A.N.C. lawmakers critical of Mr. Zuma in a difficult situation. The party has helped Mr. Zuma survive previous opposition-led votes of no confidence. While many members of the governing party want Mr. Zuma to step down, some have said that they do not want the opposition to lead the effort.\n\nMr. Ramaphosa, who has been nudging Mr. Zuma to resign without deepening the party split, has said that Mr. Zuma should not be humiliated. His supporters say that reflects Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s skillful negotiating style and his view of the big picture.\n\nBut others interpret Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s attitude as a sign of weakness.

Asked to clarify, Mr. Probst noted that the U.S.O.C. was part of the Olympic system.\n\nMore than 260 athletes, several of them Olympic medalists, have accused Dr. Nassar, who has been sentenced to decades in prison, of abusing them, often in the guise of medical treatment.\n\nThe appearance of scores of the athletes at his sentencing hearings last month threw the Olympic committee into crisis as several publicly accused it of not doing enough to protect them.\n\nThrough his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Blackmun has been highly regarded and viewed as a stabilizing force in an organization previously troubled by chaotic leadership.

As a result, it said, Mr. Blackmun and the Olympic committee \u201ccreated the underlying conditions for sexual abuse to thrive by cutting athletes off from institutional support.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the reform group members is Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a three-time gold medalist in swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and a lawyer who said she was serving as an expert on sexual abuse on behalf of some gymnasts in civil litigation.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Hogshead-Makar said that Mr. Blackmun \u201callowed one of the country\u2019s largest youth-serving organizations to avoid basic child protection measures, such as prohibitions on adults being alone with children.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHe has instructed the U.S.O.C. to sit on the sidelines when athletes have been sexually abused.

The proposal lacks detail and will be complicated by an important debate about fee increases at national parks, but it deserves a close look from federal officials and conservationists.\n\nDespite this progress, the threats to migrations are still outpacing conservation. This is why leadership from the federal government, with its immense reach across hundreds of millions of acres, could be so important.\n\nBut gaps and questions linger. Many migrations cross Forest Service lands, which are administered by the Department of Agriculture and beyond the reach of Mr. Zinke\u2019s order. Most also cross private lands where funding is needed for conservation easements and incentives to accommodate wildlife. By joining with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Mr. Zinke could engage not only the Forest Service but also conservation programs authorized by the last farm bill that can be used to help ranchers and farmers conserve habitats of migratory herds.\n\nSecretaries Zinke and Perdue would need assistance from Congress, which controls the purse strings on farm bill conservation programs as well as the Land and Water Conservation Fund\u2014 another potentially crucial funding tool in the conservation of migrations.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Zinke\u2019s Interior Department has accelerated oil and gas leasing significantly in the past year, and some industry groups and Western stakeholders will push back on any new land protections whatsoever.

{"date": "2018-02-24 00:00:00", "text": "VARIETY PUZZLE \u2014 Puns and Anagrams are two ingredients in a cryptic puzzle, also called a \u201cBritish puzzle\u201d after its popularity in England (and much of Europe). They\u2019re pretty fiendish! Every clue has at least one form of trickery, you\u2019re rarely able to completely solve any clues with crosses, and the misdirections can be creative, frankly, to the point of mild lunacy. Tempting, right? If you\u2019re interested in getting into cryptic crosswords, today\u2019s variety is a great gateway drug. If the idea makes you shudder, you should try this puzzle by Sam Ezersky anyway; it draws from a different set of skills than a regular crossword puzzle, requires and rewards a sense of humor, and is very gratifying (and possible!) to solve.\n\nFirst of all, there are usually a ton of anagrams, which are the equivalent of multiple-choice questions on a very difficult exam, although they\u2019re not labeled such. The thing is, the answer is in front of you; you just need to scramble up some letters. A nice, approachable example of this would be 6D, \u201cSteals electric cars.\u201d One word, reordered, defines the rest of the clue; so S-T-E-A-L-S becomes TESLAS, \u201celectric cars.\u201d Other straightforward clues like this are 20A, 34A, 59A, 57D.\n\nThe next step, putting together longer words, or anagramming two words in a clue or an entry, appears at 10A, 17A, 32A, 38A, 10D, 14D, 31D and 44A, among others. 32A, for example, is a common crossword entry that reads pretty funny, but HELP COIN \u2014> PINOCHLE.\n\nSometimes the clue will scramble one name into another, which is a little tricky: 16A, Maori woman, for example, anagrams Maori to Moira. Have you seen Catherine O\u2019Hara as Moira Rose in \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d? Hilarious.\n\nThere are also clues with some misdirection \u2014 like numbers that need to be simply spelled out (1A) or converted to letter(s) by the Roman numeral system (1D). A couple don\u2019t use every last speck of a clue, which is permitted. 13D, for example, \u201cDepot near Las Vegas,\u201d leaves the Vegas out to solve to ARSENAL. A few clues have a side of pun with their anagram; don\u2019t be surprised to need to know a bit of both for a clue like 41D, where an \u201cex\u201d can become an X, or 45D, where \u201cwell-head\u201d tells you to use the \u201chead\u201d of the word \u201cwell\u201d in your answer \u2014 W.\n\nThat segues us into puns. Puns are infinite, one hopes, as language evolves and we grow (hopefully?) ever cleverer. I was completely delighted by Mr. Ezersky\u2019s punny jokes, and had to mumble and mull over several to get them. If it weren\u2019t for another accessible trait of Puns and Anagrams, their configuration as a standard crossword, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to solve them altogether. A few flavors included here were visual puns, like 64A: G W G, or a W in two Gs \u2014> WINGS; an original-looking fill-in-the-blanks thing at 33D and 49D : _ _ ds dec _ _ atio _ _? becomes \u201cadds decorations?\u201d \u2014> ADORNS, the missing letters; and \u201cgrammagrams,\u201d where you need to sound out letters to make words or vice versa, the most fiendish example here being 23D: \u201cSeaside, by the sound of it.\u201d That would be C side; or B and D \u2014 BEADY.\n\nWhat did you think?!", "title": "Puns and Anagrams", "authors": ["Caitlin Lovinger"]}

She has worked to persuade legislators and regulators in her state to embrace measures that would foster greater use of solar power.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cI didn\u2019t just put my head in the sand like an ostrich,\u201d Ms. Dooley said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: They had to come kicking and screaming.\u201d\n\nShe is also having a wider impact, taking on some of the nation\u2019s largest utilities.\n\nProponents of residential solar power like Ms. Dooley accuse utility companies and the energy industry at large of waging war on efforts to free consumers from their power companies, even if only for a slightly lower electric bill.\n\nFor the utilities, which are facing flat or declining consumption, residential solar power threatens the bottom line. They have responded by spending tens of millions of dollars to combat consumers\u2019 efforts to untether themselves from the electric grid.\n\nA new study by the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research on efforts to influence corporate boards, found that utilities had spent $50 million between 2011 and 2016 to block clean energy in seven states: Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite calling itself the Sunshine State, Florida lags behind states like New York and New Jersey in residential solar installations. But a 2016 campaign resulted in overwhelming voter approval of a constitutional amendment to provide a property tax exemption for solar installations. In a referendum months later, voters rejected a utility-backed measure, presented as pro-solar, that would have actually allowed new fees on home solar users.\n\nDifferent Directions on Solar Energy Republican-leaning states lag in residential solar capacity, though some of those states are among the leaders in large solar-power projects by utility companies.

Ms. Dooley worked to counter their efforts, standing with environmentalists and business groups and helping win support from the Christian Coalition and self-identified libertarians.\n\nHer side prevailed. And aided by the property-tax break and lower solar-panel prices, Florida more than doubled the number of residential solar projects in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.\n\nClean-energy proponents are determined to build on such successes. According to research by the University of California, Irvine, the California Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institution for Science, 80 percent of the nation\u2019s power needs can be met by solar and wind.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Still, red states \u2014 particularly in the South \u2014 have been resistant to residential solar power, a review of data from the solar industry organization has found. If they support solar power at all, their utilities tend to want to produce it themselves.\n\nOf the 10 states with the most residential solar power, eight voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Of the 10 with the most solar capacity at utility scale, six voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nRandy Wheeless, a spokesman for Duke Energy, insists that utilities are embracing cleaner technologies, noting that a decision by the company to forgo building a nuclear plant in Florida included plans for new solar farms. He said Duke was one of the few utilities in the country to file comments opposing the solar-panel tariff.\n\nMr. Wheeless also said Duke had recently been adding 300 residential solar customers in Florida each month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Lauren McDonald Jr., a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission who led efforts to bring more solar to his state, said the utilities simply didn\u2019t want to depart from the business model they had operated under for a century, despite the changing world of energy.\n\n\u201cTheir business is to generate electricity, transport it and to sell it,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cAnything that might come into play that might derail that agenda, they don\u2019t give up easily.\u201d\n\nNeither, it seems, does Ms. Dooley.\n\nWhen she talks about clean energy and climate change, she clutches her cellphone and pulls up a picture of her grandson, Ayden Sides.\n\n\u201cI fully believe we should be good stewards of what God gave us,\u201d Ms. Dooley said.", "title": "A Gun-Owning Trump Fan\u2019s New Crusade: Clean Energy", "authors": ["Ivan Penn"]}
