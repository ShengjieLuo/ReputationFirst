I stand at the edge of the yard and watch my mother\u2019s house reduced to rubble.\n\nIt stood directly across the street from mine \u2014 I could see it from the window of my home office \u2014 but I almost missed the demolition.

The original houses were small brick rectangles, less lovely than a double-wide mobile home. Built after World War II for working-class servicemen buying on the G.I. Bill, each house followed one of two simple floor plans, with small variations \u2014 a covered stoop on some, a gable on others \u2014 to make them distinguishable from one another.\n\nWhen my husband and I moved here in 1995, we had a small son and a baby on the way. Back then, there were only a handful of young families on this block. Most of the houses were occupied by the original postwar owners aging in place or by couples buying starter homes.

{"date": "2018-03-03 00:00:00", "text": "Egypt has previously denied being the intended recipient of the weapons, or breaching international sanctions. In response to questions about the United Nations finding, the State Information Service said this past week: \u201cThe relevant Egyptian authorities have undertaken all the necessary measures in relation to the North Korean ship in full transparency and under the supervision\u201d of United Nations officials.\n\nAfter the Trump administration slashed aid last summer, Egyptian officials said they were cutting military ties to North Korea, reducing the size of its Cairo embassy and monitoring the activities of North Korean diplomats. The relationship with North Korea is \u201climited to representation, and there is almost no existing economic or other areas of cooperation,\u201d Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said at a news conference with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in Cairo last month.\n\nBut that diplomatic representation, in an embassy that doubles as a regional arms dealership, is the problem, American officials have said. In addition, Washington worries that North Korea, a longtime supplier of ballistic missile technology to Egypt, is still supplying missile parts, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBallistic missile customers are the most concerning of North Korea\u2019s partners and deserve the highest attention,\u201d she said. \u201cEgypt is one of those.\u201d\n\nThe Embassy\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s largest embassy in the Middle East, an elegant, three-story Victorian building with a rusty brass plate over the entrance, sits on a leafy street on an island in the Nile. The embassy walls display photos of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, standing in a garden or strolling through a fish market. Its windows are usually shuttered, and security guards discourage passers-by from taking photos.\n\nLike those of many North Korean outposts, the duties of the Cairo embassy extend well beyond diplomacy.\n\nIn Africa especially, North Korean diplomats have engaged in a wide variety of ruses and schemes to earn hard currency, United Nations investigators say. In South Africa and Mozambique, North Korean diplomats have been implicated in rhino poaching. In Namibia, North Koreans built giant statues and a munitions factory. In Angola, they trained the presidential guard in martial arts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Egypt, their business is weapons. United Nations inspectors and North Korean defectors say the Cairo embassy has become a bustling arms bazaar for covert sales of North Korean missiles and cut-price Soviet-era military hardware across a band of North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nShielded by diplomatic cover and front companies, North Korean officials have traveled to Sudan, which was then subject to an international trade embargo, to sell satellite-guided missiles, according to records obtained by the United Nations. Others flew to Syria, where North Korea has supplied items that could be used in the production of chemical weapons.\n\nInside the embassy, arms dealing goes right to the top. In November 2016, the United States and the United Nations sanctioned the ambassador, Pak Chun-il, describing him as an agent of North Korea\u2019s largest arms company, the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation.\n\nAt least five other North Korean officials based in Egypt, employed by state security or various arms fronts, have been sanctioned. One of them, Kim Song-chol, traveled to Khartoum in 2013 as part of a $6.8 million deal for the sale of 180 missiles and missile parts to Sudan.\n\nAccording to this year\u2019s sanctions report, Mr. Kim and another sanctioned official based in Cairo, Son Jong-hyok, continue to deal with Sudan\u2019s state-controlled Military Industrial Corporation.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAn arms dealer with a diplomatic passport is still an arms dealer,\u201d Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council in 2016.\n\nThe Ship\n\nFor weeks in the summer of 2016, American intelligence had covertly tracked the Jie Shun, the ship filled with rocket-propelled grenades that has become a focus of Cairo\u2019s ties to North Korea. As it neared the Suez Canal in August, according to a Western diplomat familiar with the case, the Americans warned the Egyptians it might be carrying contraband, effectively forcing them to intervene.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Americans wanted to send officials to inspect the dilapidated freighter and its illicit cargo. North Korea sent a diplomat to negotiate its release.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Egyptians refused both demands, but in November 2016 agreed to allow United Nations inspectors to board the ship. But by then, valuable information about the identity of the customer for the rockets, which had been hidden under mounds of iron ore, was missing. The North Korean crew had been sent home, which meant the inspectors could not interview them.\n\nBut one piece of evidence remained, in the form of a name stenciled on the rocket crates: \u201cAl Sakr Factory for Developed Industries (AOI),\u201d Egypt\u2019s principal missile research and development company and a subsidiary of its sprawling state weapons conglomerate, the Arab Organization for Industrialization.\n\nMohamed Abdulrahman, the chairman of Al Sakr, did not respond to emailed questions about the shipment. In its statement, Egypt\u2019s State Information Service said the measures taken by the country were \u201cpraised\u201d by the United Nations\u2019 sanctions committee, \u201cwhich reiterated that the way Egypt dealt with this case is a model to be followed in similar situations.\u201d\n\nSecret Missile Cooperation\n\nThe Jie Shun shipment was a glaring example of how cash-starved North Korea has helped finance its nuclear program by hawking stocks of cheap, Soviet-era weapons to countries that developed a reliance on those systems during the Cold War, American officials and analysts say.\n\nBut it also pointed to an established smuggling route and an entrenched military-to-military trading relationship that American officials say has long been a conduit for ballistic missile technology.\n\nPhoto\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Cairo and Pyongyang collaborated to extend the range and accuracy of Soviet Scud missiles, said Owen Sirrs, a former agent with the Defense Intelligence Agency. In the late 1990s, American officials worried that Egypt was trying to buy North Korea\u2019s Nodong missile system, which has a range of about 800 miles.\n\n\u201cWe were sending d\u00e9marches to the Egyptians to say, \u2018Knock it off \u2014 we\u2019re sending you hundreds of F-16s, and you don\u2019t need that North Korean crap,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sirrs, who was based in Cairo at the time and now lectures at the University of Montana.\n\nIt is unclear if Egypt ever acquired the Nodong missiles. Although Cairo has spent billions on high-profile military purchases in recent years, including Russian fighter jets, French aircraft carriers and German submarines, it has been notably cagey about its offensive missile capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2013, a shipment of spare parts for Scud-B missiles, which have a shorter range than the Nodong, was intercepted in transit as it was shipped by air from the North Korean Embassy in Beijing to a military-controlled company in Cairo. The missile components had been labeled parts for fish-processing machinery.\n\nEgypt denied that the military company had ordered the Scud parts.\n\nSuch missiles could strike Israel from deep inside Egyptian territory. They could also reach Ethiopia, with which Egypt has a simmering dispute over a new dam on the Nile.\n\nThe Politics of Sanctions Evasion\n\nThe Trump administration has scored some successes in its drive to isolate North Korea from its allies, notably with the Philippines and Singapore last fall. But Egypt, which receives $1.3 billion annually in American aid, has resisted Mr. Trump\u2019s entreaties.\n\nEgypt\u2019s relationship with North Korea runs deep. President Hosni Mubarak was regularly feted in Pyongyang before his ouster in 2011. An Egyptian tycoon, Naguib Sawiris, built North Korea\u2019s main cellphone network and invested in a bank there. Along with the AK-47 monument on the Suez Canal, North Korea built a large war museum in Cairo that is frequently visited by Egyptian schoolchildren.\n\nEgypt\u2019s military leaders are reluctant to cut those ties and lose access to Soviet-era weapons and ballistic missile systems, analysts say, a posture bolstered by their reflexive distaste for appearing to bow to American pressure. They may feel that, based on past experience, American criticism will eventually abate.\n\n\u201cThey think they can evade the consequences,\u201d said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy, who until last year worked on Egypt at the State Department. \u201cThat they are continuing to stonewall and obfuscate and pursue this course of action indicates they think they can get away with it, and whatever price will be imposed on them will be bearable.\u201d\n\nAt the North Korean Embassy in Cairo, now under a new ambassador, business continues as usual. North Korean state media has said little about the ambassador, Ma Tong-hui, other than to note that his previous post was as head of a little-known government body in Pyongyang called the Disarmament and Peace Institute.", "title": "Need a North Korean Missile?

Mr. Trump is dealing with the special counsel\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election; Mr. Netanyahu faces allegations by the Israeli police that he committed bribery, fraud and breach of trust in his dealings with wealthy businessmen and newspaper publishers.\n\nMr. Trump, unlike Mr. Netanyahu, has not been personally accused of wrongdoing.

Yet American military officials have said that, so far, countering Iran is not part of their mission in Syria.\n\nPhoto\n\nMich\u00e8le Flournoy, a former under secretary for policy at the United States Defense Department, said Mr. Netanyahu needed above all else to get the Trump administration to focus, in talks over ending the Syria war, on Iran\u2019s moves there and the risk of a broader regional conflict embroiling Israel.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is not quite missing in action in the negotiations, but it\u2019s certainly not carrying a lot of water at this point,\u201d Ms. Flournoy said. \u201cAnd it needs to be carrying a lot of water on this, not just for our own interests but for Israel \u2014 because Israel doesn\u2019t have a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu is likely to resume his critique of the Iran nuclear deal in his meeting with Mr. Trump, Ms. Flournoy said.

Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, has yet to decide whether to issue an indictment, pending a hearing with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers, a process that can take months.\n\nMr. Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Sunday for meetings with Mr. Trump on Monday and to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, on Tuesday.

Former confidants are lining up to testify against him and his wife. A criminal prosecution seems only a matter of when, not if. And the Israeli media is already treating him like an indicted man walking.\n\nThere were the little jokes: Asked if Mr. Trump had given Mr. Netanyahu his bright red tie, the Israeli leader observed, \u201cThat could be investigated too, so I won\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nThere were the on-record demurrals, and the off-record defensiveness.

Whatever.\u201d\n\nAnd in English, Mr. Netanyahu trumpeted Israel\u2019s and, by implication, his achievements: Establishing diplomatic relations and reaching trade deals across the globe, saving the lives of other nations\u2019 innocents through peerless intelligence collection, and using drones and computers to fine-tune agricultural irrigation down to the individual plant.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And when I opened Eowyn Ivey\u2019s first novel, THE SNOW CHILD, I was completely transported, both narratively and geographically. Set in Alaska in the 1920s amid the homesteaders who eked out a hard living in the short summers to survive the long winters, the story flickers between realism and the possibility of the supernatural. Mabel and Jack have arrived in Alaska on the run from their past and the loss of a stillborn child. The novel revolves around the appearance of a girl who seems to survive on her own in the woods, withstanding the winters, wild animals and loneliness. Their relationship with her, with each other and with the unbelieving neighbors pulls you into a world that for all its strangeness is rendered so realistically \u2014 the washing of dishes, the stacking of firewood, the difficulty of plowing during mud season \u2014 that you trust Ivey\u2019s voice. Much like Halldor Laxness\u2019s \u2018Independent People\u2019 the book conjures a mountainous, wintry place where geography exerts a powerful pull on anyone who dares to try to call it home.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alissa J.

Not until I moved to London last fall did I understand how much residual loathing exists for her. In her 2011 biography, THAT WOMAN, Anne Sebba makes a sporting attempt to vindicate Simpson in the eyes of her countrymen. Quoting from Simpson\u2019s letters, Sebba suggests that she tried to squirm out of her relationship with King Edward VIII, whom she viewed with a sort of maternal pity, but he was so infatuated that she could only watch as he hurtled toward his abdication in 1936. The trauma of the abdication did, Sebba argues, challenge Britons to accept a new principle: that members of the royal family had the right to pursue their own personal happiness, even when it meant breaking with tradition. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s family has made good use of that principle: Three of her four children, including the future king, are divorced.

Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.\n\nThe critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.\n\n\u201cThis could end up being the free speech issue of our time,\u201d said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. \u201cThe Silicon Valley elites are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t care what you want to see \u2014 we know what you should see.

In city after city, this has led to huge increases in traffic congestion, increased carbon emissions and the undermining of public transportation.\n\nMost customers who love Uber don\u2019t realize that the company subsidizes the cost of many rides. This is likely a major factor in Uber\u2019s annual losses surging from 2.8 billion in 2016 to $4.5 billion in 2017. This seemingly nonsensical approach is actually Uber\u2019s effort to use its deep pockets to mount a predatory price war and shut out the competition.

Our great epiphanies might feel like celestial gifts, but in reality they tend to arrive at 2:14 on gray Thursdays while plastic bags flutter in the trees and drawers we thought we had fixed suddenly scrape and stick again.\n\nPart of the job of a good historian is to return celebrated moments of kairos \u2014 the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Michael Jackson\u2019s first moonwalk \u2014 back to the chronos from which they sprang.\n\nIn a new book, Ryan H. Walsh finds a way to do this with one of the most kairos-soaked artworks of the 20th century. Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cAstral Weeks\u201d sounds less a rock album than a mystical folk cloud, formless and eternal, pulsating on the edge of the Big Bang.

One of Morrison\u2019s session musicians, the jazz guitarist Jay Berliner, came to the artsy improvisations of \u201cAstral Weeks\u201d directly from working on jingles for Noxzema and Pringles.

Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nImage\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nImage\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

In today\u2019s New York, gentrification has pitted partygoers against the settled residents of neighborhoods like the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. In her first official act, Ms. Palitz promised to hold a series of listening tours and entertain the gripes of those who are bothered by the vomit on their streets or the noise at 3 a.m.\n\n\u201cBoth sides feel unheard,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth sides feel that things are unfair. I think the grievances are almost the same but there haven\u2019t been any practical real-world solutions to address them.\u201d\n\nAs a fifth-generation New Yorker, Ms. Palitz, 47, claims to be of a broad enough mind to discern those solutions and to ably serve as advocate for the after-hours set while remaining responsive to community concerns. Though she was raised on 86th Street on the Upper East Side, she moved to the East Village in 1996 and has lived there ever since \u2014 on three of the four different corners at First Street and First Avenue. In her early 20s, she took her first night life job, managing the guest list at the old Club Mars. Soon she was producing the \u201cSoulution Spontaneous Groove Open Jam\u201d \u2014 a night of hip-hop, spoken word, gospel, rock and drag \u2014 at clubs like Nation, SOB\u2019s and the Tunnel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the early 2000s, a friend from grade school asked Ms. Palitz to invest in a bar near her apartment called The Flat. (It was briefly famous as a rendezvous that the actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher used for their romance.) But in 2004, The Flat went under and Ms. Palitz took it over. She turned it into Sutra, which for the next 10 years until it closed, was known for Toca Tuesdays, an old-school hip-hop party overseen by the D.J. Tony Touch.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

There, she was introduced to the brass-knuckle politics of night life \u2014 chiefly through her dealings with what she has called the \u201cno-more bar contingency.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in 2012, Ms. Palitz told The Daily News that the area was \u201cripe for the picking\u201d by high-end nightclub entrepreneurs \u2014 a remark that did not endear her to local residents and bloggers. Though she later claimed she was misquoted, the comment triggered a firestorm and some in the neighborhood called for her removal from the board.\n\nNow in charge of a mayoral office with a 12-person advisory board, a $300,000 budget and a salary of $130,000 a year, Ms. Palitz seems to have realized that even a doyenne of New York night life must make a few concessions when joining city government. On her Tuesday evening drink, she was accompanied, for instance, by a minder from City Hall. While she admits that there were times in her career when she personified \u201cwhat the no-bar movement rejected,\u201d she also claimed that she has always tried \u201cto find solutions that work for everyone.\u201d\n\nAmong those who will be watching her as she begins her job is Rafael Espinal, the Brooklyn city councilman who sponsored the law that created the position. Mr. Espinal, whose district includes the night life neighborhood of Bushwick, said he was excited by Ms. Palitz\u2019s appointment, but hoped that she would not be too Manhattan-centric.\n\n\u201cI would love it if she were sensitive to the D.I.Y. underground in Brooklyn too,\u201d Mr. Espinal said. \u201cThat\u2019s the scene that has set the trend for years and has made things in the city so interesting.\u201d\n\nMs. Palitz acknowledged that the scene had changed from her day in the mix and that the once-cool clubs of the Meatpacking District had moved to Queens and Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t crush culture \u2014 or subculture \u2014 in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just goes deeper and longer.

They are less likely to test on grade level or to graduate, and they are more likely to drop out. Some of this stems from the fact that they are simply not in school in enough to keep up. They also tend to move around frequently, bumping from one temporary spot to another, so it is common for them to attend at least two schools in one academic year.\n\nThe education department has rules and employees in place, both in schools and in shelters, to try to minimize student absences. But the comptroller\u2019s office found that in many cases, protocols just weren\u2019t followed, seemingly because those charged with trying to keep children in schools were overwhelmed. During the 2015-16 school year, there were 110 family-assistance workers responsible for helping the 32,243 students in city shelters \u2014 giving them an average caseload of 293 children each.\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s office said that the education department should make a number of changes, including conducting a study of caseloads and making sure that schools follow existing regulations. The second report released on Thursday went further.\n\nThat paper, released by Advocates for Children of New York and the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York, called on Mr. de Blasio to hire more trained social workers to work in shelters \u2014 family assistants need neither a college degree nor any formal training in social work or education, the paper said.

But in a statement this month, the leaders of the bank\u2019s search committee said they had solicited comment from a variety of groups and had interviewed a range of candidates.\n\nIn recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices.

The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.\n\nIn early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers\u2019 interests. Standing outside the Fed\u2019s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could \u201cmake history\u201d by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.\n\n\u201cThe New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,\u201d Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.\n\nMr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects.

Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York.

This means that they are less guilty than adults and that their punishment must be different, especially in the case of life sentences for those convicted of murder. The \u201cimposition of a state\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children,\u201d the court said in 2012. They must be given \u201ca meaningful opportunity\u201d to get out; actual life sentences should be reserved for those few who exhibit \u201cirretrievable depravity.\u201d\n\nWhile those rulings have struck down the most severe sentences for juveniles \u2014 the death penalty and mandatory life without parole \u2014 the New York appeals court rightly extended their logic to cases in which parole is technically available but is rarely or never granted. \u201cA parole board is no more entitled to subject an offender to the penalty of life in prison in contravention of this rule than is a legislature or a sentencing court,\u201d the state court said.\n\nThat\u2019s right, of course, but it should go further. Parole officials should, as a rule, expect to release juvenile offenders who have served their minimum sentences. If the board has evidence that an inmate continues to pose a threat to the public, it\u2019s reasonable to keep him or her locked up, but the inmate should still get future chances to show that he or she is ready to return to society.\n\nIn response to the state court\u2019s ruling, New York\u2019s Parole Board said last summer that it would start considering an inmates\u2019 youth when deciding whether to release that inmate, but it still regularly rejects people like Mr. Flores, whom no one would describe as \u201cirretrievably depraved.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Flores filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the Parole Board, claiming that its knee-jerk denials of applications by inmates like him violate the Constitution. New York holds roughly 630 prisoners on indeterminate life sentences for crimes they committed before they turned 18.\n\nNew York\u2019s Parole Board has long resisted modern understandings of crime and punishment, but the failure to treat juveniles as a unique category of offender exists nationwide. A 2016 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that in just 12 states, more than 8,300 inmates were serving sentences of effective life \u2014 meaning 40 years or more \u2014 for crimes they had committed as juveniles. In Florida in 2015, 366 people were serving juvenile life sentences. Two were granted parole.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "Republican consultants argue that Ms. Nixon\u2019s entry into the race will help their party\u2019s candidates in several ways, pushing Mr. Cuomo to the left \u2014 he\u2019s considered a centrist by most political observers, and dismissed as one by Ms. Nixon \u2014 as well as scuffing him up on a variety of issues, including his handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nMr. Cuomo will have to spend money, they argue, dipping into a formidable $30 million war chest. And Ms. Nixon has already signaled that she will use the age-old Albany issue of corruption \u2014 including the recent conviction of Joseph Percoco, formerly one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s closest aides and friends \u2014 to batter his stewardship of state government.\n\nThere\u2019s also, they say, an even more tantalizing possibility.\n\n\u201cEither he\u2019ll come out battered,\u201d said William F. B. O\u2019Reilly, an adviser for Mr. DeFrancisco\u2019s campaign, \u201cor she\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans would no doubt welcome a Nixon victory; the party currently has two declared candidates, an understated candidate who may well be the front-runner, and a renegade running as an independent who wants to legalize marijuana.\n\nMr. DeFrancisco\u2019s principal opponent at this point is Marcus J. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who has been quietly amassing \u2014 and then loudly publicizing \u2014 endorsements from a variety of county chairmen and other political groups around the state. He has made no secret of his intention to run for governor, and is positioning himself as a youthful, energetic alternative to Mr. Cuomo (and Mr. DeFrancisco, for that matter).\n\n\u201cI am deeply humbled by the challenge,\u201d he said, in a March 14 email saying he would run. \u201cBut my determination is driven by the need.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe only thing he has not done is actually formally kick off his campaign, preferring to largely wage the race thus far through news releases and closed-door meetings with Republican decision makers. Nonetheless, Mr. Molinaro, 42, has assumed the posture of the prohibitive favorite, going so far as to issue another email in mid-March announcing he had secured the endorsements of 50 percent of the necessary delegates to secure the nomination when the party meets later this spring.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Molinaro is to formally begin his campaign on April 2, likely in Tivoli, N.Y., where, in 1995, he became the youngest mayor in the United States at 19, according to his old Dutchess County campaign website.\n\nBut the DeFrancisco camp notes that they have a far more substantial bankroll at this point \u2014 some $1.5 million \u2014 and a willingness to stay in the race until the convention. They also have questioned their opponent\u2019s strategy of rolling out electronic endorsements, and have said they will \u201ckeep their powder dry,\u201d and their costs down, until Mr. Molinaro starts to fight for the nomination in person.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

O\u2019Brien Murray, a Republican consultant, predicted that Ms. Nixon \u201cwould distract Andrew Cuomo and makes him spend resources of time and money on the race.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s supporters dismiss the notion that Ms. Nixon could do damage to Mr. Cuomo, citing a raft of progressive accomplishments, including raising the minimum wage, a paid family leave program and the legalization of same-sex marriage. They also point out that Republicans had high hopes that a previous, and surprisingly strong, primary challenge \u2014 from a little-known law professor, Zephyr Teachout, in 2014 \u2014 would also weaken Mr. Cuomo. But he handily won re-election that year over Rob Astorino.\n\nThe governor\u2019s campaign seemingly is not paying Ms. Nixon, or potential Republican candidates, any mind.\n\n\u201cWhile Trump and Washington Republicans threaten to divide this country and take us backwards, Governor Cuomo\u2019s sole focus this year is on turning red districts blue to help win back the House and elect more Democrats to the State Senate,\u201d said Austin Shafran, a campaign spokesman.\n\nThe recent optimism in Republican ranks comes after several months of gloomy developments, beginning in November when Mr. Astorino, the party\u2019s 2014 nominee, lost his bid for re-election as Westchester County executive and promptly announced that he would not run against Mr. Cuomo again, disappointing party leaders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, another putative candidate, the millionaire Harry Wilson, also demurred. Mr. DeFrancisco entered the race in late January, but Assemblyman Brian Kolb, an upstate Republican who serves as minority leader, dropped out.\n\nAnother candidate, Joel Giambra, the former Erie County executive, bolted the Republican primary process to run as an independent, and now wants to legalize cannabis to help pay for state programs. Joseph Holland, a former housing official under Mr. Pataki, also is vying for the bid, though he is little known.\n\nStill, nothing has seemingly excited the G.O.P. more than Ms. Nixon\u2019s entrance.\n\n\u201cThe race for governor is going Hollywood,\u201d Mr. Molinaro\u2019s campaign said on Monday, shortly after Ms. Nixon announced her plans to run. \u201cAnd our chances to win in November just got a whole lot better.\u201d", "title": "New York G.O.P.\u2019s Hopes Are Raised by Nixon.

After the 2010 census, which the city challenged because it claimed that 50,000 residents were not counted, New York forfeited two seats, in part because of a loss of population upstate.

In 2015, the state paid $545,000 to settle harassment claims related to a former assemblyman from Brooklyn, Vito Lopez.\n\nThe bill also does not address longstanding criticisms of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, a committee made up in large part by members appointed by the governor. The group is investigating several high-profile harassment claims but has often been called toothless. Mr. Cuomo had suggested creating a new arm within the commission specifically to investigate harassment complaints, but Ms. Young said on Friday that it was unclear where that proposal stood, or if there would be money available to pay for it.\n\nMs. Young conceded that the wording of the new policies would not necessarily cover other forms of gender-based harassment, such as inappropriate comments. But she defended the need for a flexible definition of harassment, citing how quickly understandings of acceptable behavior have evolved in recent months in the wake of the #MeToo movement.\n\nA stricter sexual harassment policy was one of just a few policy issues to be included in the budget talks.

But he added that, based on 29 years of working on and running transit systems, \u201cYou need to look at the long-term game.\u201d\n\nMr. Byford pointed out that subway performance improved in February, though it has struggled again in March with back-to-back storms. Although on-time arrival statistics for February are not yet available, there were 56 major incidents that disrupted weekday service that month, compared with 105 incidents in January.\n\nMr. Byford also said he would review longtime safety regulations that restrict the speed of trains when they are approaching signals with timers, which some transit advocates have said may be unnecessary in some cases and slow down the system too much.\n\nEven before the latest problems, the New York City subway system had one of the worst records for on-time performance among the nation\u2019s cities, though it is by far the biggest system. For instance, in January, on-time performance was 85.7 percent for Washington\u2019s Metro system, 95 percent for Chicago\u2019s L-train system and 96.7 percent for Atlanta\u2019s Marta rail system.\n\nGov.

Of those, 27,249 were the result of overcrowding or insufficient capacity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, there were 18,931 delayed weekend trains, up from 14,182 the year before.\n\nBlaming overcrowding for delays has become contentious after an investigation by The New York Times in December found that officials had been citing that to mask delays caused by breakdowns or signal problems that forced people onto fewer trains. Mr. Byford has acknowledged that overcrowding is not a meaningful measurement and that officials need to provide more specific information.\n\nM.T.A. officials said that January was particularly hard on the subway system because of a two-day snowstorm early in the month that blanketed the city, and extreme swings in temperature from cold to warm during the month that caused snow to melt faster and seep into equipment. Also, trains were stored on some express tracks instead of outside in yards to protect them from the cold, but that resulted in some delays in service while they were moved out of the way. In addition, a burst water pipe knocked out service to many trains at the subway station at Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan.\n\nWhile there are other indicators of subway performance besides on-time arrivals, many advocates and others say that it remains an important measure because consistent delays can mean fewer trains and more crowding.\n\nStill, Bill Henderson, executive director of a citizen\u2019s advisory committee to the M.T.A., said that he was not overly concerned based on January\u2019s performance alone. \u201cOne exceptional month would not necessarily trigger an alarm for me,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral subway riders said they felt that train service was improving. Matt Albala, 29, a brokerage manager who takes the subway three or four times a day, said he had been delayed only once or twice in the past month. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, I would get delayed 5 or 10 minutes here and there, and that doesn\u2019t happen much anymore.\u201d\n\nBut many other subway riders said the subways were still making them late as they tried to get to work, go home or just get around the city.\n\nHorace Medley, 34, a contractor from Canarsie, Brooklyn, said that in his experience, the 4 train is delayed by 15 to 20 minutes almost every day when he takes it going home. \u201cIt makes you upset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey keep on raising the fare, and the service is not getting any better.\u201d", "title": "New York Subway\u2019s On-Time Performance Hits New Low", "authors": ["Winnie Hu"]}

Their job: track down bedbugs with their highly trained noses.\n\nWe met Nemo yesterday after he was picked up from Biscuits and Bath on the Upper East Side, where he lives, and before he and his handler of six years, David Trevino, headed out for their first inspection of the week.\n\nThe canine unit is dispatched to city apartments after a resident complains to 311 about a possible infestation.\n\nOnce Nemo arrives, and after a few belly rubs from adoring children, he gets to work with the command: \u201cFind the bugs!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s trained to pick up the scent of bedbugs, and only bedbugs, and he scours headboards, couches and corners for the little bloodsucking critters. If he finds them, he sits down.\n\n\u201cThen I say, \u2018Show me, show me,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trevino said, \u201cand he indicates the location of the bugs with his nose.\u201d\n\nHis reward? A Bil-Jac chicken liver treat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s accurate about 80 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Trevino said, a hit rate that has led some in the past to complain about using dogs to inspect for insects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Trevino defended his co-worker. Instead of exploring an entire apartment, he said, the dogs help him narrow his search.\n\nAnd they are fast. An inspection takes about 20 minutes, or a matter of seconds if it\u2019s a full-blown infestation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the dog walks in and is like, \u2018Whoa,\u2019\u201d he said, mimicking Nemo by throwing his head back and crinkling his nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll look at me like, \u2018What do you need me for?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe number of bedbug complaints dropped last year to 8,113, from 9,618 in 2016, but the dogs are still used for about 10 inspections a day. The pair recently hit a milestone, completing more than 25,000 inspections in the six years they have worked for the housing department.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten better over time,\u201d Mr. Trevino said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing it for so long, it\u2019s in their blood.\u201d\n\nWe asked a housing department spokesman if Nemo (age 8) and Mickey (age 7), who have each worked on the force for 44 dog years, had any plans to retire.\n\nNo, the spokesman wrote in an email. \u201cThey are in the prime of their careers.\u201d\n\nNew York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don\u2019t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.\n\nFor updates throughout the day, like us on Facebook.\n\nWhat would you like to see here to start your day?

Chris Christie, a Republican, blocked efforts by Democrats in Trenton to push through increases in their state\u2019s minimum wage.\n\n\u201cNew York proudly set an example for the nation by raising the minimum wage to $15, yet the fight for economic justice for our working families continues, and we won\u2019t stop until every New Yorker is paid the fair wages they deserve,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, the ability to extend a generous raise to hourly workers could help him fend off attacks by the newest entrant into the governor\u2019s race, the actress Cynthia Nixon, who has sharply criticized the governor over what she has characterized as a growing economic divide in the state.\n\nAfter the November election of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who pledged to raise New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour, the impasse at the Port Authority dissolved. Even the agency\u2019s chairman, Kevin O\u2019Toole, a former Republican state legislator appointed by Mr. Christie, supports the mandated increase.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. O\u2019Toole said, \u201cThis board has heard the voices of airport employees who\u2019ve shared their stories with us over the years. We know that higher wages won\u2019t only make a difference to them personally, but will have a significant impact in workplace morale and productivity that will directly enhance the experience of the traveling public visiting our airports.\u201d\n\nMr. Murphy praised Mr. O\u2019Toole and the other commissioners for \u201cgetting to the right place.\u201d\n\nUnder the proposal, the annual increases for the workers \u2014 most of whom are employed by private contractors as airplane cleaners, caterers and baggage handlers \u2014 would begin Sept. 1. The Port Authority estimates\n\nThe first one would raise the minimum for workers at Newark Liberty to $12.45 an hour, from the Port Authority\u2019s current minimum wage of $10.45.

By Sept. 1, 2019, that imbalance would end with the minimum wage at all three airports increasing to $15.60 an hour. After that, it would rise in three more steps, to $19 an hour on Sept. 1, 2023.\n\nPaul K. Sonn, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project, said $19 an hour would be the highest targeted minimum wage in the country. He said airports on the West Coast had set a trend of higher pay to reduce instability and improve security that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would be catching up to.\n\n\u201cThe Port Authority has really been lagging, in part because Chris Christie was blocking action on this,\u201d Mr. Sonn said.\n\nSince fast-food workers in New York City began a campaign a few years ago for a $15 minimum wage, that number has become a rallying cry for workers around the country.\n\nBut Hector Figueroa, the president of 32BJ Service Employees International, the influential union that represents several thousand of the airport workers, has set his sights higher. Last year, frustrated by the Port Authority\u2019s slow response to demands, 32BJ; the Retail, Wholesale and Departments Store Union; and Unite Here, another union representing airport workers, lobbied for legislation in Albany and Trenton that would have set an $18-an-hour minimum at the airports.\n\nThat effort failed, but once Mr. Murphy was elected, the unions returned to the Port Authority\u2019s monthly board meetings to press their demands. This time, Mr. Figueroa said, their efforts appear to be bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase but it\u2019s the kind of money that you need to live in this market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge increase because the workers were earning so little for so long.\u201d\n\nDozens of workers in purple knit caps bearing the 32BJ logo or red Unite Here T-shirts whooped and chanted as the agency\u2019s directors endorsed the new wage scale at a meeting in Jersey City.\n\nAndrea Bundy, who has cleaned airplanes at Kennedy Airport for five years, said she would now have the money to buy uniforms and track shoes for her 16-year-old daughter, who competes in track and field for her high school in Brownsville, Brooklyn. \u201cI feel like I got an early Christmas present, not only for me but for my daughter,\u201d Ms. Bundy said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZakiyy Medina, 22, who has been a baggage handler at Newark Liberty for two years, said the raises would allow him to help his grandmother with the rent and other bills. \u201cI feel exhilarated, proud, happy,\u201d he said, wearing a big smile.", "title": "New York-Area Airport Workers on Way to $19 Per Hour", "authors": ["Patrick Mcgeehan"]}

In the past couple of years, black homes have cropped up on the internet, dominating decorating sites like Dwell, Gardenista and Apartment Therapy. The Black Houses Tumblr has amassed pages and pages of black homes in rural, urban and desert settings. Shou sugi ban, the ancient Japanese technique of charring exterior wood, became a thing. PPG Paints named Black Flame its 2018 color of the year. Nashville-based O\u2019More College of Design coated its 2017 show house in black.

Nineteenth-century anarchists waved their black flag. Twentieth-century fascists loved it. Beat poets, punks and Goths made it their brand. The Black Panthers wore black leather jackets and black berets. When the fashion designer Rei Kawakubo introduced everyday black clothes in the early 1980s, critics described the collection as \u201cpost-atomic.\u201d Most recently, black is what women in Hollywood and Congress chose to wear to express solidarity with victims of sexual assault.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn early 2016, Victoria Smith of SF Girl, a design blog, painted her home in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles Benjamin Moore\u2019s Onyx. She latched on to black after seeing a slew of houses painted that color in Amsterdam. For her, black houses are symbols of power. \u201cIt\u2019s like, don\u2019t mess with me,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Smith was initially worried about her neighbors\u2019 reaction. \u201cI think they thought I was some Goth person,\u201d she said. Then more people in the neighborhood began painting their homes black. Was she bothered by the imitations? No, she said. She was flattered.\n\nFor Abigail Ahern, an interior designer and retailer in London, black is warm and mysterious but also a courageous color for women to slather on walls. \u201cYou have to have a certain amount of confidence to use black, and I think we all have more confidence than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re channeling our own direction.\u201d\n\nShe first painted a small alcove black in her 1860s four-story Victorian, then became so entranced that she painted her entire interior and exterior black and filled her garden with furniture and accessories to match.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough.

King, a New York Republican who spent several hours with the president during two St. Patrick\u2019s Day events on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a combination of being more relaxed and also being frustrated by the fact that he feels like a lot of what he didn\u2019t succeed at, or what hasn\u2019t worked, is that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nHis close allies, like Representative Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, believe the president is finding his stride and learning how to navigate Washington.\n\n\u201cI see it more as a function of just, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve taken a year to understand the different dynamics within a broad array of personalities,\u2019 and so now it\u2019s all about putting together a team to go the distance for the next three years,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nWarnings of dire consequences from his critics have failed to materialize.

His grandparents immigrated from Mexico. He didn\u2019t learn English until he started elementary school. Music played a major role in his life from early on.\n\nAt Monday\u2019s news conference, Mr. Carranza said he had been a mariachi musician since he was about 6 years old. When he wanted to stay up late with his father and his uncles, they said the only people staying up late were people playing instruments \u2014 so he learned to play the guitar. He later worked his way through college at the University of Arizona \u201cgigging,\u201d as he put it on Monday.\n\nAfterward, when he became a social studies teacher at his former high school in Tucson, students knew that he played music and asked him to start a mariachi class. He did, and it eventually grew into a program serving 250 students and an award-winning student group, Mariachi Aztl\u00e1n de Pueblo High School.\n\nLater, Mr. Carranza, who eventually became principal of the school, attributed the school\u2019s improved reputation and performance to the transformative power of music in the students\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what mariachi music does \u2014 it keeps our kids connected to who they are,\u201d he said in 2016, when he was inducted into the Mariachi Hall of Fame.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same ceremony, Mr. Carranza described himself as \u201creally a mariachi masquerading as a superintendent.\u201d (He also met his wife, Monique Garcia Carranza, through music \u2014 she works with her sister, Susie Garcia, who has an all-woman mariachi band in Los Angeles, Las Colibri.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Carranza left Tucson in 2004 for the Clark County School District in Las Vegas, where he began his ascent into administration. In 2009, his former mentor in Clark County, Carlos Garcia, by then the superintendent in San Francisco, hired Mr. Carranza as his deputy superintendent of instruction, innovation and social justice. When Mr. Garcia retired in 2012, the district skipped a national search, instead elevating Mr. Carranza as superintendent.\n\nHydra Mendoza, the president of the Board of Education of the San Francisco Unified School District and deputy chief of staff to the mayor, said that in San Francisco, Mr. Carranza presided over a period of consensus among the school board and improving academic performance.

The same year he was hired by the board of trustees of the Houston Independent School District to run its schools, which serve some 215,000 students, the vast majority of whom are Hispanic or black. In Houston, he faced major challenges, including a board that was often divided, persistent racial and economic achievement gaps, and a funding system in which the district, which has high property values but overwhelmingly serves low-income students, has to send money back to the state to redistribute to other districts.\n\nNot even a year into his tenure, he faced a crisis when Hurricane Harvey struck the city, causing major damage to the schools. But Mr. Carranza was credited with skillfully steering the district through the crisis.\n\nAmong other things, he obtained a $1 million donation from Mr. Benioff that went to provide meals, clothing and other supplies to students and their families.

Past winners include Jane Kamensky, Drew Gilpin Faust, Eric Foner and Gordon S. Wood.\n\nMr. Farrell, a journalist who has also written books about Clarence Darrow and Tip O\u2019Neill, has not been shy about drawing parallels between the Watergate scandal and the current investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. In a statement he was less direct, naming no names but saying that journalists and scholars have been called on to defend the study of history, and \u201cthe concept of truth itself,\u201d from \u201ccorrosive attack.\u201d", "title": "Nixon Biographer Wins American History Book Prize", "authors": []}

Mr. Klein and Ms. Stewart-Cousins have indicated a willingness to reunite if Democrats seize a numerical majority in April, when two special elections favoring Democrats are being held, but that scenario is dependent on another rogue Democrat, Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, reuniting with his party\u2019s conference; he currently sits with Republicans.\n\nMr. DiNapoli\u2019s office indicated that it intends to pay out 25 percent of the stipend amounts requested \u2014 which are scheduled to be in paychecks next week \u2014 but will not pay the remaining 75 percent in April unless the Senate provides \u201cdocumentation showing that these members serve in the office or special capacity listed.\u201d It also argues that the office will attempt to claw back the money already scheduled to be paid if proper explanation is not given.\n\nThe letter from Mr. DiNapoli\u2019s office and other documents about the stipends were obtained through a Freedom of Information request. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the comptroller, Jennifer Freeman, said the office had issued the letter since \u201clegal entities have yet to clarify the legality of the Senate\u2019s practices,\u201d after they were brought to light last year.\n\nState Legislative Law 5-a allows senators who serve as chairs or ranking members of committees to receive stipends ranging from $9,000 to $34,000 a year, sometimes greatly increasing a lawmaker\u2019s $79,500 salary. But the law does not outline payments for vice chairs.\n\nIn past years, senators have received tens of thousands of dollars for jobs they did not hold. And the newest payment request, dated March 6, mirrors similar certifications made in previous years, incorrectly listing senators as committee chairmen and chairwomen. Ms. Savino, for instance, was listed as chairwoman of the Codes Committee and as such entitled to receive $4,500, a quarter of the annual $18,000 allotted to the actual chairman, Andrew Lanza. She is the committee\u2019s vice chair.\n\nThe same situation is true for Mr. Peralta, the No. 2 on the Senate\u2019s Energy and Telecommunications Committee, who is misidentified as its chairman and slated to receive $3,125, part of the $12,500 earmarked for that committee\u2019s chairman, Joseph Griffo. Lawmakers can receive only one stipend and in each case, the actual chairs of those committees \u2014 such as Mr. Lanza and Mr. Griffo \u2014 receive higher stipends for other leadership positions.\n\nState Sen. John J. Flanagan, the Republican leader, and his counsel, David L. Lewis, have strenuously argued that such misdirected lulus are legal, despite there being no explicit statutory basis for a stipend for vice chairmen. In a four-page memo released last spring, Senate officials said that the documents sent to the comptroller with the false titles were simply a way to ensure payment, not to lie about the position they held.", "title": "No Lulus for You: Comptroller Threatens to Withhold Lawmakers\u2019 Payments", "authors": []}

No charges were brought against the mayor or his aides. Federal prosecutors noted last year that making a case would have been difficult, presumably because the United States Supreme Court had raised the bar for proving political corruption months before Mr. Singh\u2019s plea in 2016.\n\nNonetheless, the specter of shadowy behavior isn\u2019t going away, not with Mr. Singh figuring in another federal corruption trial about to begin, that of Edward Mangano, a former Nassau County executive. He\u2019s accused of taking Singh bribes. Mr. Mangano\u2019s lawyers have left little doubt that they will make Mr. Singh\u2019s de Blasio connection \u2014 and the absence of any charges against the mayor \u2014 part of a strategy to discredit him as a prosecution witness.\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, who\u2019s up for re-election this year, discomfiting proximity to criminal cases does not end with the Percoco trial. Another administration insider, Alain Kaloyeros, has his own federal court date in May. Dr. Kaloyeros, who headed the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, is charged with corruption in connection with pay-to-play projects upstate.\n\nCourthouses aside, the governor has trouble keeping his deeds fully in sync with his words on ethics. He has repeatedly urged the Legislature to close the \u201cL.L.C. loophole,\u201d by which corporate interests pump vast sums into political campaigns through a series of limited liability companies. No action has been taken, a failure arguably more on lawmakers than on Mr. Cuomo. But having claimed the high ground, he could show seriousness of purpose by not slipping through that loophole himself. Instead, he has used it to plow many hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate donors into a campaign strongbox containing more than $30 million.\n\nSimilarly, he renewed an executive order imposed by a predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, under which most people in state positions are forbidden to donate to, or solicit political donations for, the governor who appointed them. But Mr. Cuomo and his counsel interpret the order as applying solely to those who can be fired by the governor at any moment. It doesn\u2019t cover people who\u2019ve had legislative confirmation and serve fixed terms, they say. That smacks of pettifoggery. A Times investigation disclosed this week that 37 Cuomo appointees contributed a total of $2.2 million to his political campaign, directly or through relatives and companies they own or control.\n\nNo one can expect the governor to cease trawling for campaign cash in an election year, and not when he has his eye on a possible presidential race in 2020. But a serious challenger to his re-election has yet to emerge. With his bursting campaign chest, how hard would it have been to forgo a couple of million to demonstrate he\u2019s sticking to both the spirit of the rules and his own ethics agenda?

It was originally written in 1841 to help unite Germany\u2019s states, but its opening verse, which included the line \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles\u201d (\u201cGermany, Germany, above all else\u201d), gained sinister connotations under the Nazis and stopped being sung after World War II.\n\nThe anthem was again adopted for the united Germany after the Berlin Wall fell. \u201cOur national anthem is a piece of history itself,\u201d Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said.\n\nMs. Rose-M\u00f6hring\u2019s feelings about the controversy are unknown \u2014 the Family Ministry said she would not comment \u2014 but those who have succeeded in changing anthems before said it could take years, even decades, to achieve the change if she decides to push her suggestion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the big discussion it\u2019s caused, and I\u2019m not surprised the politicians said no \u2014 I only succeeded the second time,\u201d said Maria Rauch-Kallat, a former Austrian politician who led efforts to get her country\u2019s anthem changed, with the result that Austrians now sing about their \u201cgreat daughters\u201d as well as their \u201cgreat sons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNancy Ruth, a former Canadian senator who spearheaded the campaign to make \u201cO Canada\u201d gender-neutral, said she felt all anthems that excluded women should be changed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my reaction to this?\u201d she asked, before answering her own question using an expletive and expressing frustration about the debate. \u201cOh, grow up,\u201d she added, addressing those against change. The easiest way to realize the power of a word like \u201cfatherland\u201d was to ask men if they would be happy singing about their motherland instead, she said.\n\nChanging an anthem requires a long campaign, she added: \u201cIt takes until you have a leader, with a majority, who truly wants equality among the sexes.\u201d Canadian feminists started calling for \u201cO Canada\u201d to be made gender neutral in 1980 and it took Justin Trudeau\u2019s election in 2015 for them to succeed.\n\nAngela Merkel was not in a position to offer such leadership given her recent electoral struggles, the former lawmaker said. She recommended that Ms. Rose-M\u00f6hring start singing her own words and hope others follow.\n\nNot all efforts to change Europe\u2019s anthems involve gender. Last month, the pop singer Marta S\u00e1nchez prompted debate in Spain by singing lyrics to her country\u2019s wordless anthem (\u201cI come home to my beloved homeland, where my heart was born,\u201d she began). The country\u2019s anthem has been wordless since it was first played at in an official occasion in 1770. Words were used during the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, but not officially adopted, and any new ones could prompt concern from, say, Catalans and Basques.\n\nBosnia\u2019s anthem is also wordless, to keep a lid on potential conflicts. Some Bosnians are calling for lyrics to be added, but ethnic splits mean agreement on a set of official words looks impossible, with some Bosnian Serbs not wanting to give the country a more effective symbol.\n\nSwiss campaigners are arguably undertaking the most comprehensive effort to change a national anthem. In 2013, they held a contest to find new words to their God and weather-obsessed anthem, the \u201cSwiss Psalm.\u201d They have since been trying to cajole people into singing them. Last year, a Christian group ran a postcard campaign against the new words.\n\nLukas Niederberger, director of the Swiss Society for Public Good, the organization behind the contest, said the idea of changing Germany\u2019s anthem seemed sensible. \u201cI think for a modern society, the central text of the culture should be politically correct,\u201d he said.\n\nChange shouldn\u2019t be hard, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re saying change the whole text, just adapting a few words.

Republicans were left with the prospect of defending a far broader range of districts this fall than they had hoped.\n\nVideo\n\nA first-time candidate and former Marine, Mr. Lamb, 33, forced Republicans to pour over $10 million into a southwestern Pennsylvania district where Democrats did not even field a candidate in the past two congressional elections.\n\nYet whoever wins here may not hold the seat for very long. The State Supreme Court ruled in January that Pennsylvania\u2019s House map was gerrymandered unlawfully and redrew congressional boundaries that may cause either candidate to run in a new district in November.\n\nEphemeral as any ultimate victory may be, this contest evolved into a test for both major parties in Trump country. Republicans scrambled to prop up Mr. Saccone, a 60-year-old state representative, mindful that a failure here would send signals well beyond Pittsburgh.\n\nThe president appeared twice with Mr. Saccone, most recently at an airport rally on Saturday night in which Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Lamb as \u201cLamb the sham\u201d and pleaded for voters to support Mr. Saccone. But Mr. Trump also delivered a rambling, 75-minute speech that careened away from the matter at hand.\n\nRepublicans concede that they will be unable to keep the 2018 battlefield limited to a few dozen districts, mainly in coastal suburbs where Mr. Trump is intensely unpopular. With a deepening mood of pessimism and fear in Washington, they may be hard-pressed to tackle additional contentious legislation this year.\n\nEven before the returns were counted, Republican officials began criticizing Mr. Saccone\u2019s candidacy in a district where the anti-abortion Republican previously holding the seat, Tim Murphy, was forced to resign after a woman with whom he was having an affair said he pressed her to have an abortion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut three months after suffering an embarrassing defeat in the special Alabama Senate election, Mr. Trump and his administration once more put their prestige on the line on friendly terrain. By continuing to aggressively compete even as Mr. Lamb was surging, Republicans tested the potency of two of their most fearsome political weapons for the midterm campaigns: their fund-raising advantage and the deep unpopularity of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader.\n\nOutside organizations sought to derail Mr. Lamb with attacks on his record as a federal prosecutor and claims that he would, as one ad put it, merely be a sheep for Ms. Pelosi.\n\nBut the spending did not put the race away, in part because Mr. Lamb pre-emptively inoculated himself against the Pelosi offensive by stating early in the campaign that he would not support her for leader.\n\nAlong with his military service and support for gun rights, Mr. Lamb\u2019s opposition to Ms. Pelosi, which he highlighted in a TV ad, helped him win over some of the voters who were raised Democrats but have drifted to the Republican Party in this heavily unionized district.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s two visits, Vice President Mike Pence appeared with Mr. Saccone, and two of the president\u2019s children did as well, with Donald Trump Jr. here on Monday. Other administration officials also descended on the district, backed up by an advertising offensive by outside Republican groups that began in January.\n\nFew Republicans publicly said Mr. Trump was at fault for the race\u2019s closeness. But their difficulties here, coming mere hours after he abruptly fired Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, illustrated how much his chaotic governing style and divisive conduct has unsettled the electorate and presented Democrats the chance to portray themselves as a political safe harbor.\n\nIn his remarks early Wednesday morning, Mr. Lamb said, \u201cPeople are so tired of the shouting on TV and in our politics.\u201d\n\nMr. Lamb ran a fairly cautious campaign, calling for more cooperation in Washington and largely keeping national Democrats, other than former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., out of the district.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLess than a decade removed from law school, Mr. Lamb, a Marine prosecutor turned assistant United States attorney, said he ran because he wanted to show his party he could compete in working-class white districts and help reconnect Democrats with organized labor.\n\nMr. Saccone, a mild-mannered Air Force intelligence veteran, aggressively linked himself to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI was Trump before Trump was Trump,\u201d he declared at the outset of the race, and on election eve, he went about proving he could deliver his own set of incendiary remarks.\n\nStanding next to Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son at a firehouse, Mr. Saccone said Democrats were energized by a hatred for the president, \u201ca hatred for our country\u201d and \u201ca hatred for God.\u201d\n\nMr. Saccone echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s call for steel tariffs, a popular position in what historically was a steel-and-coal anchored district. But Mr. Lamb also backed the president\u2019s proposed 25 percent tax on imported steel, seeming to blunt an issue that Republicans sought to make central late in the campaign.\n\nRepublicans hoped that stamping Mr. Trump\u2019s brand on the race would help mobilize pro-Trump voters who are otherwise mostly tuned out of politics.\n\nBut the president\u2019s presence most likely cut both ways, energizing Democrats and disaffected moderates, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s base. In a rally with Mr. Saccone days before the election, Mr. Trump delivered a heated and unfocused speech, railing about illegal drugs, the Senate confirmation process and news coverage of his administration, and reminiscing about his own victories in 2016.

I wanted to make smothered pork chops (above) in the middle of last week, a feed for a day when things are generally falling apart in the kitchen and in our lives, everyone caught between weekends, a little frantic or bummed, with no desire to shop or follow instruction or really do anything more than receive comfort.\n\nI had the idea around 10 in the morning, a few hours into a shift and a great many ahead of me before I could scooch out to get supplies. I checked the recipe again. It called for three hours of cooking after a 12-hour soak of the pork chops in brine. My idea wasn\u2019t going to work, and I was saddened, as many are on Wednesdays, facing facts.\n\nBut I made the dish anyway. And you can, too, at least if you believe in the precepts of no-recipe recipes and especially if you\u2019ve followed the crowds and gotten yourself an electric multicooker. (You don\u2019t need one. You can always cook in one pan on the stove, letting everything bubble along under a lid until the meat collapses. But it helps to use the science machine. The stovetop version will leave you eating late.)\n\nSo here\u2019s a nice Wednesday-night meal. Buy the thickest pork chop you can for each person you\u2019re serving, on the bone and hopefully with a jaunty cap of fat. Salt and pepper the chops, herb them up as you like, rub them with flour and then brown each one hard in a pan dressed with oil or bacon grease. Set the browned chops aside and cook a whole lot of chopped onions in the remaining fat in the pan, then hit them with a few tablespoons or up to half a cup of flour, stirring and cooking until the whole lot of it goes dark and caramel and a little bit dry. Add enough chicken stock to make the onions turn into a kind of gravy, then watch it thicken and add a little more stock but not too much. You want it kind of thick.", "title": "No-Recipe Smothered Pork Chops", "authors": []}

Inspired by a slower, jazzier recording several years earlier by the country star Chet Atkins (the original recording was by the song\u2019s composer, the guitarist Johnny Smith), the Ventures\u2019 version had a propulsive power, driven by heavily amplified guitars and the drumming of Skip Moore.\n\nAlthough Mr. Bogle\u2019s playing was a key to the single\u2019s success, Mr. Edwards soon replaced him as the band\u2019s lead guitarist; Mr. Bogle\u2019s switch to bass was an acknowledgment of Mr. Edwards\u2019s greater skill.

The band, which is still active, has gone through various permutations. Mr. Wilson retired in 2015 but still occasionally records; Mr. Bogle died in 2009.\n\nMr. Edwards played with various artists in his career, including the country star Lefty Frizzell. In recent years he formed a company, HitchHiker, to make custom guitars, and toured with his own group, the HitchHiker Band.

Dratel, a New York lawyer experienced in defending terrorism cases.\n\n\u201cYou have to share the intent of the actor,\u201d Mr. Dratel said. \u201cYou have to do something to make the crime succeed \u2014 not do something that makes the crime succeed without knowing that the crime is going to occur. You have to have both of those elements.\u201d\n\nProsecutors did not have to prove a motive, though Ms. Sweeney, an assistant United States attorney, said in her closing argument on Wednesday that Ms. Salman could have aided Mr. Mateen out of love, money or spite. But while Mr. Mateen\u2019s internet browsing and social media records showed intense radicalization, there was no similar history for Ms. Salman. In fact, twice on Facebook she criticized Islamic terrorists, at one point calling them bad Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, to have a case like that where you have access to all the social media, you have access to the phones, you have access to the computers \u2014 all of that, and you don\u2019t have a specific piece of evidence pointing to her intent? You don\u2019t have a case,\u201d Mr. Dratel said.\n\nIn her supposed confession, Ms. Salman told F.B.I. agents that she and Mr. Mateen had scouted Pulse as a target for the June 12, 2016, attack, yet investigators apparently knew just days later that there was no evidence to corroborate that. That false statement in her confession called into question the rest of what she told law enforcement over more than 11 hours of questioning without a lawyer present. The F.B.I. made no audio or video recordings of the interview. The jury foreman told The Sentinel that he wished a recording had been available.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, not everybody who you ran into had a digital recorder in their pocket, and we didn\u2019t have \u2018CSI\u2019 shows, and we didn\u2019t expect to have everything on tape for us to see,\u201d said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who is now a defense lawyer. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we expect now. If there isn\u2019t a picture, it didn\u2019t happen. So the fact that they didn\u2019t record the confession helped to raise this reasonable doubt as to what was being said.\u201d\n\nThe final coup for the defense came during the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, when Ms. Sweeney for the first time suggested that the reason Ms. Salman told F.B.I. agents that she and Mr. Mateen had driven by Pulse was because she incorrectly thought the nightclub was at the Disney Springs shopping and entertainment complex, formerly known as Downtown Disney, which the couple did visit.", "title": "Noor Salman Acquitted in Pulse Nightclub Shooting", "authors": []}

The administration now says it will enter negotiations with North Korea only after it commits to discussing denuclearization.\n\nAmerican officials fear that North Korea is more interested in weakening sanctions that have begun biting the impoverished country than engaging in serious negotiations. Even if talks begin, they say, Washington will not stop its campaign of \u201cmaximum\u201d pressure and sanctions until the North dismantles its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea rejects any preconditions for talks, saying Washington must treat it like an \u201cequal\u201d nuclear power. It also insists that any talks with Washington would have to deal not only with its nuclear program but also with \u201chostile\u201d American policies, like the United States\u2019 annual joint military exercises with the South, which the North says forced it to seek a nuclear deterrent in the first place.\n\nMr. Moon spent most of the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward a possible war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nMr. Moon saw an opening when Mr. Kim agreed to send North Korean envoys, as well as athletes and cheerleaders, to the Olympics. He has since assumed the role of a matchmaker in persuading Washington and Pyongyang to soften their stances enough to make dialogue possible.\n\nThe last time South Korea sent an envoy to Pyongyang was in 2007, toward the tail end of the South\u2019s decade-long \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d of encouraging economic and other exchanges with the North. But a conservative leader took power in Seoul the following year, cutting off inter-Korean trade in retaliation against the North\u2019s nuclear weapons development and other provocations.\n\nKim Jong-un has accelerated his country\u2019s nuclear and missile tests since inheriting power after his father, Kim Jong-il, died in 2011. After launching an intercontinental ballistic missile in November, Mr. Kim claimed to have a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk with which he could fire missiles capable of reaching the mainland United States. American officials say Mr. Kim is getting dangerously close to achieving the ability to strike the United States with nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nMr. Kim, at 34, is one of the world\u2019s youngest and most reclusive dictators. He has met with envoys from China and Cuba, as well as personal guests, including the American basketball star Dennis Rodman. But until now, he has never met any envoy from South Korea. Neither has he visited any foreign country as North Korea\u2019s leader, although he studied in Switzerland as a teenager.", "title": "North Korea Hails \u2018Openhearted Talk\u2019 With South Korean Envoys", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun"]}
{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "North Korea\u2019s apparent agreement to talk to the United States about abandoning its nuclear weapons is a relief after the world faced months of tension over Pyongyang\u2019s testing of those devices and Washington\u2019s bellicose response.\n\nFor once, President Trump\u2019s tweeted reaction made sense. \u201cPossible progress being made in talks with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cFor the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\u201d\n\nAs he indicated, optimism needs to be tempered with caution, since the hard work needed for a peaceful solution would have to overcome years of distrust and the bitterness of failed negotiations. But there finally seems to be an opening for talks, so the Trump administration needs to seize it.\n\nThe news that North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, had agreed to discuss ending his nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and that he would suspend tests of weapons and missiles during negotiations came from senior South Korean diplomats after discussions in Pyongyang with Mr. Kim. They were the first representatives of the South to meet with Mr. Kim since he came to power six years ago. While the North has not yet made its own statement on the talks, the fact that the South Korean delegation met directly with Mr. Kim was significant.", "title": "Opinion | North Korea Has Put the Ball in Trump\u2019s Court", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThe North expressed its willingness to hold a heartfelt dialogue with the United States on the issues of denuclearization and normalizing relations with the United States,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt made it clear that while dialogue is continuing, it will not attempt any strategic provocations, such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump, who has veered from bellicose threats against Mr. Kim to offers to sit down with him, welcomed what he called \u201cpossible progress\u201d with the North. \u201cFor the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump expounded on his reaction later to reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden. \u201cWe have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would meet with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nThe cautious American reaction partly reflected a history of suspicion toward the motives of North Korea, which has remained an enemy of the United States since the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nA pattern of what American officials have described as North Korean duplicity in previous talks has repeated itself, with modest variations, during the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. In January 2009, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who had served under both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, summarized the American skepticism about North Korea with an oft-repeated line: \u201cI\u2019m tired of buying the same horse twice.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean statement said the two Koreas would begin working-level discussions to prepare for the summit meeting, to be held in the Peace House, a South Korean building in Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles the border. Before Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon meet, the countries will install, for the first time, a hotline by which the leaders can talk on the phone directly, the statement said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

Nonetheless, the reported agreements represented major progress in Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to improve relations with North Korea. Those efforts advanced considerably during the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to which Mr. Kim sent athletes, entertainers and political delegations that included his sister.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe top South Korean envoys who returned from North Korea on Tuesday \u2014 Mr. Moon\u2019s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, and the director of the South\u2019s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon \u2014 are expected to be dispatched to Washington this week to brief the Trump administration on their discussions with Mr. Kim.\n\nMr. Chung told reporters in Seoul, the South Korean capital, that Mr. Kim had been unexpectedly flexible. He said the delegation had expected him to insist that the South and the United States not hold their annual joint military exercises, which were suspended for the Olympics.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un simply said he could understand why the joint exercises must resume in April on the same scale as before,\u201d Mr. Chung said. \u201cBut he said he expected them to be readjusted if the situation on the Korean Peninsula stabilizes in the future.\u201d\n\nMr. Chung said the South Koreans believed that their agreements with North Korea would be enough to start a dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang. He also said he was carrying additional messages from Mr. Kim to the Trump administration that he could not reveal.\n\n\u201cThere was no other specific demand from North Korea in returning to dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only said they wanted to be treated like a serious dialogue partner.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the overture by North Korea sets in motion a challenging phase that will call on the United States to exercise diplomatic muscles after a long stretch in which the White House relied on economic pressure, backed by threats of military force, to deal with the North.\n\nThat challenge will be compounded because the State Department\u2019s veteran North Korea negotiator, Joe Yun, recently announced his retirement from the Foreign Service. Another experienced negotiator, Victor Cha, was recently sidelined when the White House decided not to move ahead with his nomination as ambassador to South Korea.\n\nAdministration officials are deeply wary of being drawn into a negotiation in which the United States makes concessions \u2014 on issues like military exercises or shipments of medical and food aid \u2014 only to see the North Koreans renege on their commitments later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has said that the United States could talk with North Korea, but \u201conly under the right conditions.\u201d American officials have repeatedly said they can start negotiations with the North only if it agrees to discuss denuclearizing. They have also insisted that the North first take some actions that would convince them of its sincerity.\n\nDefense Minister Itsunori Onodera of Japan, which has steadfastly supported the Trump administration\u2019s tough approach to sanctions against North Korea, struck a note of caution about Pyongyang\u2019s interest in negotiations.\n\n\u201cWhile talking about nuclear abandonment several times, it turned out that North Korea didn\u2019t halt its nuclear development in the past,\u201d Mr. Onodera said. \u201cWe need to carefully assess if this North and South dialogue will really lead to the abandonment of nuclear and missile development.\u201d\n\nChina, which has pushed for direct talks between Pyongyang and Washington for many months, welcomed the South Korean statement. Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China hoped \u201cthe relevant parties can seize the current opportunity\u201d to work toward \u201cpolitically resolving the Korean Peninsula issue.\u201d\n\nOne Chinese expert on North Korea characterized Pyongyang\u2019s reported offer as \u201cconcessions that are dramatic and significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be hard for the U.S. government to resist,\u201d said the expert, Cheng Xiaohe, of Renmin University in Beijing.\n\nBut Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department official who was involved in previous negotiations with North Korea, was less impressed. He said the formula of denuclearization for security guarantees had \u201cbeen the basis of several sets of talks\u201d between the two countries in the past.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has actually provided security guarantees to North Korea, including in writing by President Clinton,\u201d Mr. Revere said. \u201cSuch guarantees have never been adequate or acceptable to the North Koreans, just as the U.S. provision of alternative energy sources, food and other assistance has never proved adequate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also noted that the moratorium on nuclear and missile tests offered by the North would not prevent Pyongyang from continuing to build its nuclear arsenal, including by producing fissile material for nuclear weapons.\n\nEven so, Mr. Revere said the Trump administration would be hard-pressed to reject the North\u2019s proposal without making it appear that Washington \u2014 not Pyongyang \u2014 was the problem.\n\n\u201cWith these developments, the door seems wide open to a U.S.-North Korea exploratory conversation if both sides want one,\u201d he said. The North went to considerable lengths to meet the American demand that dialogue had to be about denuclearization, he said.\n\nThe 10 members of the delegation Mr. Moon sent to the North were the first South Korean officials to meet Mr. Kim since he took power six years ago. They were also the first outside officials to directly hear Mr. Kim explain his intentions regarding his country\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.\n\nMr. Kim, 34, has accelerated the North\u2019s nuclear and missile tests since inheriting power after his father, Kim Jong-il, died in 2011. Mr. Moon spent most of the past year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward possible war as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test yet, while Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nAfter launching an intercontinental ballistic missile in November, Mr. Kim claimed to have a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk with which he could fire missiles capable of reaching the mainland United States. American officials say Mr. Kim is getting dangerously close to being able to strike the United States with nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nBut Mr. Kim suddenly shifted his tone on New Year\u2019s Day, using an annual speech to propose sending a delegation to the Olympics. During the Games last month, his sister, Kim Yo-jong, hand-delivered his proposal for a summit meeting with Mr. Moon.\n\nThe South Korean leader hoped to use the thaw surrounding the Olympics to improve inter-Korean ties and to steer the United States and North Korea away from what he called a collision course. Analysts say Mr. Kim\u2019s sudden overture for dialogue is driven at least in part by his desire to weaken sanctions that have begun biting his isolated country, as well as to stave off Washington\u2019s threat to use military force.", "title": "North Korea Signals Willingness to \u2018Denuclearize,\u2019 South Says", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun", "Mark Landler"]}

By walking through the torii, one has entered the world of the Kami, or Shinto gods.\n\nThe earliest documentation of the torii in Japan dates to 922 A.D., during the Heian period.\n\nThe structure of the torii varies, but the most important parts are the pillars (hashira), the lintel placed on the two pillars (kasagi), and a tie-beam that keeps the structure together (nuki).\n\nFor the easier puzzles at the beginning of the week, the word might also appear with the clue: \u201cShinto temple gateway\u201d or \u201cShinto gateway.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, it might be referred to as: \u201cShinto shrine entrance,\u201d \u201cTraditional Japantown feature,\u201d \u201cDecorative gateway in Japan\u201d or \u201cJapanese portal.\u201d\n\nDeb Amlen contributed reporting.\n\n_____\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

His most high-profile guest had been Mr. Rodman, a former professional basketball player who developed something of a bromance with Mr. Kim over his fondness for basketball, during visits in 2013 and 2014.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s agreement to denuclearization talks is no guarantee that North Korea will start dismantling its arsenal. Mr. Kim said he would give up nuclear weapons only when he felt no more military threats. Previous efforts all collapsed over the same hurdle.\n\nThe Trump administration has escalated economic pressure, backed by threats of military force, to deal with North Korea. President Trump has said he is open to talks \u201conly under the right conditions,\u201d and officials have insisted that the North first take actions to show sincerity.\n\nSome analysts speculated that Mr. Kim\u2019s charm cloaked a wily attempt to fend off sanctions and deflate talk of military action from Washington. With the United Nations banning major North Korean exports, including coal, fish and textiles, North Korea\u2019s exports have plummeted in recent months, a potentially crippling economic blow.\n\n\u201cEither Kim Jong-un\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolution to be a nice guy is real or his smiles and soft messages for Seoul are a ploy for buying time and money to perfect his own nuclear posture review,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Mr. Moon, the South\u2019s leader, has repeatedly called for dialogue with the North, relations were deadlocked until Mr. Kim used his New Year\u2019s Day speech to propose an inter-Korean dialogue and offer to send athletes and cheerleaders to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Mr. Kim also sent his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, to meet Mr. Moon and invite him to a summit meeting.\n\nAmerican officials argued that their pressure campaign had forced Mr. Kim\u2019s hand.

Heilbroner\u2019s \u201cThe Future as History,\u201d Joseph Wood Krutch considered similar themes and wondered about the future\u2019s inevitability. Read an excerpt below.\n\nCan a study of the past predict the future \u2014 even when the future seems as uncertain as ours is commonly thought to be? The author of this intricately argued book, the economist Robert L. Heilbroner, says \u201cYes.\u201d Assuming that the fate of societies is largely determined economically and using the kind of extrapolating logic favored by the Rand Corporation, he emerges with the conviction that both the world in general and the United States in particular will probably go on getting richer, more powerful, more egalitarian and more thoroughly \u201cplanned.\u201d\n\nNineteenth-century optimism has given way to twentieth-century uncertainty because so much in the contemporary situation seems unprecedented. But actually, so he argues, the tendencies and forces that present new problems are only continuing developments from the very same tendencies and forces which transformed seventeenth-century society into nineteenth. Former optimism was not wholly justified; neither is our sense that the future is completely unpredictable.\n\nOur own society will be increasingly planned and regulated because only thus can the increasingly interrelated parts be assured an orderly development. Universal abundance and high incomes will (to take a particularly alarming example) abolish the pressures that now compel some citizens to undertake the less pleasant tasks which must be performed. Some sort of \u201csocial pressure\u201d will have to be substituted for the present economic pressure. \u201cWhat that source of social discipline might be is a speculative matter.\u201d Some readers may be inclined to wonder if it can be anything except slavery more or less disguised as \u201cdiscipline.\u201d\n\nIt would be unfair to suggest that what the author predicts for us seems to him a brave new world.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "This week\u2019s cover reviews look at the role of corporations in American life. In a 1954 review of \u201cThe 20th Century Capitalist Revolution,\u201d by Adolf A. Berle Jr., Seymour E. Harris, an economic adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, reflected on the need to check the increasingly unbridled power of corporations. Read an excerpt below:\n\nThe elephantine corporation is, according to Berle, central in the twentieth-century capitalist revolution. The great corporation is necessary, inter alia, to achieve the objective of high output and low costs. But the resultant concentration of power in management may be abused, and hence the colossal corporation, if it is to survive, must serve as well as take; it must advance the good society, not merely seek to maximize profits. In fact, Berle observes a wholesome trend toward a higher moral code in corporate behavior.\n\nJust as the priest could check military power in the past, or as \u201ca higher law imposes itself in time on princes and powers and institutions of this terrestrial earth,\u201d so \u201cthere is beginning to be apparent a realization of a counter force which checks and remotely acts on, and in time may modify in certain areas, the absolute power of business discretion.\u201d\n\nThe shreds of evidence adduced by Berle are not convincing that \u201ca higher law\u201d as yet determines substantially the operations of big business. Indeed, there are corporations that will not abandon a town just to increase profits. But also relevant is the recent history of Nashua, N.H., where one corporation virtually destroyed the livelihood of the town in order to exploit cheap labor elsewhere; of Lawrence, Mass., and even of Yonkers, N.Y.\n\nHow can we contain the power of corporate management? This is the crucial question raised by Berle. We are all agreed that the corporation is a must in American life for the many reasons ably discussed by Berle. But we need in a democracy to prevent abuse of power by any group: Government, labor, capital or management. How can we mobilize the corporation to serve the nation? Shall it be through countervailing power \u2014 that is, confronting bigness with bigness?", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "This week\u2019s issue is dedicated to women, both ordinary and trailblazing. In 1983, Paule Marshall, best known for her novel \u201cBrown Girl, Brownstones,\u201d reflected on how observing her mother\u2019s relationship to language inspired her career. An excerpt follows.\n\nI grew up among poets. Now they didn\u2019t look like poets \u2014 whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young.\n\nNor did they do what poets were supposed to do \u2014 spend their days in an attic room writing verses. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn\u2019t have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day\u2019s work cleaning their houses. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became \u201ca few raw-mouth pennies,\u201d they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children.\n\nThere was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. It restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work day.

In 1973, Philip Kurland, the legal scholar who in 1974 would advise the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Nixon tapes, reviewed \u201cImpeachment: The Constitutional Problems,\u201d by Raoul Berger. Read an excerpt below:\n\nImpeachment is the \u201cunthinkable\u201d subject about which we are thinking because of Watergate. This book is not, however, one of those instant volumes created by a publicist in response to a particular political event and rushed through production to capitalize on the daily headlines and momentary fashions. This is a serious, scholarly effort, nonetheless highly readable even by those who want to know what they want to know only because of its implications for current events.\n\nRaoul Berger\u2019s primary concern was to demonstrate that, although impeachment was a proper means for removal of derelict judges, it ought not to be the sole means for accomplishing that worthy end. Impeachment belongs in a far more important tradition: \u201cImpeachment was for the English \u2018the chief institution for the preservation of the government.\u2019\u201d And he would restore it to that lofty category.\n\nToday this volume is important for the historical exegesis of the origins and meanings of the constitutional provision. And, as Berger says, \u201cOne thing is clear: in the impeachment debate the Convention was almost exclusively concerned with the President.\u201d\n\nProbably the most important of the questions of the moment addressed by Mr. Berger concerns the proper meaning to be given the phrase \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d He tells us that despite the practices indulged by Congress in the past, the phrase is not an empty bottle to be filled with whatever meaning the national legislature thinks appropriate. Nor is it a term of fixed meaning whose denotations may be derived by examination of the criminal laws heretofore enacted by Congress. We must turn, rather, to the English constitutional history from which our constitutional provision took its meaning.

A 3-pointer by Crystal Dangerfield tied the score at 89-89 with 27 seconds left. Notre Dame called timeout with 13 seconds remaining and planned to isolate Ogunbowale (27 points) on the right wing and have her drive to the basket with about five seconds remaining, in the belief that UConn would not try to foul.\n\nBut UConn\u2019s defense made it difficult for Ogunbowale to get the ball as planned.

It grew heated, sometimes to the point of bitterness.\n\nNow they are in different leagues \u2014 the Irish play in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Huskies in the American Athletic Conference \u2014 and the rivalry is less intense, but no less predictive of deep runs in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Notre Dame prevailed over UConn in the semifinals in 2001, when the Irish won their only national title, and did it again in 2011 and 2012, as well as on Friday.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, UConn failed to reach the championship game. Last year, defeat came on a stunning jumper by Mississippi State in overtime that snapped the Huskies\u2019 111-game winning streak. Again on Friday, the Huskies were left to contemplate going home empty-handed \u2014 despite having won 147 of their last 149 games.\n\n\u201cWhen you do something and it seems like it\u2019s so effortless, you do get numb and forget it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Auriemma said of UConn\u2019s raft of national titles. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult.

In the first 37 years of the men\u2019s tournament Coach John Wooden and U.C.L.A. won 10 titles.

He was arrested and spent a month in jail.\n\nA few weeks ago the city of Oakland, now promoting itself as a hub for marijuana entrepreneurs, awarded Mr. McCullough, 33, a license to sell marijuana and the prospect of interest-free loans.\n\nFour hundred miles to the south, in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, Virgil Grant, 50, straddles the same two worlds, but with a different outcome. He was a marijuana dealer in the 1990s whose customers are said to have included rap stars like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac, and he spent more than eight years in prison on marijuana convictions. But his vision of starting a marijuana dispensary in his hometown was dashed in January when the residents of Compton voted decisively to ban marijuana businesses from city limits.\n\nFrom a distance, the legalization of recreational marijuana in California can appear like a giant collective embrace of the drug by a state that is by far its largest producer and consumer.

Forever trapped in the outmoded, low-revenue Coliseum, they need to take risks to compete with the World Series champion Houston Astros and their other American League West rivals. The Fowler trade qualifies.\n\nIn moving Gray, whose rights the A\u2019s controlled through 2019, Oakland received a second injured prospect besides Fowler: pitcher James Kaprielian, a former first-round draft choice who is recovering from Tommy John surgery. Jorge Mateo, a shortstop who was not injured then but has a sprained knee ligament now, was the third \u2014 and most highly touted \u2014 prospect in the deal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this cycle a lot, in my and Billy\u2019s time together,\u201d General Manager David Forst said, referring to Billy Beane, Oakland\u2019s executive vice president for baseball operations. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the up-and-down, and hopefully can recognize when there\u2019s a time to look at higher-upside guys. We\u2019ve made trades for safer guys with a lower ceiling who could impact us sooner, but we were certainly in position last July to go for the most talent regardless of how far away from the big leagues they were.\u201d\n\nIn Fowler\u2019s case, the A\u2019s had few precedents to study. The injury, Forst said, is more common in N.F.L. running backs than major league outfielders.

The former president and first lady could also lend their brand \u2014 and their endorsement \u2014 to documentaries or fictional programming on Netflix that align with their beliefs and values.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear how much money the Obamas will be paid, given their lack of experience in the media business. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300 million deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox, but Mr. Murphy is among the television industry\u2019s most sought-after producers\n\nThe deal is evidence that Mr. Obama, who left the White House when he was just 55 years old, intends to remain engaged in the nation\u2019s civic business, even as he has studiously avoided direct clashes with Mr. Trump about his concerted efforts to roll back Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. It is also a clear indication that the former president remains interested in the intersection of politics, technology and media.\n\nSeveral people familiar with the Netflix discussions said that executives from Apple and Amazon, which have their own streaming services, have also expressed interest in talking with Mr. Obama about content deals.\n\nThe former president has maintained a low profile since leaving office. He and his wife are each writing highly anticipated memoirs, for which they were reportedly paid more than $60 million. And Mr. Obama has been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches in the United States and around the world. The Obamas are rarely seen in public in Washington, where they still live.\n\nMr. Obama has long expressed concerns about how the flow of information \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 has the power to shape public opinion. In the last several months, Mr. Obama has discussed with technology executives and wealthy investors the threats to American democracy from the manipulation of news.\n\nHe has seethed privately and publicly, about what he says is the manipulation of news by conservative outlets and the fractured delivery of information in the internet age. In several recent public appearances during the last several months, the former president hinted at his frustration with the way conservative news outlets have shaped people\u2019s perceptions about the divisive 2016 campaign and the issues he cares about.\n\n\u201cIf you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you are listening to NPR,\u201d Mr. Obama told David Letterman in an interview broadcast in January for the comedian\u2019s first Netflix program. Last December, at a forum in New Delhi, Mr. Obama conceded that \u201cIf I watch Fox News, I wouldn\u2019t vote for me. I would watch it and say, \u2018Who is that guy?\u2019\u201d\n\nEvidence began to emerge while Mr. Obama was president that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were being used to spread false information about candidates and issues. Social media\u2019s impact on society became even clearer last month, when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, indicted 13 Russians and three companies that had used social media companies to undermine democracy in the United States and push voters to reject Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the election came to a close, Mr. Obama told The New Yorker that the new media landscape had made it possible for large swaths of the country to ignore facts. \u201cEverything is true and nothing is true,\u201d he complained. He later personally scolded Facebook\u2019s chief executive for saying it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to think the social network influenced the election.\n\nFor Netflix, securing the Obama programming is a part of the company\u2019s broader search for original content, as the streaming service competes for viewers with HBO, Apple, Amazon and the traditional broadcast networks. Netflix has said it could spend as much as $8 billion on content this year. It has been paying top dollar for original programs like its hit Stranger Things and the documentary Icarus, which won the Oscar this year for best documentary feature.\n\nIt would also be another coup for a company that began by distributing DVDs and is now doing deals with some of the most powerful names in entertainment.\n\nSeveral of the technology and media worlds\u2019 top executives have been close advisers and donors to Mr. Obama over the years, including John Doerr and Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the entertainment executive.\n\nBut Mr. Obama has particularly close ties to Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. Mr. Sarandos is married to Nicole A. Avant, an activist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Bahamas. And Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was close to Mr. Obama while he was president and an attendee at state dinners. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment about any discussions with the former president and his wife.\n\nSome of the biggest media companies on the internet, like BuzzFeed and Vice, have embraced politically-themed programming, even as they have recently seen their growth flatline with shifts in the digital advertising and distribution landscapes. Political news start-ups like the website Axios and the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d hosted by former Obama officials, have connected with audiences that are eager for scoops, analysis and opinion.\n\nThe deal between Netflix and Mr. Obama would be a modern media twist on an approach that former politicians have tried in the past.\n\nAl Gore, the former vice president, created a new cable network after losing the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman and Democratic activist, purchased a small cable company in 2004, eventually renaming it Current TV and positioning it as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in the political debate.\n\nThe network expanded its presence on cable and satellite networks and changed formats several times during the next eight years, at one point providing a home for Keith Olbermann, an outspoken liberal and a former host at MSNBC. In 2013, Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt sold their company to the Al Jazeera Media Network, which shut down the Current TV channel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s approach is less of a direct challenge to the existing news establishment.

But the chances of heading off this policy disaster are small, because this is a quintessential example of Trump being Trump.\n\nIn fact, the tariffs are arguably the Trumpiest thing Trump has done so far.\n\nAfter all, trade (like racism) is an issue on which Trump has been utterly consistent over the years.

There\u2019s a reason we have international trade agreements, and it\u2019s not to protect us from unfair practices by other countries.

His other influences, he said, ranged from Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Var\u00e8se to Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.\n\n\u201cMusic is experience consciously transformed, and because my experience has been an African-American experience, I think it expresses that,\u201d he told Bruce Duffie, a radio producer and interviewer in 1997, when asked if he were conveying African-American ideas in his pieces.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mr. Wilson wrote a viola concerto for Marcus Thompson that had an improvisatory feel, with riffs associated with a jazz saxophone or trumpet and a bluesy middle section. Mr. Thompson said in a telephone interview that, compared with other viola concertos, Mr. Wilson\u2019s was special \u201cbecause he writes from a completely different medium; he\u2019s a jazz player who\u2019s written all sorts of chamber music.\u201d\n\nThe work, titled \u201cViola Concerto,\u201d had its long-delayed premiere in 2012 with the Rochester Philharmonic.

Decades earlier, Ms. Basile\u2019s parents, Maril\u00fa and Jorge Basile, met and fell in love in a building on the northernmost corner of Grand Avenue. Gonzalo Armendariz, the grandfather, had opened one of New York City\u2019s first tortilla factories, Mexi-Frost, there in 1975 with Ms. Armendariz\u2019s mother, Parisina Alonso.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

I was in the office. She ran in and said, \u2018I think my husband just walked into the receiving area.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Basile was newly arrived from Argentina. He was carrying 10 pounds of Argentine beef, hoping to become a wholesaler for Mexi-Frost, which was expanding into foods beyond tortillas. \u201cShe made us invite him to dinner that night,\u201d Ms. Armendariz said. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t even known each other 24 hours.\u201d\n\nLess than a year later, they were married.\n\nMarriage was not on Ms. Basile\u2019s mind when she moved to Crown Heights, though she was by then older than her mother and grandmother were when they married. She had broken up with the boyfriend from the N.Y.U. party but was in no hurry to find a new one. And Mr. Smith was too preoccupied with finishing his Ph.D. to invest a lot of time in dating. But Ms. Basile\u2019s presence proved hard to ignore.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNicole is beautiful and brilliant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Thanksgiving party was his introduction to Ms. Basile\u2019s culinary skills. \u201cNicole was prepping cranberry sauce for the party and she knocked on my door and said, \u2018Hey, try this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is great, where did it come from?\u2019\u201d She had made it from fresh cranberries.\n\nBut even before Mr. Smith and his roommates ventured downstairs for Thanksgiving, he had already been plotting ways to impress Ms. Basile. In one instance, he asked his N.Y.U. adviser, Jairo Moreno, who is from Colombia, what wine he should bring to a woman who was part Argentine. (Mr. Moreno recommended a rioja and a malbec that earned the thumbs up of Ms. Basile and her grandmother.) Weeks later, he secured tickets to the kind of show that perhaps only a pair of academics would appreciate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was a staged production of Kafka\u2019s \u2018Metamorphosis,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI thought it was perfect for a comp-lit gal.\u201d It was. By Christmas, Mr. Smith and Ms. Basile were a couple.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Basile didn\u2019t have to knock on the ceiling or a heating pipe to get Mr. Smith\u2019s attention the way her grandmother did to rouse Mr. Armendariz in 1961. But she was just as fully swept up in her short-distance love affair.\n\n\u201cThere are all these wonderful surprises with Steve,\u201d Ms. Basile said. \u201cLike he has this incredible sensitivity \u2014 we\u2019ll be watching a movie or something and I\u2019ll look over and see that he\u2019s crying.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, after years of romantic interludes lit by desk lamp and littered with theses, Ms. Basile\u2019s lease was coming up for renewal.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBy then it was pretty clear that they wanted to have their own space,\u201d Ms. Nonko said. She and Ms. Mitchel finished out the lease, while Ms. Basile and Mr. Smith found a place together in another Crown Heights building.\n\nOn Dec. 16, 2016, the day before their anniversary as a couple, Ms. Basile had been writing a paper all day and into the evening in their new apartment when Mr. Smith asked if she could take a break at midnight for Champagne. She was expecting a low-key anniversary toast, but Mr. Smith had a better idea.\n\n\u201cIt was midnight and he was getting the Champagne, and he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we play the music ball?\u2019\u201d she said. Years earlier, Ms. Basile had given him a wooden sphere that, when wound with a key, plays a tune from \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d a favorite opera. Ms. Basile grabbed the ball off a bookshelf. As she was about to wind it up, she found, around the key, an Art Deco ring from the 1930s that Mr. Smith had bought at Erie Basin, a Brooklyn shop Ms. Basile loves.\n\n\u201cI was so surprised,\u201d she said. As \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d played, Mr. Smith proposed. She said yes instantly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn March 10, Ms. Basile and Mr. Smith were married before 154 guests at the Brooklyn Winery, not far from where they fell in love. Ms. Basile, in a full-length fitted lace dress with a high neck from Shareen Bridal, walked down the aisle with her father. Mr. Smith\u2019s sister, Heather Hussar, who became a marriage officiant via the City of New York for the occasion, led a short ceremony punctuated by three poetry readings. (One, \u201cDos Palabras,\u201d was read in Spanish and English.)\n\nJust after the ceremony, Mr. Smith and Ms. Basile mingled with family and friends as the Respect Sextet, the band of his former roommates, played selections that included \u201cHello Mary Lou\u201d and \u201cCampi\u00f1a,\u201d an Afro-Cuban jazz number with cha-cha leanings.\n\nThe newlyweds had been planning a first dance post-dinner to the soul hit \u201cI\u2019ve Been Loving You Too Long,\u201d played by a D.J., but the lure of \u201cCampina\u201d proved too enticing. Mr. Smith cut in to his wife\u2019s dance circle and the couple showed off what looked like well-practiced moves to cheers and wolf whistles.\n\nLater, Ms. Armendariz pointed out that her granddaughter and Mr. Smith were clearly made for each other. Also that it pays to believe in serendipity, especially in New York apartment buildings. \u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to meet somebody and your life will change,\u201d she said.", "title": "On Craigslist, 3BR Unfinished, Future Husband Upstairs", "authors": ["Tammy La Gorce"]}
{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Iungerich grew up in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and \u201cAwkward\u201d was set in that largely white and Asian-American environment. With \u201cOn My Block,\u201d she\u2019s stayed in Southern California but shifted the demographics, setting the show in a fictional section of Los Angeles called Freeridge, whose residents are predominantly Latino and African-American.\n\nThe show has drawn praise for promoting diversity, but its most distinctive feature is Ms. Iungerich\u2019s sensibility, the same one she brought to \u201cAwkward\u201d: a kind of deadpan burlesque in which the jokes hit on the downbeat, and the young characters, no matter how bright, seem to exist in a constant state of irritable confusion.\n\n\u201cOn My Block\u201d is a coming-of-age story built around a love quadrangle \u2014 two girls (Sierra Capri and Ronni Hawk) and two boys (Diego Tinoco and Jason Genao) trying to sort out their mutual attractions and jealousies. A fifth friend played by Brett Gray, whose slightly abrasive style calls to mind Kevin Hart or (very distantly) a young Eddie Murphy, provides the pure comic relief in a subplot about an urban buried-treasure legend.\n\n\u201cOn My Block\u201d has the off-center charm and quirky comic rhythms Ms. Iungerich is known for, but it has a problem that\u2019s tied to its setting. The stumbling block Ms. Iungerich has chosen for her young characters is the gang life: One of the boys is expected to join his older brother\u2019s gang, which threatens to break up \u201cthe fam\u201d (the group of friends) as well as the central romance.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with that as a dramatic device (besides overuse), but it\u2019s uncomfortably out of proportion in a half-hour teenage comedy. The shifts from football game high jinks or a character\u2019s apple-bong-toking abuelita to the question of whether to shoot another teenager in the head are disconcerting, to say the least.\n\nIf neither cancer diagnoses nor street gangs are your idea of a children\u2019s-comedy premise, you might shift your gaze from Netflix to Amazon, where \u201cThe Dangerous Book for Boys\u201d has its premiere on Friday. In this fictionalization of the fanciful boy\u2019s-life handbooks written by Conn and Hal Iggulden, the central conflict involves a family whose three young boys are recovering from the death of their gadget-inventing father. Warmhearted and perhaps imaginary adventures ensue, facilitated by the father\u2019s identical twin (played by the always engaging Chris Diamantopoulos).

It may not be the biggest cruise boat on the seas (that became clear when we docked next to the real behemoths in the Bahamas) or even in the Disney fleet, but its dimensions are still impressive: 11 decks, 984 feet long, 171.5 feet tall.\n\nActivities were legion. I had signed up for some in advance. (Not-at-all-pro tips: Sign up early and preregister your children at the Disney Cruise website \u2014 many events book up quickly. And download the Disney Cruise app before you leave \u2014 it\u2019s how you will communicate with family members.) Other activities were noted on a daily schedule dropped off at our Deluxe Oceanview Stateroom With Verandah. At 3 p.m. on our first day, for example, we could have: caught the second half of \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d in a state-of-the-art movie theater that seats 278; lined up to meet Minnie Mouse on Deck 4, or Princess Sofia (of the Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cSofia the First\u201d) on Deck 5; joined \u201cGame Show: The Feud\u201d on the promenade lounge; taken part in an (adults-only) origami session; or dropped Anna off at the Oceaneer Club \u2014 one of two activity centers open to kids for the bulk of the day and evening. It was all dizzying.\n\nOr we could have gone ashore to Key West, our first stop. I couldn\u2019t convince Anna to join me, so I went solo. It turned out Anna had made the right call: It was sunny but cool and very windy; fellow passengers shivered down touristy Duval Street buying their T-shirted kids oversized sweatshirts. I headed to CVS to get some DayQuil for Nancy, who had picked up Anna\u2019s chest cold, then stopped for a mediocre Cuban lunch.\n\nI had signed Nancy and myself up for a couples massage later that afternoon \u2014 hey, we deserved a break even on day one, O.K.? \u2014 so we dropped Anna off at the Oceaneer Club and headed up to Senses Spa & Salon. The massage, given by two Serbian women (their nationalities, as with all crew members, were noted on their name tags), was a good one, if pricey ($170 per person). We passed on the products they had used during the massage, which were for sale. Almost every activity, it would turn out, ended with a gentle upsell.\n\nIt was time for dinner. There are two seatings nightly, and you are directed to one of four restaurants around the ship, the idea being that you get to try each one. Tonight was Carioca\u2019s, supposedly Brazilian-themed, though I couldn\u2019t quite figure out in what way. We were seated with a couple from Miami, whose daughter was about Anna\u2019s age. The food was fine, but the service was stellar, as it was everywhere on the ship. I can\u2019t say that I was thrilled that my daughter was constantly being called \u201cPrincess,\u201d but each crew member seemed genuinely enthusiastic and pleased to be on the boat, down to the person passing out sanitizing wipes to e very passenger entering a restaurant. (Hygiene is, understandably, a huge deal on the ship. In addition to the wipes, the kid centers have devices that might best be described as washing machines for hands.)\n\nOur servers at Carioca\u2019s at dinner were from Thailand and Scotland and introduced themselves as such, as all crew members did (there are 950 in total, of 80 nationalities, for an astounding customer-to-crew ratio of less than 3-to-1). I found all of this charming and touching.\n\nMy adult activity that night, which I had signed up for in advance, was a whiskey tasting in the loungey Cove Caf\u00e9 on Deck 9. It was not my first bar visit of the trip. The night before, I had grabbed a $20 glass of quality Scotch at Keys, one of the cluster of venues in the After Hours section of the boat (the others are Fathoms, where a D.J. was setting up, and O\u2019Gill\u2019s Pub, which offered beers on tap and free crudit\u00e9s and wings). Keys is a piano bar, complete with a high-end booze selection and a fedora\u2019d player behind the piano. (It also plays host to Friday night Shabbat services.) My bartender, Alejandro, from Peru, was friendly and knowledgeable. Noting my interest in Scotch, he offered me a flight of four Macallan single malts for $60. Another upsell, but also a pretty good deal. Still, four more ounces of booze seemed like a bad idea, so I declined, and instead caught 20 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d in the excellent Buena Vista Theatre.", "title": "On a Disney Cruise, It\u2019s a Stressful World (After All)", "authors": []}

For that we had to go to the city of Qamishli, which in any case had the nearest hotels, and apply to the State Security office, known here as the Asayish.\n\nUnfortunately, the Asayish could not issue such a permission until we were registered as journalists with the Self-Administration Government\u2019s High Media Council, and to do that we would have to proceed to the city of Amuda, about an hour\u2019s drive west of Qamishli. Since the office there closed at 2:30 p.m., that meant a wait until the next day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBright and early in the morning, we climbed the five flights of stairs, strewn with peeled paint, to the media council\u2019s suite of offices. The head of administration, Arsheikh Baravi, sat in front of a laptop in an office with a wood stove converted to burn oil from a scary-looking, suspended drip tank. (It\u2019s hard to explain.)\n\nThere we presented passports, our white customs entry slips, press cards and our letter of introduction from The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThis is not correctly addressed,\u201d Mr. Baravi said.\n\nWhat was the problem?\n\n\u201cIt says \u2018To Whom It May Concern.\u2019 That is not my name.\u201d But after some discussion Mr. Baravi agreeably agreed to overlook the issue, this one time.\n\nOnce back in Qamishli, inside the Asayish compound, getting our road permit required visits to two more offices and one photocopier. That allowed us to proceed west back to Ainissa, a four-hour drive. The S.D.F. media office added to our growing sheaf of paperwork a permit that allowed us to work in military areas of Rojava.\n\nJust when we thought we were done, a friendly official named Ali in the S.D.F. media office informed us that we would have to come back the next day, and every day, to renew that permission. Since the nearest hotel was an hour and a half away in the town of Kobani, that meant potentially three hours of daily paper-chase commuting lay ahead.\n\nNot so quick, though. Since we were staying in Kobani we would also need to register there and get another permission slip. That office was now closed, so we would not be able to do that until it opened at 9 a.m. the next day.\n\nAt the hotel late that night we learned that the office\u2019s employees were going into hiding, fearing Turkish airstrikes. So instead of opening at 9 a.m., the Kobani office would be closed all day, and then again the next day when a mass demonstration was called to protest the Turkish assault on Afrin and all public offices emptied out to join it.\n\nThe day after that (now four days since our initial arrival in Syria), the head of the media center in Kobani, Ghosn Rajb, finally issued the Kobani paperwork, but only after scolding us for failing to register all week.", "title": "On the Road in Syria, Where Covering the War Is a Paper Chase", "authors": ["Rod Nordland"]}

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cI think Ryan\u2019s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. \u201cI think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.\u201d\n\nTo supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan\u2019s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party\u2019s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as \u201cthe intellectual center of Republicans in the House\u201d has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,\u201d said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nConservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as \u201ca tax hike the American people don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he\u2019s chosen not to assume that role,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to see he\u2019s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, the speaker\u2019s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule \u2014 and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine Tip O\u2019Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can be for that, I\u2019ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president\u2019?\u201d asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal\u2019s provisions for \u201cthe rebuilding of our depleted military.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re from entirely different worlds,\u201d Mr. Wehner said. \u201cThat said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.\u201d\n\nNow 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.\n\nTo a certain extent, he has succeeded.\n\nBut in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator\u2019s private texts \u2014 a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.\n\nIf Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as \u201cinclusive and fair,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.\n\nUnlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate \u2014 and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members\u2019 chagrin.\n\nThat is not Mr. Ryan\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cAnd because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.\u201d\n\nApart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.\n\nThe chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to micromanage this,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\nBut there are consequences to Mr. Ryan\u2019s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan\u2019s signature fights \u2014 an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state \u2014 are on nobody\u2019s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.\n\nTo Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan\u2019s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can\u2019t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that\u2019s not leadership,\u201d said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.\n\n\u201cI can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,\u201d Mr. Meadows said then. \u201cIf he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.\u201d", "title": "Once Outspoken, Paul Ryan Wields His Speaker\u2019s Gavel Gingerly", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"]}

The mother-in-law of one, Laurie Jinkins, a Democrat, is 92, has dementia and just qualified for Medicaid.\n\nThe father of the other, Norm Johnson, a Republican, used up much of his savings paying for in-home aides for Mr. Johnson\u2019s mother. The elder Mr. Johnson spent so much on care for his wife that by the time he required care of his own, he, too, wound up on Medicaid.\n\nSo Ms. Jinkins and Mr. Johnson sponsored a bill calling for a payroll tax on state residents of 0.49 percent, or $22.30 a month on average. (Washington has no state income tax but does have a statewide sales tax.) People who paid into the system over a certain number of years would ultimately become eligible to access the $100-per-day benefit if they could not complete three or more activities of daily living, like dressing or bathing.\n\nThey could then take that $100 and put it toward in-home care, adult day care, nursing home fees or similar expenses. After 365 days, they would exhaust the benefit. At that point, Medicaid would still be an option.\n\nWhy would a member of the typically tax-averse Republican Party support such a measure? After all, people are supposed to save for their old age, and they can buy long-term care insurance to protect themselves, too.\n\nMr. Johnson, a former teacher, school counselor and principal, drew on his own life to answer the question.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe had five sons in my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we could afford long-term care insurance and raising five kids and paying for a house and school.\u201d\n\nHe knows that younger adults might resent the idea of elected officials reaching deeper into citizens\u2019 pockets to pay for benefits that are probably decades away for them. But he said that his experience had afforded him some perspective.\n\n\u201cYou never think you\u2019re going to get old,\u201d he said. \u201cBut guess what? I didn\u2019t think that either when I had kids at home, and now I will be 80 in July.\u201d\n\nThe way Ms. Jinkins and Mr. Johnson tell it, AARP was supportive until suddenly it was not. \u201cThe two people who represent AARP here, neither one had darkened my door,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cAnd then the last day, they threw a wrench into things.\u201d\n\nWhen I contacted AARP, I was told that the group had a number of concerns with the bill and had been expressing them all along. Perhaps the thorniest one involved the question of who qualified as a caregiver and how he or she would become eligible to collect to benefit.\n\nEligibility is not in dispute in licensed adult day care centers or nursing homes. But many people prefer to stay in their own homes as long as they can, and in some parts of Washington there are not enough licensed in-home caregivers. That means family members pitch in, often sacrificing their own wages to do so.\n\nEveryone in the coalition that supported the bill wanted the people who need care to be able to use the $100-a-day benefit to pay relatives. But not everyone is qualified to provide care, especially if doing so requires lifting a person or treating certain conditions.\n\nWould a spouse have to take a 75-hour class at a cost of hundreds of dollars to qualify as a caregiver? If so, was that too much to ask? How best to train a novice? Could family members train for, say, only 15 hours just to learn the specific skills they needed to help a relative? And if in-person training was required, who would care for an ailing spouse in the meantime?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe bill needed too much work, and we had too many questions and not enough answers,\u201d said Cathy MacCaul, AARP\u2019s advocacy director in Washington.\n\nWithout those answers, AARP would not support the bill as written. And without its support, and with emails arriving from AARP members encouraging \u201cno\u201d votes, lawmakers chose not to move the bill to a full vote.\n\nThe State Legislature met in a short session this year. Next year, its session will be longer, allowing more time for negotiation. All sides vow to redouble their efforts in the meantime. But the episode is a reminder of just how slowly new financial benefits creep across the country, hopping from state to state as new legislation is passed.\n\nHawaii offers some help to certain caregivers, but the Washington bill would establish the first payroll tax where the proceeds go to long-term care more broadly. It could be the difference between some families spending nearly all of their money and ending up on Medicaid or having something left after an older person\u2019s death.\n\nBut precisely because it would affect so many people, it\u2019s not going to happen very quickly. \u201cCould we all have dropped everything in our lives and answered all these questions sooner?\u201d asked Doug Shadel, AARP\u2019s state director in Washington. \u201cMaybe.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Jones and Sun contend that in many respects, Trump is reminiscent of Richard M. Nixon:\n\nNixon, like Trump, accused the media of being out to get him and predicted that the press would mischaracterize his public support or the reception he received. He believed the liberal media to be biased against him personally, maintaining that he had \u201centered the presidency with less support from the major publications and TV networks than any president in history\u201d and that \u201ctheir whole objective in life is to bring us down.\u201d\n\nUnlike Trump, however, Nixon (like the country\u2019s founders)\n\nroutinely reaffirmed to both the press and the public that he conceived of the press as central to democracy. Indeed, in his first speech to the public regarding the Watergate scandal, Nixon acknowledged that \u201cthe system that brought the facts to light and that will bring those guilty to justice\u201d was a system that included \u201ca vigorous free press.\u201d\n\nTrump stands out, according to Jones and Sun, in that his administration\n\nhas passed a threshold not approached by previous administrations in their tensions with the media. Trump is signaling \u2014 through his terminology, through his delegitimizing actions, and through his anticipatory undercutting \u2014 that the press is literally the enemy, to be distrusted, ignored, and excluded.\n\nIn response to my email, Jones replied that \u201cwar has been declared, whether they (the media) like it or not.\u201d She noted that the instincts of the press\n\nmotivate it to want to call out the changing norms that it sees around it, and to defend the role of important democratic institutions when they are attacked. But when the press is itself one of those institutions, it finds itself a part of the story in ways that it is unaccustomed to being, and it has to weigh the potential loss of credibility that might come with an aggressive self-defense.\n\nI asked Jonathan Ladd, a professor of public policy and government at Georgetown, what strategies he thought the media should adopt to counter negative portrayals by conservatives.\n\n\u201cThe best way for the press to react to Trump\u2019s undemocratic behavior is to continue trying to do their jobs the best they can,\u201d Ladd wrote. \u201cThe press is not perfect, but Trump\u2019s bad behavior doesn\u2019t change what they need to do.\u201d\n\nLadd specifically warned against \u201creacting to Trump by becoming more crusadingly anti-Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump has successfully \u201cput the mainstream media in a difficult position,\u201d according to Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago:\n\nIf the media directly address the accusations of fake news, they ironically run the risk of dignifying the accusations. But if they ignore the accusations, they miss the opportunity to prove their professionalism to those who have grown skeptical.\n\nIn the long term, Stone suggested, we could begin to remedy this problem if we improved civic education and encouraged a stronger defense of the media by politicians, especially Republicans \u2014 a prospect about which he is not optimistic.\n\nOf the media itself, however, Stone wrote:\n\nI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s really much they can do to defend themselves. Those who trust them will continue to trust them. Those who distrust them are unlikely to be brought around by anything they themselves are likely to say.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for the First Amendment is an integral part of a much longer series of developments in which both parties have demonstrated a willingness to defy democratic norms, although the Republican Party has been in the forefront.\n\nIn \u201cAsymmetric Constitutional Hardball,\u201d Joseph Fishkin and David E. Pozen, law professors at the University of Texas and Columbia, write:\n\nFor a quarter of a century, Republican officials have been more willing than Democratic officials to play constitutional hardball \u2014 not only or primarily on judicial nominations but across a range of spheres. Democrats have also availed themselves of hardball throughout this period, but not with the same frequency or intensity.\n\nFishkin and Pozen cite the work of Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, to define constitutional hardball as \u201cpolitical claims and practices\u201d\n\nthat are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. Constitutional hardball tactics are viewed by the other side as provocative and unfair because they flout the \u2018goes without saying\u2019 assumptions that underpin working systems of constitutional government. Such tactics do not generally flout binding legal norms. But that only heightens the sense of foul play insofar as it insulates acts of hardball from judicial review.\n\nRepublicans on the far right, in particular, Fishkin and Pozen write, have been willing to engage in constitutional hardball because they are drawn to \u201cnarratives of debasement and restoration,\u201d which suggest\n\nthat something has gone fundamentally awry in the republic, on the order of an existential crisis, and that unpatriotic liberals have allowed or caused it to happen.\n\nThe severity of the liberal threat, in the eyes of these conservatives, justifies extreme steps to restore what they see as a besieged moral order.\n\nIn an email, Fishkin wrote:\n\nAs with so many things about President Trump, it strikes me that he didn\u2019t start the fire. He got into office because it was already burning and now he\u2019s pouring on gasoline.\n\nIn Fishkin\u2019s view, Trump will do all he can to make the conflict between his party and the press \u201csharper and more intense, in the same way that he depends on and aims to intensify partisan polarization.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | One Thing Donald Trump Would Like Is Freedom From the Press", "authors": []}

Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: Puffer coat season is ending. I am in need of a transitional coat. My thought is a raincoat with a zip-out liner. I do like a bit of an edge. No epaulets. And belting doesn\u2019t suit me. Knee length. I would prefer an online search, delivered to my door with an easy return policy. Budget would be in the $700 range unless it was super, super fabulous. I\u2019m really looking for something that I would like wearing for a long time. I should also mention that lack of closet space means I am unable to accommodate multiple seasonal options. \u2014 Margaret, New York\n\nA: You definitely have the right idea. My transitional coat is a Barbour from an Anya Hindmarch collaboration released in 2010. It is knee-length waxed cotton, with narrow shoulders and slightly truncated sleeves with long, ribbed cuffs. I happened upon it accidentally \u2014 I was living in London at the time \u2014 so I can\u2019t take credit for any brilliant insight, but it has turned out to be perfect for exactly the time of year you are discussing. I have been wearing it happily for eight years, and it shows no signs of looking tired, so I plan to wear it for many more.\n\nThat said, it isn\u2019t for sale any more, so it\u2019s not an option for you (sorry). But according to T\u2019s women\u2019s style director, Malina Joseph Gilchrist, heritage English outerwear brands are indeed the way to go. This makes sense, when you think about it, since the British climate is pretty much what we in North America think of when we think of a transitional climate. So to Barbour add Mackintosh, Burberry, Hunter, Belstaff and \u2014 if you want to range further afield \u2014 Max Mara. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "title": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "What does it all mean?\n\nAs for the first item, I would expect a lot of logo action to start. Then, the question will be whether the Abloh appointment really does herald the luxury streetwear age, a sector-disrupting event that may change how we think about clothes in a permanent way. (Unlike, say, when contemporary designers such as Alexander Wang hit Paris, which despite a lot of hype had very little permanent effect.) Or whether it reveals, as some have suggested, that Mr. Abloh is an emperor who talks a great game but actually has no clothes.\n\nAs for the second, there has been a lot of cheering about this being a triumph for the indie designer (an oft-seeming endangered species) versus the corporate megalith, coupled with rumors that Ms. McCartney will bring her show back to London from Paris. That isn\u2019t happening, however \u2014 at least not according to her spokesman. And while it\u2019s possible Ms. McCartney may pick up the banner of the indie designer from such champions as Dries Van Noten and Rei Kawakubo \u2014 she has never shied away from activism \u2014 my guess is that this is more a practical decision about her business, and Kering\u2019s, than a major political message about the state of the industry.\n\nBut we shall see!\n\nIn the meantime, and speaking of luxury streetwear: Apparently in Sunday night\u2019s NBC production of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live\u201d John Legend will play Jesus while wearing \u2026 really expensive Balmain jeans.

Any suggestions on some go-to pieces? \u2014 Angelin, Oakland, CA\n\nA: This is a perennial question when going to a vacation destination: You don\u2019t want to look as though you are donning a costume by going pretend-native (i.e., wearing what glossy magazines photograph as fantasy-in-the-brush clothing). That generally only makes you stand out as someone who doesn\u2019t belong.

You weren\u2019t the only one who noticed, and it was a big Twitter moment while I was in Paris in the netherworld of fashion shows. It seems to me this is the monogram equivalent of the novelty T-shirt, though more about vanity than, say, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s novelty socks, which are pretty obviously chosen for their strategic appeal to various constituencies.\n\nHowever, I did seize the opportunity to canvass some of my fellow show-goers about the question, to see if there was precedent for this (always an important thing in government) and to hear what they thought.\n\nRobin Givhan, the fashion critic of the Washington Post, said she couldn\u2019t remember any President wearing their number on their sleeve, though it was possible George W.

{"date": "2018-03-04 00:00:00", "text": "Jimmy Kimmel once again brought his dry, sardonic style to his role as host of the Oscars. His monologue, preceded by a black-and-white video send-up of some A-list stars, was filled with barbs against Harvey Weinstein, Mel Gibson and others. He also threw jibes at President Trump, and poked fun at last year\u2019s Oscar envelope mix-up.\n\nSome of his commentary needed to be taken with a grain of salt. At one point, Mr. Kimmel said, \u201cOf the nine best picture nominees, only two of them made more than $100 million.\u201d That may have been true domestically, but most of the films hit that total if foreign ticket sales were factored in.\n\nHere is a transcript of Mr. Kimmel\u2019s monologue:\n\nAnd greetings from Hollywood to our viewers all around the world. Thank you for watching. Thank you very having me. It is a great honor to be invited back for a second time. It is a great honor to be here among so many talented women and men. Congratulations to all of you. You made it. We\u2019re at the Oscars. Some of you will be going home tonight with an Academy Award. What could be better than that? Nothing, right?\n\nSo \u2014 oh. I do want to mention. This year, when you hear your name called, don\u2019t get up right away. Just give us a minute. We don\u2019t want another thing. What happened last year was unfortunate, and I\u2019ve not told this story in public because I wanted to save it for tonight. But here\u2019s what happened. This is true. Last year, about a week before the show, the producers asked me if I wanted to do some comedy with the accountants. And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do comedy with the accountants.\u201d So, then the accountants went ahead and did comedy on their own.\n\nAnd I have to hand it to them, it was hilarious. But it won\u2019t happen again. This year, the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers said, and I quote, \u201cOur singular focus will be on the show and delivering the correct envelopes,\u201d which is \u2014 does make sense. Just out of curiosity though, what was your focus the other 89 years? I\u2019m hopeful that things will go smoothly tonight. We can\u2019t ruin this one. This is a special year. This is a big one. These are the 90th Academy Awards. This is history happening right here.\n\nOur friend Oscar \u2014 Oscar is 90 years old tonight, which means he\u2019s probably at home right now watching Fox News. Of course \u2014 no, Oscar is here with us. After all the years, after all the awards given for achievements in show business, Oscar is still No. 1. No question about it. Oscar is the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood. And there\u2019s a very good reason why. Just look at him. Keeps his hands where you can see them. Never says a rude word and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations. And that\u2019s the kind of men we need more of in this town.\n\nHere\u2019s how clueless Hollywood is about women. We made a movie called \u201cWhat Women Want\u201d and it starred Mel Gibson. Kind of all you need to know.\n\nThe Academy, as you are no doubt aware, took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks. There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most. And \u2014 oh, that\u2019s nice. That\u2019s very sweet. So, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate that applause. The Academy kicked him out and after they did, I was curious, so, I looked it up. You know the only other person to be expelled from the Academy, ever, was a character actor named Carmine Caridi. In 2004, he was kicked out for sharing screeners. Carmine Caridi got the same punishment as Harvey Weinstein for giving his neighbor a copy of \u201cSeabiscuit\u201d on VHS.\n\nBut what happened with Harvey, and what\u2019s happening all over, was long overdue. We can\u2019t let bad behavior slide anymore. The world is watching us. We need to set an example and the truth is if we are successful here, if we can work together to stop sexual harassment in the workplace, if we can do that, women will only have to deal with harassment all the time at every other place they go.\n\nOver the course of this evening, I hope you will listen to many brave and outspoken supporters of movements like \u201cMe Too\u201d and \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d and \u201cNever Again,\u201d because what they\u2019re doing is important. Things are changing for the better. They\u2019re making sure of that. It is positive change. This is a night for positivity and our plan is to shine a light on a group of outstanding and inspiring films, each and every one of which got crushed by \u201cBlack Panther\u201d this weekend. Which, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s okay. The success of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is one of many positive stories this year. Especially for African-Americans and Bob Iger. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman\u201d are \u2014 were massive hits, which is almost miraculous because I remember a time when the major studios didn\u2019t believe a woman or a minority could open a superhero movie. And the reason I remember that time was because it was March of last year.\n\nBut \u2014 this year, we have a lot to celebrate. Ceilings have been shattered. Ceilings in screenwriting. We have our first ever female nominee for cinematography, Rachel Morrison, which is historic. So many of tonight\u2019s nominees are making history, and, in fact, if you are a nominee tonight who isn\u2019t making history \u2014 shame on you.\n\nGreta Gerwig is the first woman to be nominated for director in eight years. And that\u2019s important. Only 11 percent of movies are directed by women. And that is nuts. We still have a very long way to go in that department, and a very long way to go when it comes to equal pay. Especially when you look at what happened with Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams. We all know the story. Mark Wahlberg was paid a million-and-a-half dollars to reshoot his scenes while Michelle Williams for her reshoots got a per diem. She was paid 80 dollars a day for the same thing. And what made it especially unfair is that Mark and Michelle are represented by the same agency. And I have to admit, this story really surprised me. This one shook me, because if we can\u2019t trust agents, who can we trust?\n\nTo his credit, Mark Wahlberg announced he would be donating all $1.5 million to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. That\u2019s right. So, I guess now the ball\u2019s in your court, Michelle. What are you going to do with that 80 bucks?\n\nIn the meantime, triple congratulations are in order for the kid from Comedy Central, Jordan Peele, who had a huge success with his movie, \u201cGet Out.\u201d Jordan is only the third person in 90 years to be nominated for directing, writing and best picture for his debut film. And what \u2014 what a debut it was. None other than President Trump called \u201cGet Out\u201d the best first three-quarters of a movie this year.\n\nMargot Robbie had a great year. Margot scored her first nomination for her portrayal of Tonya Harding in \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and was terrific. Whose kneecaps did Tonya Harding have to break to get this dream casting? Because, I mean, that was \u2014 if they made a movie about my life, best case scenario, I\u2019d be played by Jim Belushi. Another exceptionally gifted young actor who is nominated for the first time is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who looks very dashing tonight. Wow, look at that tux.\n\nAre you having fun, Timoth\u00e9e? This is a big deal. He\u2019s missing \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d to be here tonight. Don\u2019t worry, Ryder and his team of pups saved the day, so. Timoth\u00e9e is the star of a small but powerful story called \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d which did not make a lot of money. In fact, of the nine best picture nominees, only two of them made more than $100 million. That\u2019s not the point. We don\u2019t make films like \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d for money. We make them to upset Mike Pence. Right?\n\nTimoth\u00e9e is the youngest best actor nominee in almost 80 years, and on the other end of the abacus, we have our oldest acting nominee ever: The magnificent Christopher Plummer is 88 years old and still going strong. Maybe this is not the place, but there\u2019s something I want to ask you. How does Lin-Manuel Miranda compare to the real Alexander Hamilton?\n\nAnd once again, right here in the front row, maybe the greatest actor of all time, Meryl Streep is here with us. She earned her 21st Oscar nomination. Meryl\u2019s film career started in 1977. The longest she ever went without being nominated was from 1992 to 1995, which \u2014 and that\u2019s only because those were the years she was in prison, and that, I think, is amazing.\n\nThe most nominated movie tonight, a film that\u2019s up for 13 Oscars, is \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, a wonderful man. Congratulations, I\u2019m very happy for Guillermo. You made a beautiful movie and thanks to Guillermo, we will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly, women started dating fish.\n\nO.K., before we start handing out the awards, some history, because we\u2019re going to do things a little bit differently. The first Oscar ceremony lasted, and this is true, 15 minutes, from beginning to end. And people still complained. But \u2014 so, if you do win an Oscar tonight, we want you to give a speech. We want you to say whatever you feel needs to be said. Speak from the heart. We want passion. You have an opportunity and a platform to remind millions of people about important things like equal rights and equal treatment. If you want to encourage others to join the amazing students at Parkland at their march on the 24th, do that.\n\nIf you want to thank a favorite teacher, do that. Or maybe you just want to thank your parents and tell your kids to go to sleep. What you say is entirely up to you. You don\u2019t have to change the world. Do whatever you want. But with that said, this is a really long show. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t give a long speech, but whoever gives the shortest speech tonight will go home with \u2014 Johnny, tell them what they\u2019ll win.\n\n[ANNOUNCER\u2019S VOICE]\n\nIt\u2019s a brand new jet ski!

{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "So sure was Mr. Gr\u00f6ning of his own position that he went public in 2005 with long interviews retelling the minutiae of his experiences as what he termed a tiny cog in the gears of the Final Solution.\n\nIn 2011, though, German attitudes were transformed when John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian, was jailed in Munich for his involvement in the killing of 28,000 Jews at the Sobibor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\nMr. Demjanjuk, who died in 2012 before an appeal could be heard, \u201cknew he was part of an organization with no other purpose but mass murder,\u201d Judge Ralph Alt said at the time. The verdict opened the way for prosecutors to charge the handful of surviving death-camp personnel with complicity in the liquidation on the grounds of their membership in a criminal organization.\n\nMr. Gr\u00f6ning had volunteered for the Waffen SS in 1941 after training in civilian life as a bank teller, credentials that the SS determined qualified him to tally the cash and personal valuables seized from Jews transported to Nazi-occupied Poland. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of Auschwitz before,\u201d he said in 2005.\n\nDuring his time at the camp, from 1942 to 1944, his ledgers recorded Polish zlotys and Greek drachmas, French francs, Dutch guilders, Czech korunas, Italian lire \u2014 a range of currencies that reflected the reach of the campaign to eradicate Europe\u2019s Jews.\n\nHis remarks to interviewers, like his testimony a decade later at his trial near his home in L\u00fcneburg, in northern Germany, offered macabre insights into the privileged life he and his comrades had enjoyed in their quarters at Auschwitz, even as freight trains arrived to disgorge Jews destined for extermination.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere were tinned sardines, and bacon, vodka and rum, he recalled in an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel in 2005 \u2014 items denied to most German civilians, and, of course, to the SS\u2019s victims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe arrived in Auschwitz,\u201d he recalled at his trial, \u201cand there were all these things that we had not seen for a long time.\u201d\n\nOne currency confiscated from Jewish victims was the American dollar; it was used for clandestine transactions among camp personnel. At one point, by his own account, Mr. Gr\u00f6ning stole $30 from the sequestered funds to buy a handgun from a corrupt guard.\n\nIn interviews and in his courtroom testimony, Mr. Gr\u00f6ning acknowledged being present on two occasions when Jews were killed; in one instance, he said, a camp guard smashed an abandoned baby\u2019s head against the metal side of a truck. On the second occasion, he said, Jews who had escaped and taken refuge in a farmhouse were killed with the Zyklon B gas used for the broader extermination.\n\n\u201cThat was the only time I saw a complete gassing,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not take part.\u201d\n\nTwice, he maintained, he asked to be transferred from Auschwitz to combat duties. He equally acknowledged that his attitude toward those whose money he counted had been shaped by his upbringing.\n\nAs a child, he told Der Spiegel in 2005, he had played marbles in the street with Anne Selig, the daughter of a Jewish ironmonger whose store was next to his home. When Nazi storm troopers held up a sign outside the shop saying, \u201cGermans, do not buy from Jews,\u201d he said, he was unmoved.\n\nIndeed, so pervasive was the hatred of Jews that he recalled a song with the refrain: \u201cWhen Jewish blood begins to drip from our knives, things will be good again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then,\u201d he said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t even think about what we were singing.\u201d\n\nHe said that throughout his early life, as a member of ultranationalist movements including the Hitler Youth, he had been raised to believe that Jews were Germany\u2019s enemy within. His concerns about what he saw at Auschwitz related more to the modalities of killing than to its rationale or supposed principles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe had sworn an oath of loyalty, he believed the Jews were Germany\u2019s enemy,\u201d Mr. Rees, the BBC journalist, wrote in an article in 2015, \u201cand he knew that he could still manipulate his life at the camp to avoid encountering the worst of the horror.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of his trial \u2014 in a makeshift courtroom in an assembly hall chosen to accommodate the crush of survivors, lawyers, spectators and journalists \u2014 Mr. Gr\u00f6ning addressed the judge, Franz Kompisch, saying: \u201cIt is beyond question that I am morally complicit. This moral guilt I acknowledge here before the victims with regret and humility.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cas concerns guilt before the law,\u201d he added, \u201cyou must decide.\u201d\n\nMr. Gr\u00f6ning appeared at his trial as a silver-haired old man, a widower who found it difficult to walk unaided. Wartime photographs of him showed a self-confident and smiling young man in thin-rimmed spectacles, sporting the death\u2019s-head emblem of the SS on his cap.\n\nWhen the trial ended in mid-July 2015, Judge Kompisch ruled that for all his protestations, Mr. Gr\u00f6ning himself had taken the decision to accept \u201ca safe desk job\u201d at Auschwitz.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was perhaps affected by the era, but it was not because you were unfree,\u201d the judge said, adding that he \u201chad freedom to think\u201d and yet \u201casked to join the SS.\u201d\n\nOskar Gr\u00f6ning was born on June 10, 1921, at Nienburg, between Hanover and Bremen, in northern Germany. His mother died when he was 4 years old, and he was raised by his father, a stern textile worker who had emerged from World War I with a deep sense of grievance at the terms imposed on defeated Germany. Like others who shared his views, his father joined the Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet), an ultranationalist veterans\u2019 group.\n\nBy Mr. Gr\u00f6ning\u2019s account, his childhood was one of \u201cdiscipline, obedience and authority.\u201d He participated in the Stahlhelm\u2019s youth movement before joining the Hitler Youth. His formal schooling ended in 1938, when he was 17, and he began training as a bank clerk. A year later, war intervened.\n\nHis elder brother, Gerhard, died as a soldier near Stalingrad in 1942, and Mr. Gr\u00f6ning married his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Irmgard. Their first son, also called Gerhard, was born in 1944.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Gr\u00f6ning volunteered for the SS in 1941 during a recruitment drive at a hotel near his home. After his service at Auschwitz he was sent to join German forces in the Ardennes region, where he was wounded. But he returned to his unit before Germany\u2019s surrender in May 1945.\n\nHis initial instinct seemed to be to avoid mentioning his past. On a questionnaire handed to prisoners by their British captors, he said nothing about Auschwitz, he told Mr. Rees in 2005, telling them that he had worked for an SS administrative office in Berlin.\n\nIn 1946 he was shipped to England as a forced laborer, though he called his life there \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d\n\nBack in West Germany in 1947, with a job in a glass factory as his country began its postwar revival, Mr. Gr\u00f6ning told his family that the word Auschwitz and his connection to it \u201care never, ever to be mentioned again in my presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never really found inner peace,\u201d he told a German newspaper in 2013.\n\nIn 1977, a prosecutor in Frankfurt opened an inquiry into the activities of Mr. Gr\u00f6ning and 61 other SS members, only to determine, eight years later, that there were insufficient grounds for prosecution.\n\nMr. Gr\u00f6ning, a stamp collector, recalled later encountering a fellow philatelist, who told him that the Holocaust did not happen, according to accounts in Der Spiegel and elsewhere. He wrote a note to the man saying: \u201cI saw everything \u2014 the gas chambers, the cremations, the selection process. One and a half million Jews were murdered in Auschwitz. I was there.\u201d\n\nIn what some depict as a quest for exoneration, he wrote an 87-page memoir to his sons Gerhard and Wolfgang about his experiences. In 2005, he recorded nine hours of taped interviews for a BBC documentary.\n\nLater that same year, he told Der Spiegel, \u201cGuilt really has to do with actions, and because I believe that I was not an active perpetrator, I don\u2019t believe that I am guilty.\u201d\n\nA decade later, a court came to a different conclusion.", "title": "Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, the \u2018Bookkeeper of Auschwitz,\u2019 Is Dead at 96", "authors": ["Alan Cowell"]}

When you\u2019re photographing family, or the place you grew up in, or somewhere completely new and bewildering, how do you photograph it in a way that\u2019s beautiful and meaningful long after the trip is over?\n\nWhy Does Mt.

They\u2019re also unusual for another reason \u2014 the four faces of American presidents carved out of the mountain face. But it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ve seen the mountainscape more often in cartoons or popular culture than you have in their full, unrelenting glory in the Black Hills.

Blige, in a breakout performance; each woman played an indomitable character. But it was Allison Janney\u2019s unflinching performance as LaVona Golden, mother of the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding, that won prize after prize this season. Often a wise, warm, empathic onscreen presence, the 58-year-old Ms. Janney as LaVona was caustic and cruel, and almost upstaged by the pet bird that sat on her shoulder, pecking at her, for one extended, wickedly funny scene.\n\nSupporting actor\n\nPhoto\n\nAt 49, Sam Rockwell is the youngest of this year\u2019s supporting actor nominees, who include Christopher Plummer, 88, along with Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins and Woody Harrelson, who stars as the police chief to Mr. Rockwell\u2019s racist, dimwitted officer, Jason Dixon, in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d Mr. Rockwell is a master at playing unpredictable, unhinged men, and, because his Dixon undergoes a transformation \u2014 which is catnip for academy voters \u2014 he was able to show his range. Having already collected a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Bafta (the British equivalent of an Oscar), Mr. Rockwell\u2019s Oscar success is pretty much guaranteed.\n\nDirector\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile fans of Guillermo del Toro do not roundly consider the merman gothic fairy tale \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d his best picture \u2014 many rank it behind \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Backbone\u201d and \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth\u201d \u2014 all the momentum is there to secure him the win. \u201cShape\u201d leads the Oscars race with 13 nominations, and Martin McDonagh, the director of its biggest competitor for best picture, \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d did not manage to get a directing nomination. Mr. del Toro is widely respected and deeply liked, and buoyed by a \u201chis time is now\u201d narrative, along with wins at the Golden Globes, the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Baftas. If he nabs gold, it will be the fourth time in five years that a Mexican director has walked away with this prize.\n\nDocumentary\n\nPhoto\n\nUp until the Oscar nominations, prognosticators had their chips on the documentary \u201cJane,\u201d about the primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall. Instead, the academy voted for less sunny films that delved into endemic racism (\u201cStrong Island\u201d), civilian rescuers and medics in the Syrian war (\u201cLast Men in Aleppo\u201d), Russian doping (\u201cIcarus\u201d) and alleged bank fraud (\u201cAbacus: Small Enough to Jail\u201d). Out of the bunch, \u201cFaces Places\u201d stands out for its quirkiness and light, teaming the 35-year-old French artist JR, who slathers outsize photos of everyday folks across favelas, water towers and buildings worldwide, with Agn\u00e8s Varda, now 89, the filmmaker nicknamed the grandmother of the French new wave. The result is an idiosyncratic, bittersweet and tender film that is the favorite to win.\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nPhoto\n\nOf all the films nominated for Oscars this year, \u201cGet Out\u201d almost certainly had the most impact, with its unapologetic message (white liberals are racist too), box office success ($255 million worldwide on a $4.5 million budget), and four Oscar nominations, including best picture, actor and director, a stunning haul for an edgy comedy-horror picture. The film is a long-shot for best picture, and is outmatched in the director and actor categories, but academy members wanting to make sure it wins something will probably reward its writer-director, Jordan Peele, with best screenplay. \u201cLady Bird\u201d or \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d could also prevail, but having won best screenplay at the Writers Guild of America Awards, \u201cGet Out\u201d has the edge.\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nPhoto\n\nEven if James Ivory had not won this year\u2019s Writers Guild Award for adapting Andr\u00e9 Aciman\u2019s gay coming-of-age novel into the Oscar-nominated \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d he would still have been the sentimental favorite here. As one half of the powerhouse filmmaking team Merchant-Ivory, Mr. Ivory brought glorious period pieces like \u201cA Room With a View,\u201d \u201cHowards End\u201d and \u201cThe Remains of the Day\u201d to the screen. This category is unusual this year; it includes the superhero film \u201cLogan.\u201d But Mr. Ivory, who is 89 and has been nominated for an Academy Award three times before, is expected to clinch it.\n\nAnimated Feature\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is really, really, really hard to beat Pixar. The powerhouse production company has won nine Oscars in the last 10 years, six of them for animated features, including \u201cWall-E,\u201d \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cInside Out.\u201d Their visuals are gasp-inducing, their story lines reduce adults to tears. \u201cCoco,\u201d about a Mexican boy on a quest tied to the Day of the Dead holiday, proves no exception, while also giving props to Mexico, a country much maligned these days in the United States. This typically wide-ranging category includes \u201cThe Breadwinner,\u201d which is from the small Irish outfit the Cartoon Saloon and which counts Angelina Jolie among its executive producers; and \u201cThe Boss Baby,\u201d starring Alec Baldwin.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "But the Bivens decision has been a popular target for conservative commentators and judges, who critique it as an unjustified exercise in \u201cjudicial lawmaking.\u201d To that end, the Supreme Court over the past three decades has slowly narrowed that decision, culminating in its ruling last June in Ziglar v. Abbasi, in which Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a 4-2 majority, suggested that such remedies would be \u201cdisfavored\u201d going forward, effectively limiting the application of Bivens to its particular facts. In other words, unless a victim of a constitutional violation by a federal officer can identify an identical situation in which courts have previously recognized a damages claim under the Constitution, the Abbasi decision instructs the lower federal courts to reject the claim, no matter how clear and egregious the constitutional violation may have been.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Abbasi rested on two fundamental flaws \u2014 one of them doctrinal, the other, analytical. The doctrinal flaw was that the court completely ignored the rich history of damages suits brought against federal officers before the 1971 Bivens decision. Those cases were typically brought under state law, like a tort claim for trespass, and therefore involved an exercise of judicial power similar to the Bivens case in recognizing a remedy not specifically authorized by a legislative body.\n\nBut state tort lawsuits against federal officers acting within the scope of their employment were prohibited in 1988 when Congress passed a law requiring those cases to be brought as federal claims, if they could be brought at all. Thanks to Abbasi, then, the choice in cases like these is no longer Bivens or state law, as it was in 1971; today it\u2019s Bivens or nothing. Which is why the holding in Bivens \u2014 that damages remedies for violations of constitutional rights can be inferred when they are not explicitly authorized \u2014 is so essential to enforcing federal constitutional rights.\n\nAs to the analytical flaw, Abbasi, like the Supreme Court decisions leading up to it, was based on an understanding of the separation of powers that is entirely backward \u2014 that judicial recognition of a damages remedy without express authorization from Congress would unduly commandeer the authority of the government\u2019s political branches. But when, as in the Abbasi and Hern\u00e1ndez cases, the right comes from the Constitution, it would defeat the purpose of having independent, unelected judges \u2014 to say nothing of constitutional rights in the first place \u2014 if the enforcement depended upon the government, the very institution against which the rights would be enforced. This is also why it is laughable when judges and defenders of these rulings suggest that Congress could fix the problem. Of course Congress could provide \u2014 as it has with respect to constitutional violations by state officers \u2014 for an express, statutory remedy in those cases. But Congress has no incentive to similarly provide a remedy against the federal government (which would necessarily come at the expense of taxpayers) \u2014 and it never will.\n\nAs Justice Kennedy pointed out in Abbasi, courts have not shown the same resistance to enforcing the Constitution against the federal government when the constitutional violation is continuing \u2014 as we see in cases like the pending challenges to the travel ban. But the government can always make those cases go away simply by ceasing the purported unconstitutional conduct. And in any event, there are far more cases in which the constitutional violation was a singular event or ended long before the victim can make it to court \u2014 cases that, as Hern\u00e1ndez underscores, now have increasingly little chance of success.", "title": "Opinion | Our Increasingly Unenforceable Constitution", "authors": []}

Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option.\n\nLike our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react.

The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything.\n\nMuch of this is a reflection of who we have become.

Glynn, who served as general counsel in the Office of Government Ethics during Republican and Democratic administrations, when told by The New York Times about the Trump-Kushner talks.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Both companies on Friday confirmed their discussions about the hotel in Pier Village, while dismissing ethics concerns.\n\nThe plans under discussion in Long Branch have called for the Kushners to own the hotel and make payments to the Trump Organization to run it. The bonds issued by the city, part of a broader renewal effort, are not earmarked for the hotel, but they will support public infrastructure around Pier Village, and in turn help the hotel and nearby properties succeed.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast year, in another previously unreported endeavor involving the two family businesses, the Trump Organization began managing a Kushner-owned hotel in Livingston, N.J., people briefed on the matter said. That property, the Westminster Hotel, is believed to be the only hotel that the Trumps manage but do not brand.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes activity signals a deepening of the Trump-Kushner business relationship, which until recently appeared to be limited to a single residential project in Jersey City. It also poses potential ethical headaches for the White House, Ms. Glynn and other legal experts say.\n\nDeals between the two families, said Ms. Glynn, who also served as acting director of the ethics office for part of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, do not inherently violate any ethics rule. But, weighing whether new financial entanglements posed more of a problem than existing family ones, she added, \u201cI think the financial concerns trump the familial ones, so to speak.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWalter M. Shaub Jr., who led the ethics office under President Barack Obama and is a frequent critic of Mr. Trump, said: \u201cIf a subordinate is your son-in-law, maybe you like them, but once you have entangled business interests, they\u2019ve got leverage over you. Blood is not thicker than money for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Kushner Companies said the Trumps \u201chave zero equity of any type in our properties or businesses.\u201d In Long Branch, the statement said, \u201cwe are contemplating a third-party operator agreement with their hotel management division at market rate.\u201d Noting that it did not specialize in the hospitality industry, the company said it had \u201ca business obligation to seek the most capable resource.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Eric Danziger, the head of Trump Hotels, disputed that teaming up with the Kushners might pose a conflict.\n\n\u201cThis is a straight-up business deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were something out of the ordinary about the deal, then I think that question is fair,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe do market transactions that are reviewed and checked.\u201d\n\nMr. Danziger said that Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser, had asked about the financing involved in a potential Long Branch deal with the Kushners. Mr. Burchfield, who scrutinizes how the Trump Organization\u2019s partners finance deals, among other things, often requires more information before approving a deal.\n\nWhether or not the Trumps and Kushners reach a deal, Mr. Kushner stands to gain. He is expected to eventually own 20 percent of the hotel in Pier Village, according to documents obtained through a public records request. And he was personally involved in the project early in the presidential campaign. In documents provided to Long Branch, the Kushner Companies stated that Mr. Kushner \u201cis strictly a passive investor.\u201d\n\nHe also retains a stake in a Kushner residential tower in Jersey City that bears the Trump name.\n\nIn Livingston, Mr. Kushner has divested from the Westminster Hotel, a three-story property overlooking strip malls. While it is unusual for the Trumps to manage hotels that do not carry one of their brands, Mr. Danziger said he was discussing similar deals with other companies as a way to expand the business under the \u201cright circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn owner wants to know they can depend on and rely on the operator, and we have a lot of credibility as operators,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe growing relationship between the families could be helpful to the Trumps, as the ethical restraints they voluntarily adopted after the election have proved to be a hindrance to new business. The Trump Organization, which agreed not to start any new foreign projects during the presidency, has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.\n\nWhile Mr. Danziger said the pipeline of potential deals was \u201cstill very active,\u201d the company has also shown some signs of scaling back: Since the election, the Trump name has been removed from properties in Manhattan, Toronto and Panama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the Trumps manage a Kushner property that received foreign or domestic government funding, it could test the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Some legal experts argue that local bonds like the ones issued in Long Branch could brush against the domestic clause.\n\nThe Kushners, who co-own the development with Extell Development, a New York real estate firm, said they would not accept money from foreign governments.\n\nThe firm, however, has a history of seeking cash from investors with strong connections to foreign governments, including Anbang, an insurance company in China.\n\nThe Kushners also have a history of teaming up with Israeli investors, which is ethically thorny for Mr. Kushner, whose central responsibilities in the White House include handling Middle East policy. Extell\u2019s bonds have traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.\n\nThe Kushners also used money from Chinese investors to finance the construction of Trump Bay Street, the residential tower in Jersey City. The Chinese money came through the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for $500,000 investments in real estate projects. Federal prosecutors have been investigating the Kushner businesses\u2019 use of the program, though the company has said it no longer pursues this type of funding and \u201cdid nothing improper.\u201d\n\nIn addition, investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with foreign businesspeople, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn Long Branch, the Kushners are moving ahead with building the hotel in Pier Village and may add more hotels in the area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe talks with the Trumps have focused largely on the Pier Village property under construction, which might carry the Scion brand, a new line of four-star hotels the Trumps announced in 2016. The Kushner Companies, however, said on Friday that it planned only to have the Trumps manage the hotel.\n\nThe hotel construction is part of the latest phase of a decades-long effort to remake the Long Branch waterfront after a fire destroyed the boardwalk in 1987 and contributed to a downward spiral.\n\nMayor Adam Schneider and local business leaders spearheaded a redevelopment plan in the 1990s that gave rise to Pier Village. The effort increased the city\u2019s annual beachfront revenue from $200,000 in the early 1990s to more than $2 million in 2017, the mayor said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Kushners have long owned an oceanfront house in an exclusive section of town, and in 2014, they teamed up with Extell to buy Pier Village.\n\nWith the purchase, the Kushners took over the part of Pier Village that already had a row of restaurants and shops, as well as a vacant strip of land that will eventually feature luxury residential condominiums, retail stores and the hotel.\n\nMr. Kushner was involved in planning the project. He was copied on emails with city officials, and the mayor recalls meeting with him twice.\n\nMr. Kushner assumed a role in the White House, but his sister, Nicole Meyer, and his father, Charles Kushner, continued to work on the effort, including discussions with officials about the bonds.\n\nIn September, the City Council unanimously approved the bonds to help close a \u201cfunding gap.\u201d The city will borrow the money to reimburse Kushner Companies and Extell for approved costs that arise from building public improvements such as a boardwalk, public restrooms and a children\u2019s play area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schneider said that the arrangement would not cause a tax increase, and that the city had struck a better deal with the Kushners and Extell than with the previous owners of Pier Village.\n\nThe city expects to more than recoup its investment by collecting an annual service charge and other payments that the Kushners and Extell pay in lieu of certain taxes. And the city said it had obtained a personal guarantee from Charles Kushner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very lucrative deal to municipalities,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nA week after the city approved the bonds, emails show, Ms. Meyer invited local officials to lunch at the Beach House restaurant at Pier Village. \u201cPlease let us know if you would like to join,\u201d the invitation said, \u201cand thank you for all your support and efforts!\u201d\n\nWhen informed by reporters that the Trump Organization might ultimately be involved in a hotel in his town, Mr. Schneider, a Democrat first elected in 1990, sighed and expressed concern.\n\nBut he added: \u201cOur success is that we have a hotel that\u2019s doing a great volume of business that\u2019s creating jobs and economic vitality.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThis goes against the lore that you should have the dog sleep elsewhere,\u201d and not in the bedroom, said Dr. Lois E. Krahn, the study\u2019s senior author and a psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist at the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic. Her 6-year-old golden retriever, Phoebe, routinely sleeps on the floor in the bedroom \u2014 and in the colder months joins her and her husband on their bed. Both the dog and the people, she said, sleep fine.\n\nIn an earlier study from 2015, Dr. Krahn and her colleagues asked patients who had visited the Mayo Clinic\u2019s sleep clinic whether they owned dogs, cats or other pets. About half did, with many owning more than one. Forty-one percent said they perceived their pet as unobtrusive or beneficial to their sleep, compared to 20 percent who said their pet was disruptive. That study was self-reported, and \u201cwe can\u2019t quite trust people to have an accurate report or even be able to accurately observe their feelings for their pets,\u201d Dr. Krahn said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a parent\u2019s feelings for their child. I wanted to have objective data.\u201d Hence the recent follow-up report that used activity monitors to get objective data.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhere the pet sleeps \u201cdepends on the animal\u2019s temperament,\u201d said Dr. Carlo Siracusa, a veterinarian and the director of animal behavioral science at Penn Vet in Philadelphia. \u201cThere are dogs that tend to be more reactive to stimuli. So, for example, if the dog is on the bed and the owner turns and inadvertently hits the dog with the leg, some dogs will get startled and react out of fear,\u201d growling or barking and waking the sleeper, he said. Other dogs aren\u2019t bothered at all. \u201cIf there are no problems and the owner is happy with letting the pet in the bedroom, or on the bed, it\u2019s fine with me.\u201d\n\nHe added that a dog sleeping in the same room or bed with humans won\u2019t make Sparky think he\u2019s top dog. \u201cDogs can distinguish between the relationship with its human fellows and other dogs, and the way in which they regulate their interactions with humans in the house is not trying to establish a hierarchy,\u201d he said.\n\nSome dogs may not belong in the bedroom, such as very young or old pets who may not sleep through the night, a sick pet or a reactive pet who might become aggressive when startled or woken up suddenly. Also, if a new baby is entering the family and will sleep in the same bedroom as the parents, Dr. Siracusa said, that might no longer be a good place for the pet to sleep \u2013 not because of concerns of a pet smothering a baby, he said, but because space may be an issue with that many human and furry bodies in one room.\n\nIf a pet is already sleeping in your bed or in the bedroom and interfering with your sleep, you can take steps to transition a pet out of the bedroom. Dr. Siracusa said it is best to make the transition a gradual one rather than abruptly kicking the pet out of the bed or bedroom. That may mean first moving a dog from the human bed to a comfortable spot elsewhere in the bedroom, and then moving the pet just outside the door.\n\nThe key is to create a similar sleeping experience for the pet. Dogs may be attracted to humans\u2019 beds, especially if they\u2019re elevated, \u201cbecause they are comfortable and strategically in a good position,\u201d letting dogs keep watch over their surroundings, Dr. Siracusa said. Creating an equally strategic place might mean that it\u2019s also elevated, or that it has coverings that the dog can burrow under, or that it is near a heater that can simulate the warmth of the people in the humans\u2019 bed.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome dogs will never want to sleep with their owners, especially if the owner snores or moves around a lot at night. \u201cWhen dogs sleep, they want a safe space and don\u2019t want to be bothered,\u201d just like people, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFiguring out where a new dog should sleep can take some time. When Natalie Hastings and her husband adopted Mikey, a 70-pound boxer bulldog mix, they tried letting him sleep in the bed at first, but he shifted around so much they moved him onto a couch. But as Mikey became more settled in their home and he slept more soundly through the night, that changed. He started sleeping in the bed with Mrs. Hastings when her husband traveled for work. Now he\u2019s there all the time and, Mrs. Hastings says, helps her fall asleep faster.\n\n\u201cI have trouble settling down, and he\u2019s got very rhythmic breathing,\u201d she said of Mikey. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like white noise. And he\u2019s really warm.\u201d\n\nMore Reporting on Dogs\n\nDr. Krahn said the next step in her research is to study a larger group of dogs and their owners, and also to see whether having one or two humans in the bed makes a difference.\n\nShe\u2019d also like to do a similar study on cats, though they, of course, are entirely different animals. In addition to Phoebe, she has a 4-year-old cat, Oliver, who is allowed anywhere in the house except the bedroom because \u201cthe cat wanders, scratches, meows,\u201d she said. While most dogs can be trained, \u201cI think cats do what they want. If that cat is hungry in the middle of the night, that cat does not care\u201d about waking you up, she said.\n\nOliver the cat declined to comment.", "title": "Out of the Doghouse, Into the Bed", "authors": ["Jen A.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "A survivor whose life had been shaped by grief, Bront\u00eb was perhaps emboldened to write as few, if any, women had before: tales of resistance and insistence on trusting one\u2019s own sense of true morality, however unconventional. In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d she wrote from the first-person perspective of a child, an innovation that gave voice and power even to the very young; she created, too, a heroine who was, like Bront\u00eb herself, plain, pale, small, and yet frankly desirous, as well as worthy of desire.\n\nBront\u00eb once wrote to a friend that she considered the marital ambitions of women of no means or beauty \u201can imbecility which I reject with contempt,\u201d a practical response to the frank injustices of class and a kind of sexism. In her novels, however, those same plain women are entitled to not just any marriages, but to passionate, loving ones. The interior lives of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are shared in such detail that the characters\u2019 unfair burdens are plainly manifest; Bront\u00eb could make great sweeping plotlines of the small moments and humiliations in an unmarried woman\u2019s life. Lucy Snowe\u2019s struggle to find a private place to read a long-awaited letter reads, over several pages, with the suspense and drama of a Spenserian quest.\n\nA miniaturist of the soul, Bront\u00eb captured shades of emotion with a psychological subtlety that still feels exquisitely modern. When Lucy Snowe, battling depression, is advised to cultivate her own happiness, her strong response will feel familiar to many a 21st-century person who has the condition: \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHappiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure.\u201d\n\nShe had a mordant wit, which could protect her only so much from the series of losses that left her so fragile. \u201cIt is useless to tell you how I live,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1851. \u201cI endure life \u2014 but whether I enjoy it or not is another question.\u201d She startled readily, and wrote to friends complaining of crushing insomnia, a poor appetite, grief and flashbacks; she put off writing letters for fear of how dejected she would feel if the replies came too slowly. Her two most intense romantic passions \u2014 one, involving a married Belgian school master, was meticulously memorialized in \u201cVillette\u201d; the other, for her publisher, George Smith (also captured in the characteristics of a doctor in \u201cVillette\u201d) \u2014 were both unrequited.\n\nBut reader, she married, eventually, at the age of 38, choosing Arthur Bell Nicholls, a pastor who worked for Bront\u00eb\u2019s father. Although she acknowledged frankly that he was not her intellectual equal, he pursued her persistently, and against her father\u2019s wishes, possibly imbuing a late-in-life courtship with a jolt of romance.\n\nDid Bront\u00eb ultimately find the kind of happiness that she described as \u201ca glory shining far down upon us out of heaven\u201d? In \u201cVillette,\u201d Lucy Snowe describes her own feelings about happiness: \u201cThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives \u2014 the life of thought, and that of reality. And provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of strange and necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work and a roof of shelter.\u201d Once Bront\u00eb married, however, her life of thought suffered. \u201cMy own life is more occupied than it used to be,\u201d she wrote to a friend. \u201cI have not so much time for thinking.\u201d\n\nLiterature would no longer be the business of her life; whether the pleasures of marriage could offset that loss remains unclear. To one friend, she wrote, \u201cIt is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\u201d But several months later, she wrote, \u201cI have a good, kind attached husband, and every day makes my own attachment to him stronger.\u201d", "title": "Overlooked No More: Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Novelist Known for \u2018Jane Eyre\u2019", "authors": []}

This is a team that has been constructed, at almost unimaginable cost, to win the Champions League. As its coach, Unai Emery, said Tuesday, losing to Real Madrid is no embarrassment. \u201cIt is a team of champions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did not say that losing like this is, or should be. P.S.G., a team that cost half a billion dollars, did not rage against its fate. It did not hurl all it had at Real\u2019s defense, ending the game breathless and broken, fighting for pride, if nothing else.

It is quite another not to seem to care what the plan is, or was.\n\nThey were waiting for what they had decided was inevitable, for the blissful release of Brych\u2019s whistle, for the chance to return to what they do best: beating French teams with a fraction of their budget by six- and seven-goal margins. That is where this team really comes into its own.\n\nThis defeat \u2014 just like all those defeats in the last six years \u2014 does, at least, provide some answers.

It is open to debate quite how satisfying he has found his work here, anyway, trying to pick his way through a forest of delicate egos, political necessities and sporting realities.\n\nMainly, though, the latest elimination brought questions, ones that are growing ever more pressing.

Has Paris Saint-Germain, the club that has blown away all of its rivals, with only two teams in Manchester as exceptions, with its checkbook, simply not spent enough?\n\nOr is it time to look at the problem from another angle, to assume that perhaps success in soccer does not simply come from accumulating as much talent as possible and seeing what happens?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the moments after Ronaldo\u2019s goal just after halftime, when all seemed lost, it had nothing to fall back on, and so it fell apart instead.\n\nP.S.G. can make excuses.

In the aftermath, he lost 25 pounds. He vowed to return, training with ferocity, and now, here he was.

This moment, he told himself.\n\nThen down he went.\n\nRegardless of how Velasquez finished, he viewed the race as a triumph.

So the fashion community was stunned last summer when Mr. Saillard abruptly announced he was quitting in January to become artistic director of J.M.

In fashion museums, we always try to find a way to transmit certain ideas about what we are exhibiting: the history, the cultural context in which these items were created, the designer and the spectacle \u2014 because spectacle is so intrinsic to fashion.

Billions of dollars of investment would be necessary. The ideas of \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d seem to be based in recreating the economy of the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s. This and the return of coal to the high ridges of Pennsylvania seem a distant memory. Is revitalization of these old industries even a possibility? Aren\u2019t the jobs from the Rust Belt too expensive to get back? Or would another community\u2019s landscape be blighted instead? \u2014 CC, New Cumberland, Pa.\n\nPK: There\u2019s no way to bring back all those steel plants and steel jobs, even if we stopped all imports. Partly that\u2019s because a modern economy doesn\u2019t use that much steel, partly because we can produce steel using many fewer workers, partly because old-fashioned open-hearth plants have been replaced by mini-mills that use scrap metal and aren\u2019t in the same places. So this is all a fantasy.\n\nWhat is your critique of the anti-trade argument made by the Warren-Sanders wing of the Democratic Party: that free trade has been bad for the (proverbial) American worker and has been a significant contributor to America\u2019s rising income and wealth inequality? Is the answer simply that the benefits of free trade \u2014 lower prices generally \u2014 are diffuse and therefore underappreciated, whereas the costs \u2014 worker dislocation in particular sectors \u2014 are concentrated and thus easier to highlight? How much of America\u2019s increase in income inequality over the past half-century do you attribute to free trade?\n\nThank you for addressing this. \u2014 JG in CT, Greenwich, Conn.\n\nHow should we deal with the deindustrialization and loss of community that free trade has been causing?

In games, you know what\u2019s right and wrong, legal versus illegal; whereas in life, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPaul David Magriel Jr. was born on July 1, 1946, in Manhattan. His father, an immigrant from Latvia, was librarian at the American School of Ballet and curator of dance archives at the Museum of Modern Art. His mother, the former Christine Fairchild, was an architect.\n\nAs a child, Paul was remembered as a savant who rarely answered questions and spoke only when he had something to say. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and getting a perfect score on his college boards, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in math from New York University. At. N.Y.U., he was a fellow of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was later a National Science Foundation fellow at Princeton University, where he specialized in probability. He taught at the Newark College of Engineering (now part of the Newark Institute of Technology) from 1969 to 1973.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Magriel was married several times and divorced. His survivors include a son, Louis, with Ms. Oules, a French-born poker player, and a brother, Dr. Nicolas Magriel, a musician and teacher.\n\nMr. Magriel made his transition from chess to backgammon in Greenwich Village, at hangouts like the Olive Tree Cafe, while he was a doctoral student at Princeton and on track to become a math professor there.\n\n\u201cPsychologically, backgammon is very different from chess,\u201d Mr. Magriel said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exercise in frustration \u2014 you can make the right moves and lose, or you can make the wrong moves and win. And chess didn\u2019t have the gambling that I like.\u201d\n\nMr. Magriel grew increasingly gifted at backgammon, and consumed by it, cataloging, in the era before computers, thousands of potential playing strategies on index cards. And he ascended to more upscale venues, like the Mayfair Club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where wagers might be made for $1,000 a point.\n\nGambling, too, became an obsession. Coupled with that were on-again-off-again brushes with substance abuse and a preoccupation with his own celebrity in the rarefied world of backgammon, his first wife, Renee Roberts, said.\n\n\u201cHe had an incredible ability to concentrate his intellect on the things he wanted to know,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe had so much promise, but the gambling took him to a place where everyone was relating to him because of his fame.\u201d\n\nWith Ms. Roberts, he wrote the seminal \u201cBackgammon\u201d (1976) and \u201cIntroduction to Backgammon: A Step-By-Step Guide\u201d (1978). His Times column appeared from 1977 to 1980.\n\nMr. Magriel made a small fortune from backgammon and later low-stakes poker. Playing poker, sometimes huddled disheveled over a table, he was known for uttering a signature \u201cQuack, quack\u201d when betting (usually a bet beginning with 22, the pair of numbers known in backgammon as double ducks and in poker as ducks).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis more enduring legacy to the card game was his formulation of the M-ratio \u2014 a measure, named for him, of how many chips a player needs to sit passively and make only compulsory bets.\n\nFor all his expertise in any game that required mental acuity, Mr. Magriel found backgammon to be \u201cthe most frustrating, the cruelest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fascinating thing about backgammon is that it represents an interesting paradox,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1977, adding: \u201cPeople who want a sure thing don\u2019t make it in backgammon. There are risks, yes, but on the other hand there is an enormous amount of control needed, something most gamblers lack.\u201d\n\nIn 1977, he played a promotional match at the 21 Club in Manhattan against George Plimpton, the adventurous journalist and author who liked to slip into other careers and write about his experiences. (Mr. Magriel\u2019s original backgammon tutor, years earlier, had been Mr. Plimpton\u2019s wife, Freddy Espy, a decorator and artist.)\n\nIn this match Mr. Magriel had a serious handicap: He was playing Mr. Plimpton while blindfolded.\n\n\u201cI have nothing at stake except the honor of my psyche,\u201d Mr. Plimpton told The New Yorker. \u201cMy tactics are going to be to talk as much as possible, ply him with drinks, and do everything else I can to befuddle him. If he loses track of a single piece on the board, I win.\u201d\n\nMr. Plimpton lost.", "title": "Paul Magriel, Who Was Called the Best in Backgammon, Dies at 71", "authors": ["Sam Roberts"]}

This happened to Mr. Fujimori, who resigned in 2000 after fleeing to Japan. Congress rejected his resignation and impeached him instead. Years later he faced trial in Peru, and the country\u2019s Supreme Court sentenced him to 25 years in prison on human rights violations.\n\nLawmakers on Wednesday expressed anger that Mr. Kuczynski had not apologized.\n\n\u201cWe hoped that his resignation letter would have at least some self-criticism of the mistakes and crimes he may have committed,\u201d said Marco Arana, who leads the leftist Broad Front. \u201cInstead, he just plays the victim in his letter and doesn\u2019t admit anything.\u201d\n\nMr. Kuczynski was set to be replaced by his vice president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, who is also serving now as ambassador to Canada. Mr. Vizcarra himself was once forced by Congress to resign when he served in Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s cabinet, although opposition lawmakers have in recent weeks spoken highly of him. Mr. Vizcarra has not spoken publicly about the controversy, and it was not clear on Wednesday whether he was even in Peru.\n\n\u201cThis was a government that carved its tomb from Day 1,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. \u201cLooking forward, it\u2019s very unclear what will happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker and World Bank economist who was educated at Oxford and Princeton, campaigned in 2016 on a liberal platform that promised economic growth and \u201csocial revolution.\u201d He narrowly beat Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of the former leader.\n\nLast year, Congress accused Mr. Kuczynski of \u201cpermanent moral incapacity\u201d for profiting from contracts with Odebrecht, the Brazilian corporate giant now troubled by scandal, during a period in the early 2000s when he served as a cabinet member. Mr. Kuczynski said he was merely a shareholder in a company that profited from Odebrecht deals.\n\nCongress\u2019s impeachment effort had been enthusiastically supported by the Popular Force, the party led by Ms. Fujimori.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Kuczynski avoided removal in December, thanks to Ms. Fujimori\u2019s brother Kenji Fujimori, a congressman who split with his sister and carried enough lawmakers to his side to save the president. Two days after the failed ouster, Mr. Kuczynski pardoned Alberto Fujimori on medical grounds.\n\nThe apparent deal allowed Mr. Kuczynski to save his political career in the short term, but it soon created a much larger problem, analysts say. By pardoning the elder Mr. Fujimori, after his conviction as a human rights abuser, the president alienated supporters who had remained with him.\n\n\u201cIt was his willingness to do these dirty deals to stay in power that was key\u201d to his loss of support, said Jo-Marie Burt, a political scientist who studies Latin America at George Mason University in Virginia. \u201cHe betrayed many of the promises he said he would uphold.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was echoed widely in Peru on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry about this, but this is the end that Mr. Kuczynski deserves,\u201d said Pedro Cateriano, a former prime minister who counseled the president during the first impeachment attempt.\n\nThe tapes, recorded by an ally of Keiko Fujimori who pretended to be toying with the idea of switching sides, appeared to trace graft to the highest levels of government. They showed Kenji Fujimori, and some people close to him, offering favors and public works projects in exchange for political support.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one video, Bienvenido Ram\u00edrez, a congressman, bragged about all the benefits he had received because of his support of Mr. Kuczynski.\n\n\u201cIn less than a week I got the public works that I wanted,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez can be heard saying. He also mentioned that a government official had been assigned to help expedite any projects that were of interest to him.\n\nAnother government official tried to explain how to earn big rewards while in Congress.\n\n\u201cImagine, brother, that in a $100 million public works that you receive only 5 percent,\u201d said Freddy Arag\u00f3n, a government official who was fired Tuesday night. \u201cBrother, you get $5 million without lifting a finger.\u201d", "title": "Peru\u2019s President Offers Resignation Over Vote-Buying Scandal", "authors": ["Marcelo Rochabr\u00fan", "Nicholas Casey"]}
{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Michelle from Rockville wonders if family views have an influence:\n\nI am a 16 year old who feels strongly about politics, but I don\u2019t think the voting age should be lowered. At 16, teens are highly impressionable and easily succumb to peer pressure. Someone might vote for a candidate just because their friends or parents like them. Even though the article says that teens have the cognitive ability to make informed decisions, I still believe that the majority of 16 year old\u2019s would not make individual decisions. I consider myself a democrat, and I feel strongly about my views, but would I still feel the same way if my parents weren\u2019t democrats as well? I can\u2019t help wondering what I would be like if I was raised in a conservative household. Would I have the same views?\n\nLaura Armedaris from Washington, D.C., said younger teens were more than capable:\n\nI\u2019m 15 years old and I know several people that are 16/17 and are far more educated than some people over 18. If the question is if we are capableI believe we are, we are not stupid and especially with social media lots of us are involved with politics sharing our opinions but it hardly means anything when we can\u2019t even vote. We are giving political speeches at our walkouts, emailing congress, writing letters and marching for justice, we are more than capable to vote\n\nSammie from California said lowering the voting age would give more teens an opportunity:\n\nTeenagers today are much more exposed to politics thanks to the internet. They can follow it and form opinions on it easily because it\u2019s at their fingertips. If they\u2019re passionate about the issue being voted upon then they should be able to take part in the decision making. Teenagers aren\u2019t oblivious to what\u2019s going on in their country anymore and want to take some kind of action. Lowering the voting age would give the younger people of America opportunities to be apart of the community political-wise.\n\nPrashamsha Rayamajhi from Danvers, Mass., said both sides have merit:\n\nI think that both sides have equally convincing evidence. On the one hand, 16 year olds are still young, and barely forming their own political opinions. Many don\u2019t know what to believe in, and many others like to live in ignorance of political issues. However, time and time again, we have seen teenagers age 16 or 17 achieve amazing feats. In regards to the Florida shooting, the \u201cchildren\u201d are the ones moving for change in a broken system, when adults refuse to do so. Teenagers this age are full of hope; they are passionate and strong-willed, and some apply these qualities to political issues as well. Even though both sides make sense, I believe that the voting age should be lowered to age 16. In these times, children are maturing much faster. There are many sixteen year olds with more rational and sophisticated opinions than adults. Also, I think that although sixteen year olds may just be forming informed political opinions, they should have a say in issues that drastically affect their lives, like gun violence. And overall, younger people are the future of the world. Change usually comes from the younger generation.\n\nShelby Johnson from Massachusetts thinks younger teenagers would vote how their parents do:\n\nAs a 16 year old myself, I do not think that the voting age should be lowered to 16. While I do accept that 16 and 17 year olds are able to make rational decisions using \u201ccold\u201d cognition in a low-pressure situation such as voting, I do not think that their scientific capability to make choices should make them eligible to vote. The primary reason that I am opposed to 16 and 17 year olds being able to vote is that they are not yet legal adults. For the majority of teens, this means that they are under the care and control of their parents. While a huge population of young people is interested in current events and politics, and stays up to date on unbiased views of various topics, there are still large numbers of 16 to 17 year olds whose only knowledge of political controversy comes from their parents. Many young people have been fed their parents\u2019 ideas since birth, and when living at home have no source of outside knowledge. If teens who are not yet legal adults and therefore not yet independents are able to vote, I think that a large portion of this age group\u2019s voters would simply vote however their parents tell them to.\n\nBryce Hilton from the United States thinks the answer is an easy one:\n\nGo to a high school and interview 3 random 16 year olds. Ask them current political questions. 2 out of the 3 will have no clue what you\u2019re talking about. Enough said.\n\nDaniel Gonzalez from St. Cloud, Fla., thinks the research in the article is incomplete:\n\nThe status quo must be maintained due to the fact that elections aren\u2019t always \u201ccold cognition\u201d scenarios. Elections have been well known to be hectic with the emphasis of political and public pressure being based on the choice of the individual, therefore the brain relies on \u201chot cognition\u201d since the would-be voter is being pressured by peers and organizations. Studies have already shown that at 16 the part of the brain that processes \u201chot cognition\u201d is not fully developed and makes them more susceptible to emotional outbursts and the bias in decisions that follows, especially when a presidential candidate tries to poke at emotions to rally people together. This part of the brain is more developed in a 21 year old and is less likely (not never) to vote based on emotions.\n\nAnaly from St. Cloud would vote if the age were lowered:\n\nIf the voting age were to be lowered to 16, I would vote. Many of the decisions that voters decide on now are what teenagers enter once they are considered \u201cadults\u201d. College students, just as high school students, have the same ability to be swayed by their peers and are quick to make impulsive decisions if they are unaware of the topic. If voters are voting on education, being a student, I wouldn\u2019t want a 60 year old high school drop out making decisions on what will occur with my education. Also, how come we can register to vote at 16, yet not be able to vote? In order to register, I believe that some sort of maturity and responsibility is needed simply to reach out and desire to vote in the future.\n\nAnthe Dalkouras from Danvers thinks most 16-year-olds are not ready to vote:\n\nI do not agree with the writer\u2019s stance that the voting age should be lowered from eighteen to sixteen. At this age I do believe that some 16-year olds are capable of making these political decisions on what to vote for, but that does not pertain to most. At this age there are many 16-year-olds who do not pay attention to current events and what is happening in politics. Also, that they truly do not have a grasp on the meaning of the events. If I was able to vote at 17, I do not believe that I would because I do not necessarily pay attention to government actions unless I am talking about it in one of my classes. Also, 16-year-olds are not a legal adult yet so they are still living at home listening to their parents opinions. This could sway them in one direction instead of making their own decision on what to vote for. I believe that the younger audience is easier to direct in one direction by feeding them false information about a certain topic. Many have not been exposed to the harsh world of politics and what occurs in order to win votes. High school students are still able to have a voice even if they are not allowed to vote. There are the high school students from the school shooting in Florida speaking out on their opinions of gun control and what should happen to control it. These students are making a difference even though they do not have the right to vote.\n\nAizik Van Horne from Tempe says teenagers need and deserve a voting voice:\n\nI believe that the voting age should be lowered. Teenagers voices should be heard and people think that our opinions are unimportant and they look over them. Teenagers are close to being adults and expect to be safe during that period of time. When a gun is easier to get that a drivers license that is unacceptable. Gun laws should be raised to be stricter and more efficient than letting people get guns with disorders and mental disabilities. We expect to be safe and not have rampaging people with guns running around and killing people. Even if we are not adults our opinions should be heard!!!!!!!!!\n\nTucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., said 16-year-olds were too young, plain and simple:\n\nShould 16-year-olds be able to vote, let me take a moment to laugh. The issue with that is, we\u2019re kids. It might sting some to be called that, but that is because it\u2019s true. We aren\u2019t as focused or passionate on politics to make specific decisions that could affect the country as a whole. Sure, this can deal a lot with gun-control and drugs, but a few hundred thousand teens still aren\u2019t loud enough to reach the government. NRA, they control what happens with guns because they have the time, money, and power to toy with whatever they want. Drugs, I don\u2019t think we need to see a bunch of stoned kids walking around campus just because \u201cit\u2019s legal\u201d. Besides, most of us will just bandwagon off of somebody else\u2019s idea of society because we don\u2019t want to understand. Our job as student is to study so we can have a greater education that the generation before us, so we have a chance to make this country better for those who come after us.\n\nSolomon from Saco, Me., answered affirmatively:\n\nI agree with the writer\u2019s proposal to lower the voting age to 16. School shootings are happening more often then they should, so there needs to be an end to them. Having kids that are of the age of 16 and are in school would be a perfect time for them to start voting because when the kids are in school they would know what to vote on.\n\n_________", "title": "Pet Instagram, Adult Dorms and Overlooked Obituaries: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

The unposed portrait has been made in bright sunshine on a busy street, and we can see other people, blurred, behind him. The man is tanned, with a head of thinning white hair and a short white goatee. His collared shirt is pale, striped and open at the neck. He has rosebud lips and somewhat worried brows that make him appear lost in thought or on the verge of making a decision. Out of the flux of the street, a unique event has been preserved: this man, this moment, this mien.\n\nNow look at another portrait. It\u2019s the same man. Placed side by side with the first portrait, it immediately raises new questions. The look is almost the same: the tanned face, the small mouth, the dark, slightly furrowed brows. With his narrowed eyes, he seems a bit more preoccupied. His white goatee is fuller and more neatly shaped, giving him the debonair look of a knight in a Renaissance painting. In this second portrait, the man is all buttoned up, and he wears an ocher bow tie. Behind him this time is a different crowd, and instead of the taxi seen in the first picture, there is an armored truck.\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to go out into the street and take a stranger\u2019s picture. It is legal and, with the right equipment, technically simple. But how do you arrive at two pictures of the same person, with almost the same expression, on what seem to be different days? These photographs were made by the Danish artist Peter Funch, and they are part of a series of many such pairs. For nine years, from 2007 until 2016, Funch hung around Grand Central Terminal and watched commuters during the morning rush between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m. Using a long-lensed digital camera, he made countless portraits, an intriguing face here, another one there, yet another over there. He began to notice repetitions, the same people, the same faces, the same gestures, the same clothes. Each person was in the self-enclosed reverie of getting somewhere. The photos were all taken in May, June or July, in bright summer sunshine. The resulting project, published last year in a monograph titled \u201c42nd and Vanderbilt,\u201d is named for the street corner on which Funch stationed himself. It contains dozens of pairs of portraits (and a few in sequences of three), all of strangers.\n\nFunch\u2019s book contains women and men, the old and the young, people of all races and social classes. It looks like New York. One woman strides by with her chin raised and eyes closed. She wears a green blouse in one photo and a purple sweater in another. A man in a dark suit wears a peach-colored shirt in one photo and a blue one in the other, and he holds a cellphone in his right hand in both portraits. A woman crosses her arms, twice; another smokes, twice; another smiles, twice. There are two men walking side by side, and the same men walking side by side again. Do they know each other? They seem not to. There are three young women in medical scrubs, and surely they do know each other. One of them checks her phone, twice; another glances downward, twice.", "title": "Peter Funch Sees the Patterns in the People on the Street", "authors": ["Teju Cole", "On Photography"]}

In 2013, it was estimated that he owned only 0.2 percent of its stock.\n\nBut Mr. Munk led the life of an international billionaire. He had three homes in Ontario and houses in Paris and Switzerland, where he remained a keen skier late in life, and took to the sea in a 140-foot-long yacht, the Golden Eagle.\n\nHis associates included Prince Charles; fellow billionaires like Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of the French luxury goods maker LVMH; and Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative prime minister of Canada.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Barrick expanded globally, Mr. Munk often dealt with governments with widely condemned human-rights records. He devoted part of Barrick\u2019s annual meeting in 1996 to praising the economic program of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former military dictator in Chile, although Mr. Munk subsequently condemned General Pinochet\u2019s human rights abuses in a letter to the newspaper The Globe and Mail.\n\nAn electrical engineer by training, Mr. Munk often attributed his success at Barrick to his lack of a mining background. That meant, he said, that he made decisions about his company almost entirely from a financial perspective, introducing measures that offset the inevitable financial risks of mining.\n\n\u201cFor 100 years it was assumed that a successful mining company had to be run by miners,\u201d he told The Economist in 2014. \u201cWhat I did know was how to run a business.

The audio gear became popular internationally as much for its futuristic design as for its sound. Clairtone stereos appeared in films starring Frank Sinatra and Sean Connery.\n\nThe company\u2019s success led to a move from Toronto to a large manufacturing plant in Nova Scotia, drawn in part by the province\u2019s offer of 7 million Canadian dollars in assistance. Overwhelmed by a variety of problems, however, including an unsuccessful move into television and poor management of the company\u2019s growth, the founders were ousted in 1968. Clairtone collapsed six years later.\n\nMr. Munk was born into a Jewish family in Budapest on Nov. 8, 1927. When the Nazis occupied Hungary in 1944, Mr. Munk\u2019s grandfather Gabriel, a chocolate distributor and real estate investor, used most of the family fortune to secure train passage to Switzerland for 14 family members, including Mr. Munk and his father, Lajos.\n\nThe trip was organized by the Hungarian journalist Rezso Kasztner, who was credited with saving thousands of Hungarian Jews by shepherding them to Switzerland.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy then Mr. Munk\u2019s parents had long been divorced, and his mother, the former Katharina Adler, did not join the group. She was later sent to Auschwitz but survived.\n\nBy some accounts, his mother is credited with suggesting that Mr. Munk join an uncle in Canada. At 20, he left Switzerland for Toronto on a student visa to study at the University of Toronto. The odd jobs that financed his studies included selling Christmas trees.\n\n\u201cWhen he landed in Canada, he was stunned by what he viewed as a relatively pleasant atmosphere,\u201d said Anna Porter, a friend, former publisher and author of a book about Kasztner and his wartime rescue missions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout his business career, Mr. Munk publicly bemoaned the sale of Canadian corporations to foreign investors. \u201cHe chose to see himself as a nationalist,\u201d Ms. Porter said.\n\nHis first marriage ended in divorce.

It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.\n\nThe anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \u201cfor many reasons.\u201d\n\nThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\n\n\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri\u2019s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between Mr. Thiel\u2019s donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.\n\nThe news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\n\n\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother of Mr. Thiel\u2019s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\n\n\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201d\n\nMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.\n\nHe denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

On the title page, we see Vanessa and her family moving in to their new home. Then spreads set at school show her new-kid anxiety and loneliness, which take an ugly turn when she is bullied.\n\nA girl who witnesses the bullying (the \u201cI\u201d of the book\u2019s title) decides to walk Vanessa to school the next day. They are joined by a few friends, then more, and eventually a whole crowd, until it is the bully who is left out. Young readers will enjoy searching for the bully, whose red-and-white striped shirt is surely a wink at Martin Handford\u2019s Waldo.\n\nBrown-skinned Vanessa, her tan friend and the white bully are all big-headed moppets drawn with loose lines and plenty of personality. The abundance of white space and use of color keeps the focus on the characters; it also sets up a stunning nighttime spread of the girls depicted through their respective bedroom windows.

At first enthusiastic about trying to make those around her feel better, she grows discouraged when her attempts fail. \u201cMaybe there is nothing I can do to help in a big way. I feel small.\u201d\n\nThere are mildly jarring bumps in the text: an abrupt switch from recollection to present tense, and a confusing line that appears to be from the girl\u2019s consciousness when it should rightly be attributed to her teacher. By contrast, the heavily outlined images are steady and solid, including the closing spreads of the girl and her family planting flowers, which circle back to a scene at the beginning, affirming the resilience that can result when small acts are focused on community.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The narrator, a dark-haired child with pale skin, flounders in an effort to comfort her, then wonders, \u201cWhat does it mean to be kind anyway?\u201d\n\nThe narrator imagines possibilities, from baking cookies for a lonely neighbor to \u201ctelling Desmond I like his blue boots,\u201d then muses: \u201cSticking up for someone when other kids aren\u2019t kind is really hard. (And really scary.)\u201d\n\nTanisha and Kerasco\u00ebt\u2019s Vanessa are both depicted as dark-complected, with lighter-skinned children befriending them. White-savior narratives? Or examples of the dominant culture taking responsibility for dismantling racism? The distinction is one ripe for discussion.\n\n\u201cBe Kind\u201d concludes with the child\u2019s hope that a small act of kindness toward Tanisha might \u201cspill out of our school\u201d and expand to encircle the world. The vignettes portraying \u201cthe world\u201d include references to familiar architecture (pyramids, the Taj Mahal, pagodas), presumably to assist in identifying location; also, alas, with the potential to reinforce stereotypes. Even so, the combination of Pat Zietlow Miller\u2019s earnest text and Jen Hill\u2019s attractive images is likely to find a receptive audience among adults wanting to spark a conversation with children.

The deal called for the group to pay off the Weinstein Company\u2019s debt, which it believed totaled around $225 million. In return, the group would receive the majority of the studio\u2019s assets, which include \u201cProject Runway\u201d and a 277-film library.\n\nBut once the buyers began looking deeper into the Weinstein Company\u2019s finances, they discovered that it had more debt than they had been led to believe, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Additional liabilities totaling between $55 million and $65 million were discovered, including $27 million in unpaid residuals and profit participation; and $20 million in accounts payable.\n\nThe Weinstein Company\u2019s board said in a statement that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the investors\u2019 decision to pull out of the agreement.", "title": "Planned Sale of the Weinstein Company Collapses Again", "authors": []}

Having built its North Korea policy on sanctions and threats of military action, the administration must now learn the language of engagement.\n\nIt also served as a reminder of how many hurdles lie ahead before Mr. Trump\u2019s spontaneous decision on Thursday afternoon leads to a meticulously staged meeting between the American president and the dictator who rules the world\u2019s most reclusive country.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean offers typically come with caveats and asterisks that need to be examined,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, a former Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe all hope that the multiyear pressure campaign has had an effect, but we shouldn\u2019t prematurely celebrate.\u201d\n\nAt the State Department, where some diplomats quietly applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s gamble, there was a fear that more hawkish aides in the White House might throw up further hurdles to the meeting. The White House, they said, has invested more in sanctions and military options than in diplomacy. Officials there have in the past expressed frustration about what they viewed as the Pentagon\u2019s reluctance to provide options for a military strike on the North.\n\nWith all the potential traps and internal misgivings, some officials said they believed the chances of a meeting between the two leaders actually happening were less than 50 percent.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision stunned allies and his own advisers, not least Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was caught unaware while traveling in Africa when the president accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s lack of involvement in the announcement underscored how marginalized the State Department has become in North Korea policy. The department\u2019s chief negotiator on the North, Joseph Yun, resigned from the Foreign Service last week.\n\nOther State Department officials insisted that Mr. Tillerson had not been singled out; Mr. Trump blindsided all of his advisers. And the secretary, speaking to reporters in Djibouti, argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was not the bolt from the blue that it seemed.\n\n\u201cThis is something that he\u2019s had on his mind for quite some time, so it was not a surprise in any way,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cHe\u2019s expressed it openly before about his willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 expressed concerns about a meeting, according to a senior official. But nobody vocally opposed it.\n\nMr. Trump also had to mollify a rattled ally, Japan, which got no advance notice of his decision. In a call, the president reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the United States would not ease its pressure campaign on North Korea. Mr. Abe, officials said, asked for a meeting with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call on Friday morning with President Xi Jinping of China was more relaxed. The Chinese have long called for direct talks between the United States and North Korea. American officials said they expected that Mr. Xi would offer Beijing as a venue for the meeting.\n\nThe location is one of a number of unresolved issues, including the size and composition of the delegations and the agenda. Some officials said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim would set a broad framework for the talks, and leave the actual negotiating to subsequent sessions with lower-level officials. Even the logistical issues might require a couple of preliminary meetings, they said.\n\nStill, the lack of direct communication between Pyongyang and Washington was a yellow light to some experts. The two countries communicate through independent channels, one of which \u2014 the \u201cNew York Channel\u201d \u2014 goes through North Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn recent months, these channels have been used mostly for communications about Americans detained in North Korea. Mr. Yun, the former State Department negotiator, used such a channel to negotiate the return of Otto F. Warmbier, the college student from Cincinnati who suffered an irreversible brain injury while held in prison in Pyongyang.\n\nAt some point, officials said, they expected North Korea to send a message about the Trump-Kim meeting through one of the channels. The administration will parse it carefully to assess if it aligns with the message brought to Washington by the South Korean envoys.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has tried tirelessly to broker a meeting between American and North Korean officials. He sent his envoys \u2014 Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, the director of the intelligence service \u2014 to the White House almost immediately after they returned from their meeting with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang.\n\nThe message from the envoys, American officials said, was that the economic sanctions had really crippled the North. Mr. Kim, one official said, referred to North Korea as a poor country.\n\n\u201cThis was the most forward-leaning report that we\u2019ve have had in terms of Kim Jong-un\u2019s \u2014 not just willingness \u2014 but his strong desire for talks,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cWhat changed was his posture in a fairly dramatic way that, in all honesty, came as a little bit of a surprise to us.\u201d", "title": "Planning Begins for Kim Jong-un Meeting Some Trump Aides Believe Will Never Happen", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}

Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: \u201cShe\u2019s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.\u201d\n\nIn her absence, Baldwin said, \u201cJared Kushner\u2019s basically the hottest chick left in the place.\u201d And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster\u2019s name in front of it.\n\nTurning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: \u201cBoth sides hated it. I don\u2019t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.\u201d\n\nIn other highlights from the episode:\n\nSurprisingly Topical Monologue of the Week\n\nThough he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the \u201cInside the NBA\u201d analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began:\n\nI\u2019m an athlete, and athletes have been speaking out a lot this year. They\u2019ve been kneeling during the anthem, refusing to go to the White House, and a lot of professional athletes are worried about speaking out might hurt their career. Well, here\u2019s something that contradicts all of that: me. I\u2019ve been saying whatever the hell I want for 30 years, and I\u2019m doing great. I\u2019m hosting \u201cS.N.L.\u201d for the fourth time, for no reason. Lorne Michaels just wanted somebody to talk to about \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But this country\u2019s had a great tradition of athletes speaking their minds. Muhammad Ali changed the way people thought about Vietnam. Jim Brown had people thinking about race. Michael Jordan even thought it was O.K. for humans to play with Looney Tunes.\n\nAlluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham\u2019s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added:\n\nWell, some folks think we\u2019re all spoiled millionaires. But athletes work hard. \u2026 But some people don\u2019t want to hear from professional athletes. Like this lady on Fox News who told LeBron James to shut up and dribble. And dribbling\u2019s like LeBron\u2019s only fourth thing he\u2019s good at. Shooting, passing, and magically making his hairline come back. But the media does this stuff all the time. I went to President Obama\u2019s 50th birthday party. They got video of me, Jay-Z, Steve Harvey and Grant Hill at the party, and Fox News called it a \u201chip-hop barbecue.\u201d First of all, we were the only four black people there. And three of us ain\u2019t even in hip-hop. So calling it a hip-hop barbecue is like calling any tournament Tiger [Woods] plays in \u201cDef Golf Jam.\u201d\n\nAt the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Michael Che. \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand for the anthem,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cUnless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.\u201d\n\nChe responded: \u201cI stay seated for the anthem, because I\u2019m still in my Uber.

But podcast listeners still constitute a very different audience than viewers of network sitcoms, with different sensibilities. And the elements that make a podcast spark \u2014 internal conflict, patient world building, conversational digressions \u2014 don\u2019t translate seamlessly to TV.\n\n\u201cThere were things we loved about the podcast, but we had to turn it into an ABC show,\u201d Mr. Braff said.\n\nSo the inside story of starting a podcasting company is refocused as a broad family comedy. Mr. Blumberg\u2019s real-life business partner, the Gimlet co-founder and president Matt Lieber \u2014 who holds an M.B.A. from M.I.T. and started his career at NPR and WNYC \u2014 is recast as a scrappy salesman played by Michael Imperioli. It\u2019s a bid to differentiate the characters and inject an Everyman foil to the insular and often absurd podcaster culture on display. \u201cWe wanted to have an in for the layman who has no clue what a podcast is,\u201d Mr. Braff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a character who is comically na\u00efve to this whole world.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s an invented character, the female producer Deirdre, whose central personality trait is that she is hopelessly in love with Alex \u2014 a retrograde note not on display in Gimlet\u2019s offices or in its shows. Also, Alex carries a comically oversized old-time microphone with him everywhere he goes, a way to visually telegraph his job to viewers. In real life, \u201cit\u2019s not so big,\u201d Mr. Blumberg conceded. Mr. Sacca, though, is unchanged: After an acting crash-course from Mr. Braff, the investor played himself.\n\nPersonality-based podcasts offer the temptation of a more effortless adaptation. Earlier this year, HBO spun the WNYC podcast \u201c2 Dope Queens,\u201d starring the comedians Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams, into a four-part live special, and the network has struck a deal with the Obama staffers-turned-podcasters of \u201cPod Save America\u201d to air a live series in the lead-up to the 2018 midterms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dramatically alter their formula, and that took the pressure off them to continue doing what they were already doing so well,\u201d Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president for programming at HBO, said of \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSome transitions from audio to visuals feel natural: The comedians Desus Nice and the Kid Mero\u2019s cult hit \u201cBodega Boys\u201d podcast has translated easily to the Viceland late-night talk show \u201cDesus & Mero.\u201d\n\nOthers, not so much. When the beloved podcast host Bill Simmons tried to take his interview style to HBO, on the late-night program \u201cAny Given Wednesday,\u201d he floundered onscreen. And even the most promising projects can fall through: \u201cSerial\u201d was optioned in 2015 for development by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the filmmaking team behind \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d and \u201c21 Jump Street,\u201d but the project languished and the option has since expired. The Serial team is now in talks to adapt its American gothic true-crime serial \u201cS-Town.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mediums want very different things,\u201d said Mr. Blumberg, who previously worked for \u201cThis American Life,\u201d including on that radio program\u2019s TV adaptation that aired on Showtime from 2007 to 2009.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When Mr. Davis came knocking for \u201cStartUp\u201d in 2015, Gimlet ceded creative control of the adaptation to the network. At the time, Mr. Blumberg said, \u201cwe were barely putting our podcasts out the door.\u201d\n\nNow, Gimlet is developing and pitching its podcasts instead of waiting for Hollywood to call, and in January, the company started Gimlet Pictures, a new division headed by Chris Giliberti. \u201cHomecoming,\u201d the podcast network\u2019s first scripted thriller, is now headed to Amazon, and this time, \u201cour fingerprints are all over it creatively,\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\n\nMr. Giliberti has an office on the studio lot, and he flies out to Los Angeles from Gimlet\u2019s Brooklyn offices every couple of weeks. Eli Horowitz, who wrote the Gimlet show with the screenwriter Micah Bloomberg, is acting as showrunner of the Amazon series. Gimlet also recruited the show\u2019s director, Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d; helped staff the writer\u2019s room; and cast the star, Julia Roberts. (Gimlet\u2019s representation with CAA, Ms. Roberts\u2019s agency, helped.)\n\nGimlet is also working to develop an episode of its tech podcast \u201cReply All\u201d \u2014 about a charismatic figure who used a new technology, radio, to manipulate the masses \u2014 into a film. The director Richard Linklater and the star Robert Downey Jr. are attached. Gimlet also recently recruited a new chief marketing officer, Jenny Wall, who\u2019s worked at Hulu and Netflix.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Gimlet recorded the first season of \u201cStartUp,\u201d the drama of the show hinged on the financial and personal risk of establishing a podcasting company. But relatively low-cost audio shows carry less financial risk than TV and film projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Gimlet produced \u201cHomecoming,\u201d it could land in-demand actors like Oscar Isaac and Catherine Keener because it required only a couple days of work in front of a mic. The same is true of the network\u2019s next scripted series, its first dramedy.\n\n\u201cActors are open to doing a show with us because they don\u2019t have to put on makeup, they don\u2019t have to put on their Spanx, they don\u2019t have to go on location,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, interesting creative work that doesn\u2019t require so much.\u201d Then, when the company pivots to casting an adaptation, it helps to already have respected actors in the audio version. As Gimlet pursued Ms. Roberts for \u201cHomecoming,\u201d it was able to send her the podcast with Ms. Keener in the role to help prove the company\u2019s bona fides.\n\nStudios and networks are not only drawn to the proven storytelling a podcast provides, but they also like the built-in fan base \u2014 one that\u2019s easier to reach and engage than, say, people who have bought a book. Tens of millions of listeners have downloaded StartUp, and \u201cnow Gimlet can go back to those people and tell them about \u2018Alex, Inc.,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s great synergy.\u201d\n\nFor podcasters, adaptations also offer the prospect of drawing even bigger audiences to the original audio show.\n\nAaron Mahnke of the podcast \u201cLore,\u201d who now serves as executive producer and narrator of the Amazon adaptation, has seen new listeners stream in from Amazon. These days, \u201ca story can exist in a variety of different mediums,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all feeds itself.\u201d\n\nBut only to a point. \u201cWhen we see headlines announcing a podcast gold rush, there\u2019s a shift in the people who bring content to the table,\u201d Mr. Mahnke said of \u201cLore,\u201d which hit the jackpot with its Amazon deal. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with the medium of podcasting, and I\u2019m conscious of how we can manage this growth without burning our listeners,\u201d he said. \u201cMy caveat is this: Don\u2019t get into it for the money.\u201d", "title": "Podcasts Get the Hollywood Treatment, Complete With Zach Braff", "authors": ["Amanda Hess"]}

It was a reminder that for all the power of video to get to the truth, the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t always ensure that relevant video evidence ever makes it into court. The justice system offers few solutions to incarcerated defendants who insist that video footage will vindicate them. Yes, defense attorneys can dispatch investigators to gather video, and they often do so. But those investigators have no legal authority to force a bodega owner or a property manager to hand over surveillance footage.\n\n\u201cEspecially larger buildings, they are not going to respond to an investigator with a USB\u201d flash drive, said Cynthia Conti-Cook, a Legal Aid lawyer. If the bodega owner or property manager insist they are too busy to help, or just don\u2019t want to get involved, the defense can ask a judge for a subpoena. But that takes time, and in the intervening days there is a decent chance the footage will be deleted, Ms. Conti-Cook said.\n\nHold More Suppression Hearings\n\nPolice officers take the witness stand in open court in far fewer cases than one might expect. The reason is that the vast majority of arrests result in a plea deal or dismissal.\n\nSuppression hearings \u2014 which are held ahead of a trial and are often used to test the constitutionality of the police\u2019s conduct \u2014 are somewhat more common than trials, but are still rare. The court system doesn\u2019t track how many occur. But data provided by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office indicates that only about 2.4 percent of felony cases that do not end in a guilty plea at the initial arraignment wind up having suppression hearings in Manhattan.\n\nThese are the hearings at which judges scrutinize police credibility. Judges sometimes base their conclusions on the consistency or inconsistency of an officer\u2019s testimony. Or judges might point out contradictions, if serious enough, between officers\u2019 accounts. They are, defense lawyers said, often the best chance to get at the truth of how an arrest or investigation unfolded.\n\nMore suppression hearings would be a good thing, almost everyone agrees.

Francis wants a compromise with Beijing that would reconcile China\u2019s underground Catholic Church, loyal to Rome, with the Communist-dominated \u201cpatriotic\u201d Catholic Church. Such a reconciliation, if accomplished, would require the church to explicitly cede a share of its authority to appoint bishops to the Politburo \u2014 a concession familiar from medieval church-state tangles, but something the modern church has tried to leave behind.\n\nA truce with Beijing would differ from the truce with the sexual revolution in that no specific doctrinal issue is at stake, and no one doubts that the pope has authority to conclude a concordat with a heretofore hostile and persecuting regime. Indeed, he is building on diplomatic efforts by his predecessors, though both of them declined to take the fraught step to a formal deal.\n\nBut the two truces are similar in that both would accelerate Catholicism\u2019s transformation into a confederation of national churches \u2014 liberal and semi-Protestantized in northern Europe, conservative in sub-Saharan Africa, Communist-supervised in China. They are similar in that both treat the concerns of many faithful Catholics \u2014 conservative believers in the West, underground churchgoers in China \u2014 as roadblocks to the pope\u2019s grand strategy. They are similar in that both have raised the specter of schism by pitting cardinals against cardinals and sometimes against the pope himself.\n\nAbove all, the two truces are similar in that they both risk a great deal \u2014 in one case, the consistency of Catholic doctrine and its fidelity to Jesus; in another, the clarity of Catholic witness for human dignity \u2014 for the sake of reconciling the church with earthly powers. And they take this risk at a time when neither Chinese Communism nor Western liberalism seem exactly like confident, resilient models for the human future \u2014 the former sliding back toward totalitarianism, the latter anxious and decadent and beset by populist revolts.\n\nWhich means that if these two bets go badly the Francis legacy will be judged harshly \u2014 in spite of his charisma, his effect on secular observers, and all the other elements of the \u201cFrancis effect.\u201d\n\nThe risks of the Chinese gamble are already apparent in the weirdly sycophantic language that Francis\u2019 allies have used toward the Communist regime, and their eagerness to reassure Beijing that unlike, say, American evangelicals, Rome would never take the threatening step of mixing religion and politics.\n\nIf current trends continue, China could have one of the world\u2019s largest Christian populations by this century\u2019s end, and this population is already heavily evangelical; indeed, the Vatican\u2019s desire for a deal with Beijing is influenced by the fact that a divided Chinese Catholicism is being outcompeted for converts.", "title": "Opinion | Pope Francis Is Beloved.

Harper, the Conservative prime minister at the time, apologized on behalf of the government and established the reconciliation commission.\n\nChief Bellegarde said that the pope\u2019s direct apology in 2015 during a trip to Bolivia for \u201cgrave sins\u201d committed by the church against Indigenous people in the Americas gave him confidence that a similar apology over residential schools was still possible.\n\nThe schools operated from 1883 until the last one closed in 1998. The commission found that children were severely punished for speaking Indigenous languages or following their cultural practices. It concluded that 3,201 students died while in the schools, often from mistreatment or neglect. About 80,000 former students are still alive.\n\nPope Francis has tried to decentralize authority away from the Vatican and giving more authority to local bishops. And while some in the Vatican bristle at the notion that the pope should have to answer to a request of a secular government, the more important factor could be what guidance came from the bishops in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe big question is what is the position of the Canadian bishops on this,\u201d said Thomas Reese, a veteran Vatican watcher and senior analyst at Religion News Service. \u201cIf the bishops are saying \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 he is getting mixed signals and he tends to support the local bishops.\u201d Mr. Reese added that \u201cfor him to turn down the bishops and the government, that would be noteworthy.\u201d\n\nSome in the Vatican have worried about the legal implications of apologies in cases with potentially large damages. About 50 Catholic organizations agreed to a financial settlement in the case of residential schools but were unable to raise enough money to fully cover the commitment. A 2015 court ruling released them from fulfilling the agreement.\n\nYet popes have recently made a habit of public apologies.\n\nAfter apologizing for Catholic involvement in the slave trade, the church\u2019s treatment of Jews and treating Galileo as a heretic, Pope John Paul II issued in 2000 a sweeping blanket request for forgiveness for the church\u2019s sins over the past 2,000 years. \u201cRecognizing the deviations of the past serves to reawaken our consciences to the compromises of the present,\u201d John Paul II said.\n\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI apologized with \u201cshame and remorse\u201d to the victims of decades of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland.\n\nIn addition to his apology in Bolivia, Francis asked for forgiveness in 2017 for the church\u2019s role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide. As recently as January, Francis apologized to Chilean victims of abuse, though he created a larger problem for himself and his pontificate when he defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up that abuse.\n\nThe letter to Canada\u2019s Indigenous people said the pope was considering a trip to Canada and would make meeting Indigenous people a priority in the event of a visit.", "title": "Pope Rejects Call for Apology to Canada\u2019s Indigenous People", "authors": ["Ian Austen", "Jason Horowitz"]}

Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.\n\nThe Mission E vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market. Last week, Jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric I-Pace crossover, which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of 2018. The Jaguar I-Pace, the carmaker\u2019s first electric vehicle, will start at $69,500 in the United States; a Tesla Model X starts at $79,500.\n\nAudi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.\n\nPorsche, Jaguar, Audi and other long-established carmakers have watched as Tesla has sprinted ahead, but Tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap: tax benefits. At some point this year, Tesla will produce its 200,000th car. (General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Volt electric vehicles, will most likely reach that mark in 2018, too.) At that milestone, federal tax credits will begin to phase out.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201d\n\nThe wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.\n\nThe concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others.

There have also been quality issues; Consumer Reports ranked the Model X among the 10 least-reliable vehicles in its survey, and there have been well-documented fit and finish problems.\n\nThat has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3.

Alizadeh raps, \u201cLet me scream, I\u2019m tired of silence,\u201d while lifting a Western-style wedding veil. Beneath it her face is made up to look as if she\u2019s been beaten: swollen eyes and bruised jaw. It\u2019s a powerful image, one that Bagieu doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw into the strip.\n\nVideo\n\nAnd Bagieu\u2019s drawings are wonderful. Though sometimes spare, with minimal effort spent on backgrounds, her line manages to flow and skate through 29 stories of remarkable women. These drawings can act. They are alive with gestural attitude. They move, dance, struggle, fight back, fall in love, resist and wonder at the world. Some ham it up. Some suffer terrible abuse. To her credit, Bagieu doesn\u2019t back away from drawing the marks of violence on their faces and their bodies, which may come as a surprise to those who are expecting a rah-rah young adult girl-power sort of read.\n\nBagieu calls these comics \u201cbroad stroke portraits,\u201d and explains the sometimes too breezy storytelling this way: \u201cThis book is by no means a thorough scholarly work; rather, it\u2019s one woman\u2019s tribute \u2014 my homage to the full, daring lives they lead, often against great odds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of her stories follow a similar pattern. Almost every page has nine frames and each biography begins with a portrait drawn in a beribboned oval template. They cover the birth, life and death of each of her subjects in a way that can feel a bit formulaic, but this seems to have more to do with the fact that the English translation is typeset rather than in Bagieu\u2019s handwriting.\n\nIn the original version of these strips, which are luckily available in French on the Le Monde website, where they originally appeared, the difference is instantly apparent. The nature of handwriting gives the portraits a more personal \u201cvoice.\u201d It feels as if Bagieu herself is telling you these stories. They lose their Wikipedia tone and become more intimate, more like that of a cool fairy godmother recounting tales you need to hear without too much worry about sources, originality or historical accuracy. Her handwriting preserves her passion, along with clear intent to both delight and embolden the reader.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s painful to see this crucial part of her work replaced with type. It changes everything about how the stories are received. The reading speed is altered. The tone and the visual relationship between the text and the drawing just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s her handwriting that makes these panels spring to life. Panels that seemed awkwardly composed suddenly become elegant and beautifully balanced. It\u2019s hard for people to understand the importance of a cartoonist\u2019s handwriting. In the same way melody transforms lyrics, handwriting transforms words and can have a profound impact on how the story is received and understood.\n\nSadly, nearly every scrap of Bagieu\u2019s lovely handwriting has been scrubbed and replaced in this translation, even when completely unnecessary. The only clue to this \u201cvoice\u201d is a rare lettered sign here and there, and her name, \u201cP\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\u201d sweetly signed at the end of each strip.\n\nThese \u201crebel ladies\u201d come from all over the world (though surprisingly over a third of them are American). They also come from all points in time, like Agnodice, whom Bagieu presents as a gutsy gynecologist from ancient Greece, to the astronaut Mae Jemison (the one with the tight Afro), to the \u201cAnimal Whisperer\u201d Temple Grandin and the \u201cLover of Modern Art\u201d Peggy Guggenheim (she\u2019s the one with the wild sunglasses). Bagieu includes sets of siblings, like the Wiggins sisters, who were forced by their father to form a rock band called \u201cThe Shaggs,\u201d and \u201cLas Mariposas,\u201d the Dominican Republic\u2019s Mirabel sisters, who were murdered during the Trujillo regime in 1960. And she profiles too one of my favorite women, Frances Glessner Lee, who helped crime scene investigators hone their craft by creating intensely accurate miniature replicas of rooms where murders took place.\n\nBagieu has dedicated this book to her own daughters, and I kept that in mind as I read it. When I imagine her telling these stories to them, I\u2019m reminded of something my grandmother would say when she told me these kinds of tales. \u201cOf course it is only a story my dear. But it is true!\u201d Bagieu\u2019s pen transforms these true stories into something that has the tone of a personalized fairy tale.

The \u201cEngland\u201d sign has long been permitted, he said, because it simply represents the overwhelming desire among the Irish for a unified nation and is not meant to express anti-British sentiment.\n\n\u201cThere still are strong feelings that England still occupies six counties of Ireland,\u201d he said, adding that in his 25 years on the board no one has ever raised objections.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A similar ban was ordered in 1983, when Michael Flannery, an ardent I.R.A. supporter, was named grand marshal, and called it \u201ca pro-I.R.A. parade.\u201d\n\nDuring those years, many marchers brazenly flouted parade regulations by carrying signs supporting icons of the I.R.A. movement, including Bobby Sands, who died during a hunger strike in Northern Ireland in 1981.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the years, some gay groups argued that since the \u201cEngland\u201d banner was permitted, gay groups should also be able to march under their own banner.

So Demeny voting might change the balance of power within each coalition rather than benefiting either party overall: Hispanics and low-income families would have more clout within the Democratic Party, and the Hannity-obsessed elderly would cede influence within the G.O.P. to the minivan-driving middle-aged.\n\nBoth shifts would be positive. American life is increasingly polarized by age, with our politics tilted rightward by aging baby boomers voting Trump to hold off a millennial-ruled future and our cultural and commercial spheres devoted to pandering to the fashions of the adolescent. Parents, mostly Gen Xers now, are as well-positioned as any group to play a mediating role \u2014 and they will be more likely to play it effectively if they have the political power to redirect more resources to the beleaguered, ever-more-expensive cause of procreation.\n\nSuch a system, of course, would turn politically aware teenagers who differed ideologically from their parents into domestic dissidents, their citizenship hijacked, their support for an alderman who wants to build a skate park subsumed by their dad\u2019s desire to make the local dog park great again. I\u2019m personally not all that troubled by this injustice, but I\u2019m happy to offer concessions to my 16-year-old self. There\u2019s no reason Demeny voting when kids are small can\u2019t coexist with giving teenagers the vote a little earlier, if that\u2019s what\u2019s required to make their parents\u2019 empowerment during their minority more tolerable.\n\nSadly, the very thing that makes Demeny voting desirable \u2014 the political and cultural weakness of the family in an aging and individualist society \u2014 makes it hard to imagine how it could ever get off the ground politically. But it\u2019s somewhat easier to imagine experiments at the state level, where a certain kind of political self-interest could grease the wheels.\n\nJust as there\u2019s currently a push for youth voting in liberal California, where more teenage voters would top off liberal supermajorities, there\u2019s no reason that red states rich in Republican-voting families (hello, Utah) couldn\u2019t consider experiments with Demeny voting. (Certainly it would be a far better voting-reform cause for social conservatives than the present Republican fixation on hassling Democratic constituencies \u2014 sorry, preventing voter fraud \u2014 with onerous voter registration requirements.) And then blue-state feminists could respond by embracing a matriarchal Demeny alternative, like the economist Miles Corak\u2019s suggestion that a child\u2019s voting rights should be vested, not half in each parent, but wholly in the mother.", "title": "Opinion | Power to the Parents", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a dream that has confounded generations of architects and developers,\u201d said Amanda Dameron, until recently the editor in chief of Dwell, a shelter magazine that is one of prefab\u2019s biggest proselytizers.\n\nPhoto\n\nLess than 3 percent of housing starts in the United States in 2016 were some sort of prefab. On one hand, there is a \u201cresistance to prefab as ugly boxes,\u201d she noted. But the more specialized and elaborate the look and layout, the less affordable it becomes. Designer prefab easily costs more than $300 a square foot, putting it in competition with custom-built houses.\n\nWhich is a pity, Ms. Dameron added, because, compared with traditional methods, modern prefab construction saves time, limits waste and often incorporates environmentally sensitive materials and energy-saving technologies.\n\nIf ever there was a time and place for prefab to flaunt its virtues, it is now, in Northern California. Even before the fires, stringent statewide building regulations and a shortage of contractors and construction workers made erecting a home a challenge. Now with the spike in demand for labor and materials, the wait time for completing a stick-built house in the area is estimated to be four years at a cost of anywhere from $500 to $700 per square foot.\n\nCompare that with what Stillwater Dwellings offers. The Seattle-based prefab company that Ms. Peden approached charges around $350 to $400 per square foot for a basic move-in-ready home assembled on a prepared foundation. Construction takes six to eight months once a building permit is issued.\n\nIt is to be expected that after the fires, the rebuilding process will be hampered by competition for contractors, poor site conditions and the mobbing of county building departments struggling to expedite paperwork. But prefab puts fewer demands on local construction professionals because so much of it is standardized.\n\nAn abbreviated timeline is what convinced B.J. Patnode and Glen Smith, to replace the ranch home they lost in Kenwood, Calif., just north of Glen Ellen, with a Stillwater Dwellings prefab. The men learned that if they chose an existing design rather than one they customized, the process could be substantially shortened. They picked an H-shaped model, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms in each of two wings, separated by a breezeway. They also opted for a detached garage. The estimated price is $475 per square foot.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the soil boring details this week, and once they finalize the foundation and the house plans we can submit them to the county,\u201d Mr. Patnode said in late February.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf indeed the plans and expedited permits are approved as promised, manufacturing will begin this month. The materials will be delivered in June and the home should be ready by Christmas. (The men received a big advantage by jumping into the process early. According to Kaveh Khatibloo, Stillwater\u2019s co-chief executive officer, most new clients in the area are advised not to expect to begin construction until 2019 at the earliest.)\n\nBecause the men chose a panelized house \u2014 where the prefabricated parts are walls, roofing and floors, rather than three-dimensional modules with plumbing and electrical systems built into them \u2014 more work will be required to finish it on site. Expediting the project will be a general contractor and subcontractors that Stillwater Dwellings is recruiting from Reno, Nev. The crew will camp out on the property and build not just Mr. Patnode\u2019s and Mr. Smith\u2019s new home but also one for the couple next door. Both sets of neighbors will share the expense of hosting the workers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One Glen Ellen fire victim said he liked the idea of \u201cvery sharp designers\u201d making most decisions regarding fixtures and finishes. \u201cI\u2019m not into looking into 20 different versions of a sconce or light switch,\u201d he said.\n\nThat resident, who asked not to be named out of concern that his choice of prefab might complicate negotiations with his insurance company, had picked a one-story model from Connect Homes, a Los Angeles company that was founded with the aim of making attractive prefab housing more affordable. The style, with its open layout and expansive glass, updates the midcentury ranch house he lost and is well suited to his 1.5-acre property, he said.\n\nHe also praised Connect Homes\u2019 method of transporting modules through the intermodal system, drastically reducing shipping costs. Given a level lot, the price of a house, including design, production, installation and even appliances, ranges from $247,080 for 640 square feet to $826,160 for 3,200 square feet.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Jane Milotich, also a Glen Ellen fire victim, prefab offers a chance to have a state-of-the-art home. She went to Acre Designs, a start-up in Mountain View, Calif., for a net-zero-energy home \u201cso you practically never have to use a heating system or a cooling system,\u201d she said. Solar panels are included in all homes, and North Bay clients will receive a Tesla Powerwall battery as a standard feature, said Andrew Dickson, Acre Design\u2019s co-founder.\n\nThe homes, which cost from $250 to $320 a square foot, are engineered to be shipped flat, like Ikea furniture. This makes them easier to transport up winding roads, but they also require more attention from on-site construction teams.\n\nMs. Milotich imagined the Glen Ellen landscape dotted with new prefab homes from a variety of suppliers. \u201cIt would be like the Fountain of Youth for the community,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as shiny contemporary buildings spring up in the North Bay, will prefab finally blossom into a viable movement? Allison Arieff, a writer and former editor of Dwell and the author of the 2002 book \u201cPrefab,\u201d doubts it.\n\n\u201cThe issue for prefab isn\u2019t aesthetic acceptance,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re way past that.\u201d Nor does speeding up construction \u2014 prefab\u2019s major benefit \u2014 ultimately matter in a process overburdened with state regulations, she said. \u201cThe permitting is the hiccup.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Arieff the cost of single-family homes built largely in factories is still too high to create an economy of scale. (She sees prefab put to its best use for multifamily construction.) Or as Ms. Dameron, lately of Dwell, put it, \u201cOnly the wealthy can afford to employ what is supposed to be a cheap alternative.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIf you have the good fortune to be in this position, prefab is truly the smartest way to go.\u201d", "title": "Prefab Finds a Home in Fire-Ravaged Neighborhoods of California", "authors": ["Julie Lasky"]}

Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that enforces immigration laws. \u201cThe undocumented, or people with uncertain immigration status, or anyone with any concern about their legal status, are not going to be responding to the census.\u201d\n\nThe census matters to the city because the count will determine how billions of federal dollars are distributed for everything from housing to bridge repairs to education. The census will also determine the state\u2019s standing in Congress. Population shifts have reduced the state\u2019s congressional delegation from 45 representatives in the early 1950s to 27 now, and New York State already expects to lose one congressional seat in reapportionment after the census. The concern among officials like Mr. Salvo is that in an undercount, New York could be forced to give up a second seat.\n\nAs in the past, census information in 2020 will be collected in two phases, first through the materials sent to every household and second by census takers who are supposed to visit the addresses that do not respond. Reflecting the digital age, the Census Bureau also has said its goal is for 55 percent of the population nationwide to be able to answer census questions online in 2020.\n\nIn New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an outreach campaign to bolster participation in the census that will be called \u201cGet Counted NYC.\u201d\n\nThe 542 unreturned forms in 2010 went to addresses in the Sidney Hillman Houses on Grand Street, a complex named for a clothing workers\u2019 union leader who died in 1946.

In the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s first calls to ban bump stocks, the official said, the White House knew the bureau was open to revisiting a ban.\n\nYet in tweets, public remarks and statements, Mr. Trump upended the time-consuming, often-overlooked federal rule-making process, which requires coordination among multiple agencies. The president dismissed it as \u201clong and complicated,\u201d vowing that bump stocks would be banned and that the legal review was almost finished.\n\n\u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d Trump said in the days after the Florida shooting, directly addressing Mr. Sessions while the agency was continuing its review.\n\nAs recently as last week, the public positions of the president and the bureau were out of sync. Mr. Trump announced that the \u201clegal papers\u201d to ban bump stocks were nearly completed and said the devices would soon be \u201cgone.\u201d That same day, bureau officials said that the agency was still reviewing the issue, and that no final determination had been made.\n\nTraditionally, the bureau would study existing statutes, decide that the law permits it to regulate bump stocks and then submit a proposed rule to the Justice Department. The deputy attorney general\u2019s office would make modifications before the budget office reviewed and approved the rule change, and it would then be published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe regulation of bump stocks has strayed from that pattern. The bureau determined in 2010 that it could not regulate the devices because they could not be defined as machine guns, which are regulated under the National Firearms Act, the law that regulates firearms in the United States. To prohibit bump stocks, the agency had to contradict that earlier position, essentially saying the statute had not changed but could be read differently to include such a ban.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Justice Department and A.T.F. officials privately stuck by their earlier conclusion that they could not outlaw bump stocks, but with little appetite to tackle gun policy in Congress, Mr. Sessions asked the A.T.F. to review its determination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgencies periodically scrutinize earlier rulings and change interpretations. What set apart the bump stock evaluation, according to former bureau officials, was Mr. Trump\u2019s overt political pressure.\n\n\u201cNo disrespect intended, but I\u2019m sure President Trump has no idea what exactly the authority is for A.T.F. or the D.O.J. to ban these things,\u201d said Bradley A. Buckles, who was the head of the bureau from 1999 to 2004. \u201cIn all honesty, he doesn\u2019t know what his authority is in that regard.\u201d\n\nAnd in altering its 2010 interpretation made under former President Barack Obama, the bureau could be subject to lawsuits that tie up a bump stock ban in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department and the A.T.F. are going to get sued, and Trump is going to get flak,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \u201cObama was correct in his interpretation of the statute. If you want to ban bump stocks, it has to be done through Congress.\u201d\n\nThe apparent reversal on bump stocks appears to be more political than legal, said Rick Vasquez, a former A.T.F. official who supervised the bureau\u2019s prior determination on bump stocks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically playing games with the regulations and the law right now just to make a political statement,\u201d he said.\n\nOther presidents have also influenced Justice Department rule making to help their preferred policies come into fruition, then watched as those rules became fodder for lawsuits. Under Mr. Obama, the Justice Department created the legal underpinnings to protect undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children after Congress failed to address the issue. That program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was the subject of multiple lawsuits.\n\nIf bump stock bans are approved, as expected, questions remain on how the rule will be enforced, including whether it will apply to purchases before a ban would be instituted.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump continued to publicly press for a ban. \u201cBump Stocks,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cwill soon be out.\u201d", "title": "Pressured by Trump, A.T.F.

A monthslong investigation uncovered a number of cases in recent years in which officers had clearly not told the truth about arrests they had made \u2014 a phenomenon with a storied nickname, testilying, that is still tossed around.\n\nBut the department\u2019s reluctance to investigate and discipline officers for lying \u2014 as shown by the information collected by the civilian review board \u2014 appears to be as much of a problem as the initial lies. One reason officers lie, it would seem, is that they can get away with it.\n\nLooking at the cases brought by the review board is only one way to gauge how the Police Department responds to accusations of lying within its ranks. Another way is to review criminal cases that were dismissed after a judge concluded that a police officer\u2019s testimony was not credible.\n\nIt is impossible to tally the number of such cases because they are often sealed by the court. But in several cases reviewed by The Times, it was apparent that many officers whose testimony came under suspicion experienced little negative impact to their careers; in fact, a number were subsequently promoted.\n\nOne plainclothes officer, Konrad Zakiewicz, was accused by two federal judges of testifying falsely in gun cases in 2013. His career survived. Last year, he was promoted to detective.\n\nSo was Nector Martinez, a Bronx police officer who in October 2017 testified falsely against a woman in a gun case, nearly sending her to prison on the basis of a story that appears to be made up. In November he received his gold detective shield.\n\nAnother Bronx police officer, Sean Kinane, also made detective last year, even though a federal judge the year before had said his testimony in a drug case was \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cnot credible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn another case, in 2016, a judge rejected the account of an arrest given by a Bronx precinct commander, Christopher McCormack, concluding that little of the commander\u2019s testimony was credible. Yet in March 2017, Inspector McCormack was promoted to deputy chief and put in charge of detectives in Manhattan North.\n\n\u2018Mistakes Based on Faulty Memory\u2019\n\nThe Police Department has pushed back against the claim that lies by officers are not punished.\n\nJ. Peter Donald, a spokesman, said the Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau has grown more effective in recent years at catching dishonest officers. It has, for example, expanded its integrity-testing unit in which undercover investigators pretend to be crime victims, witnesses or suspects in order to see how officers respond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proactively rooting out people who have a problem with the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, the Police Department convened a panel of top officials who, since 2016, have been reviewing every case in which a judge finds that an officer\u2019s testimony was not believable. The department\u2019s top legal official, Lawrence Byrne, said the cases were not, in the aggregate, indicative of a systemic problem. Often, Mr. Byrne said, the police officer\u2019s testimony was undermined by \u201cmistakes based on faulty memory, not an intentional lie.\u201d\n\nAnother police legal official, Ann P. Prunty, went further, saying that at times it is the judges, not the police officers, who are in error. \u201cSometimes you see a judge who just has a bias and thinks that an officer\u2019s account is implausible,\u201d said Ms. Prunty, an assistant deputy commissioner for legal matters and a former prosecutor in Manhattan. \u201cWhen you look at it, it is. It\u2019s quite plausible.\u201d\n\nThe Police Department noted that it brings dozens of disciplinary proceedings against police officers for making a \u201cfalse statement\u201d each year. But many of those cases appear to involve internal disciplinary matters \u2014 such as falsehoods about injuries, the circumstances of car accidents or off-duty misconduct \u2014 rather than incidents in which officers lied about arrests.\n\n\u201cIf you intentionally make a false statement as a police officer, as opposed to a mistake, you can and will be terminated for that,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. More than 70 officers have been \u201cfired or forced out of the department in the last five years\u201d for perjury or false statements, Mr. Byrne said in October at a New York City Bar Association event. About 150 more were disciplined to a lesser extent for making false statements in recent years, he said.\n\nOn paper, the Police Department\u2019s policy about lying is severe: \u201cIntentionally making a false official statement regarding a material matter will result in dismissal from the Department, absent exceptional circumstances.\u201d The policy notes that statements to the Civilian Complaint Review Board are subject to this policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe severity of the punishment may actually discourage the department from bringing police officers up on disciplinary charges for false statements, the Commission to Combat Police Corruption noted in a recent report. With little option for lesser punishment, the Police Department may be trying to avoid ending the career of a police officer over a single lie.\n\nThe commission found that the Police Department has been \u201ccharging officers with making false official statements in far fewer instances than facts and circumstances seem to warrant.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions, although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent years.\n\nA finding that McDonald\u2019s is a joint employer would make the company liable for labor-law violations committed by its franchisees, and would require it to bargain with restaurant workers who unionized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonald\u2019s restaurants had disciplined them, retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a $15 hourly wage and a union.\n\nThe general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, at the time an appointee of President Barack Obama, investigated their charges and issued complaints against McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees in 2014.

Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald\u2019s and made a settlement more likely.\n\nIn his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could \u201cfacilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.\u201d\n\nBefore the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald\u2019s could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.\n\nAfter the board\u2019s decision in December, a company had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.\n\nAt the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb\u2019s logic was specious because the board\u2019s case against McDonald\u2019s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.\n\nLawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald\u2019s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered \u201ca game of hide-the-ball.\u201d\n\nThen, last month, one of Mr. Robb\u2019s primary arguments for a pause in the trial was upended when the labor board, on a procedural question, reversed its December decision narrowing the definition of a joint employer. At that point, the joint employer definition reverted to what it had been earlier in the trial.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter that the board\u2019s reversal \u201celiminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald\u2019s case so near to the trial\u2019s close.\u201d They urged Mr. Robb to \u201cswiftly resume and finish the trial.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Robb\u2019s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement.

In one instance, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she \u201cwas ok with $50k\u201d for back pay as part of the settlement, according to an email between the board and Mr. Wissinger, one of the union lawyers. The offer was conditional on the worker\u2019s waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.\n\nMr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.\n\n\u201cIt was a done deal by the time we found out,\u201d Mr. Wissinger said. \u201cThey were completely cutting us out of the process.\u201d\n\nJennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with custom.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unusual,\u201d Ms. Abruzzo said. \u201cThe charging party is the one that the regions typically go to.

There was also a discrepancy in some places between the turnout numbers tallied by Mr. Navalany\u2019s organization, which fielded more than 30,000 observers, and the official numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere was no real need for extensive rigging, however, because of Mr. Putin\u2019s genuine popularity.\n\nThe result set off immediate, bitter infighting within the already divided liberal opposition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Sobchak, who just organized a new political party, came sweeping into Mr. Navalny\u2019s headquarters proclaiming that they should unite. \u201cWe have common goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are more important than our differences, regardless of how unjust the government has been to you.\u201d\n\nWhat came next was like a scene from \u201cHouse 2,\u201d the reality television show based on \u201cBig Brother\u201d that Ms. Sobchak hosted before she became a political journalist.\n\nMr. Navalny verbally bashed Ms. Sobchak, calling her a tool of the Kremlin and releasing the anger evidently pent up since she stepped forward to claim the liberal banner in the election.\n\n\u201cIt was a grandiose fraud and you were part of it,\u201d he shouted, accusing her of undermining the boycott. \u201cYou are part of this lie, this falsification.\u201d\n\nInstead of criticizing Mr. Putin, he said, Ms. Sobchak made advertisements for caviar and vodka during the campaign.\n\nMany suspected Ms. Sobchak, who is the daughter of Mr. Putin\u2019s political mentor, of being a Kremlin stalking horse in the campaign and agreeing to do it to raise her profile for the advertising and lucrative hosting opportunities that come with appearing on state television.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "LONDON \u2014 In the early spring of 2014, the world watched, astonished, as soldiers without insignia took over government buildings in Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula, surrounded Ukrainian military bases and installed new leaders in the region. President Vladimir Putin of Russia claimed at the time that these were not Russian soldiers. Instead, he said, these were \u201clocal self-defense units.\u201d Less than a month later, Russia annexed Crimea. And a year after that, Mr. Putin admitted what everyone had suspected all along: Yes, Russian soldiers had been involved.\n\nThat was when the term \u201cplausible deniability\u201d became a standard part of Western discussions about Russia. The practice of carrying out dubious deeds through the hands of proxies or other hard-to-identify agents has since become something of a trademark of Mr. Putin\u2019s. Sometimes, the agents are indeed Kremlin actors in disguise, as they were in Crimea. But in the years since, Mr. Putin has pushed this tactic even further, implicitly or explicitly encouraging independent agents to act on their own, keeping the Kremlin\u2019s hands clean. On many occasions, this has left the West a helpless bystander, unable to force Russia to account for its actions.\n\nBut time may be running out on this tactic. The attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent who was found unresponsive in southwest England earlier this month, poisoned with a deadly nerve agent, may be the moment when \u201cplausible deniability\u201d has reached its limits. In fact, it now looks as if it is turning against its masters in the Kremlin. The United States\u2019 decision on Monday, alongside Canada and a number of European countries, to expel Russians in retaliation for the poisoning makes clear to Moscow that its actions have consequences, whether it denies them or not.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea, Russia has resorted to \u201cplausible deniability\u201d again and again. The interference in the American presidential elections was a classic case: Mr. Putin has repeatedly emphasized that Russia has not intervened \u201cat the level of the government,\u201d but he admits that some \u201cpatriotic hackers\u201d or trolls with Russian citizenship might indeed have been active. The Russian president has also attempted to reap policy benefits from the denied action, steering the conversation toward his own priorities: accusing the United States of interfering in Russia and making the case for cooperating to regulate the internet and social media.", "title": "Opinion | Putin\u2019s Favorite Tactic Has Finally Backfired", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Eager to keep control of the story, Mr. Putin warned people to stick to official information. \u201cYou know it very well that social media is a murky source unfortunately,\u201d he told officials and relatives in Kemerovo. \u201cWe need to rely on the results of the actual inquiry.\u201d\n\nThat Russia is far from being a monolithic one-party state, despite Mr. Putin\u2019s lopsided re-election, was clear Tuesday evening in the two events organized to mourn the dead in Kemerovo.\n\nOne was state-sponsored, near the Kremlin; the other was held in Pushkin Square, by Muscovites who wanted no part in the official gathering. The alternative wake began as a solemn vigil with mourners burning candles and laying flowers, some of them in tears, but gradually turned into a small-scale political rally with chants of \u201cRussia without Putin!\u201d \u201cCorruption kills!\u201d \u201cShame on television!\u201d and \u201cSilence means death!\u201d\n\nInstead of fuming at the United States and its allies, Mr. Putin, during his Siberia trip, used another tool in his repertoire of responses to most problems: He set the security apparatus to work, telling relatives of the victims that the Investigative Committee, Russia\u2019s answer to the F.B.I., had deployed 100 investigators and would find those responsible for the fire and punish them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe blamed \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d and \u201cslovenliness\u201d for the blaze, which started in a children\u2019s play area and then swept through nearby cinemas crowded with young people.\n\nThe regional governor, Aman Tuleyev, a relic of the Soviet era, begged for forgiveness and accused opposition activists of trying to exploit the tragedy for political ends. \u201cIt\u2019s sacrilege when there\u2019s grief and you use it to solve your own problems,\u201d the governor said.\n\nMr. Putin avoided mention of what many, including those who lost family members, believe was the real cause of the fire: a state system, including multiple agencies responsible for limiting fire and other risks, eaten away by corruption and incompetence.\n\nRussia has strict building codes and elaborate safety regulations but, instead of being enforced, they are frequently skirted with the help of corrupt officials willing to turn a blind eye to violations in return for cash bribes and favors. Law enforcement officers, who are supposed to prevent this, are themselves often on the take or under pressure from powerful political barons not to investigate.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, Anton Gorelkin, a member of Parliament from Kemerovo, gave a list of possible reasons the fire started \u2014 a prank by children, a short circuit, arson \u2014 but he said the real cause of the tragedy was greed.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Grim Reality: Public Fury Over Children\u2019s Deaths in Mall", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"]}

Awdish\u2019s journey from physician to helpless patient and then back to reformed physician is equal parts dramatic, engaging and instructive. Her experience of acute illness makes very clear how doctors who believe they are in control of situations establish and perpetuate barriers between themselves and those in their charge. Most devastatingly for Awdish, and for many patients, is the often unintentional use of language that alienates the patient from the physician.\n\nWhile many books about medicine and illness address this, Awdish\u2019s work is singular in its rawness and willingness to show us a person at one with her pain and isolation, able to relate completely through her writing to the intense feelings of helplessness that confront almost every patient admitted to a hospital. Awdish\u2019s book suffers only when she slips into physician mode, searching for words to relate the profundity of medicine as a profession and calling.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "What\u2019s going on here? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that the modern G.O.P. contains so many crooks and that these crooks seem to thrive in intraparty politics. On the contrary, the success of people like Blankenship \u2014 or Trump \u2014 was an inevitable consequence of the political strategy Republicans have followed for decades. For the simple truth is that ever since Reagan, Republicans have basically played a con game on American voters.\n\nTheir sustained, invariant agenda has been upward redistribution of income: cutting taxes on the rich while weakening the social safety net. This agenda is unpopular: Only a small minority of Americans wants to see tax cuts for the wealthy, and an even smaller minority wants cuts to major social programs. Yet Republicans have won elections partly by denying the reality of their policy agenda, but mainly by posing as defenders of traditional social values \u2014 above all, that greatest of American traditions, racism.\n\nAnd this sustained reliance on the big con has, over time, exerted a strong selection effect both on the party\u2019s leadership and on its base. G.O.P. politicians tend disproportionately to be con men (and in some cases, con women), because playing the party\u2019s political game requires both a willingness to and a talent for saying one thing while doing another. And the party\u2019s base consists disproportionately of the easily conned \u2014 those who are easily fooled by claims that Those People are the problem and don\u2019t notice how much the true Republican agenda hurts them.\n\nThe point is that Trumpism was more or less fated to happen. Trump\u2019s crude racism and blatant dishonesty are only exaggerated versions of what his party has been selling for decades, while his substantive policy agenda \u2014 slashing taxes on corporations and the wealthy, taking health care away from lower-income families \u2014 is utterly orthodox.\n\nEven his protectionism is less of a departure from Republican norms than people imagine. George W. Bush put tariffs on steel, while Reagan limited imports of Japanese autos.

Angela Olsen Halsted, of Arlington, Va., is not only a dedicated solver but has also had four crossword puzzles published in The New York Times. She calls this weekend her \u201chappy place.\u201d\n\nIn the crowded lobby on Friday afternoon, warm hugs were exchanged, puns were suitably groaned at and more than a few brave souls donned crossword-themed clothing, including Karen Chu of San Francisco, who strolled nonchalantly through the lobby dressed as a pencil.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Friday evening, Mr. Shortz welcomed more than 670 contestants to the Marriott ballroom, noting that the turnout was the largest since the \u201cWordplay\u201d bump, the sudden increase in attendance attributed to the 2006 documentary. It has gotten so popular that HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d was filming an upcoming episode around the tournament.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the contestants gathered for the first puzzle, a relatively straightforward one meant to ease competitors into the speed-solving groove.

The competitive aspect might be about speed, but the holy grail for all but a handful of the top solvers is to come away with a \u201cclean\u201d puzzle, which is one that is completed with no mistakes.\n\nPhoto\n\nSix crossword puzzles of varying sizes and difficulties were completed on Saturday. This included the notorious Puzzle 5 \u2014 created this year by digital crosswords editor Joel Fagliano \u2014 and which Mr. Shortz referred to as the most mind-bending of the weekend\u2019s challenges, using more colorful language than is allowed here.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s a mentally draining day by any standard, but there were social activities to bolster the weary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome who were flummoxed by a confusing theme in Puzzle 4 joined the survivors of Puzzle 5 in the Marriott bar to unwind over cocktails.\n\nAt 8 p.m., the ballroom filled once again. Matt Ginsberg talked about his computer program, Dr. Fill, which solved the more straightforward puzzles in a matter of seconds. A few people who resented Dr. Fill\u2019s speed enjoyed the schadenfreude when the program missed a more complex theme that the human solvers understood. Robots have yet to outdo humans when it comes to playing with words.\n\nIf the ins and outs of computer programming were not to one\u2019s taste, there was always a 10-minute play, by the playwright Donna Hoke, featuring a human crossword puzzle and his Sudoku sidekick, both of whom attempt to pick up a flirtatious pencil in a bar.\n\nSunday was all about trying to topple the reigning champion, Mr. Feyer, in the finals, but first there was the talent show. While the officials graded Puzzle 7, which was meant to shake out the top contenders, competitors and puzzle makers alike strutted their stuff with inside jokes, songs and performances about the joys and trials of crossword puzzle solving.\n\nPhoto\n\nMidway through the singing and dancing, an official quietly slipped Mr. Shortz the latest standings that told him who would be going to the final rounds. The tournament offers prizes for a variety of age and geographic divisions, but only nine people \u2014 three in each of the A, B and C divisions \u2014 solved Puzzle 8 in front of the entire audience.\n\nAll three divisions get increasingly difficult cluing for the same puzzle, but the rarefied A division is for the top money \u2014 first prize is $5,000 \u2014 and the three solvers, Mr. Feyer, Mr. Agard and David Plotkin of Gainesville, Fla., had to puzzle the very hardest clues out. This year, the puzzle for the final round was made by the assistant crosswords editor, Sam Ezersky.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that the formerly \u201cword nerd\u201d atmosphere began to resemble a rowdy sporting event.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nColor commentary was led by a puzzle maker, Greg Pliska, as well as Ophira Eisenberg, host of NPR\u2019s \u201cAsk Me Another\u201d quiz show.\n\nAn audible gasp arose when a C division solver missed having a clean puzzle by one letter, and the entire room cheered whenever a finalist signaled that they were done. One of the B division finalists scrawled \u201cHi, Mom!\u201d on the side of her puzzle. Photos and videos were taken and immediately posted on social media to let the members of the crossword puzzle tribe who couldn\u2019t attend know what was happening.\n\nAs Jack Lechner, from Arlington, said, \u201cThis might be the only annual sporting event in which a rookie can go head-to-head with a national champion.\u201d", "title": "Puzzle Lovers Find Their Tribe at a Crossword Tournament", "authors": ["Deb Amlen"]}

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nQualcomm has slain a lion, but baited a dragon. Having the United States government essentially declare the firm a national champion allowed the chip maker to defend itself from rival Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion takeover bid. But a rise in anti-foreign sentiment may hurt Qualcomm, too \u2014 since it\u2019s still waiting for China to approve its own $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s plans for growth lean heavily on acquiring the chip maker. Sealing the deal would reduce its dependence on the stagnating mobile-phone market and expand exposure to faster-growing ones such as autonomous vehicles. The problem is it needs approval from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, and that approval has been slow in arriving.\n\nThe United States government has derailed multiple chip deals because of fears that American technology might fall into Chinese hands. Broadcom might not appear to fall into the same camp. It is based in Singapore \u2014 and plans to relocate stateside this year \u2014 and most of its shareholders and directors are American.\n\nYet fear of the Middle Kingdom played a role: Lawmakers wondered whether Broadcom would follow its playbook on other deals and cut Qualcomm\u2019s research and development. That would risk ceding wireless-technology leadership to Chinese firms like Huawei. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was also concerned about Broadcom\u2019s business relationships with \u201cforeign entities\u201d when it assessed the bid for Qualcomm.\n\nThe decision to rule Qualcomm off limits to foreign ownership could also grease the way for other sectors to be declared too sensitive for Chinese ownership.\n\nBeijing has already come down hard on Qualcomm, fining it $975 million in 2015 for what it called anti-competitive practices. The company could now find itself caught in the middle of escalating tensions. If there are suspicions in the Ministry of Commerce that Qualcomm stoked anti-Chinese sentiment among United States lawmakers to defend itself against Broadcom, the company may have a target painted on its back.", "title": "Qualcomm Could Find Itself in the Middle of Escalating Tensions With China", "authors": ["Robert Cyran"]}
{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Call it cheeky, sentimental or delusional, but Paul Jacobs\u2019s idea of making an offer for Qualcomm, the company he chaired until this month, is certainly daring. The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.\n\nThere are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.\n\nValuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.\n\nA simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.", "title": "Qualcomm Needs a Mediator More Than a Buyer", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Jacobs was chairman of Qualcomm from 2009 until March 9, when he was replaced. The change was widely seen as a move to placate shareholders who had been voicing their displeasure by voting for a slate of six candidates proposed by Broadcom for the 11-seat board as part of its bid to acquire the company.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Jacobs sent the board a letter saying that he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources, according to people briefed on the situation, who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. That led to the board\u2019s decision on Friday during its regularly scheduled meeting.\n\n\u201cQualcomm is focused on executing its business plan and maximizing value for shareholders as an independent company,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no assurance that Dr. Jacobs can or will make a proposal, but, if he does, the board will of course evaluate it consistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Jacobs, in turn, said there were \u201cclear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company\u2019s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders and bolster a critical contributor to American technology.\u201d\n\nHis potential bid was earlier reported by The Financial Times.\n\nIn aiming to take Qualcomm private, Mr. Jacobs would be following a playbook used by Michael Dell. Mr. Dell, who founded Dell Computer in his university dorm room and built it into a personal computing colossus, took his company private in a $24.9 billion deal in 2013 after it had been battered by competition from Apple and the rise of mobile devices. Mr. Dell has since been working to turn Dell around, away from the prying eyes of Wall Street.\n\nYet any takeover attempt of Qualcomm by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of fewer than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to buy equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm\u2019s directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\n\nIf Mr. Jacobs reached out to foreign investors to raise funding, that would also most likely be problematic. President Trump blocked Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm this week partly because the White House does not want to cede American primacy in fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G, which Qualcomm has been developing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jacobs is friends with Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which would seem a likely candidate to help any buyout. But SoftBank has a heavy debt load already, and any move related to foreign investors could raise the same concerns that thwarted Broadcom.\n\nNot renominating Mr. Jacobs to Qualcomm\u2019s board opens a new chapter for the company, which the Jacobs family had made an institution in its hometown, San Diego.\n\nMr. Jacobs served as Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive from 2005 to 2014, a time when revenue and profits surged as its technology became a foundation for third-generation cellular networks. As a result, Qualcomm began charging patent royalties for nearly all mobile phones that used 3G technology.\n\nThe company was also able to garner a strong position in the next generation of cellphone networks \u2014 known as 4G \u2014 because it scooped rivals in delivering chips that could work with 4G networks.\n\nBut rivals such as Taiwan\u2019s Mediatek have cut into that lead recently. Qualcomm has also lately been hurt as Apple, a longtime customer, sued it over the royalty payments and stopped paying the company.\n\nApart from expanding Qualcomm, Mr. Jacobs is associated with some of the company\u2019s most famous failures, including a plan for broadcast cellular technology called MediaFlo and a technology for mobile-device displays called Mirasol. Qualcomm announced in 2013 that Mr. Jacobs would give up the chief executive position to Steve Mollenkopf after Mr. Mollenkopf was mentioned as a possible candidate to be chief executive of Microsoft.", "title": "Qualcomm\u2019s Ex-Chairman to Leave Amid Plans to Buy Company", "authors": ["Don Clark"]}

They were such losers, all of them, and so was I, and there was kinship in that.\n\nMy friend Jessica lived on one of the park benches there, and we would squander days downtown, slouching across the East Village into Chelsea, where we would cop dope and shoot it in the bathroom at the Strand, where you don\u2019t need a code to get inside. After Jessica got her pit bull \u2014 whom she found one morning in the Bronx, chained to a fence and covered in scabs, like he was meant to break your heart \u2014 we went to the bathrooms in the basement at Petco instead, where an eight-millimeter syringe tip once broke off into my arm.\n\nWe were such apparent scum in those days, self-destructing in the wide-open, too sloppy and sinking to seem threatening, that it sometimes felt as if we were living below the law.\n\nJessica had hepatitis C. According to the most recent statistics from the C.D.C., there were an estimated 30,900 cases of new acute hepatitis C virus infections in the United States in 2015.

More than a decade ago he helped block the passage of a statewide needle-exchange program aimed at curbing the spread of H.I.V. from contaminated hypodermic needles, pitting himself against his own party.\n\nHis position on cannabis legalization not only puts him at odds with the governor and members of his party, but also with many African-Americans.\n\nIn New Jersey, African-Americans are three times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession than whites, even though both populations use the drug at similar rates.

That initial silence fed cautions that he was raising premature optimism, or perhaps strategizing to buy time.\n\nBut it seemed unlikely that the South Korean delegation would have publicized such an offer without the North\u2019s assurances, after what by all accounts was an extraordinarily cordial visit. Even President Trump, who has mocked Mr. Kim and vowed \u201cfire and fury\u201d that would obliterate North Korea if its nuclear forces ever attacked, offered a guarded but positive response.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. \u201cThe World is watching and waiting!

That would be a great thing for the world.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials were more cautious, with one senior official noting that the United States has negotiated with North Korea over its nuclear program off-and-on for 27 years, and that the North Koreans have broken every agreement they ever made with the Americans.\n\nThe United States, this official said, has no current plans to further delay joint military exercises with South Korea, suspended for the Winter Olympics last month in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Those exercises are scheduled to resume in April, after the Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang.\n\nWhile the Trump administration is intrigued by North Korea\u2019s offer \u2014 as relayed through the South Koreans \u2014 the senior official noted that North Korea could still manufacture missiles and bombs during a pause in testing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

But the senior official said the United States had confidence in the preliminary assessment they had provided.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat assessment signals the first time Mr. Kim has indicated a willingness to discuss abandoning nuclear arms in return for security guarantees from the United States, which has technically been in a state of war with North Korea for nearly seven decades.\n\nThe South Korean delegation gave no indication that North Korea would start dismantling nuclear or missile programs anytime soon. Nonetheless, the delegation\u2019s visit represented major progress in Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to improve relations with North Korea. Those efforts advanced considerably during the Winter Olympics, to which Mr. Kim sent athletes, entertainers and political delegations that included his sister.\n\nA senior member of the South Korean delegation that returned on Tuesday, Mr. Moon\u2019s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said Mr. Kim had been unexpectedly flexible.\n\nMr. Chung told reporters in Seoul, the South Korean capital, that the delegation had anticipated Mr. Kim would insist that the South and the United States not hold their military exercises. The South Koreans were wrong.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un simply said he could understand why the joint exercises must resume in April on the same scale as before,\u201d Mr. Chung said. \u201cBut he said he expected them to be readjusted if the situation on the Korean Peninsula stabilizes in the future.\u201d\n\nMr. Chung said the South Koreans believed that their agreements with North Korea would be enough to start a dialogue between Washington and the North. He also said he was carrying additional messages from Mr. Kim to the Trump administration that he could not reveal.\n\n\u201cThere was no other specific demand from North Korea in returning to dialogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only said they wanted to be treated like a serious dialogue partner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the overture by North Korea sets in motion a challenging phase that will call on the United States to exercise diplomatic muscles after a long stretch in which the White House relied on economic pressure, backed by threats of military force.\n\nThat challenge will be compounded because the State Department\u2019s veteran North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, recently announced his retirement from the Foreign Service. Another experienced negotiator, Victor Cha, was recently sidelined when the White House decided not to proceed with his nomination as ambassador to South Korea.\n\nAdministration officials are wary of entanglement in a negotiation in which the United States makes concessions \u2014 on issues like military exercises or shipments of medical and food aid \u2014 only to see the North Koreans renege on their commitments later.\n\nMr. Trump has said that the United States could talk with North Korea, but \u201conly under the right conditions.\u201d American officials have repeatedly said they can start negotiations with the North only if it agrees to discuss denuclearizing. They have also insisted that the North first take some actions that would convince them of its sincerity.\n\nAnother complication is the increased tension between the United States and South Korea, both over Mr. Moon\u2019s exuberant diplomatic engagement with the North and over trade.\n\nPrivately, American officials voice frustration that Mr. Moon has responded so readily to the overtures from Mr. Kim. During Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s trip to South Korea for the Olympics, for example, Mr. Moon sought to broker a meeting between Mr. Pence and North Korean officials \u2014 seating him a few feet away from Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, Kim Yo-jong, during the opening ceremony.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs on steel could be an even greater source of friction. South Korea is the third-largest exporter of steel to the United States, accounting for nearly 10 percent of all exports.\n\nWhile the president has floated the idea of excluding Canada and Mexico from the tariffs, provided they agree to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, he has said nothing about South Korea. Other administration officials said South Korea was among the worst offenders in terms of dumping steel into the American market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump is already demanding that South Korea overhaul its free trade agreement with the United States. Some in the administration have urged Mr. Trump to delay punitive trade measures while South Korea and the United States jointly deal with the North Korea issue.\n\nDefense Minister Itsunori Onodera of Japan, which has steadfastly supported the Trump administration\u2019s tough approach to sanctions against North Korea, struck a note of caution about the North\u2019s interest in negotiations.\n\n\u201cWhile talking about nuclear abandonment several times, it turned out that North Korea didn\u2019t halt its nuclear development in the past,\u201d Mr. Onodera said. \u201cWe need to carefully assess if this North and South dialogue will really lead to the abandonment of nuclear and missile development.\u201d\n\nChina, which has pushed for direct talks between the North and Washington for many months, welcomed the South Korean statement. Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China hoped \u201cthe relevant parties can seize the current opportunity\u201d to work toward \u201cpolitically resolving the Korean Peninsula issue.\u201d\n\nOne Chinese expert on North Korea characterized its reported offer as \u201cconcessions that are dramatic and significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be hard for the U.S. government to resist,\u201d said the expert, Cheng Xiaohe, of Renmin University in Beijing.\n\nBut Evans J. R. Revere, a former State Department official who was involved in previous negotiations with North Korea, was less impressed. He said the formula of denuclearization for security guarantees had \u201cbeen the basis of several sets of talks\u201d between the two countries in the past.\n\nEven so, Mr. Revere said the Trump administration would be hard-pressed to reject the North\u2019s proposal without making it appear that Washington \u2014 not the North \u2014 was the problem.\n\n\u201cWith these developments, the door seems wide open to a U.S.-North Korea exploratory conversation if both sides want one,\u201d he said.", "title": "Raising Hopes, North Korea Offers to Talk About Its Nuclear Arsenal", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun", "Mark Landler"]}

But their defense faltered, and the team slumped over the first two months of 2018, dropping out of contention and leading to a public proclamation that major roster changes were coming.\n\nIn the course of a week in late February, the Rangers sent McDonagh and Miller to Tampa Bay, Rick Nash and Nick Holden to Boston, and Michael Grabner to the Devils. Those moves helped complete a roster overhaul that began with the departures of Girardi and center Derek Stepan last summer.\n\nWith a new-look lineup that included the highly rated teenage forwards Lias Andersson and Filip Chytil, the Rangers were eliminated from playoff contention on Tuesday. Now, they are playing games without postseason implications for the first time since 2004, the closing days of Mark Messier\u2019s career.\n\nGirardi reflected on his lengthy tenure with the Rangers, saying he had given \u201cblood, sweat and tears for 11 years\u201d for the franchise.

They exchanged Ryan Callahan for Martin St. Louis at the deadline in 2014, and the move helped the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup finals. Anton Stralman, a key defenseman on the Rangers squad that lost in those finals to the Los Angeles Kings, also plays for the Lightning now.\n\nMcDonagh, who because of an injury did not play his first game with Tampa Bay until March 10, is again paired with Girardi for the Lightning, now the best team in the Eastern Conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty surreal. It feels like old times,\u201d McDonagh said of the reunion. \u201cIt is great to be on the ice with him again, continuing to do the same things we did in New York.\u201d\n\nMiller, a somewhat surprising inclusion in the fire sale, has thrived with Tampa Bay, with nine goals and seven assists in 15 games.\n\nThe Rangers are playing with a spark since the roster reshuffle, which included the demotion of the high-priced defenseman Brendan Smith and season-ending knee surgery in January for defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, last summer\u2019s major free-agent addition.\n\nTheir blueline corps now includes the newcomers Neal Pionk, John Gilmour and Rob O\u2019Gara, all of whom have impressed General Manager Jeff Gorton.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Rangers still face many question marks heading into their early off-season. Lundqvist\u2019s understudy for next season is to be determined, though 22-year-old Alexandar Georgiev made a strong case for consideration in his 10 recent appearances. The Rangers also acquired numerous prospects in their various trades, and they currently have seven picks in the first three rounds of the June draft, including three first-round selections.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just starting the process,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nForward Chris Kreider, who missed 24 games because of a blood clot that required rib resection surgery, has been buoyed by the work ethic and enthusiasm displayed by the lineup since his return in late February.\n\n\u201cThose guys, the little experience they have in them, they work hard and they want to get better every day,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of how old you are, the team\u2019s going to lean on you at some point and you\u2019re going to have to be a leader.\u201d\n\nThe veteran Marc Staal, who has been a Ranger for 11 seasons, has become a mentor to Pionk, 22.\n\nNow second to Lundqvist in seniority, Staal, 31, has earned particular praise from Coach Alain Vigneault for his leadership.

He listened to stories on the radio and devoured comics but didn\u2019t read another book until he discovered \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d at his branch library on a class visit when he was 10.\n\nHe was introduced to poetry by two uncles, one an aspiring actor who flamboyantly performed Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Raven\u201d at home, and another whose English bookie mailed him poems by W. H. Auden. (Mr. Danowski ultimately collected about a thousand volumes of Auden\u2019s works.)\n\nServing mornings as an altar boy at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Manhattan, he mingled in museums and Greenwich Village galleries and coffee houses. As a student at Cathedral Prep, a Roman Catholic seminary, he became smitten with rare books after an aunt, who worked at Columbia University, got him an after-school job shelving books on the campus at the Burgess-Carpenter Library, now the Milstein Library.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to create this collection, as I found the books, I was shelving them in my mind,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2004. \u201cIt was an imaginary library, based on the Burgess-Carpenter experience. It was really like being a librarian in my dreams.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter spending two years at Fordham University in the Bronx, Mr. Danowski worked as an art dealer in Woodstock, N.Y., and then in Europe.

It\u2019s been our experience that having the vocabulary right there decreases anxiety about not knowing what to say. We use the free app Skitch to label and draw on the image to create a low-filter environment. Before we begin the brainstorming part of this activity, we always go over the \u201cSteps to NYT VTS\u201d poster that Mrs. Montemagno created. Regardless of a student\u2019s language level, this vocabulary is reviewed every Monday.\n\nThe poster is an effective way to teach our students the vocabulary that describes what they will do with the photograph. These academic vocabulary words cannot simply be memorized. They need to be experienced and used over and over.\n\nAnalyzing and Discussing the Photograph\n\nStudents are given five to 10 minutes to analyze the photograph on their own and write any words or phrases that come to mind. They are encouraged to use Google Translate to translate words, and not complete sentences. While students are welcome to use their native language, it\u2019s our goal to have them practice their English skills. In the beginning of the school year, students work on this activity individually. As the year progresses, they work in groups and complete the brainstorming with peers.\n\nAfter the brainstorming session, students engage in a class discussion. We lead the discussion using the three questions prescribed by Visual Thinking Strategies, the organization that collaborates each week with the Learning Network on \u201cWGOITP?\u201d:\n\n\u2022 What is going on this picture?\n\n\u2022 What do you see that makes you say that?\n\n\u2022 What more can you find?\n\nAs the discussion progresses, we restate our students\u2019 ideas, paraphrase their comments and ensure that whatever it is they say is backed up with something (evidence) they see in the photograph (the second question does this job beautifully). Students are asked to use the sentence starters listed on a poster that is taped to the front of the room.\n\nWhile students are discussing the photograph, we write their ideas and questions on a large T-chart taped to our easel. We have different expectations for students with different English language levels. \u201cEntering\u201d and \u201cEmerging\u201d students copy down what we write on their own T-chart. Our rationale for this is that students at these levels still need practice copying notes from the board. \u201cTransitioning\u201d and \u201cExpanding\u201d students don\u2019t copy notes from the board in this activity because they will use their own evidence to support the claim that they create individually.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "_________\n\nWhat Mr. Meyer Did and Why, in His Words\n\nAs an education journalist, it didn\u2019t take me long to recognize how important a role journalism could play in the recent movement to bring more content-based curriculums into public schools. This was part of what prompted me to launch School Life Media (SLM) in 2012, and journalism education soon became a major focus of what we were trying to do.\n\nFrom the beginning I knew we would use journalism to improve student literacy and from the beginning I knew that New York Times stories would be at the heart of the program. I have since compiled a list of dozens of Times stories that I believe not only beautifully illustrate journalism\u2019s broad content reach but also the quality of its reporting and writing in communicating that content. You can find some of them at the end of this post. In the summer of 2016, we introduced some 50 children \u2014 third through sixth grades \u2014 to the practice of journalism in various summer programs sponsored by the Hudson City School District in Hudson, N.Y.\n\nAt the invitation of our district\u2019s middle school, the M.C. Smith Intermediate School, the following winter and spring we brought the program to one third-grade class and one fourth-grade class during the school\u2019s regular school day as part of those classes\u2019 state-mandated literacy unit. This fit perfectly with our mission to deliver a journalism program to all students. There were approximately 25 students in each class, representing a demographic and academic mix, including special education students and students both below and above grade level.\n\nThe pilot was successful, and the school principal invited us to present the program to the school\u2019s entire fifth grade, some 150 students in seven different classes, including one special education classroom. We began the year with a 12-lesson program and have since expanded it to 20 lessons. Each lesson is a 35-minute period at the end of the school day, in which we provide an instructor, an aide and a complete curriculum with lesson plans. The regular classroom teacher is in the classroom and assists us. He or she remains responsible for the classroom order, as well as ensuring that we are following all education rules and regulations. One of our goals is for teachers to continue to teach the program themselves after working with us.\n\nWe introduced a two-track curriculum \u2014 a New York Times track and a Local Stories track \u2014 with detailed lesson plans and a \u201cModule at a Glance\u201d format developed by the third-grade teacher Marlene Parmentier. We emphasize three essential elements \u2014 the five senses, the five W\u2019s and the five activities; four units \u2014 what is a journalist? taking notes, what\u2019s a story? and publish; and one golden rule \u2014 finish the assignment as best you can. Our students learn by doing.\n\nReporter\u2019s Notebooks, Press Conferences and Writing News Stories\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the beginning of each course, students are given reporter\u2019s notebooks and encouraged to write in them at every opportunity. They make their own press passes, take notes on every aspect of the class, and then read from those notes in front of the class (by standing and \u201cprojecting\u201d). They learn to stand and ask questions of guests (in \u201cpress conferences\u201d) and, of course, write stories, and design and create pages that include the name of their paper, the date of publication, the price of the paper (though not yet implemented, it is one of the kids\u2019 favorite tasks!), a headline, a byline, an illustration and caption, and the story \u2013 the result, we hope, of their research and note taking.\n\nOn the New York Times track, our lesson plans include New York Times stories such as \u201cStick Insect Helps Scientist Study How Animals Move\u201d by James Gorman; \u201cShould You Let Your Dog Lick Your Face?\u201d by Christopher Mele, \u201cWhy Doesn\u2019t the United States (Finally) Get Rid of the Penny?\u201d by Binyamin Appelbaum. Given the age of the students \u2013 third-to-fifth-grade \u2013 we introduced these stories gradually.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of the stories included a video; students were encouraged to take notes as they watched. We passed out a printed handout. A teacher then read the story out loud with students listening, circling words they didn\u2019t know as they listened. Students shared with the class the words they had circled. They filled out a Critical Reading form which asks students to identify such story characteristics as headline, byline and the five W\u2019s. We played a story game: rearranging phrases and sentences from the story and asking the students to put them together.\n\nThough I was well aware that these Times stories were above reading level for many, if not most, of the students, I had also been in enough classrooms to know that students are sponges, and they absorb. Thus, our mantra: Students will learn journalism by doing journalism and, in the process, learn a lot of content and skills. It is a clich\u00e9, but one worth remembering: Students rise to the challenge. We don\u2019t mandate mastery, only effort.\n\nWith our \u201clocal story\u201d track, we encourage students to focus on familiar subjects, including local guests brought to class to discuss the subject of the New York Times story. For instance, as part of the \u201cStick Insect\u201d story we invited the local high school\u2019s robotics teacher to visit. For the penny story, we invited a local banker. We introduce the students to the \u201cpress conference\u201d format: Students, wearing press passes that they have made, stand, identify themselves, the paper they\u2019re with, and ask questions.\n\nJournalism Activities and Routines\n\nPhoto\n\nOur five activities include:\n\n\u2022 Going to work. This means beginning each class with students writing in their reporter\u2019s notebooks their names, the date, the time, the location, the class name and the weather (basically, a who, what, when, where and why).\n\n\u2022 Quickwrites. On a subject chosen by the SLM instructor, write for two minutes in their reporter\u2019s notebooks.\n\n\u2022 Quick Review: What did we do last class (use your reporter\u2019s notebook for reference).\n\n\u2022 Press Conferences. An interview with a guest.\n\n\u2022 Assignments. Write on a subject chosen by the SLM instructor that does not have tight time constraints. A perennial favorite is, \u201cInterview with my shoe.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Oh yes, we also have a \u201cpub party\u201d at the last class, which includes passing out certificates of completion and awards (e.g., the Speed Demon Writing Award for filling the most pages in their reporter\u2019s notebooks), as well as healthy foods like fruit and vegetable platters and water.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the final step, the students\u2019 pages are then copied, \u201cbound\u201d and distributed.\n\nA note on computers: We have adopted a decidedly manual approach to our task. We use Smartboards for showing illustrations, stories and videos from the internet, but otherwise the students use paper and pencil, especially in their reporter\u2019s notebooks. We print the copies of the Times stories. (We adults use Google Docs to share information.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe also encourage the use of all the senses, most especially hearing. Thus, we discourage the adults from writing words and sentences on the \u201cboard\u201d for the kids to copy and instead encourage kids to raise their hands and ask for clarification, or ask their neighbors to help. Teachers reinforce this informational dynamic by asking various students to answer the questions, thus also reinforcing one of journalism\u2019s golden rules: two sources.\n\n_________\n\n10 Times Articles Recommended by Peter Meyer for Using With Students\n\nAn Insect That Masters Water and Air\n\nAn Obsessive Collector Who\u2019s Drawn Royalty to Brooklyn\n\nAt 100, Still Running for Her Life\n\nCapturing the Life of a Flower That Blooms for Less Than a Day\n\nHajj Prep: Search Soul, Buy Sturdy Shoes, Pay the Dentist\n\nIn More Backyards, the Chicken Comes First\n\nIt\u2019s a Bird!

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Why We Chose It: With the use of just one Times article, this teacher reworks the customary Robert Burns school assignment (\u201crote-learning poems about mice and lice\u201d) and, instead, has his students revel in language new and old, making the famous \u201cBurns Stanza\u201d their own.\n\n_________\n\nWhat Mr. Gillespie Did and Why, In His Own Words\n\nPhoto\n\nEvery January pupils across Scotland are besieged with lessons and assemblies about Robert Burns, our national poet, in honor of Burns Night.\n\nIt\u2019s a legitimate and important landmark that young people should be aware of and celebrate, but I\u2019ve always been a little uncertain about how we, as teachers, go about it. I was never sure what exactly students were meant to be getting out of all these recitals and Tartan Days.\n\nWhy are they rote-learning poems about mice and lice? Are they just celebrating Burns for the sake of celebration itself? What skills are they actually learning and developing that they can relate to and build upon?\n\nWell, over 200 years since Burns\u2019s death, the rich Scots language that he used can be pretty intimidating to decipher. A lot of pupils can indeed recite whole chunks from his Greatest Hits \u2014 \u201cTo a Mouse,\u201d \u201cTam o\u2019 Shanter,\u201d \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d \u2014 but I doubt they could tell you what all the words actually mean. What is a syne anyway? I wanted to try and do something a little more relatable with my class, to try and teach them a few things that they might be able to put to use in future lessons or in later life.\n\nTo do this I needed a stimulus, and this fabulous piece of travel writing from 2014 was perfect: \u201cIn Scotland, Guts, Glory and Haggis.\u201d\n\nIt focuses on one of Burns\u2019s most celebrated topics \u2014 the mysterious and elusive haggis \u2014 and gives pupils a modern insight, written in an engaging style. I used this article as the launch pad and inspiration for these lessons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo simply read, memorize and recite Burns\u2019s poems felt pretty one-dimensional to me. I thought it was far more useful for students to play about with the language that he used, and the structure of his poetry, but also to write in their own register \u2014 which could be described as a pretty standard form of English with a smattering of regional colloquialisms.\n\nWhy write exclusively in the language of Burns when students have their own evolving, intricate modern Scots instead? I wanted to make use of both, and to do this I provided a glossary of 10 fabulously expressive Scots words used today (bauchle, blether, dreich, fankle, gallus, mooch, pockle, slitter, wabbit, wheescht), but also spoke to the class about how they spoke and what regional phrases they had in their armory.\n\nBelow, the lesson sequence. Notes to students are in italics, followed by my own notes on what happened in class.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nLearning Intentions:\n\n\u25cf To understand how haggis is made\n\n\u25cf To learn about the Burns Stanza\n\n\u25cf To become familiar with new Scots words\n\nStarter Activity:\n\nWorking with a partner, discuss what a haggis is. What is it made of? How is it made? Where does it come from? Write down a description that you could give to a tourist. Be prepared to share these descriptions with the class.\n\nIt became clear from this that students didn\u2019t have a great awareness of what constituted a haggis to begin with. There were lots of answers skirting around the idea of sheep, but these were a bit wooly (forgive the pun). They had loads of vague knowledge about Burns Suppers and turnips, but nothing specific. Hence, the reading task that came next.\n\nReading Task:\n\nRead the article explaining how a haggis is made.\n\nUsing highlighter pens, pick out key phrases.\n\nYou should look for:\n\n\u25cf Descriptive phrases and adjectives\n\n\u25cf Key verbs and actions\n\n\u25cf Key nouns, facts and items\n\n\u25cf Writing features such as simile, alliteration, etc.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring this phase of the lesson, it became clear that the language of the article was perfect for engaging the pupils, who had, in all honesty, not been hugely enthused by the idea of a lesson on Burns.\n\nThe writer uses fantastically gritty and descriptive language to help the reader visualize, smell and feel the preparation of the haggis: yanking veins from lungs; picking lumps of meaty gruel from her fingernails; the glorious stench of the sheep\u2019s stomach. It\u2019s wonderful, and made the whole class sit up and take notice, as they highlighted their favorite bits.\n\nWhile Burns is often lauded for his use of wit and humor, I feel that in schools we often overlook the craft and technical expertise evident in his work. I used the first verse of the immortal \u201cAddress to a Haggis\u201d to illustrate the tight rhythm and rhyme scheme which he popularized \u2014 what became known as the Burns Stanza, as closely associated with him as sonnets are with Shakespeare. This was a key piece of information and I did not move on from this until I felt confident that the whole class understood the format.\n\nNote-taking Task:\n\nThe Burns Stanza:\n\n\u25cf Six lines long\n\n\u25cf Follows an A-A-A-B-A-B rhyme scheme\n\n\u25cf Lines are always the same length: 8-8-8-4-8-4\n\nFor example:\n\nFair fa\u2019 your honest, sonsie face, A 8\n\nGreat chieftain o the puddin\u2019-race! A 8\n\nAboon them a\u2019 ye tak your place, A 8\n\nPainch, tripe, or thairm: B 4\n\nWeel are ye worthy o\u2019 a grace A 8\n\nAs lang\u2019s my airm. B 4\n\nWriting Task:\n\nIn pairs:\n\n\u25cf Write instructions for preparing and cooking haggis, according to the New York Times article about the George Cockburn & Son butchery.\n\n\u25cf This should be in the form of a Burns Stanza poem \u2013 follow the same rhyme scheme and length.\n\n\u25cf You should write at least three stanzas, and make use of at least six Scots words \u2013 use the glossary and include ones of your own.\n\n\u25cf You should include key words and phrases from the article and the glossary. Tick these off the list as you use them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI was really pleased with the response and enthusiasm shown by pupils when writing their poems. They had clearly understood the method for making haggis from the article, which they referred to frequently, and they grappled with the rigidity of the Burns Stanza until they found themselves able to tweak phrasing and expression to fit the lines and create strong rhymes.\n\nThey used some of the traditional words from the Burns glossary, but many also included modern Scots that they knew and used themselves. The paired work allowed for plenty of discussion, meaning that the lessons incorporated the four key strands of English: reading, writing, talking and listening. All that remained was for me to help with rhyming ideas and check their understanding.\n\nHow did I know that they had learned what I wanted them to?

Philip and Elizabeth Jennings have come a long way without their true identities as Russian spies being discovered \u2014 so many close calls, so many wigs \u2014 but with two moody teenagers on their hands, a host of dubious sources and an F.B.I. agent living across the street, how much longer can their luck last?\n\n\u2018The Americans\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAnd how much longer can they keep it together under so much stress? \u201cThis has been hard for me, for a long time,\u201d Philip told Elizabeth last season. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d\n\nHang in there, Philip. Only one season left. Meantime, here\u2019s some crucial intel to catch you up:\n\nState of the Union\n\nKeri Russell and Matthew Rhys in Season 1 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Craig Blankenhorn/FX\n\nWhen we first met Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Philip (Matthew Rhys), their marriage was a complicated fiction, deep cover for their roles as K.G.B. officers. But then we saw their marriage become a little more real last season, with a traditional Russian wedding ceremony using their actual Russian names, Nadezhda and Mischa. The assumption was they would be heading back to Mother Russia soon.\n\nBut when they discovered that one of their key targets, Isaac Breland (Frank Deal), was being promoted to the head of the Soviet Division of the C.I.A., they knew they couldn\u2019t go home as planned. Together, they decided to make some changes \u2014 Elizabeth would assume most of the espionage work, and Philip would largely step aside. He would still handle Breland\u2019s daughter, Kimmy (Julia Garner); he would still help run the travel agency, which was about as neglected as their son, Henry (Keidrich Sellati); and he presumably would still keep an eye on Stan (Noah Emmerich) over Miller High Lifes. But what was that advice Elizabeth just gave their Vietnamese former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tuan (Ivan Mok)? \u201cYou need someone, Tuan,\u201d she said. \u201cA partner. To do this with, to get through it with.\u201d What happens when her own partner retires?\n\nProject Paige\n\nKeri Russell, left, and Holly Taylor in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Patrick Harbron/FX\n\nShe has mastered the fine arts of lying, spying and taking a punch; she has lost her Christian faith and taken a liking to Karl Marx: Paige (Holly Taylor) certainly seems interested in joining the family business. But given the K.G.B.\u2019s goal to place next-generation agents in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A, it may be in everyone\u2019s best interests to keep Paige on wig-care duty and out of harm\u2019s way. (It also gives her plausible deniability if her parents are ever captured).\n\n0\n\nRegarding Henry\n\nKeidrich Sellati in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Jeffrey Neira/FX\n\nDespite his (surprising!) smarts, Henry is probably not heading off to a fancy New Hampshire boarding school. \u201cThis family stays together,\u201d Philip insisted, back when he thought they were about to relocate back to Russia. Thanks, Dad \u2014 as if Henry needed encouragement to spend more time with the more reliable and understanding Stan. (To be fair, it\u2019s easier to be a father figure than an actual father \u2014 something Stan knows all too well). But might Philip have changed his mind now that the Russia plans are on hold?\n\nLast we saw Henry, he was already inadvertently leaking information about his family\u2019s movements and getting private tours of F.B.I. counterintelligence: Do his K.G.B. parents really want to put him in a position where he might someday have to choose between them and Stan? Could this be the season Henry finally gets a clue?\n\nQuestionable Assets\n\nFrom left, Margo Martindale, Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Patrick Harbron/FX\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to get good help. Who can Elizabeth rely upon, besides their handler, Claudia (Margo Martindale); their call center operative, Joan (Polly Lee); and the surveillance queen Marilyn (Amy Tribbey)? It will be interesting to see whether Elizabeth checks in with any of the former recruits still left in the game \u2014 limited shelf lives, these players. Remember when a compulsive gambler named Sanford Prince (Tim Hopper) boldly recruited an Air Force colonel on the K.G.B.\u2019s behalf in Season 1? That colonel was a strange catch \u2014 he provided classified intel on the Strategic Defense Initiative, but he also shot Prince in the head in Season 2, claiming self-defense. Approach with caution.\n\nOver on the F.B.I. side, two sources \u2014 Sofia (Darya Ekamasova) and her beau, Gennadi (Yuri Kolokolnikov) \u2014 may become more active now that Gennadi has passed a polygraph test. (Guess the F.B.I. doesn\u2019t know about the old K.G.B. trick to beat the test by clenching).\n\nDangerous Liaisons\n\nNoah Emmerich and Laurie Holden in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Patrick Harbron/FX\n\nDating is hard in the spy world, where it\u2019s difficult to know whether someone loves you or your security clearance. Stan is in a vulnerable position with Renee (Laurie Holden) \u2014 her move into Chez Beeman and the career advice she has given him are suspect. Philip has long wondered if Renee was a K.G.B. plant, but his former handler Gabriel (Frank Langella) has denied it. (\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Philip,\u201d were his exact words.) But Gabriel said \u2014 and failed to say \u2014 a lot of things. It would make sense for the Center to send a different agent to work Stan, given his history of romancing Rezidentura staffers and how little intel Philip has gleaned from him lately. (Another possibility: Renee works for an entirely different agency. Which one?)\n\nThreats and Liabilities\n\nCosta Ronin in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Eric Liebowitz/FX\n\nStan\u2019s extrajudicial killing of Vlad, the young K.G.B. agent from Season 1, is something that may still come back to bite the F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence team. Stan has already confessed the crime to the deputy attorney general (Cotter Smith), and has threatened to go public with it. (\u201cThe U.S. government killing innocent people? Splashed across the world\u2019s newspapers?\u201d) It\u2019s a card he keeps in his back pocket, but for how long?\n\nMeanwhile, Stan\u2019s K.G.B. frenemy Oleg (Costa Ronin) could be facing some unhappy music of his own. The C.I.A. has already threatened him with blackmail after he admitted on tape that a Soviet defector was a spy, as part of his (ill-fated) attempts with Stan to rescue Nina. And he\u2019s been questioned about his role in blowing the cover of their bioweapons source (Dylan Baker).\n\nThe Extended Family\n\nAlison Wright in Season 5 of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Patrick Harbron/FX\n\nMischa Semenov, Philip\u2019s son with Irina, didn\u2019t get to meet his father in Season 5, but he did find some other relatives in the Soviet Union: Philip\u2019s older brother, Pyotr; his wife, Tamara; and their son. Philip had never mentioned having a brother, so this family reunion came out of nowhere. Now we\u2019re wondering how much more there might be to discover about this side of the family (beyond the fact that Paige and Henry have a cute little cousin).\n\nOn a less complicated happy note, Martha (Alison Wright), who was cruelly separated from her loved ones because of her exfiltration to the Soviet Union, might finally be able to start a family of her own by adopting the orphan Olya. Is a happy ending possible for these two? Poor Martha. It\u2019s nice to think so.", "title": "Ready for Season 6 of \u2018The Americans\u2019?

Despite his well-heeled background (he had attended a boarding school and Yale), Mr. Armor had never been to Europe. Ms. Mead-Armor, a published poet, had lived in Sydney for five years and Paris for 14 and has a master\u2019s degree in translation from N.Y.U.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in North Carolina, in the 2006 Republican primary, before they married. She said sometimes he could be insensitive and he began spending an increasing amount of time sitting in his bathrobe watching Fox News and expected her to tend to him.\n\nWhen he had proposed, she had told him, \u201cEvery man I\u2019ve ever met has treated me like the furniture,\u201d and he promised to be different. But in Highlands, she said, \u201cHe assumed I was the chief cook and bottle washer.\u201d\n\nStill, he respected her intelligence and never underestimated her. Both appreciated The Highlands Newspaper, and after a columnist died, Ms. Mead-Armor suggested that she and Mr. Armor write a column, a combination of personal and political. He was so inspired that he drove her to the editor\u2019s office so they could pitch themselves. The editor bit. The column was named \u201cHis & Hers,\u201d and they alternated from week to week. It featured a photo of her in a French beret and him a felt, wide-brimmed hat.\n\nIn April 2010, a colonoscopy revealed that he had rectal cancer. He breezed through chemotherapy and radiation, never losing his hair or weight. He and Ms. Mead-Armor were optimistic; his cancer had an 85 percent survival rate. After his surgery that August, he wrote a column called \u201cThe End of My Cancer,\u201d urging readers to get colonoscopies.\n\nBut his own recovery was not simple. Mr. Armor, who previously had suffered two heart attacks and was a pack-and-a-half-a-day smoker for 30 years, didn\u2019t bounce back. \u201cThe days we had in the hospital were some of the most special moments of our marriage,\u201d Ms. Mead-Armor said. One day he looked down at her and said, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re the strongest person I know. I could never do this without you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter she noticed that he was being rude to the hospital workers, beeping the call button constantly, she told him he had to stop. The next morning when she returned he had a complete change of attitude, saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d to his nurses.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2010, nine days after his surgery, Ms. Mead-Armor received a call from the hospital at her motel. He died of acute aspiration before she arrived. \u201cHe looked good,\u201d she said. \u201cHis hair had been washed the day before, and he didn\u2019t have that pain in his face.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe column was retitled \u201cJust Hers.\u201d The first one she wrote after his death was called \u201cWidowhood 101.\u201d She closed with the line, \u201cIn the fine tradition of Scarlett O\u2019Hara and Joan of Arc, I am maintaining.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

She still did not have a license. She called a friend, Betty Chesna, who drove a red Corvette that Mr. Armor had nicknamed \u201cthe sex wagon.\u201d Ms. Mead-Armor put the urn box in the back seat and he was returned to Highlands in the sex wagon. \u201cJohn would have loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cMen were winking and us and blowing kisses the whole way home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven after death, life was complicated. It took three years to probate his estate. Because of legal issues surrounding the estate, the home was eventually auctioned off, as were his possessions. Ms. Mead-Armor, after having the highest bid, retained some personal items, like his Benjamin Franklin cane.\n\nA few weeks before Mr. Armor died, his eighth book, \u201cThese Are the Times That Try Men\u2019s Souls,\u201d a collection of Thomas Paine\u2019s writings that he had edited for 10 years, was published by the American Civil Rights Union. At the launch in the Highlands public library, he announced to the crowd, \u201cThere are three women without whom this book could not have seen the day,\u201d and named his boss at the ACRU, his editor and his illustrator.\n\nMouths fell open. A man in the back of the room with a thick Carolina accent called out, \u201cBoy, if you ever intend to have sex again in your natural lifetime you\u2019d better be thanking your lady wife.\u201d\n\nMr. Armor added, \u201cAnd oh yes, of course, my wife Michelle.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn could be extremely insensitive,\u201d Ms. Mead-Armor said as she recalled that evening, \u201cbut he was not a bad person. He could have taken better care of me, but he didn\u2019t always take care of himself.\u201d\n\nThe autumn after he died, she moved to an apartment above a bookstore in town. But it was difficult to be in Highlands without him. \u201cI had to go past the place I didn\u2019t live, the restaurants we had eaten in, and the church I used to go to,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also found less sympathy as a widow than she had expected. When Mr. Armor was alive, they would invite widowed and single friends to accompany them to dinner and the theater, rather than couples. But after his death, few extended that courtesy to her.\n\nBy 2013, she was reminiscing about her hometown, Waynesboro, Va., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. She found a townhouse on the banks of the South River, with Canada geese on the lawn, and fell in love with it on the spot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe has found her home in Waynesboro, singing in a choir, serving on the board of the local concert association, and attending the Unitarian Universalist fellowship.

In 2014, at the age of 63, she finally got her driver\u2019s license.\n\nAs far as romance goes, she has not remarried. \u201cPeople value what is rare,\u201d she said, \u201cand widows are not in short supply.

But on the third floor, all bets seemed off with the inclusion of a brightly enameled folk-artish sculpture of a couple by the Nigerian artist Sokari Douglas Camp.

More awkward Medieval, less Renaissance and Baroque. Why not include some of the early 20th-century carved and painted wood figures of the German Expressionist sculptors Otto M\u00fcller, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Hermann Scherer?

Over the decade from 2014 to 2024, the labor force growth rate for 65- to 74-year-olds is expected to be about 4.5 percent annually, and about 6.4 percent annually for those 75 and older. One hitch: In some workplaces, negative attitudes pervade about the cost of older workers, their stamina, their technological ability and their enthusiasm for learning new ways of doing things.\n\nA rising number of role-model employers, however, are hiring, retaining and supporting workers over 50. Lee Spring was among 13 businesses and nonprofits based in New York City that recently received Age Smart Employer Awards through the program, now in its third year, that is a project of the Columbia Aging Center at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nThose employers offer training and education opportunities and flexible scheduling; adapt physical tasks to the abilities of workers; provide advancement and leadership training for workers of all ages; retrain older workers; and allow phased retirement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased our life expectancy by 50 percent in the last 100 years,\u201d said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School. \u201cNow we have to design society for longer lives, and these awards, I think, are a linchpin of that.\u201d\n\nOne hundred businesses and nonprofits entered the 2017 Age Smart Employer competition, double the number in 2016.\n\nHere are four other companies with pioneering programs for older workers.\n\n\u2022 Huntington Ingalls Industries, the largest military shipbuilding company in the United States, operates The Apprentice School at its Newport News, Va., division.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an age limit,\u201d said Susan Jacobs, vice president for human resources and administration with Newport News Shipbuilding. \u201cEmployees go into The Apprentice School well past the age of what you would think a traditional student would be.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company\u2019s overall work force of 22,000 is composed of 38 percent baby boomers, 40 percent millennials and 20 percent Generation Xers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNearly half of our employees could retire at any day,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said. \u201cThat puts us in a risky situation, and we certainly don\u2019t want those people to retire. Being a master shipbuilder is not easy, and it takes an awful lot of time to become an expert.\u201d\n\nTo keep its aging work force engaged with their work, there are intergenerational mentoring programs. Younger workers mentor older ones, too. \u201cWhat we have found is that the younger workers are helping employees who have been here longer get really comfortable with using the technology.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some employees have relocated to an office nearer to home to allow for a shorter commute, or work part time from home. Employees nearing retirement have been permitted to reduce their hours or work as consultants.\n\n\u201cHiring older workers for our team has been a home run for us as well as for workers about to go into retirement or in retirement,\u201d said Thomas F. Blaney, a partner and director of the firm\u2019s Foundation Services, based in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not about age really.

{"date": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "As the beloved daughter of one of America\u2019s most famous playwrights, Ms. Miller met everyone who was anyone, all from a worm\u2019s eye vantage point in their home in Roxbury, Conn.\n\n\u201cFor reasons I still haven\u2019t figured out, nobody would put me to bed when they had dinner parties, so I was expected to just go under the table,\u201d she said of her father and her mother, the esteemed Austrian photographer, Inge Morath. \u201cAnd there was a big trestle in the middle and I would lie on this five-inch trestle because I was very narrow and just listen and be in my own imagination. Our very greedy dachshund was down there, too, making laps, looking for scraps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a life that\u2019s gone now, a life of artists who believed that if a coffee pot was broken, you welded it back together. It wasn\u2019t a fancy life and it was very much about work and about decency in a certain way. I remember the McGovern fund-raiser in the barn that my father had when I was a kid. I wore purple hot pants thinking I was just so cool. And the Styrons and the Calders and all the people who lived in those hills in those days were there. They were bohemians in a way, but they were also very straight people. It wasn\u2019t a bohemia or even Bloomsbury. They weren\u2019t sleeping around. They were just hard-working people who drank a lot of wine at night.\u201d\n\nMs. Miller, who is 55, has sky-blue eyes and long, dark wavy hair and is wearing a delicate cream blouse with origami sleeves, high-waisted black pants, and on her fingers jewelry given to her by her husband: an oval aquamarine ring and a French Claddagh ring \u2014 a heart with a fleur-de-lis. I ask if she was ever intimidated by her lineage as she made her own name, first as a fiction writer and then as a screenwriter and director.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI definitely went through periods of wishing I had been a child of unknown people,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I felt like I could\u2019ve made my mark alone, and it pissed me off. I would have liked the chance to say things like the Monty Python guys did when they said something like, \u2018When I was a child, we used to have to scrape the muck from the bottom of a pond.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I think my parents, especially my mother, gave me a lot of confidence. My mother was told by the poet Anna Akhmatova that because I was female, she should spoil me so that I would not be anyone\u2019s slave. I don\u2019t think my mother spoiled me in a material way. I was raised to be kind to people. But I was really raised to be an artist, sort of the way some kids are raised to be tennis players. And I kind of stuck with the program.\u201d\n\nSheila Nevins, who shepherded Ms. Miller\u2019s documentary about her dad, which will make its premiere on HBO on March 19, marvels at her friend. \u201cSweet Rebecca,\u201d she says. \u201cShe should be crazy, going to psychiatrists every five minutes. And instead she came out like a buttercup, so lovely, so guileless, so unspoiled, so nice to waiters. You expect a star and you get your college roommate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one of her short stories, Ms. Miller writes about her protagonist, a young woman named Greta: \u201cAt first her parents and their friends thought that she was \u2018not gifted or tough enough to survive so close to the light of their parents\u2019 world.\u2019\u201d The character\u2019s father, a famous lawyer, notes: \u201cEveryone has their own personal velocity.\u201d\n\nArthur Miller got famous writing about fathers and sons. As he said in one interview: \u201cThe parent is always a mythological figure. It\u2019s the basis of all mythology, after all. What\u2019s Zeus? He\u2019s the father. He\u2019s the guy that throws thunderbolts \u2014 kills you. Or raises you up into glory.\u201d\n\nHis daughter says: \u201cI definitely feel like I lucked out being female with him. Because he was not the sort of person who wouldn\u2019t have minded being metaphorically murdered by their sons, subsumed, overtaken or whatever. I got under the radar because I was female. But had I been male, I have a feeling we would have had a much different, more difficult relationship.\u201d\n\nI tell Ms. Miller that I was so strongly affected by \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d when I read it in high school that I started crying when my brother told me he had gotten a job as a salesman. In her film, Ms. Miller interviews Mike Nichols, who directed a revival of \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d on Broadway in 2012, and Mr. Nichols wonders if Mr. Miller \u201cburned something out\u201d when he wrote that play because \u201che came so close to the target.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there was almost a mystical property to the creation of that play,\u201d Ms. Miller agrees. \u201cThat remained a mystery to him for the rest of his life. How do you write that first act in one night? It\u2019s almost a visitation. It was a raging fire that went through him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting story because, of course, part of the play is talking about the wrong dreams and how our society has built people up to want things that maybe they can never have, so they feel like failures when really all the things that they need are right around them. But, early on, he said he was standing in the back of the theater once and he saw many people crying, and he was like, \u2018Oh my God, did I make this too sad?\u2019 That the pathos of Willy was so enormous that maybe no one was going to remember any of the social criticism.\u201d\n\nHis daughter, growing up in a time when his reputation had fallen off, felt compelled to offer a vision of her father as she saw him. She began shooting VHS tapes of him back when she was 21. \u201cI realize, you know, that this is my sixth film but it\u2019s also my first film,\u201d she says. \u201cI spent 18 months cutting it. It was quite an emotional process for me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe felt there was \u201ca huge gap\u201d between the cozy storyteller she saw at home, who enjoyed woodworking, and the cool intellectual she saw in interviews.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe had a remoteness in interviews, because he was a shy person and he was very protective of himself, understandably at that point,\u201d Ms. Miller says. \u201cIt was a feeling like, his warmth and his humor would never really come through.\u201d\n\nIt was strange, she admits, to work on the sections about his first two wives, Mary Slattery and Marilyn Monroe. \u201cHow do you express his vulnerability with these women?\u201d she says. \u201cWhich was a surprise to me. Because he had been lovely and jokey and cuddly with me, but he was hardly a romantic figure to me. That\u2019s not how I saw him.\u201d\n\nShe uses his journal entries and love letters to unfurl the relationships.\n\n\u201cOne of my biggest surprises was how tender he was with Mary,\u201d Ms. Miller says of her father\u2019s first wife, who had been his college sweetheart and with whom he had a son and a daughter. \u201cI had never had a taste of that, so it was interesting to read those letters and say, \u2018No, that really was a beautiful romance.\u2019 Her character was very reserved. But it was important because she talked to him about the plays, he asked her about them. She was a little tough on him. He needed that. He did need a woman to adore him, though, that is for sure.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller concedes in the movie: \u201cI enjoyed being a father. I also enjoyed escaping being a father. I was always in and out of my skin because I just couldn\u2019t be a father 24 hours a day and still do what I was thinking I had to do.\u201d He said he worried that he would forget to pick up his son from school. About his first wife, he writes in his journal: \u201cIn all the feeling for Mary, I rarely see her face, rarely sense her. At this moment I fear to go home.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Miller gets besotted with Ms. Monroe, his first marriage quickly dissolves.\n\nMs. Miller found that portraying her father\u2019s passionate romance with Monroe was \u201cvery tricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt sometimes almost that I shouldn\u2019t be in the room, I shouldn\u2019t know all this stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was this one moment that we created a scene with still pictures where he seems to be looking at her and she\u2019s standing there and he says, \u2018You\u2019re the saddest girl I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019 It was weird, but that was also the moment where I sort of transformed from a daughter into a filmmaker. And I also ended up sort of seeing how she was just a person, you know? Because there\u2019s so much smoke around her. She would even tend to take up huge amounts of space in the film. I was constantly trying to cut it down again, because she has so much light coming out of her. So much charisma. I just said, \u2018O.K., how can we penetrate the mystery a little bit of this woman and this man and in the end find some clarity?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe puts one of her father\u2019s searing love letters to Marilyn up on screen, reading: \u201cSo be my love as you surely are. I think I shall be less furiously jealous when we have made a life together. It is just that I believe that I should really die if I ever lost you. It is as though we were born the same morning when no other life existed on this earth. Love, Art.\u201d\n\nI ask Ms. Miller if, as a filmmaker, she fathoms why Ms. Monroe continues to burn so bright.\n\n\u201cI think she came to represent something, like a patron saint of vulnerability or something,\u201d she says, sipping an iced cappuccino. \u201cThere was something about her orphanhood that became in itself its own kind of mythic thing.\u201d Ms. Monroe used to tell Mr. Miller how to recognize orphans in the crowd by the look in their eyes. Mr. Miller called Ms. Monroe \u201ca poet on a street corner trying to recite to a crowd pulling at her clothes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe romance that began with such passion devoured itself. \u201cHe was really, really worn down,\u201d his daughter says. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t gotten any work done for a long time, and this was a man who completely identified himself as a writer. And that had been put away, barring \u2018The Misfits,\u2019 which was itself excruciating. But I think she had had it, too. They were not matched. They tried and they just bungled it.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe was the rose and he was definitely the gardener. But he\u2019s more of a rose and he needed a gardener. People can only play the other part for so long.\u201d\n\nMs. Miller says that eventually her dad realized he could not rescue the eternal orphan.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really save someone,\u201d Ms. Miller says. \u201cYou have to acknowledge that you\u2019re you and I\u2019m me, and your powers don\u2019t extend to being a savior. My impression is for whatever reason, I don\u2019t know exactly, but she saw death was luring her for a long, long time, and I think that had to be her end point.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The unconscious, you never know.\u201d\n\nWhen she was still single, Inge Morath happened to be working on the set of \u201cThe Misfits\u201d for her photo agency, Magnum, and took some haunting pictures of the luminous blonde with the darkness inside.\n\n\u201cMy mother was always very sweet about Marilyn,\u201d Ms. Miller says. \u201cShe really liked her. Someone asked her how the marriage between Marilyn and my father was and my mom was like: \u2018Oh, very happy. They seemed very happy.\u2019 Because she wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout a year after his split from Ms. Monroe, Mr. Miller began dating Ms. Morath. \u201cI am discouraged with myself, my rootlessness,\u201d he wrote to her. \u201cAnd ashamed too. I can\u2019t talk to anyone but you about so many things. I feel haunted sometimes by the question of whether anything, any feeling, is eternal.\u201d\n\nIf Ms. Miller had to summon her nerve to deal with the lusty and sorrowful side of her father that bubbled up with Marilyn, she also had to summon her nerve to deal with the most disturbing part of the documentary: the institutionalization of her younger brother, Daniel, who was born in 1966 with Down syndrome.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe was asked to make the film in the mid-90s, but demurred because her parents were alive and she had not yet discussed her brother in interviews.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know how to approach it,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was a delicate subject for them and it was very personal and they were very private people. And it was a tender point for my mother, especially, and I felt very protective over that. But I also felt a filmmaker\u2019s need to be honest. And I felt, if I\u2019m doing this portrait, I\u2019m going to have to do it. And as I say in the film, my father did offer to do an interview.\u201d\n\nHe died in 2005, at 89, before that was accomplished.\n\nIt would have been revealing. The playwright known as the moralist of the century for his work and his brave refusal (backed by Marilyn) to name names during the McCarthy era, the playwright who focused on fathers and sons, ended up virtually wiping his own son out of his life; Daniel was not mentioned in Mr. Miller\u2019s memoir, \u201cTimebends,\u201d nor in his obituary in The New York Times. He was also not cited in Ms. Morath\u2019s Times obituary.\n\nIn the film, Ms. Miller shows her father\u2019s journal entry from 1968: \u201cAs the nurse was dressing Daniel in the hospital, preparing him for our journey to the institution, I turned to examine him \u2014 with some difficulty. In a few seconds I found myself, not doubting the doctor\u2019s conclusions, but feeling a welling up of love for him. I dared not touch him, lest I end by taking him home, and I wept.\u201d\n\nIf she had done the interview, Ms. Miller says, she thinks her father would have said this: \u201cThat they were advised to do it. That he believed that it was the right thing for our family. It\u2019s a subject that was just hard to broach in my family. And when you\u2019re raised like that, it\u2019s not easy to just overcome that right away.\u201d\n\nA 2007 Vanity Fair article suggested that Daniel had basically been abandoned in an \u201cunderstaffed and overcrowded\u201d facility in Connecticut, with his father rarely visiting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think the Vanity Fair article was written in a spirit of malice,\u201d Ms. Miller says. \u201cThey made it seem like he never saw him, which wasn\u2019t true. He did see him. It\u2019s just that it wasn\u2019t, perhaps wasn\u2019t, enough. But you also have to put things in a little bit of historic perspective. There were other families who put their Down syndrome children in institutions. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mystery. And really, finally, in the film, I was ultimately honest with my own limitations and where my knowledge ends. I don\u2019t know exactly what transpired between those people because they never told me. All I know is what my relationship is with my brother, which is great.\u201d\n\nEncouraged by her husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ms. Miller incorporated her brother into her life.\n\n\u201cI started seeing him much more when I was in my 20s, actually late 20s, to be honest, and even more so once I started to have a family,\u201d she says, adding about her husband: \u201cDaniel was in my life, my children were in my life and I was sort of free to create new rules and another, different kind of life.\u201d Her husband, she says, \u201cbreathed fresh life\u201d into her relationship with her brother.\n\nShe says her brother, who is said to resemble his father, is \u201chugely happy\u201d now. He works; has participated in the Special Olympics six times, for biking; and lives with a family that has become \u201clike a second family\u201d and that \u201chas a wonderful social life,\u201d she says.\n\nIn her father\u2019s will, she says, his money \u201cwas divided by four.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you can talk and talk and talk, but somehow you don\u2019t get any closer to the truth,\u201d she says, her eyes filling with tears.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Miller\u2019s work has been called the \u201cfeminist, non-creepy\u201d version of Woody Allen. Ethan Hawke says that being directed by Ms. Miller is \u201clike being directed by Annie Hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, this is a difficult subject,\u201d she says of Mr. Allen. \u201cWhat he does inside a frame, he\u2019s moving and he\u2019s moving people around within it. He\u2019s a great artist in that sense. As for the rest of it, it\u2019s a debate. You know, my husband won\u2019t go to see any Wagner operas because he was an anti-Semite, right? If you only appreciate artists who have been good people, who\u2019s going to be left for us to appreciate?

To get Ms. Bruns\u2019s license taken away temporarily required petitioning a judge, even though city records indicated that during the past two years, the car she was driving had been caught on camera violating speed regulations around schools four times and running red lights on several other occasions.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that Ms. Bruns was not driving the car in the moments of those infractions, but it is also possible that she should not have been driving at all. The police believe she may have had a seizure while driving; she was taken to the hospital after the crash where she remained.\n\nThe tragedy points to the limits of Vision Zero, a plan to reduce pedestrian fatalities and one of the mayor\u2019s signature initiatives. It has been largely successful: Pedestrian deaths dropped by 32 percent last year, making 2017 one of the safest on record. Speed cameras that have been shown to reduce crashes involving fatal and serious injuries are in place in some parts of the city. But automation in this sense has a real cost; it removes the presence of a police officer who could pull a speeding driver over and see if something might be off. Beyond that, Vision Zero cannot get around the broader spirit of the law, which treats cars much in the way it treats guns, sanctioning the right to operate them as nearly sacrosanct.\n\nFor five years now, this truth has been evident to Thomas Wallack, an investment manager who lives in Brooklyn Heights.

She died in 1909, and Clemens in 1910, several months before the Jean L. Clemens Memorial Building \u2014 the original Mark Twain Library \u2014 was completed and stocked with Clemens\u2019s books.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince then, the library\u2019s space has quadrupled; its holdings now include more than 50,000 items, and its walls are inscribed with Twain quotes.

Then last month his administration indicated that it is receptive to sending more captives there, including members of the Islamic State. They would be the first new arrivals in a decade, extending the life of an institution that has disappointed on every front.\n\nAlso last month, Secretary of Defense James Mattis fired the official in charge of overseeing the trials. The Pentagon gave no explanation, but some speculated it was because the official had been exploring a potential plea deal for the Sept. 11 suspects.\n\nAnd last week we learned, thanks to Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s reporting, why the lawyers for the man accused of masterminding the Cole bombing defied a judge\u2019s order to appear in court.

Since the beginning, they have been dogged by accusations of inherent unfairness. Hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion, which would never be allowed in a civilian court, are potentially admissible in these proceedings. More prosaically, the court\u2019s location on an island in the middle of the Caribbean means that all of the lawyers and judges shuttle back and forth from the United States on expensive military-chartered flights, adding logistical complexities and delays.\n\nAs a result, while roughly 780 detainees have been held at Guant\u00e1namo, the commissions have issued only eight convictions, and half of those have been either overturned or partly invalidated. Cases languish for years in pretrial proceedings. The majority of Guant\u00e1namo detainees will probably never have their day in court, which means we will never deliver the justice that the families of victims of terrorism deserve. After a decade or more behind bars, more than half of the remaining detainees have yet to be charged with any crime.

Along the way, he will find his fate shackled \u2014 for a while, literally \u2014 to that of a slave he buys at auction, the well-spoken John Blanke (a wittily regal Chukwudi Iwuji), who has great expectations of his own.\n\nDo the trials shared by these young men forge true spiritual kinship? Nah. When they find themselves taken in by a Shaker-like religious sect, led by a blind lay preacher (Max Baker, hilarious), Jim is quick to point out the errors of his host\u2019s altruistic ways, in a lacerating, crockery-smashing dinner scene.\n\nThroughout the first act, Mr. Norris and Mr. Greif pull off the not inconsiderable feat of keeping us fully, even breathlessly engaged, without presenting a single character who entirely captures our sympathies. Granted, Mr. Iwuji\u2019s John, who escapes slavery to become an artist and activist, has conventionally heroic possibilities. But he\u2019s so pie-in-the-sky pious, too.\n\nYet after a cliff-hanging first-act finale (it involves a Hessian execution squad), the play seems to lose faith in its audience\u2019s capacity for inference. The second act begins with a 21st-century, Davos-style symposium, in which various world titans of industry \u2014 including a pompous descendant of Jim Trewitt (Richard Poe) \u2014 defend the right to be rich.\n\nDo we really need this thudding nudge? It\u2019s not as if a show titled \u201cThe Low Road\u201d was ever going to be subtle. That side-trip into the present admits a harsh, electric glare that undermines the candle-lighted artifice of the central story.\n\nAnd once we return to that story, which finds Jim and John taken up by rich New York City patrons (Ms. Harris and a period-perfect Kevin Chamberlin), \u201cThe Low Road\u201d never quite finds its sly footing again. The script sprays its venom on arts philanthropists, four-horse-coach liberals and the ancestors of Wall Street scam artists with fire-hose force.\n\nIn case we missed a point that has been sharply present from the beginning, we are treated to one other sermonizing time-travel excursion, which is so batty it\u2019s kind of fun.

His terrific \u201cThe Runner,\u201d an exemplar of neorealist-style storytelling first shown in the 1980s, should be more widely available. \u201cA, B, C \u2026 Manhattan,\u201d part of a trilogy inspired by his life in New York, experiments with lengthy Steadicam shots in a wandering, day-spanning narrative. You would never identify it as the work of the same filmmaker.\n\nA current retrospective of Mr. Naderi\u2019s movies at the Museum of Modern Art includes a run of his latest film, \u201cMonte\u201d \u2014 which again tries something totally different. Set in the Middle Ages, this Italian-language feature opens with a funeral. After the protagonist, Agostino (Andrea Sartoretti), a farmer, and his wife, Nina (Claudia Potenza), bury their daughter, his cousins soon depart the settlement. But Agostino wishes to remain where his ancestors lived, and Nina won\u2019t leave their daughter\u2019s grave.\n\nLike Albert Serra\u2019s \u201cQuixotic/Honor de Cavalleria,\u201d \u201cMonte\u201d demonstrates how to suggest an epic scale without the means of a Hollywood production. The natural scenery becomes a character. The howl of the wind (and in one brief moment, what sounds jarringly like air traffic) stands in place of a score. \u201cMonte\u201d weds these straightforward elements to a fittingly stark narrative: Agostino sets out to conquer the mountain that keeps his farm barren by chipping away at it bit by bit.\n\nThe film is limited by its central metaphor, but it is never less than absorbing or original.", "title": "Review: A Man Confronts a Mountain in \u2018Monte\u2019", "authors": []}

The famous \u201cexit pursued by a bear\u201d scene serves as the hinge between the two theatrical worlds, and we now spend an hour or so with the requisite rubes, light-fingered scalawags, misallied lovers and sheepshearing hoydens.\n\nBut before we can fully identify what happened to the plot, which involves the banished baby and her adoptive family, we are uprooted once again. Back to Sicilia we go, for a denouement that is all melodrama and magic. Hermione, apparently preserved all these years as a statue and now brought back to life by Paulina, is reunited with her lost daughter and humbled husband. Whether it counts as a happy ending may depend on how long it takes you to stop trying to make sense of it.\n\nMost productions I have seen work too hard to make these elements emulsify. (The rustic act is a chore in any case.) Ms. Arbus, who has directed six other Shakespeare plays for Theater for a New Audience, including an especially notable \u201cOthello,\u201d doesn\u2019t try; rather, she emphasizes the lumps. She begins with a severe white set (by Riccardo Hernandez) but also with the Bohemian bear, dancing in the snow and demonstrating that what follows will be both grisly and giddy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The different seasons of the year and the different experiences of restraint and freedom within them are skillfully sketched in Marcus Doshi\u2019s lighting, Justin Ellington\u2019s music and Emily Rebholz\u2019s costumes, which go from tails and evening gowns to hayseed overalls.\n\nBut mostly Ms. Arbus depends on the excellent cast to squeeze the ripe Shakespearean language for all it\u2019s worth. The actors in the Sicilian roles are especially fleet and pungent, which is one of the reasons the production, at two hours and 50 minutes, is much shorter than many. (It\u2019s also lightly trimmed.) Anatol Yusef, recently a fine Laertes in the Oscar Isaac \u201cHamlet,\u201d makes an unusually convincing Leontes, whipping himself into a lather of jealousy that seems perversely sexual in itself. And you may never hear a Paulina as fierce as Mahira Kakkar, who in her defense of Hermione nearly blows down the castle.\n\nIf Ms. Kakkar inevitably brings to mind the #MeToo moment, Ms. Arbus doesn\u2019t dwell on it. She needn\u2019t; the women are already the most powerful characters, and though that power is mostly moral, they eventually find ways to weaponize it. In Hermione\u2019s resuscitation scene, regally played by Kelley Curran, Leontes\u2019s contrasting shame is palpable. We understand that what Shakespeare values is not the anarchic emotionality of men but the vigilant self-possession of women.\n\nMs. Arbus\u2019s production endorses that preference, suggesting a way to face all challenges \u2014 not just bizarre and catastrophic ones \u2014 honorably. Our lives will be both Sicilian and Bohemian, tragic and comic, constrained and free, \u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d tells us. Some griefs will be assuaged; others will not. We must practice the patience to shoulder it all.\n\nBeyond that it may be the most we can ask that, when we exit, it won\u2019t be pursued by a bear.", "title": "Review: A Moving \u2018Winter\u2019s Tale,\u2019 With Women in Charge", "authors": ["Jesse Green"]}

John McDermott\u2019s set couldn\u2019t be simpler \u2014 a table, a few chairs, a curtain, some carpets \u2014 and the audience is on three sides, smack in the middle of the action. As a director, Mr. Tucker is at his best and most comfortable in a middle scene, a genteel reception at which Eliza accidentally outs herself with pleasant conversation like \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d In typical Bedlam fashion there are more characters at this party than there are actors so the scene is accomplished with lightning-strike changes of hats and accents and it\u2019s a rare treat.\n\nIf you know \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d then there are parts you will miss, like the scenes of instruction and Eliza\u2019s success at the ball. When Eliza says she can do without Higgins or Higgins admits having grown accustomed to her face, you can\u2019t help pricking your ears for the orchestra. But this is a testament to the charm of Lerner and Loewe, not a broadside against Shaw. This \u201cPygmalion\u201d can do without music. When it slices to the core of a classic text with wit and verve and a show-off\u2019s delight, it\u2019s doing what the company does best.\n\nStill, Bedlam is doing other things, too, and they aren\u2019t as successful. There\u2019s nothing here as discouraging as its recent high-concept, low-joy \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d but some ideas don\u2019t fly. I don\u2019t question the decision to cast Ms. Sharma. She\u2019s a cracking Eliza, fierce and impish and moving. But Mr. Tucker has encouraged an Anglo-Indian accent, translated her first lines into Hindi and altered a bit of dialogue: \u201cLisson Grove prudery\u201d becomes \u201cIndian prudery,\u201d and there\u2019s a mention of Delhi. Eliza\u2019s ball gown, designed by Charlotte Palmer-Lane, borrows from a sari.\n\n\u201cPygmalion\u201d is a comedy about a woman who becomes declassed. These changes shift the play toward themes of colonialism and deracination instead. That\u2019s a play I\u2019d like to see, but it\u2019s not \u201cPygmalion,\u201d or at least it\u2019s not \u201cPygmalion\u201d with only a line or two improved. Here it\u2019s just a tease and as Higgins ought to know and doesn\u2019t, teasing isn\u2019t nice.\n\nThere\u2019s more teasing involved in having Mr. Tucker play Higgins. Because what is Higgins if not a kind of tyrannical director, rehearsing Eliza in her role until she walks and talks and smiles and laughs just the way he wants. (Let\u2019s hope Mr. Tucker is a little less domineering offstage.) When Eliza rebels, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t agree on her interpretation of the role. She thinks that a life including love and sex and the occasional kindness would be a richer one. He thinks that it would be a fatal compromise, a sacrifice of her strength and independence.\n\nThis is the tragic part, that the boy and the girl he\u2019s created, or the girl who\u2019s been allowed to create herself, can\u2019t mold themselves into some new shape that would surprise them both. I\u2019m a Henry and Eliza shipper and I have plenty of company. Audiences, actors, directors, everyone pressed Shaw to give the play a happy ending \u2014 the actress he had written Eliza for rebelled and wrote her own cutesy curtain line \u2014 but Shaw wouldn\u2019t budge. For him, an unromantic friendship was a happy ending. Maybe that\u2019s his tragedy. Maybe that\u2019s ours.", "title": "Review: A Playful \u2018Pygmalion\u2019 From Bedlam?

Contemporary classical heavyweights can feel it, too.\n\nIn the music world, few recent works loom as large as John Luther Adams\u2019s \u201cBecome Ocean,\u201d from 2013. The follow-up to \u201cBecome River\u201d (2010), for chamber orchestra, \u201cOcean\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize, then a Grammy for the Seattle Symphony, which commissioned it.\n\nIt was a high bar to clear, then, on Thursday evening here, when the same orchestra gave the premiere of Mr. Adams\u2019s \u201cBecome Desert,\u201d completing a trilogy he never set out to write: three nature-immersed \u2014 and so inevitably, in this day and age, obliquely political \u2014 pieces. Mr. Adams has written about his concerns about our changing ecology, and has lately been pondering a line attributed to the French Romantic writer Chateaubriand: \u201cForests precede civilizations, and deserts follow.\u201d\n\nIn an essay for The New York Times, he suggested that \u201cDesert\u201d would be an experience less obviously theatrical than the cresting waves of \u201cOcean\u201d; he even imagined a listener thinking, \u201cThis music is never going to change.\u201d In a program note Ludovic Morlot, who departs as the Seattle Symphony\u2019s music director after next season, promised \u201ca very different sonic landscape.\u201d\n\nManaging expectations made some sense. But it was also unnecessary. While \u201cBecome Desert\u201d doesn\u2019t have the easily graspable transitions of its predecessor, it is packed with moments of drama in microcosm. Over a nearly 40-minute span, those slight twists combine to create a new route toward a grand impact. Precisely because the two are so distinct in method, \u201cDesert\u201d came across as a thoroughly worthy successor to \u201cOcean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the new work Mr. Adams divides a large orchestra and a 32-member chorus into five groups. Playing at different tempos \u2014 though none of them fast \u2014 these discrete ensembles are meant to surround the audience. In Benaroya Hall here, the singers were stationed high up, toward the rear of the space. Tubular chimes were visible two levels up from the orchestra seats, along both sides. Strings, winds and percussion instruments were congregated on the stage.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis separation of sonic landscapes brought out Mr. Adams\u2019s gift for orchestration. After an opening section coasted for a bit on a meditative air, courtesy of pinging bells and hissing high strings, the soft-grained entrance of trumpets signaled a change, without overhauling the moderate, peaceable dynamics. At the same time, the disparate tempos between the mini-ensembles kept this from feeling like an easy-listening exercise. Chiming sounds were omnipresent throughout.

The play\u2019s second half still lacks the focus of its first part. Mr. Kushner takes it upon himself to elucidate mysteries he has set up earlier, and \u201cPerestroika\u201d has some of the water-treading frenzy of the last season of David Lynch\u2019s original \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d But the characters remain so palpably there, in the writing and the performance, that attention never flags.\n\nMs. Elliott \u2014 a two-time Tony winner for her productions of \u201cWar Horse\u201d and \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\u201d \u2014 has always been at home with vast canvases. But on the National\u2019s immense Lyttelton stage, her \u201cAngels\u201d could sometimes feel lost in space. And some of the British cast members were having trouble fitting into the American skins of their characters.\n\nThis \u201cAngels\u201d sits far more comfortably in its New York residence. And the method in Ian MacNeil\u2019s shadow-shrouded stage design, with lighting by Paule Constable, is now gratifyingly apparent. The mid-1980s New York conjured here is a town of endless night.\n\nIsolated spaces \u2014 apartments, offices, restaurants and hospital rooms \u2014 are defined by cool neon strips, with window-framed vistas as lonely as those of a Hopper painting. The real radiance comes from the people, and how they flicker, sputter and flame.\n\nAt their center is Prior Walter (a magnificent Mr. Garfield, last seen on Broadway in Mike Nichols\u2019s staging of \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d). Having just learned that he is HIV-positive when the play begins, Mr. Garfield\u2019s Prior is a mix of mortal terror, a drag queen\u2019s bravado and a profound consciousness that the world is now a different place for him.

Louis leaves Prior, drawing the first line in a pattern of abandonment that informs the entire play, and finally stretches all the way into the empyrean kingdom of an absent God.", "title": "Review: An \u2018Angels in America\u2019 That Soars on the Breath of Life", "authors": []}

It\u2019s private: a mystery to outsiders from first to last.\n\nYet she makes it immediately compelling. You watch in hope of understanding her better. Instead, in \u201cWealth From the Salt Seas,\u201d presented this week at the Chocolate Factory Theater in Queens, she remains opaque, an unknown species keen to remain unknowable. The audience sits on four sides of the action: Even when she comes closest to you, she feels remote.\n\nMs. Sperber ranges from being quietly withdrawn to obsessively intense. It\u2019s a pleasure to watch her face, her physique, her variety. At the start, in silence, she walks to a corner of the stage \u2014 stands, turns, looks askance. Then she places the back of her hand to her neck while she looks to one side. Is the gesture one of mild anxiety? Maybe, but her thoughts seem directed elsewhere. Her eyes continue to suggest some other preoccupation while her hands start to trace the top and bottom of her pelvis. Soon she travels across the stage: a few spins this way, a few that. Who is she? What\u2019s driving her?\n\nBut \u201cWealth From the Salt Seas\u201d tells no story. And, although this hourlong piece changes Ms. Sperber\u2019s character, it does not deepen it. After this beginning in silence, the piece becomes a collaboration with the singer-musician Gelsey Bell \u2014 who shares the stage, is similarly dressed (barefoot, leggings and chemise in matching brown) and is evidently a kindred spirit. Some of Ms. Bell\u2019s music is taped, but some consists of remarkable vocalism. She emits a number of trills (long lines of rolling Rs with full voice, now inwardly delivered, at high pressure) and single notes sustained with the steadiness of electronic signals.\n\n\u201cWealth\u201d proceeds in sections, as if the two women were switching from one task to another, all equally mysterious, but some failing to sustain interest. Among the highlights was Ms. Sperber\u2019s way of standing on the spot, hands clasped high above her head, while sending rapid vibrations from her knees and heels. And in a quietly thrashing solo \u2014 helplessly driven \u2014 she paced to and fro within a limited space, bending low from the waist in a fixed rhythm during a sequence in which she also shookher head rapidly from side to side.\n\nIn another moment, the two women, at opposite ends of the room, shook large metal rectangles between their hands, so that the quivering material both gave off sound and reflected it, gradually reaching a climax, then ebbing from it. It recalled an earlier passage in which they had picked up small, tintinnabulating obelisks. All this was wonderfully strange \u2014 until it started to become schematically strange.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "The Met has hired a 12-member ensemble that includes sword swallowers, a strongman, a fire eater, a contortionist and a bearded lady to help make this setting seem a place where disbelief can be suspended. When these boyfriends appear in disguise, they look like classic greasers, with slicked-down hair, mustaches, leather jackets and jeans. You believe that their fianc\u00e9es, in time, could see these strangers as the kind of guys one could let yourself go with.\n\nI don\u2019t think even Mozart realized how deeply he had managed to probe below the comic surface of Lorenzo Da Ponte\u2019s libretto. The work\u2019s ambiguities quickly grow darker. The girlfriends don\u2019t recognize their disguised boyfriends? Well, perhaps on some level they do! \u201cCos\u00ec\u201d explores the baffling truth that romance may be more arbitrary than we like to admit. After all, Mozart fell in love with one woman and then, when it didn\u2019t work out, wound up marrying her younger sister. So this sister or that one, this boyfriend or the other? Perhaps it\u2019s not that crucial.\n\nPhoto\n\nI have never seen a production that completely cracks the code of \u201cCos\u00ec,\u201d and for all its charms and insights, this production also comes up short. Mr. McDermott\u2019s concept doesn\u2019t explore the unsettling elements as much as some productions I\u2019ve seen. But one thing it gets right is the role of sexual desire as a motivator for these lovers. To that end, moving the story to the 1950s, when proper young people refrained from premarital sex, and setting it in an amusement park, where the couples are on vacation, work well.\n\nThings start off with a playful pantomime during the overture. We see Don Alfonso (the hearty, excellent baritone Christopher Maltman) acting as a sort of master of ceremonies. His assistant is Despina, the maid who works for the two sisters, and here the wonderful Kelli O\u2019Hara, a Broadway star who brings savvy dramatic instincts, a lovely soprano voice and quite good Italian diction to the role.\n\nAlfonso rolls out a box, out of which pop the sideshow performers, who show us their tricks and hold up signs to signal what\u2019s to come: Lust, Love, Big Aria, Lies, Intrigue and more. The audience applauded each trick, understandably; if this meant that the spirited playing of the orchestra under the conductor David Robertson became background music, I don\u2019t think Mozart would have minded. Mr. Robertson\u2019s performance of the long score was fleet, clean and vibrant.\n\nWhen we meet the young officers, they are having a drink at a garish nightclub near the park with Alfonso. The tenor Ben Bliss is wonderful as Ferrando, with an ideally sweet voice and boyish earnestness. The bass-baritone Adam Plachetka, as Guglielmo, comes across as more blustery and impulsive, with a robust voice and swagger.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe sisters, it\u2019s strongly suggested here, are sexual innocents, and they\u2019re an adorable pair. The soprano Amanda Majeski, as Fiordiligi, and the mezzo-soprano Serena Malfi, as Dorabella, wear \u201950s-style skirts, sweaters and pumps. Ms. Majeski\u2019s lustrous, focused voice and Ms. Malfi\u2019s mellower tones blend beautifully in the scene, set on the boardwalk with a Ferris wheel and roller coaster in the distance, when the sisters pine for their boyfriends and say that they are sure weddings are not far off. You sense what they are really longing for.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s mostly effective to see visitors to the park strolling in the background and sideshow performers doing their thing as the main characters interact. But sometimes it distracts from the richness of Mozart\u2019s harmonically intense and complex music during the many intricate ensembles in which the lovers go through moments of genuine confusion and torment.\n\nMr. McDermott knew, thank goodness, when to clear the stage and focus our attention on the music. When Mr. Bliss sang the melting aria \u201cUn\u2019aura amorosa,\u201d as Ferrando thinks about the breath of true love that comes from his fianc\u00e9e, he faced the audience, lost in reverie. Guglielmo \u2014 and even, for a moment, Alfonso \u2014 seemed touched by his sincerity.\n\nAnd in Act II, when Fiordiligi realizes that her resolve to stay faithful is weakening, and she sings the heartbreaking \u201cPer piet\u00e0,\u201d asking her absent boyfriend to pity her inability to contain her desire, Mr. McDermott created stage magic. Ms. Majeski sang from within a teacup-like compartment of a ride that lifted her into the air against an empty stage.\n\nI\u2019ve still never seen an ideal \u201cCos\u00ec\u201d production. But the Met certainly has a winning show here, albeit one now shadowed by the company\u2019s ongoing battle with the Mozart-loving conductor who has defined its modern history.", "title": "Review: As James Levine Sues, the Met Opera Opens a New \u2018Cos\u00ec\u2019", "authors": ["Anthony Tommasini"]}

Although set to a selection of Purcell music (played on tape), it strongly evokes the female-centered Romantic/classical world of George Balanchine\u2019s \u201cSerenade\u201d (1934), to Tchaikovsky, in which a group of women are affected by the presence of a man and the love he brings to one of their number before departing. As in \u201cSerenade,\u201d the women here wear calf-length blue dresses, which Ms. Bond has designed with beautifully individuated shades for each dancer.\n\nHer choreography, however, is busy and overwrought, especially beside its chosen music. She crams each phrase with too many movements, each romantic encounter with too many lifts. And so her dancers don\u2019t leave an impression of complete sincerity: They all seem to be concerned with making effects \u2014 not emotion but emotionalism.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Gomes both create stage worlds that contain same-sex partnering as well as conventionally heterosexual duets; both allow for those same-sex relationships to be interpreted in sexual terms. Although Mr. Brown is much the least experienced dance-maker of this program\u2019s three, he\u2019s the one with the strongest sense of structural suspense. One group of four (one woman, three men) is juxtaposed with another of six (three male-female couples); and what he does with each group keeps you wondering what will happen next. A sustained duet for two men looks natural: a study of intimate cooperation.\n\nHis worst flaw here, one from which Mr. Gomes\u2019s work also suffers, is cuteness. Dancers flirt with the audience and jokily vie for attention in ways that shatter the stage reality they\u2019ve been building together. The music is Rossini\u2019s unusually scored but appealing Duet for Cello and Double Bass in D major. If Mr. Brown can pare away his immaturities, he may yet become a choreographer.\n\nMr. Gomes uses Dvorak\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d String Quartet (No. 12 in F major, Op. 96) to tell a tale of social relations in small-town America. One man wants to leave (with suitcase) despite his powerful affection for the woman we may assume is his wife. Two pairs of male-female lovers spend time together, with one couple reaching the marriage ceremony as the ballet ends (veil, bouquet, trousseau, confetti); but one of these two men is keener on the other man than on his own girlfriend, and so sulks when his devotion is rejected.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a soap opera to pile onto poor Dvorak\u2019s wonderful and large-spirited quartet. Mr. Gomes is not short of ideas; but almost none of them feel organic. There are forcefully folksy handclaps where the music doesn\u2019t call for them; later, when the music develops a folk atmosphere, Mr. Gomes ignores it. Though I believe that there are many such small-town stories to tell, I don\u2019t believe the way Mr. Gomes tells this one. He keeps nudging us to notice the same points about the same relationships. The long pas de deux between the husband and wife creates its own clich\u00e9s.\n\nLarger than each work is the engaging impression created by Ms. Kent\u2019s dancers. They carry the evening.

The strongest drive in the largely minimalist music comes, strangely, before the curtain rises. Throughout, the composer Mr. Begin processes the sound electronically, so that we sometimes seem to be hearing snatches from an old sci-fi flick, a ray-gun battle in the distance.\n\nLater, low rumbles arrive and cacophony increases, yet that kind of drama has little effect on Mr. Brooks\u2019s even-tempered choreography. Over and over, the dancers grapple lightly, manipulating one another\u2019s limbs with careful grips at the wrist or elbow. The delicacy of this could be dreamy, but it\u2019s too dry for that. And despite the resemblance to martial arts, it has no urgency or kick. It\u2019s a fight without fight.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t feel like much of an advance from \u201cDivision,\u201d the 2015 work also on the program.

In her own hard shell of a navy pinstripe suit, she is tart, verging on pitiless; you feel her need to distance herself from the prospect of becoming exactly the same kind of woman.\n\nAnd then, in the second act, here performed continuously with the first, her nightmare comes true.\n\nHaving slyly acclimatized the audience to a naturalistic comedy about the frailty of memory, Albee gleefully reshuffles the cards. After a boffo stage trick straight out of vaudeville, he lands you in a newly arranged world, in which A, B and C are no longer different women but the same one, refracted, at different ages.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the new configuration, with the whole cast dressed in coordinated purples \u2014 the superb costumes are by Ann Roth \u2014 the tone darkens even as the play remains raucously funny. You may never have heard a dirty story about a man\u2019s anatomy told as Ms. Jackson does in the second act, but A, B and C, now a living time-lapse photograph, have more at stake in one another\u2019s success, and more at risk in failure.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because they are all, in essence, Albee\u2019s mother, who (he always said) bought him from an adoption agency for $133.30 and forever after hoped to return him. \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d is based, in part, on conversations she had with him about her life, marriage and unhappy parenthood. In more ways than one, Albee hovers about the action.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut unlike in much of his early work, he does not insist on dominating it. \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d is rigorous but also generous, even loving, to its characters \u2014 and audience. It honors the women\u2019s flintiness and fear as C swears not to become B and B hopes not to become A. In doing so, it slips Beckettian existentialism through the commercial barricades by disguising it as comfortable mainstream entertainment.\n\nWell, not always comfortable. By the end, when Ms. Jackson gives voice to A\u2019s terror as her faculties wane, and considers the idea that death will be a relief, you may be struck, as I was most recently in the Signature Theater\u2019s revival of \u201cAt Home at the Zoo,\u201d by Albee\u2019s willingness to go anywhere. Or rather, his unwillingness not to.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean this is a perfect play. Given the Cubist structure, it\u2019s not surprising that the themes eventually start to recycle with more panache than novelty. And C, as written, does not always stand for compelling.\n\nStill, time has been good to \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d and Mr. Mantello\u2019s production further burnishes its insights and confirms its originality. The staging tricks enhance the ones that Albee built in, with Miriam Buether\u2019s astonishing set design, at first so pretty and cozy, holding unexpected dimensions of alienation in store. The lighting (by Paul Gallo) and subtle sound design (by Fitz Patton) beautifully support the idea of a play slipping identities in the same way its characters do.\n\nFinally, though, it comes back to the actors. Ms. Jackson\u2019s history with us, and her aura of indomitability, mean that she is not merely a casting coup for A but a natural advocate for the play\u2019s central themes. She is, politically and personally, the embodiment of not going gentle into that good night; death and Thatcherism are all the same to her.\n\nAnd though Ms. Metcalf and Ms. Pill look nothing like Ms. Jackson, or each other, they bring more important skills and associations to their roles. Ms. Metcalf, once known for tragedy but now transformed into a peerless comedian (thanks to \u201cRoseanne,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2\u201d and \u201cLady Bird\u201d), is thus a very Albee creature. And it is not irrelevant, seeing Ms. Pill\u2019s just-holding-it-together C, to think of the devastated young woman she played, under Mr. Mantello\u2019s direction, in the Off Broadway premiere of \u201cBlackbird.\u201d\n\nWatching these three women in \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d means seeing the ghosts and echoes of many other women as well. They complete Albee\u2019s imaginative leap into difficult souls, which of course means all of us. And they honor a play that despite its frailties and wrinkles has aged beautifully, into a burning, raving classic.", "title": "Review: Glenda Jackson Gets Her Queen Lear Moment in \u2018Three Tall Women\u2019", "authors": ["Jesse Green"]}

This challenge is often on my mind, but I had something of an epiphany about it on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe place was packed for a concert performance of Handel\u2019s opera \u201cRinaldo.\u201d It was the latest in a series of nearly annual Handel performances at Carnegie by Harry Bicket and his English Concert ensemble; since 2013, this has become a beloved ritual for many.\n\nThe exceptional cast of singers included the superb countertenor Iestyn Davies in the title role.

The Handel performance could not have been better.\n\nIf I were recommending a program to someone fairly new to classical music, I wouldn\u2019t immediately think of \u201cRinaldo\u201d in concert. It\u2019s long (nearly three hours of music) and, hewing to the conventions of Italian opera seria, it\u2019s structured as a seemingly endless series of so-called da capo arias. Taken at face value, the story \u2014 a love tangle set during the Crusades \u2014 is full of improbable plot twists designed to let the characters milk some emotion and display their voices.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet perhaps because Americans are enduring a period of fractious partisanship, disinformation and social media hysteria, performances that offer honesty and insight are like salves. The authenticity of this \u201cRinaldo\u201d was like a clarifying gift.

This comes through in the first aria for Rinaldo, a Christian hero, who loves Almirena (the radiant soprano Jo\u00e9lle Harvey), the winsome daughter of Goffredo (the dark-voiced mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke), the captain of the Christian armies intent on seizing Jerusalem from the Saracen king Argante (the robust bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni).", "title": "Review: Handel\u2019s \u2018Rinaldo,\u2019 in Concert and Profoundly Authentic", "authors": ["Anthony Tommasini"]}

The cinephile joke is that Claire, played by French cinema royalty Isabelle Huppert, has never been to the festival before. \u201cIf I take a photo of you, you are not the same person anymore,\u201d she tells So, as he gets increasingly drunk at lunch. It\u2019s possible that Claire\u2019s camera also alters the stream of time itself, as the story line introduces some elements of temporal dislocation while never shifting into an obvious sci-fi mode. In the meantime, the movie offers up pertinent and dispiriting observations on gender relations, particularly in one scene in which the loathsomely hypocritical So tries to dress down Man-hee for wearing what he considers too-revealing attire at a cocktail party. Ms. Huppert\u2019s presence \u2014 steady, warm, thoughtful but with a casual air \u2014 keeps the entire enterprise classically comedic.", "title": "Review: In \u2018Claire\u2019s Camera,\u2019 Isabelle Huppert Plays a Cannes Newbie", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny", "Sang-Soo Hong"]}

Others, though, are unlikely to fare much better, given that this unflinching debut feature from Russ Harbaugh delivers something rarely seen in American movies: a warts-and-all examination of extended grief.\n\nArranged in discrete, scrapbook-like scenes, the narrative (loosely based on Mr. Harbaugh\u2019s own family experiences) comes at mourning only obliquely. At the center is Suzanne (a remarkable Andie MacDowell), who watches her husband die, painfully and exhaustingly, at home, attended by their two sons, Nicholas (Chris O\u2019Dowd) and Chris (James Adomian).\n\nVideo\n\nThose early scenes are harrowing enough, depicting the draining physical labor of caring for someone who\u2019s terminally ill.

Elegantly shot on film by Chris Teague, the movie feels unforced and at times shockingly authentic, allowing its emotions to percolate and rise of their own volition.

Humanity has been ravaged by the usual political and ecological disasters (among them \u201cbandwidth riots\u201d referred to in Wade\u2019s introductory voice-over), and most people seek refuge in a digital paradise called the Oasis.\n\nThat world \u2014 less a game than a Jorge Luis Borges cosmos populated by wizards, robots and racecar drivers \u2014 is the creation of James Halliday (Mark Rylance). After Halliday\u2019s death, his avatar revealed the existence of a series of Easter eggs, or secret digital treasures, the discovery of which would win a lucky player control of the Oasis. Wade is a \u201cgunter\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cegg hunter\u201d \u2014 determined to pursue this quest even after most of the other gamers have tired of it. Among his rivals are a few fellow believers and Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the head of a company called IOI that wants to bring Halliday\u2019s paradise under corporate control.\n\nIn the real world, IOI encourages Oasis fans to run up debts that it collects by forcing them into indentured servitude. Sorrento\u2019s villainy sets up a battle on two fronts \u2014 clashes in the Oasis mirroring chases through the streets of Columbus \u2014 that inspires Mr. Spielberg to feats of crosscutting virtuosity. The action is so swift and engaging that some possibly literal-minded questions may be brushed aside. I, for one, didn\u2019t quite understand why, given the global reach of the Oasis, all the relevant players were so conveniently clustered in Ohio. (If anyone wants to explain, please find me on Twitter so I can mute you.)\n\nBut, of course, Columbus and the Oasis do not represent actual or virtual realities, but rather two different modalities of fantasy. Wade\u2019s avatar, Parzival, collects a posse of fighters: Sho, Daito, Aech and Art3mis, who is also his love interest. When the people attached to these identities meet up in Columbus, they are not exactly as they are in the game. Aech, large and male in the Oasis, is played by Lena Waithe. But the fluidity of online identity remains an underexploited possibility. In and out of the Oasis, Art3mis (also known as Samantha, and portrayed by Olivia Cooke) is a male fantasy of female badassery. Sho (Philip Zhao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) are relegated to sidekick duty. The multiplayer, self-inventing ethos of gaming might have offered a chance for a less conventional division of heroic labor, but the writers and filmmakers lacked the imagination to take advantage of it.\n\nThe most fun part of \u201cReady Player One\u201d is its exuberant and generous handing out of pop-cultural goodies. Tribute is paid to Mr. Spielberg\u2019s departed colleagues John Hughes and Stanley Kubrick. The visual and musical allusions are eclectic enough that nobody is likely to feel left out, and everybody is likely to feel a little lost from time to time.\n\nNostalgia? Sure, but what really animates the movie is a sense of history. The Easter egg hunt takes Parzival and his crew back into Halliday\u2019s biography \u2014 his ill-starred partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), his thwarted attempts at romance \u2014 and also through the evolution of video games and related pursuits. The history is instructive and also sentimental in familiar ways, positing a struggle for control between idealistic, artistic entrepreneurs (and their legions of fans) and soulless corporate greedheads.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sorrento is an autocratic bean counter, a would-be master of the universe who doesn\u2019t even like video games. These characters are clich\u00e9s, but they are also allegorical figures.\n\nIn the movie, they represent opposing principles, but in our world, they are pretty much the same guy. A lot of the starry-eyed do-it-yourselfers tinkering in their garages and giving life to their boyish dreams back in the \u201970s and \u201980s turned out to be harboring superman fantasies of global domination all along. They shared their wondrous creations and played the rest of us for suckers, collecting our admiration, our attention and our data as profit and feudal tribute.\n\nMr. Spielberg incarnates this duality as perfectly as any man alive. He is the peer of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and a Gandalf for the elves and hobbits who made Google, Facebook and the other components of our present-day Oasis. He has been man-child and mogul, wide-eyed artist and cold-eyed businessman, praised for making so many wonderful things and blamed for ruining everything. His career has been a splendid enactment of the cultural contradictions of capitalism, and at the same time a series of deeply personal meditations on love, loss and imagination. All of that is also true of Halliday\u2019s Oasis. \u201cReady Player One\u201d is far from a masterpiece, but as the fanboys say, it\u2019s canon.", "title": "Review: Spielberg\u2019s \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 Plays the Nostalgia Game", "authors": ["A.

From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn\u2019t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.\n\nSawyer \u2014 an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn\u2019t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer\u2019s life with quick, grim strokes \u2014 a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss \u2014 and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there\u2019s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.\n\nSawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up \u2014 ostensibly because she\u2019s a suicide risk \u2014 at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.\n\nVideo\n\nWritten by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it\u2019s obvious who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn\u2019t belong in the hospital but doesn\u2019t help her case \u2014 she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl \u2014 which prolongs her incarceration and torment.

Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer\u2019s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she\u2019s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).", "title": "Review: In \u2018Unsane,\u2019 It\u2019s Not Paranoia if Someone\u2019s After You", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Jonathan Bernstein", "James Greer"]}

Still, the movement of the first act is from mistrust and recrimination to solidarity. When the roommates change into clubbing clothes to toast Isabela with whatever sad staples they can scrounge, the lamest farewell party ever becomes, briefly, one of the most joyous.\n\nPlaying both ends of the scale like that is a distinctive trick Ms. Majok uses to release emotion without sentimentality. These women are tough, and not in a glamorous way: Their expectation of mistreatment is no pose and no metaphor. They are angry at the world yet nurture that anger, recognizing that in it may be the beginning of progress. Certainly there is no progress without it.\n\nThis makes for thrilling writing. But as the play further complicates its story in the second and third acts, it loses control of its effects. We are offered too much information for the frame to contain, even if it\u2019s vital: How Inna got from Ukraine to Queens after a six-month stop as a potential internet bride in Florida; what brought Renia to the basement and how she becomes its landlady. New characters come and go as well, their identities and stories blurred because they are played by the same actors who played the previous ones. After seeing \u201cqueens\u201d and reading the script carefully I was still confused by many plot points.\n\nConfusion can be salient, of course, in plays about confusion, whether moral or existential. But \u201cqueens\u201d isn\u2019t squishy that way, so its confusion is subtractive. It may in fact be the result of cutting to keep the production under three hours. (The timing of the acts is lopsided.)\n\nIf so, I think Ms. Majok would have done better to expand her scope rather than contract it. The material is so important, so ripe and so multi-stranded that it might have been better off as a marathon or a mini-series. Squeezed into its current shape it can do little more than check the boxes on its trenchant to-do list.\n\nThis puts excess pressure on the production to provide coherence, but Danya Taymor\u2019s direction opts for suggestiveness rather than clarity. The powerful set design by Laura Jellinek \u2014 dominated by a vast ceiling that lowers and lifts over the stage to create feelings of containment and freedom \u2014 is more successful in sculpting moods than in defining space or telling the story. (You are never sure where the doors to this basement are.) Action specified in the script is not always clear onstage: a problem of focus. And the fine performances, especially by Ms. Reeder and Ms. Tolan-Mee, dissipate under the excessive dramatic pressure.\n\nFor all that, \u201cqueens\u201d is still a notable work, or maybe several. It strikes at the heart of the immigrant experience, which is often unfair, one way or another. \u201cYou? Are lucky,\u201d Renia tells one of the women. \u201cWhich means that maybe other people: not so much.\u201d\n\nWelcome to America.", "title": "Review: In \u2018queens,\u2019 11 Immigrant Women and What They Left Behind", "authors": []}

In the first movement, Mr. Pierson made sure players articulated each madcap twist of rhythm not just with precision, but with a sense of glee. The way the bass and trombone savored droning tones in the second movement served as a reminder of what this group has learned from engaging with the Minimalist aesthetic. The soloist, John Orfe, sounded magnificent throughout, whether pummeling or delicately shaping Ligeti\u2019s emotionally varied piano motifs.\n\nPhoto\n\nAll told, this made for approximately 25 minutes of the best live music I\u2019ve heard so far this year. Which raises the question: Did it really need so much setup?\n\nMost of the preplanned banter between Ms. Sirota and Mr. Pierson came off smoothly enough. And the sound effects that rolled underneath the narrative material were all tasteful \u2014 an important hurdle to clear, given that the topics included concentration camps, where some of Ligeti\u2019s family members were killed. (He narrowly eluded the same fate.)\n\nYet when Mr. Pierson led the group in a brief excerpt of music, referred to during some radio-play aside, I often found that I wanted to hear more of each piece. Why not play all of Karlheinz Stockhausen\u2019s \u201cKontra-Punkte\u201d? Or more of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s score to \u201cModern Times\u201d (in the arrangement by Courtney Orlando)? The answer, presumably, is that then you\u2019d only have time for a regular concert.\n\nClassical performers and venues are well advised to be rethinking inherited strictures of the recital hall. Monastic seriousness isn\u2019t the only way to take in a show. Lowering anxieties about what to wear and when to clap is all to the good. (There was some scattered, justly earned applause before Alarm Will Sound presented the final movement of Ligeti\u2019s Chamber Concerto for 13 Instruments, which closed the concert.

The film\u2019s most memorable sequence is a sex scene in which Lexi acts out a prostitution fantasy, inviting a man to her room only to be shocked when her conquest brings a friend without asking for her permission. As Lexi maneuvers the two men, seeking ways to regain the control that was taken from her, Ms. Sealey navigates power through nudity, physically and psychologically exposing her male subjects while allowing her female protagonist to remain an enigma.

You learn in short order that the horse is a goner, and it isn\u2019t long into this slick, shallow movie that you wish the girl, Amanda (Olivia Cooke), was, too. This is no fault of Ms. Cooke, an appealing performer (she was the girl in \u201cMe and Earl and the Dying Girl\u201d). She and her equally likable co-star, Anya Taylor-Joy (\u201cThe Witch\u201d), have been burdened with giving their matching ciphers flesh and a reason for us to watch.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Taylor-Joy plays Lily, a wealthy teenager who is tutoring Amanda when the story begins. Amanda, who\u2019s more middle-class comfortable, knows that Lily is getting paid for her attention, which doesn\u2019t stop the girls from curiously circling each other. They were once friends and soon ease into a new, unpersuasive intimacy (they watch Shirley Temple on TV), largely so the writer-director Cory Finley can make them combust. What happens next is pretty much what you would expect from peewee nihilists (\u201cHeathers\u201d) adrift in a bourgeois hellscape of quiet dinners and symmetrical visuals (\u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d).\n\nMaking his feature directing debut, Mr. Finley gives the movie a professional sheen and gets fine performances from his actors, including Anton Yelchin as a sad sack with a bull\u2019s-eye where his brains should be, and Paul Sparks as Lily\u2019s chilled-to-the-bone stepfather. Nothing these two characters do or say is surprising. Yet both actors give their roles a spark of life \u2014 Mr. Yelchin lends the movie heart in one of his final performances, Mr. Sparks gives it a touch of realistic cunning \u2014 that let you see where this movie might have gone if Mr. Finley hadn\u2019t relied on formula.\n\nFor all the chatter and intrigue, Mr. Finley never settles on a point or theme. At times, he seems invested in performing a cultural autopsy on Lily and Amanda, opening them up so we can see the pathologies crawling inside. At other times, he seems to want us to see them as symptoms of a larger malady, which doubtless accounts for the scene in which a wealthy woman idles in a tanning bed that looks like a coffin. The ostensibly comic images of the workers laboring at Lily\u2019s palatial digs are presumably meant to say something, too, though their marginality here says less about their employers than it does about the filmmaker.", "title": "Review: Meet the Peewee Nihilists of \u2018Thoroughbreds\u2019", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Cory Finley"]}

It was hugs all around as Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin, who has been the orchestra\u2019s music director since 2012 and was clearly energized by an hourlong immersion in Rachmaninoff\u2019s Second Symphony, made his way through the ranks, congratulating individual players.\n\nAnd congratulations were in order. The Philadelphia Orchestra became a sort of spiritual home for Rachmaninoff after he left Russia in 1917, and the ensemble maintained a close relationship with his work during its many years under Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy. If Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin and the current players can no longer claim primary ownership of Rachmaninoff\u2019s music, evidently no one has told them.\n\nThe lush string playing, in particular, summoned memories of the Fabulous Philadelphians of yore.

And it works.\n\nMs. Kaling appears in the first two episodes of the show (three were made available to critics) as Priya, a single mom from Ohio. She has raised this theater-crazed teenager (J. J. Totah), who wants to go to a performing arts high school in New York. Luckily, that\u2019s where his father, Vince (Mr. Holm), lives and runs a Brooklyn gym. Unluckily, they\u2019ve never met, nor does Michael know anything about his dad. This doesn\u2019t stop Priya from dropping off her son, though, and this being a sitcom, Vince and his roommate and brother, Matthew (Andy Favreau), turn out to be decent, mostly upstanding and generally O.K. with this arrangement.\n\nAs in many \u201cthe day everything changed\u201d comedies, the first episode of \u201cChampions\u201d exhibits symptoms of pilot-itis: It\u2019s heavy on exposition and feels a bit forced, with a too-pat ending. But that\u2019s a treatable disease, and it clears up completely by Episode 2, when the supporting characters who work at the gym settle into natural rhythms, and the show establishes what level of corniness it\u2019s aiming for in the father-son plotlines.

One incidental revelation, or reminder, is how breathlessly and exhaustively the events were reported. They were the reality TV of their time, with guns, sex, a mass poisoning and murder schemes. The events may have been playing out in the proverbial middle of nowhere, but that was the point: A movement, or cult, of thousands of post-\u201960s seekers in orange and purple mufti had descended upon a thin population of ranchers and retirees, who took on the mantle of frontier yeomen protecting American values against foreign invasion.\n\nThe battle between the Rajneeshees and the citizens of Antelope prefigures, in a funhouse-mirror way, our current cultural and political landscape \u2014 notions of American liberty and morality were being defended against perceived (and actual) outside threats.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re invading,\u201d an Oregonian said at the time. \u201cMaybe not with bullets, but with money and, um, immoral sex.\u201d In the long and successful fight to get rid of Rajneeshpuram \u2014 which led to the deportation of the Bhagwan and the jailing of some of his followers \u2014 the government used immigration law, accusations of church-and-state violations and the denial of voter registration as tactics.\n\nParanoia and anger reigned on both sides, though, and the emotional crux of the story lies in the arrogant, tone-deaf and eventually criminal behavior of the Rajneeshees. The Ways supply ample testimony to this, along with lots of shots of the members toting semiautomatic rifles and conducting Al Qaeda-style combat drills. There is also a recurring motif of the newcomers in their monochromatic attire walking around Antelope, where they co-opted the government and much of the real estate.

Eight are based on comic books; two more are based on existing properties; one is the long-running stalwart \u201cSupernatural\u201d and another is a likely-to-be-canceled military drama. Then there are the two quirky, critical beloved genre-benders: \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d a dark-comedy musical, and \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d a sudsy but deeply sincere telenovela. Which brings us to \u201cLife Sentence,\u201d starting Wednesday, neither superhero nor supernatural nor super bold. Instead, it feels like the straightforward family drama of CW\u2019s \u2014 and WB\u2019s \u2014 past: light, young, heartfelt. It\u2019s also unmoored, though, without a clear anchor or companion, putting the show in the unenviable position of having to stand on its own right from the start.

But then, \u201cLife Sentence\u201d is all about surprise survival.\n\nLucy Hale, who starred as Aria on the teen thriller \u201cPretty Little Liars,\u201d plays Stella, a manic pixie cancer girl who was miraculously cured, thanks to a trial medication. So the good news is that she\u2019s cancer-free. The bad news is that her family has been lying to her constantly, in the hopes of not adding to her suffering.\n\nNo one is as stable as she thought: Her parents (Gillian Vigman and Dylan Walsh) instantly separate, her lovable older brother (Jayson Blair) reveals himself to be a lowlife and her type-A older sister (Brooke Lyons) admits to feeling trapped by their family\u2019s put-on-a-happy-face dysfunction. Stella herself had impulsively married a hunky Brit (Elliot Knight) she met in Paris because, well, if you\u2019re only going to live a few more months you might as well marry hunky Brits you meet in Paris. But now she\u2019s married-married and perhaps shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a bohemian-aspirational character before, it\u2019ll come as no surprise that Stella rides a cute little motor scooter and gets a job at a coffee shop, or that \u201cLife Sentence\u201d is set in Oregon. Stella\u2019s largely unnecessary voice-over drives home the show\u2019s coming-of-age vibe and its naked earnestness. \u201cLife\u201d might be a little too light for its cancer story, but it certainly isn\u2019t glib or ironic.

It\u2019s a nuanced episode, pitting his grandparents\u2019 worry for him against the Conners\u2019 constitutional mandate to be defiantly different.\n\nIt also echoes the third-season episode \u201cTrick or Treat,\u201d in which Dan fretted that D.J. would get bullied for dressing as a witch for Halloween, while Roseanne went to the bar in a convincing beard and passed herself off as one of the guys.

What do ragtime and stride piano, two early forms of jazz, have to do with the Cuban rhythm also known as the tango? And the lineup of performers only increased the sense of incongruity: four virtuoso pianists from different parts of the world, joined by three dancers \u2014 one tap, one salsa, one flamenco.\n\nNo wonder one of those pianists, the 90-year-old master Dick Hyman, confessed to being bewildered at the start of the early show on Friday. By the early show on Saturday, though, he was able to announce that he and his fellow artists had figured out what the title meant: What had been an enjoyable mess on Friday had by Saturday cohered into something more.\n\nThe programming was far from random. The habanera is a hybrid seed of great potency. An adaptation of the European contradanza by slaves from West Africa, it is not only an early version of a New World rhythm that took over the globe, but also a direct ancestor for much of jazz and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Ragtime and stride are part of the same African-diaspora tree, though on a different branch. And these dance rhythms call for dancers.\n\nThe concert touched on all this. You could sense history in the various dances of the pianists\u2019 left hands: the slinky syncopations of habanera; the manic but metronomic bounce, in swing, as if between two trampolines. But the show wasn\u2019t nearly selective enough for the history to be clear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe format was a relay, with two pianos onstage. After one pianist played a few songs, another came on for a duet before embarking on his own set.

Harold, you see, is a perfect sucker, an innocent whose trusting good nature makes him an easy target for grifters, scammers and liars.\n\nThere are a lot of those in his life, including his wife, Bonnie (Thandie Newton), and his boss, Richard (Joel Edgerton, the director\u2019s brother), a type-A blowhard who insists that Harold is his friend. Richard and Elaine (Charlize Theron), his predatory colleague-with-benefits, are planning a merger and are also involved in some off-the-books deals in Mexico having to do with medical and nonmedical marijuana. A business trip down there goes south in fairly predictable ways, at least in the context of the kind of hectic, strenuous, nasty caper-comedy \u201cGringo\u201d aspires to be.\n\nVideo\n\nHarold, as he wises up to the fact that he\u2019s been played, takes matters into his own hands, faking a kidnapping and setting off a flurry of chasing, shouting, coitus interruptus and gunplay. A few familiar characters are summoned from the clich\u00e9 repository and outfitted with a random quirk or two. The ruthless drug kingpin (Carlos Corona) is obsessed with the Beatles. The international mercenary (Sharlto Copley) is running a nonprofit in Haiti. The small-time hood (Harry Treadaway) dragging his clueless girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) into potential danger has a British accent.

Mr. Oyelowo is without a doubt the best thing in \u201cGringo,\u201d supplying the only grace notes in a cacophony of secondhand attitude and facetious overacting. But the deck is stacked against him, much as it is against Harold, who as the designated nice guy is assumed to be the least interesting person in the movie.\n\nThe attention is lavished on his foils and tormentors, who are cut from gaudy, worn-out cardboard and set in motion like furious windup toys. Ms. Theron vamps and sneers, Joel Edgerton struts and blusters, and everyone works hard to sustain a mood of jokey, wised-up menace. It is possible to sit through it all without feeling completely miserable, and to remember a time when these comic-grotesque shenanigans might have seemed fresh.

Our critics consider it alongside this week\u2019s concerts of Brahms and Prokofiev.\n\nWe Heard Them at Lincoln Center ...\n\nDoes Mr. van Zweden always require time to warm up? A couple of weeks ago, it seemed to take some days for him and the orchestra to find a groove. I heard that program \u2014 dominated by the first act of Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d \u2014 on both Wednesday and Saturday, and the latter performance was significantly tenser and sharper than the former\u2019s vague dreariness.\n\nThis week, on Wednesday evening at David Geffen Hall, it took only 20 minutes or so to slough off the stolidity. Mr. van Zweden began Brahms\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 with a deliberation drained of energy. By comparison, the pianist Yuja Wang\u2019s offhand dreaminess \u2014 she always somehow seems at once modest and virtuosic \u2014 crackled with vitality.

Karl Marx increasingly gives way to the Marx Brothers as Stalin\u2019s son and daughter (the contrapuntal Rupert Friend and Andrea Riseborough) rush in to wail and thunder, adding absurdity and self-dramatizing melodrama to the mix. There are secret meetings, crowds of mourners, visiting dignitaries and more secret meetings. Mr. Iannucci is particularly good at the theater of sycophancy and at all the ways in which supplicating faces, hands and bodies can quiver in fear and with a terrible love.\n\n\u201cThe Death of Stalin\u201d is by turns entertaining and unsettling, with laughs that morph into gasps and uneasy gasps that erupt into queasy, choking laughs. Mr. Iannucci\u2019s decision to have the performers speak in an array of accented English \u2014 from Brooklyn to Cockney \u2014 carries some political resonance, suggesting that totalitarianism knows no borders. But it also makes the familiar strange, creating a Brechtian alienation that few movies succeed in pulling off. Mr. Buscemi plays Khrushchev with persuasive realism, and he certainly looks the part, with his bald head and boxy clothing. But the character\u2019s Brooklyn accent also underscores Mr. Buscemi\u2019s identity, making him present, too.\n\nThis doubling in which both the actor and the character wave at the audience is also a familiar comic strategy, one used by the likes of Bugs Bunny and Jim Carrey. It fits for a movie in which almost all the characters have been playing variations on the same role of slavishly adoring, lethally submissive servant. Stalin hasn\u2019t taken his final breath before Beria and Khrushchev stop playing those roles; others, like Molotov and Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor), the deputy prime minister and Stalin\u2019s heir apparent, scarcely seem to have anything left except their long-enacted performances.", "title": "Review: The Slapstick Horror of \u2018The Death of Stalin\u2019", "authors": []}

She dominates the stage without effort. (Her credits include roles in \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d on the FX channel.) And neither she nor the script patronizes her character, who turns out to be far more self-aware and purposeful than her siblings realize.\n\nThe problem is much of what surrounds her. The squabbling Maggie and Jacob have been accoutered with those bright, jumbo-size neuroses and eccentricities that are often found in dysfunctional-family sitcoms. Despite eager performances from Mr. Blum and Ms. Monk, those most reliable of pros, their characters feel cut from shiny, synthetic cloth.\n\nThe same might be said of Vanessa Aspillaga\u2019s lovably overbearing Kathy, the loudmouthed but big-hearted Italian nurse, who is tending to Amy in the Queens, N.Y., institution where Maggie and Jacob come to visit.

What\u2019s most remarkable about these scenes is the degree to which we accept the potency of this couple\u2019s love for each other.

And the more we learn about Amy, the less we feel able to sympathize with Jacob and Maggie. I think Ms. Ferrentino over-eggs their obnoxiousness in this regard, to make the contrast more apparent.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to. Amy is more than capable of making her own, implicit case.

Still, all night Mr. Grigolo was in the zone with a fervor that no one else matched.\n\nMr. Grigolo put everything on the line for that final scene, at the graveyard of the Ravenswoods, a landed Scottish family in decline. Edgardo, the laird of that estate, has fallen in love with Lucia, the sister of a rival clan, the Lammermoors, now headed by her imperious brother, Enrico, who is Edgardo\u2019s sworn enemy. But to save the Lammermoors from financial ruin, Lucia, who adores Edgardo, has been forced into a marriage of convenience with a wealthy lord.\n\nEdgardo comes to the graveyard at the very moment he believes Lucia is entering her bridal chamber with her new husband.

There are some cute interpretive moves (a translator voiced by Frances McDormand), but Mr. Anderson clearly didn\u2019t want subtitles competing with his visuals. So when the Japanese characters speak, their words are usually reduced to the decorative, at least for non-Japanese speakers.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange, discomfiting choice not least because it means that few of the Japanese characters, including Atari, have the depth or dignity given the dogs. Back in Megasaki City, when the mayor plots and scientists (Akira Ito and the one and only Yoko Ono) work on a cure for what ails the dogs, only some of what they say is conveyed. At the same time, high school journalists, led by a foreign-exchange student, Tracy (Greta Gerwig), investigate the mayor. Tracy speaks Japanese but mostly yammers on in English. A bossy boots with a blond puffball of hair, she is a tedious variation on Tracy Flick (of \u201cElection\u201d) and Mr. Anderson\u2019s own young strivers (\u201cRushmore\u201d and elsewhere).\n\nMr. Anderson has always drawn liberally from film history, folding allusions to favorites into his work. In \u201cIsle of Dogs,\u201d he gives an apparent shout-out to the director Seijun Suzuki. The mayor was amusingly (and convincingly) modeled on the actor Toshiro Mifune, known for his work with Akira Kurosawa, whom Mr. Anderson has referenced, with Hayao Miyazaki, as an influence on \u201cIsle of Dogs.\u201d The allusions are loving, but at times also ritualistic, distracting and uninvolving; mostly Mr. Anderson is replaying his own greatest hits, going back to familiar ideas \u2014 the fallen adult world included \u2014 that would work better if they weren\u2019t smothered in filigree and self-consciousness.\n\nAnd yet, time and again, Mr. Anderson pulls you hard into \u201cIsle of Dogs.\u201d His use of film space, which he playfully flattens and deepens, is one of his stylistic signatures; he likes symmetry and, in contrast to most directors these days, does a lot inside the frame. He\u2019s especially inventive in this movie, and I could watch hours of its noble dogs hanging out, sniffing the air. Their relationships are expressed in asides and periodic growls but more poignantly when they are separated in the frame and when they\u2019re gloriously united. (By protecting others, you save yourself.) Here, when a dog looks into the camera, the wind caressing him where a human hand once did, the movie finds its soul.", "title": "Review: Wes Anderson\u2019s Bleakly Beautiful \u2018Isle of Dogs\u2019", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Wes Anderson"]}

This latest film, \u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d adds Henri Bloom, an aging filmmaker, to Mr. Desplechin\u2019s oeuvre, and his name, of course, evokes the older protagonist in Joyce\u2019s novel.\n\nFor all that, Mr. Desplechin\u2019s films cannot, or ought not, be considered literary. Cinema is the only medium that can accommodate the narrative sprawl that has distinguished this director\u2019s work since even before \u201cMy Sex Life \u2026 or How I Got Into an Argument\u201d (1996), a film in which he originated several characters who incarnate in his later works.\n\n\u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts\u201d opens with a film-within-a-film, an espionage thriller about one Ivan Dedalus, a globe-trotting diplomat turned spy. (He\u2019s probably related to Paul, but you don\u2019t have to understand this convoluted situation to enjoy the movie.) Ivan springs from the mind of Ismael Vuillard (Mathieu Amalric), whose reverie is interrupted by a 3 a.m. phone call from his former father-in-law, Henri Bloom (Laszlo Szabo). Both men are still mourning the loss of Carlotta (hello, \u201cVertigo\u201d people), Bloom\u2019s daughter and Ismael\u2019s wife, who disappeared 20 years ago. Ismael is now involved with Sylvia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), an astrophysicist, who, shortly after her introduction becomes the movie\u2019s temporary narrator, and takes the story back a couple of years.

The patients are accompanied by an advocate or two who speak on their behalf, at times sharing medical reports.

The excellent work of Michael Park as Connor\u2019s stony father and Laura Dreyfuss as his ambivalent sister reveals itself more than ever. (The entire cast has dug deeper into its roles.) I also noticed more clearly how the director Michael Greif\u2019s relentless staging figures in the storytelling, as if it were a ninth character. This is high-def theater: full of color and information wherever you look.\n\nBut not everything that feels different about \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d is a result of the cast change. A story that turns on a high school tragedy naturally plays differently so soon after the shootings in Parkland, Fla. The audience on Tuesday gasped when a character described Connor\u2019s look as \u201cvery school-shooter chic.\u201d And when social media turns his classmates into famous survivors \u2014 then turns on them with suspicion and vitriol \u2014 I felt almost nostalgic for a time, just a year ago, when that plot point seemed like a stretch.

Connor\u2019s (Jennifer Laura Thompson) is naturally crushed by the death of her son. Evan\u2019s (Rachel Bay Jones) tirelessly enacts the role of cheerleader-in-chief for her lonely, awkward boy. But both are also dealing with something I suspect every parent in the audience understands: their terrifying responsibility for the happiness of their children, coupled with their marginal ability to do anything about it. When Ms. Jones sang the song \u201cSo Big/So Small\u201d near the end of the show on Tuesday, there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in my face.\n\nSo in fundamental ways, \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d has not changed after all. It has survived the big cast change that many predicted it couldn\u2019t, and, the succession assured, seems likely to thrive on Broadway for the foreseeable future.\n\nCritics shouldn\u2019t care about that, of course; box office is not our concern.

Matthew Ball, a first soloist who recently made his debut in the role, would take his place.\n\nJudging by the loud groan, it was a huge disappointment for the audience, many of whom had probably never seen Mr. Hallberg perform with Ms. Osipova, a principal with the Royal Ballet since 2013. And how must he have felt? Mr. Hallberg returned to the stage just 14 months ago, after a two-and-a-half-year injury-filled break and a painful, painstaking fight back to physical prowess. (Dancing with Ms. Osipova again, he has said, was one of his strongest motivations.)\n\nUntil the announcement, there was little indication of a problem. Albrecht, the nobleman who disguises himself as a peasant to court the lovely village girl Giselle, doesn\u2019t have a great deal of dancing in Act 1. If Mr. Hallberg seemed slightly muted in those passages, with legs and jumps kept low, it was in keeping with the effortless air of nobility that he brought to the role from the moment he arrived on stage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis Albrecht is genuinely infatuated with Giselle, rather than a cad with a seduction plan. By the end of the act, Mr. Hallberg seemed aware of the depth of his feelings, appalled by the vast error and consequences of his actions. That he could convey all this while negotiating a just-sustained injury is a tribute to his artistry and to that of Ms. Osipova, who offered a rivetingly original account of the role.\n\nPhoto\n\nMost ballerinas play Giselle as a shy, charming, innocent village girl who readily falls for the mysterious (and perhaps calculating) stranger she has just met. Ms. Osipova\u2019s Giselle may be na\u00efve, but she rushes at life with gusto and sensuality.

It\u2019s sometimes hard to judge how successfully the Chinese students have been integrated into the daily life of the school. They tend to stick together, and to be regarded with a curiosity that sometimes verges on suspicion. A sign in a common area of one building declares it an English-only zone, which could be interpreted both as an encouragement to develop social and language skills and as an alienating, hostile gesture.\n\nBut good will and hard work are the prevailing values of \u201cMaineland.\u201d The portmanteau title maps out a patch of common ground defined by the understanding that education is a path to worldly success. It can be more than that, of course, and the movie hints at complications that are all the more intriguing for remaining largely unstated.

But its first 10-episode season, starting Tuesday, is proof that wanting alone does not make a thing so.\n\nIts first problem is stage center. Lou Mazzuchelli (Josh Radnor), a dispirited English teacher, talks his way into taking over the school drama department. He has no experience \u2014 unlike the colleague, Tracey Wolfe (Rosie Perez), he blithely steps over \u2014 but he has a big ambition: putting on \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d the rock musical about teenagers in sexually repressed 19th-century Germany.\n\nLou\u2019s character was controversial even before the show was screened. The series is based (like \u201cF.N.L.\u201d was) on a nonfiction book, \u201cDrama High,\u201d by Michael Sokolove, about Lou Volpe, a high school drama teacher in Levittown, Pa., who came out as gay late in life. Mr. Katims renamed Lou and reimagined him as a married straight man with kids.\n\nI can\u2019t know if Lou would work better if Mr. Katims hadn\u2019t taken that liberty. I do know that Mr. Radnor is not convincing \u2014 or he is, but in the wrong ways.\n\nLou has supposedly taught in Stanton for 17 years, yet he interacts with everyone as if he\u2019s just stepped off the bus. He seems blindsided, for instance, that the conservative small town he\u2019s taught in for a generation might resist a school play that involves incest, abortion and a kiss between boys.\n\nThe character has a priggish self-seriousness that worked for Mr. Radnor when he starred in \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d as Ted, whose emo intensity the show tweaked lovingly.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn \u201cRise,\u201d it\u2019s confusing. Lou comes across as well-meaning but full of himself, like Mr. Schue in \u201cGlee.\u201d (Like that show, \u201cRise\u201d also involves the ruse of recruiting a football player \u2014 Robbie, played by Damon J. Gillespie \u2014 as a singer). The performance cues you to see Lou as blinded, maybe a little ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the show, especially early on, treats him as a heroic inspiration. This dissonance with his character makes \u201cRise\u201d feel at times like someone remade \u201cWaiting for Guffman\u201d in the manner of \u201cDead Poets Society.\u201d\n\nThe young cast is good to terrific, and \u201cRise\u201d is better the closer it gets to the kids\u2019 stories. Lilette (Auli\u2019i Cravalho) waitresses alongside her mother to pay the household bills. Simon (Ted Sutherland) is wrestling with his sexual identity, which becomes doubly fraught when Lou casts him as a character with a male love interest, outraging Simon\u2019s conservative Catholic family. Ellie Desautels is remarkable as Michael, a transgender boy with a knockout voice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The shaky pilot takes the group from reluctant performers to a cohesive unit implausibly fast. But the cast sells the offstage drama, and the musical snippets are transporting.\n\nThe other global issue is how \u201cRise\u201d stacks the deck dramatically. Lou\u2019s opponents are almost all portrayed as craven, repressed or philistine for preferring that the school produce \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance.\u201d The major exception is Tracey, whom Ms. Perez plays as a passionate pragmatist.\n\n(It\u2019s also a little rich for NBC to air a show about a town being too provincial for \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d a show that it\u2019s hard to imagine the network mounting uncensored for its December musical.)\n\nBut more often, \u201cRise\u201d sees Stanton through Lou\u2019s perspective, which ranges from bleak to condescending. \u201cI wanted to send a message to the people of Stanton,\u201d Lou says when the production is in jeopardy. \u201cWe see you. You\u2019re not forgotten.\u201d The town is shot in drained color, as if it\u2019s cloudy even on sunny days.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect \u201cRise\u201d to be neutral about free expression or closed-mindedness: Works of fiction naturally tend to be pro-art. But without seeing its antagonists as full people \u2014 the expansive empathy that defined \u201cF.N.L.\u201d \u2014 it has little to add to a familiar story of artists vs. censors.\n\nIn the second half of the season, \u201cRise\u201d becomes more vibrant, less dour. It starts to challenge and leaven Lou\u2019s self-absorption, and both character and story make more sense. It even shows a sense of humor when Lou has to rewrite a profane lyric to meet community standards. (\u201cTotally hosed\u201d is one variant he tries.)\n\nThis version of \u201cRise\u201d works better, and the finale gave me the right kind of chills. I could imagine the series coming into its own in future seasons (presumably involving other productions and challenges).\n\nBut a stage production can go through weeks of rough rehearsals, and none of it will matter if it works out the kinks by the premiere. With \u201cRise,\u201d you have to sit through the growing pains.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou might do that if, like me, you find that this is the sort of show essentially engineered in a lab for you to want it to succeed.

The students are a diverse bunch of working-class locals; the teacher, Olivia, is a famous novelist, brought in from elsewhere to help them write a book together that has to take place in the town.\n\nThe class differences between teacher and students are so pronounced that they threaten to plunge the film into a schoolhouse drama \u2014 that well-worn genre in which a charismatic authority figure, inevitably likable yet inevitably tough, gains her students\u2019 grudging respect and eventual trust.

A journalist with the soul of a mythmaker, Runyon wrote about the exotic fauna of Broadway around the area he called \u201cthe Roaring Forties,\u201d with its two-bit bootleggers and natty bookies, its fast-talking gangsters and softhearted broads.\n\nRunyon, who died in 1946, made up quite a bit of his flowery vernacular, and his prose can now be as opaque as the language of a lost tribe. Take a line like \u201cDancing Dan is a guy with no Barnaby whatever in him, and in fact he has about as much gizzard as anybody around,\u201d which is cryptic to most modern readers \u2014 and may even have been back then. It can be found in \u201cDancing Dan\u2019s Christmas,\u201d a Runyon short story from 1932 that, together with 1933\u2019s \u201cThe Three Wise Guys,\u201d inspired the new comedy, \u201cThree Wise Guys.\u201d\n\nBut what this production from The Actors Company Theater mostly demonstrates is how difficult it is to bring Runyon to life nowadays. (The troupe has announced it is closing shop, after 25 seasons, with this show.)\n\nThe company\u2019s artistic director, Scott Alan Evans, teamed up with Jeffrey Couchman to combine characters and plotlines from the two stories, and they liberally added flourishes of their own. The titular guys are the charming crook Dancing Dan (Jeffrey C. Hawkins), the bootlegger Blondy Swanson (Karl Kenzler) and the Dutchman (Joel Jones), an aging operator with a taste for gambling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1932, they leave their watering hole in the West 40s to embark on a picaresque journey to Pennsylvania \u2014 these three are always on the run from something or someone.

Sexed down and pumped up, Ms. Vikander certainly looks the role, with flowing hair and a washboard stomach you could play the blues on. She runs, jumps and leaps into this yawning void with grim determination.\n\nThere are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and \u201cTomb Raider\u201d goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun. When you first meet Lara Croft, she\u2019s doing the poor little rich girl thing in London, working as a bike messenger and kick boxing in her off hours. Her globe-traveling zillionaire father (Dominic West) disappeared years ago while chasing down a Japanese goddess of death or some such. Refusing to accept either his death or her inheritance, she ends up taking her daddy issues to Asia.\n\nFirst, Lara runs around Hong Kong, where she hires a cute boozer captain (an underused Daniel Wu) who instantly sobers up and takes her to a mysterious isle. There, she runs and runs some more, dodging danger and villains who are also searching for her father\u2019s mystery goddess. The lead baddie is a cookie-cutter scoundrel, but at least he\u2019s played by Walton Goggins, a skilled mustache twirler (as he regularly proved on the TV show \u201cJustified.\u201d) Looking rather like a midcareer Bruce Dern here, Mr. Goggins oils up his rust-bucket role enough to give it a hint of personality.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Vikander barely manages to do the same with Lara, a center who can\u2019t hold. An appealing performer who popped off the screen as the enigmatic android in \u201cEx Machina,\u201d Ms. Vikander never settles comfortably into Lara, whether she\u2019s delivering the empty, often risible dialogue or running the movie\u2019s endless obstacle course. She has a trained ballet dancer\u2019s familiar amalgam of silk and steel \u2014 the fluid gestures, the ramrod posture \u2014 and she can move beautifully, as she showed in \u201cEx Machina.\u201d Here, though, she often seems to be trying too hard; at times you can almost see her thinking about the marks she needs to hit. You see the strain, not the play.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd without play, there\u2019s nothing left but franchise fumes. The first \u201cTomb Raider\u201d movies are ridiculous, but they have their minor satisfactions, not least being Ms. Jolie\u2019s badass superbabe. A video game heroine turned media franchise, Lara Croft, with her pneumatic breasts and heavy guns, always came off as an onanistic cartoon for 12-year-old boys. With her amused smile and self-possession, Ms. Jolie seemed happy to strut around in Lara\u2019s shorts and big boots, but she also seemed to be there for her own pleasure, which she made easy for girls (and women) to share. Ms. Vikander doesn\u2019t yet have that kind of self-possession, but one day might.\n\nNo one person deserves all the credit or blame for an industrial product like \u201cTomb Raider\u201d; one place to start griping, though, is with those who signed off on its script. (The writers are Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons.) The director Roar Uthaug knows how to work on a sizable scale as he proved in \u201cThe Wave,\u201d an amusing nail-biter about a tsunami that sweeps away a Norwegian paradise. But he can\u2019t make \u201cTomb Raider\u201d work on any level or in any location. At times, he seems to be playing with genre, particularly when Lara hits the island and begins pinballing from peril to peril, but the action is leaden, dispirited and finally dispiriting.", "title": "Review: \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 and the Perils of Blockbustering", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "Geneva Robertson-Dworet", "Alastair Siddons"]}

High among the realist artists he praised was his brother-in-law, the painter Paul Cadmus. Paintings by Cadmus and by PaJaMa (a collective name for Cadmus, Cadmus\u2019s lover Jared French and French\u2019s wife, Margaret French) hang on the \u201cTransmissions\u201d walls. One of the people shown is the dancer Jos\u00e9 Martinez, Kirstein\u2019s lover.\n\nAlthough Kirstein made ballet the central part of his vast operation, Nadelman and the photographer Walker Evans (also represented here) were two of the many artists he admired who had no connection to ballet. \u201cTransmissions,\u201d like Kirstein, does not stay in one box. Other photographers here, often depicting dance as Evans did not, are Carl Van Vechten and George Platt Lynes.\n\nThe display of Lynes (1907-55) pictures is where the exhibition most evidently connects ballet to overtly gay art. (The images shown here come from the Kinsey Institute in Indiana, which houses his originals.) Lynes made many intensely poetic studio images of dancers and choreography. They impressed Balanchine in particular with their sense of light, darkness and drama. No less poetically, he was also a pioneer of homosexual photography. His work certainly anticipated that of Robert Mapplethorpe; its imagery and contrasts are often more touching.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf you want to see how gay photography can be admirable art and memorable pornography at the same time, start here. One photo shows a nude man whose anus is the focal point; another, not shocking but striking, is a full frontal nude view of the dancer Nicholas Magallanes. Two 1934 Lynes pictures show three male dancers from the all-black cast of the Virgil Thomson-Gertrude Stein opera \u201cFour Saints in Three Acts\u201d recumbent on the floor, calmly nude, intimately juxtaposed. In one picture, they\u2019re grouped with their choreographer, Frederick Ashton, kneeling, elegantly attired in suit and tie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVan Vechten, a complex figure who touched several arts and aspects of society, had been intelligently passionate about ballet since before World War I. His photographs, most dating from the 1940s and \u201950s, are full of information \u2014 but some tip matters decidedly over into the tastelessly tasteful, ego-flaunting, offbeat area known as camp. Although he took pictures in color, they\u2019ve been almost invariably published in his inferior black-and-white reproductions. In \u201cTransmissions,\u201d however, a series of some 800 of his originals are projected on a large screen.\n\nIn several cases, the color makes them far more peculiar. Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin \u2014 British ballet stars central to this era of dance in America \u2014 are shown in a wide range of roles. Seen in close-up, they often look precious, combining lurid hues and aesthetic flamboyance. Dolin is also seen in a number of nude poses, far from full frontal, but startlingly self-dramatizing. This man was famous as one of ballet\u2019s princes? You\u2019d never guess from the poses he strikes when naked here.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "When Mr. Bignone was handed the reins on July 1, 1982, the military junta that had engulfed Argentina in repression and economic chaos was on its last legs.\n\nMr. Bignone, who had retired from the military in 1981, was asked by the military leadership to succeed Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, who in 1982 led Argentina to embarrassing defeat when British forces repulsed an invasion of the British-held Falkland Islands.\n\nMr. Bignone took over with the stated goal of transitioning to a democratically elected civilian government. On Dec. 10, 1983, he handed power to Ra\u00fal Ricardo Alfons\u00edn, who had been elected in late October.\n\nBefore the transition, however, Mr. Bignone led a methodical process not only to destroy evidence about the dictatorship\u2019s crimes but also to justify its repression. He approved an amnesty that was effectively an effort to shield military officers from prosecution.\n\nMr. Bignone\u2019s convictions in 10 war-crimes trials led to three life sentences and seven sentences of 15 to 25 years. He was also acquitted in one case and indicted in nine others that never went to trial, according to data from the Argentine attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDeath was left without its last boss: The genocide perpetrator Bignone died,\u201d Hijos, a human rights group that advocates for descendants of the disappeared, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHis family knows the time, the reasons and the location. It can also decide where to bid him farewell. The thousands of families who are Bignone\u2019s victims can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Bignone\u2019s convictions and sentences marked a stark shift in how Argentine society regarded him. He had once been seen as the most benevolent member of the military junta because he had led the transition to democracy, but he came to be reviled when his key role in the darkest chapters of the dictatorship became clear.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bignone was sentenced to prison for the first time in April 2010 after being found guilty of torture and killings as the head of the Campo de Mayo military base, where illegal detention centers had held thousands.\n\nHe had also led the military takeover of the Posadas Hospital in Buenos Aires Province, where another illegal detention center was set up.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Bignone was sentenced for his role in Operation Condor, a joint effort by right-wing dictatorships in the region to track down dissidents.\n\nHe never expressed regret for his crimes. In a memoir, \u201cThe Last De Facto\u201d (1992), he sought to justify the actions of the juntas.\n\nHe did so again before being sentenced in 2010, saying that there had been an \u201cirregular war\u201d underway in Argentina at the time and that the armed forces \u201chad to get involved in the fight to defeat terrorism.\u201d\n\nReynaldo Benito Bignone was born on Jan. 21, 1928, in Mor\u00f3n, Buenos Aires Province, and entered the Military Academy at 19. He went on to become general secretary of the Army and was named head of the Military College months before the 1976 coup that ousted President Mar\u00eda Estela Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Defense Ministry stripped Mr. Bignone of his military rank in October 2014.\n\nHe is survived by two of the three children he had with his wife, Nilda Raquel Bel\u00e9n Etcheverry, who died in 2013.", "title": "Reynaldo Bignone, Argentina\u2019s Last Military Dictator, Dies at 90", "authors": ["Daniel Politi"]}

For me, every new rice dish is a controlled experiment in which I play with variables like flavor and method, and adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nIn recent years, for example, my rice has often been migrating to the oven, and cooking in a baking dish rather than a pot. I do this when I want a large surface area, either underneath or on top of the rice, in which I can embed flavors in all sorts of interesting ways. On one occasion, I braised two heads of garlic and a dozen shallots in lots of olive oil before adding the rice and slowly baking it with curry leaves. Another time, I covered the large surface of the baked rice with thin \u201ctiles\u201d of feta, placed it under the grill and then finished off with a sweet and salty garnish of pomegranates, walnuts, olives and herbs.", "title": "Rice, Coming Off the Sidelines, Becomes a Centerpiece", "authors": []}

Panofsky, the director of SLAC from its founding until 1984. He had been the driving force in getting the accelerator built and oversaw it at a time when four different experiments performed there would lead to Nobel Prizes.\n\n\u201cThere were 20 of us named on that experiment,\u201d Dr. Taylor said in a 2008 interview with the Nobel Institute, referring to their work on deep inelastic scattering. \u201cThere were, like, 40 of us who built that apparatus, backed up by another 40 engineers and technicians, using an accelerator that is built by a thousand people.\u201d\n\nA science prize given to even more recipients, he said, would \u201cacknowledge that it is not the work of an individual person, but a huge group of people.\u201d\n\nRichard Edward Taylor was born on Nov. 2, 1929, in Medicine Hat, Alberta, the son of a Canadian father (whose own parents had immigrated from Northern Ireland and Scotland) and an American mother (a daughter of Norwegian immigrants).\n\nWhen he was young, Richard wanted to be a surgeon, but while in high school he lost the forefinger and parts of the middle finger and thumb on his left hand after accidentally blowing up a chemistry lab in his basement at home.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "When right-to-work laws are in place, Democrats up and down the ballot do worse. In presidential elections, we estimate that these laws cost Democratic candidates two to five percentage points in right-to-work counties. Voter turnout also dropped by approximately two points. That is not trivial, especially considering that Hillary Clinton lost Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 \u2014 two relatively recent right-to-work states \u2014 by less than one percentage point each. We find similar effects at other levels of government. Democrats, for instance, are less likely to win state legislative seats after the passage of right-to-work laws.\n\nWith a weaker labor movement, it\u2019s not just Democratic electoral prospects that suffer. The working class loses, too. We find that the number of state legislators who had previously worked in blue-collar jobs drops sharply after right-to-work goes into effect. These politicians tend to strongly support economic policies preferred by working-class Americans, like a higher minimum wage and a stronger safety net. Right-to-work laws thus undercut political representation for working-class people, a group that is disproportionately nonwhite, and reduce the legislative voice for progressive economic policies.\n\nWhy do unions matter so much to Democrats\u2019 electoral chances and to working people\u2019s political voice? Most people know that unions are big campaign spenders and help turn out voters during elections. But in between elections, unions also help develop political interest and skills among workers who might not otherwise devote much time to thinking about politics. And, on a deeper level, unions shape how working-class Americans perceive their political and economic interests. For all of these reasons, unions have been vital to Democratic electoral success and in ensuring that Democrats, once in office, take the concerns of working people seriously.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, unions and Democrats are attempting to recreate the old winning formula. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.-endorsed Democrat in the 18th District, Conor Lamb, is running on union rights, infrastructure investment and the protection of Social Security, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act. His Republican opponent, Rick Saccone, supports anti-union policies like right-to-work laws. The election next week affords unions an opportunity to show their strength.\n\nBut whatever happens in this one race, revitalizing the labor movement ought to be at the center of the Democratic agenda. Democrats would do well to ban right-to-work laws, as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Brad Sherman have recently proposed. Democrats might consider making it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively with their employers.

And at the same time he also captured likenesses with brilliant precision and great wit.\u201d\n\nMr. Grossman, whose mentors included Harvey Kurtzman of Mad magazine, found a nice niche in the early 1970s when New York magazine gave him a regular space to fill under its weekly politics column.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was Watergate time and there was much talk about bugs and bugging,\u201d he recalled in an interview with The Atlantic in 2012. \u201cI drew some insects named Haldebug and Ehrlichbug serving their master, the terrifying Richard M. Nightcrawler.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDecades later, during the early days of the 2008 presidential campaign, he would reach back to the very beginning of his career for an inspiration. In the early 1960s he had drawn a black superhero named Captain Melanin.\n\n\u201cIt was the civil rights era,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly in early 2007 there was Barack Obama, whose extraordinary poise and charisma seemed to be inspiring messianic hopes in a portion of the population. So it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine for him a secret identity with the ability to fly and to lead stranded whales to safety by walking on water.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe created O-Man, who lived in O-Manland and went up against characters like Milt Rhomboid and Rich Gingnewt. O-Man\u2019s adventures appeared in The New York Observer, then in The Nation, then on a website Mr. Grossman created to continue them.\n\nMr. Grossman was not about to leave the current goings-on in government unremarked upon. He had of late been posting on his website episodes of a strip called \u201cTwump and Pooty,\u201d whose title characters look suspiciously like President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nBut for all of his politically oriented drawings, his best-known work might well have been the poster he created for \u201cAirplane!,\u201d a 1980 disaster-movie parody that became a box-office hit. It shows an airplane whose bizarrely flexible front end is tied in a knot.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe also drew the occasional book and album cover and made animated commercials.\n\nMr. Grossman\u2019s first marriage, to Donna Lundvall in 1964, ended in divorce in 1980. His second marriage, to Vicki Anne Morgan, ended in divorce in 1987. In addition to his son Alex, his survivors include his partner of 24 years, Elaine Louie; another son, Michael Jonathan Grossman Rimbaud; two daughters, Leila Suzanna Grossman and Anna Jane Grossman Pedicone; two brothers, James and David; and five grandchildren.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with The Tennessean, Mr. Grossman explained why, of the various jobs that fit under the big tent of journalism, he preferred illustrator.\n\n\u201cReporters labor under the terrible requirement that what they report must be true,\u201d he said. \u201cOpinion writers need to endure the less stringent demand that what they opine be at least plausible.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "That requires a constitutional judgment. Answering strictly legal questions in a potential trial does not resolve the issue of the president\u2019s accountability under the Constitution. Congress\u2019s inquiry can and should be informed by an unfettered special counsel investigation, but it cannot depend on it.\n\nFurthermore, narrowing impeachable offenses to include only violations of law may lead to a constitutional dead end. In opinions issued in 1973 and 2000, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has taken the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted while in office. If Mr. Mueller concludes that the president engaged in criminal conduct but follows O.L.C. opinions in declining to indict him, the president\u2019s legal responsibility will not be adjudicated as long as he occupies the White House. On what basis would Congress then proceed to oust him from office under the legalistic conception of the impeachment power?\n\nMany people assume that the special counsel will report to Congress on the evidence against the president. But the special counsel regulations, unlike the now defunct independent counsel statute, do not clearly mandate or authorize any such report from either the counsel or the deputy attorney general. Congress may be more likely to learn about Mr. Mueller\u2019s work from publicly filed indictments and plea agreements.\n\nAnd Congress cannot rely on the Mueller record alone. Even if Congress made impeachment a legal rather than political process, a president will be quick to argue that he is entitled to a fair adjudication of any criminal charge.\n\nMoreover, the timetables for the two processes are not the same. Congress cannot responsibly defer its task for as long as it may take for lawyers to clash and courts to rule.\n\nA Congress that was serious about meeting its responsibility would neither shirk nor rush a judgment about a president\u2019s impeachable offenses. The House would structure an investigative and deliberative process that it would explain in clear terms to the public. As in 1974 in the Nixon impeachment process, the House Judiciary Committee would review and publish the best constitutional learning on what presidential misconduct rises to the level of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d It would proceed in the same spirit as its predecessor did when the 1974 committee said that \u201cwhat is said here does not reflect any prejudgment\u201d of the allegations but is \u201cintended to be a review of the precedents and available interpretive materials, seeking general principles to guide the committee.\u201d The Committee would then move to the investigative phase.\n\nAs in the Watergate case, the congressional inquiry would run parallel to the legal process, each benefiting from the other even as Congress took steps as necessary to avoid compromising the criminal investigation. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine a new Mueller indictment spurring the Congress to action. While the special counsel may conclude that he cannot indict the president, the nature of charges against close aides and relatives could support the initiation of an impeachment inquiry. Even in this case, Congress\u2019s task is to carry on its own investigation and to arrive at an independent judgment about whether the president should remain in office.", "title": "Opinion | Robert Mueller Is Not a Superhero", "authors": []}

In a typically analytic and introspective passage, he described the moment at which a runner decides to break from the pack and take the lead:\n\n\u201cThe decision to \u2018break away\u2019 results from a mixture of confidence and lack of it. The \u2018breaker\u2019 is confident to the extent that he suddenly decides the speed has become slower than he can himself sustain to the finish.

But he also lacks confidence, feeling that unless he makes a move now, everyone else will do so and he will be left standing.\n\n\u201cThe spurt is extremely wasteful because it is achieved at the cost of relaxation,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhich should be maintained throughout the race.

But in reflecting behavior with good clothes and beautiful stars, they begin to define it as cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always go back to Valentino,\u201d she told me, referring to the actor Rudolph Valentino and the movies \u201cThe Sheik\u201d (1921) and \u201cThe Son of the Sheik\u201d (1926). \u201cHe carries her off \u2014 it is actually a rape thing \u2014 but it\u2019s couched so romantically. He\u2019s so beautiful and exotic and he sweeps her up on the horse.\u201d Basinger wasn\u2019t endorsing this scenario. She was just describing its presentation.\n\nIn books, there\u2019s a genre called \u201cthe bodice ripper,\u201d and, she noted, \u201cThe woman doesn\u2019t rip her own bodice.\u201d That\u2019s a man\u2019s work. And that idea informs countless movies in which, she said, \u201cThe man is supposed to desire and pursue and the woman is supposed to resist and make demands.\u201d\n\nThat theme persisted beyond \u201cRocky\u201d and the 1970s. For your consideration: \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d 1980. On her wedding night, Loretta Lynn, just a teenager, cries \u201cno, no, no, no\u201d as her older husband wrestles her into submission. The next morning, when he tells her to get used to it and she says that she won\u2019t, he slaps her. It\u2019s not pretty, but it\u2019s a necessary rite of passage \u2014 or so the movie seems to maintain.\n\n\u201cRevenge of the Nerds,\u201d 1984. Fixated on sorority women typically beyond his reach, a college nerd costumes himself so that one of them mistakes him for her boyfriend and has sex with him. When he removes his mask, she\u2019s not appalled at his subterfuge. She\u2019s impressed by his prowess.\n\n\u201cOverboard,\u201d 1987. Dean and Joanna luxuriate in a post-coital embrace. \u201cWas it always like this?\u201d she asks him. He answers, \u201cEvery time with you is like the first time.\u201d It\u2019s a line meant for laughs, because this was the first time: She\u2019s a spoiled heiress suffering amnesia, and he\u2019s a working-class hunk who has duped her into cleaning his house, caring for his kids and sharing his bed by telling her that they\u2019ve long been a couple. From this elaborate ruse comes her ecstatic rebirth. The movie is a romantic comedy.\n\nEach of those episodes has a particular context and justification. None are intended as instructive. But all, I think, would be changed if being filmed today.

The huge squares of weedy grass and clumps of umbrella pines outlined in brick stubs could almost be farm fields \u2014 but, in fact, most of the stubs are remains of a colossal royal residence, the Domus Flavia, inaugurated by Vespasian and completed by his wicked, wildly ambitious second son, Domitian. Josephus, whose life spanned all three Flavian emperors, would have come to the Domus Flavia to pay homage to his patrons and perhaps murmur a prayer before the sacred scroll they had cached here.\n\nI lingered on the Palatine for half an hour, trying to conjure the nerve center of an empire from its ruins.

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "All of this matters because, if Dr. Jackson cannot be trusted to act independently when it comes to the president\u2019s mental and physical health, we cannot be confident that he will do so when it comes to the fitness of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The department has the sacred charge of repaying our soldiers for their service by providing them with health care and other support. If Dr. Jackson tells the president \u2014 and the country \u2014 what Mr. Trump wants to hear about his own health, how can we trust him to honestly and rigorously diagnose the ailments of the V.A., and to treat them appropriately?\n\nHaving a candid V.A. secretary is all the more important because the department faces profound challenges. Since 2014, it has dealt with a pattern of negligent treatment at hospitals operated by one of its agencies, the Veterans Health Administration. Outgoing Secretary David Shulkin revealed yesterday that he had fought Trump administration proposals to privatize services provided by the V.A. \u2014 a move that could undermine the quality of health care provided to our veterans. Dr. Jackson\u2019s treatment of the president does not inspire confidence that he will take on the V.A.\u2019s problems with the brutal honesty that the job demands.\n\nDr. Jackson\u2019s nomination is also undermined by the fact that although he is a medical professional, he lacks the management experience that the job demands. The V.A. secretary is responsible for a department that provides health care services to over nine million individuals. While Dr. Jackson has served his country with distinction, both in Iraq and as the White House physician, managing a relatively small medical team is not preparation for leading a vast and sprawling bureaucracy. The V.A. is one of the most complex health care management jobs in the world, and ideally would be run by someone with experience operating hospital systems or health businesses or enterprises, and large ones.\n\nThe nomination fits a pattern of cronyism, with the president appointing those of dubious qualifications to patronage jobs across the administration. The president\u2019s former golf caddy is now the White House social media director. A contractor married to one of the Trump\u2019s former household staff members now has a job at the Environmental Protection Agency. And a longtime friend of the Trump family who has been involved in planning golf tournaments and Eric Trump\u2019s wedding is the head of the New York and New Jersey office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And now he has appointed his White House doctor to oversee the health care of millions of veterans.\n\nFinally, in addition to concerns about independence and qualifications, it appears that Dr. Jackson had not undergone the normal vetting process for White House presidential personnel. Reportedly, the tweet-from-the-hip nomination of Dr. Jackson by the president surprised even his own advisers. That suggests that Dr. Jackson has not in fact received the careful review that is normally completed before such an announcement.\n\nOne of us worked (just down the hall from Dr. Jackson, actually) on vetting hundreds of senior administration officials. Very presentable and capable individuals \u2014 sometimes even those with existing security clearances \u2014 are sometimes disqualified by the rigorous personnel investigations that are normally undertaken for cabinet positions. Such cabinet-level vets complement but are more thorough than a typical pre-existing security clearance, and can uncover conflicts, misdeeds or other disqualifying information.\n\nWe are not suggesting that vetting will uncover anything improper, but caution is warranted, since many of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees have had unprecedented conflicts and other issues.", "title": "Opinion | Ronny Jackson\u2019s Disturbing Lack of Independence", "authors": []}

So was David Chiu, a Brooklyn journalist.\n\n\u201cWhen you walked into the Tower Records store in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood back in the day, you just didn\u2019t go in there to buy an album and then rush off to leave,\u201d he wrote in Cuepoint, an online publication, in 2016. \u201cTo me, going into Tower was like visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art or attending a baseball game \u2014 it required a certain investment of time.\u201d\n\nMr. Solomon told Billboard magazine in 2015: \u201cOur favorite regular was Elton John. He probably was the best customer we ever had. He was in one of our stores every week, literally, wherever he was \u2014 in L.A., in Atlanta when he lived in Atlanta, and in New York.\u201d\n\nIn an interview for this obituary last September, Mr. Solomon recalled that he opened the first Tower Records store in what had been his father\u2019s drugstore with $5,000 in borrowed capital. He called it \u201ca neighborhood business,\u201d which he named after the Tower Theater, a local landmark that was built in 1938 and topped by a neon-bathed, 100-foot Art Deco pillar.\n\nHe soon opened a second Sacramento outlet, but the business did not take off until 1968, when he opened Tower Records in San Francisco. It was an instant sensation in the heart of the hippie and music scene, capitalizing on the 1967 Summer of Love. At 5,000 square feet, the store was small by later company standards, but it set a formula for the future: wide selections and discounted prices.\n\n\u201cI stole ideas from supermarket merchandising,\u201d Mr. Solomon recalled. The store, he said, stacked hot-selling items on the floor, to encourage impulse buying and to suggest plentiful supplies, reinforcing the impression that Tower would be well stocked when competitors\u2019 supplies had run out. The store also set late-night closing hours.\n\nBut the most important innovation, he said, was hiring a staff so well versed in the local music scene that the store could order its own inventory. It was a task that music chains typically assigned to a central office to achieve economies of scale for their outlets. But Mr. Solomon found that local judgments were more profitable, and decentralized ordering became a pattern for all his stores.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe wanted people in the store to run the store \u2014 they\u2019re your strength,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cCentral buying is just a bad idea. You can\u2019t make decisions on what to do in Phoenix if you\u2019re sitting in New York or London.\u201d\n\nWhile staff wages were relatively low, the workers were given unusual fringe benefits, including parties with live bands and opportunities to mingle with musicians, promoters, record company executives and radio and television personalities, Mr. Solomon said. And in the 1960s and \u203270s, he said, employees were given time off to attend protests against the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to be with the scene. It was important to us and to them.\u201d\n\nAs business boomed in the \u203270s and \u203280s, he established Tower Records outlets in major cities across the United States, many with 20,000 to 40,000 square feet of space. The New York flagship, in Greenwich Village, opened in 1983.\n\nTower began opening stores abroad in the 1980s, starting in Japan and spreading in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In the 1990s, it became the nation\u2019s largest privately held music retailer, with nearly 200 stores in the United States and 14 other countries.\n\nBut it never went public. \u201cThat was the dumbest thing I ever did,\u201d Mr. Solomon conceded. Selling stock might have paid for further expansion. Instead, he borrowed to finance more stores, and his debt swelled to $300 million. In 1999, Tower sales topped $1 billion, but its financial tailspin had already begun. The company lost $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001.\n\nMr. Solomon sold and closed stores and converted others to franchises. At the same time, the music business went into a slump. Tower declared bankruptcy in 2004, and in 2006 it was forced to liquidate and close.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Solomon acknowledged that he had underestimated the internet\u2019s threat to store retailing. Pirates downloaded music without paying for it, and paying customers turned to online vendors and price-cutters like Wal-Mart and Best Buy. The owner blamed himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was overextended,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cI was swamped by the debt.\u201d\n\nRussell Malcolm Solomon was born on Sept. 22, 1925, in San Francisco to Clayton Solomon and the former Annette Sockolov. The boy and his sister, Shirley, grew up mostly in Sacramento, the state capital, where their father established his business, Tower Cut Rate Drugs, in the late 1930s.\n\nRussell, an indifferent student, was expelled for repeated truancy from C. K. McClatchy High School at 16 and went to work for his father. He served stateside in the Army Air Forces from 1944 to 1946.\n\nIn 1946, he married Doris Epstein, from whom he was divorced. In 2010, he married Patricia Drosins, who survives him. Besides his son Michael, he is also survived by another son, David; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Michael Solomon said his father died, apparently of a heart attack, while watching the Academy Awards ceremony on television.\n\nMr. Solomon attempted a comeback in 2007, opening a store called R5 Records at the location of his first Sacramento store. He no longer had the rights to the Tower Records name, but used its red and yellow color scheme for his logo. After three relatively unsuccessful years, R5 Records was sold to a local music chain.\n\nA nostalgic documentary, \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d directed by the actor Colin Hanks, was released in 2015.

But then a chance bit of browsing changed his direction.\n\n\u201cOne day I read an article about a 16-year-old blind boy who invented a Braille typewriter,\u201d he recounted in a 1988 interview with The Chicago Tribune. \u201cI thought that was remarkable. Then, as I kept reading, I learned that the Braille system itself, as used around the world, was invented by another 16-year-old blind boy, Louis Braille.\u201d\n\nHe decided to write a book, \u201cTeenagers Who Made History.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time the book was completed, he realized it had to be a book for young readers,\u201d said the critic and filmmaker Evans Chan, Mr. Freedman\u2019s partner of many years, whom he married in 2013. The book was published in 1961, with a little help from Mr. Freedman\u2019s father.\n\nThe many works that followed included a string of nature books like \u201cAnimal Architects\u201d (1971). But a trip to a photographic exhibition changed his focus and approach.\n\n\u201cHis interest in biographical and history writings was rekindled by a visit to a New-York Historical Society exhibition of \u2018Street Kids: 1864-1977\u2019 in 1978,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cThe show inspired Russ to begin combining text with vintage photos (and eventually archival illustrations) in his own books.\u201d\n\nHe quickly put the approach to the test in \u201cImmigrant Kids\u201d (1980), using photographs and text to tell the stories of young immigrants in the early 1900s. A particularly effective example was \u201cLincoln: A Photobiography,\u201d which won the Newbery Medal in 1988. It was one of only a handful of nonfiction books to win that prestigious children\u2019s-literature award at that point, something Mr. Freedman attributed partly to poor writing practices.\n\n\u201cCondescension used to be the rule in children\u2019s nonfiction,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cthe belief that we needed to dramatize history to make it palatable and keep kids reading. So we lied. We created unbelievable characters \u2014 bland stereotypes \u2014 and fictionalized their lives. Biographies, almost without exception, were adulatory and reverential.\u201d\n\nIn the Lincoln book, he said, he strove to convey the human qualities of Lincoln, including the shortcomings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen he started out, he was weak, indecisive, insecure, a crybaby,\u201d he said. \u201cYet in my book, I can show the process of growth taking place. If kids see that our greatest president had the same fears, doubts and failings they have, they realize that Lincoln, whose picture hangs on every schoolhouse wall, was not all that different from them.\u201d\n\nLincoln may be one of American history\u2019s marquee names, but Mr. Freedman did not confine himself to obvious subjects.\n\n\u201cRussell\u2019s writing was beautiful in its clarity and precision,\u201d Mary Cash, his editor at Holiday House, said by email. \u201cYet his approach was usually broad. He included the perspectives of people whom others overlooked, such as Native Americans and enslaved people.\u201d\n\nDinah Stevenson, his longtime editor at Clarion Books, recalled that someone once referred to Mr. Freedman as \u201cthe Zen master of children\u2019s nonfiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mastery is evident,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps the Zen was in the discipline and dedication that went into crafting his clear, compelling books. He made it look easy.\u201d\n\nOne of the books she edited was \u201cThe War to End All Wars,\u201d a work augmented by more than 100 photographs and illustrations. Mr. Chan said that the book so impressed the directors of the 2011 Broadway production of \u201cWar Horse,\u201d a story set during World War I, that they assigned it as reading for the cast. Mr. Freedman adapted an essay from the book for the Lincoln Center Theater Review\u2019s \u201cWar Horse\u201d issue.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Chan, Mr. Freedman is survived by a sister, Carol Hutchinson.\n\nOne thing that teachers, librarians and inquisitive students love about Mr. Freedman\u2019s books is that most are thoroughly annotated, so that the curious can follow his research path and delve deeper into the subject. In his book about one of the greatest American female athletes, \u201cBabe Didrikson Zaharias: The Making of a Champion,\u201d he included a cautionary tale for historians young and old.\n\n\u201cShe tended to glamorize the story of her life, adding choice tidbits and details, putting a shine on past events,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs impressive as her achievements were, she could not resist the temptation to embellish them.\u201d\n\nIn researching that book, he discovered that he had erroneously included her in his very first book, \u201cTeenagers Who Made History.\u201d One of the things she stretched the truth about, it turned out, was her birth year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe first thing I was surprised to learn,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas that Babe wasn\u2019t a teenager at all during the 1932 Olympics, as she claimed and the world believed.\u201d Despite using, variously, a birth year of 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1919, she was born in 1911.", "title": "Russell Freedman, 88, Writer of History for Young Readers, Dies", "authors": ["Neil Genzlinger"]}

Those sanctions could include ending the practice of allowing Russian athletes to compete as neutrals if they can prove they have not used performance enhancing drugs, or expelling Russia\u2019s track and field federation from the I.A.A.F.\n\nAs part of a pathway to reintegration, Russia had agreed to a series of conditions with the I.A.A.F. Sports officials were supposed to acknowledge that the doping scheme that lasted at least from 2008-2015 was part of a systemic effort to corrupt sports. They have not done so. Russia has also failed to identify athletes in a database of individuals suspected of using performance enhancing drugs.\n\n\u201cThere is no ambiguity about the criteria, and the criteria was agreed,\u201d Coe, a former two-time Olympic gold medal-winning runner, told reporters in Birmingham, England, where the world indoor championships are currently taking place. \u201cWe want the country and their athletes back, but we want the world to be in a position to trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussia\u2019s athletics officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement followed a meeting of the I.A.A.F. executive board. It stands in stark contrast to the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision last month to restore Russia to full membership status less than three months after issuing its own suspension.

About 350 colleges and universities field teams in the top division, compared with 65 in football. At the end of the regular season, 68 teams move on to a knockout tournament.\n\nThe first men\u2019s tournament was held in 1939, and for more than a decade only eight teams were invited. The women\u2019s tourney started in 1982.

Walker, director of environmental sustainability at Green Cross International, a disarmament advocacy group.\n\n\u201cNobody that I know of has questioned their veracity about declaring everything,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cNow, with the Novichok situation, it is a new day at the O.P.C.W. People will ask, is this inspection system intrusive enough? In the executive council in particular, people are raising questions about secret stockpiles.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker said that he was surprised by Britain's claim it had proof Russia has been producing and stockpiling the nerve agent, and that he had not yet seen evidence to back it up.\n\n\u201cThey must have something we haven\u2019t seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has to come out.\u201d\n\nRussia has pushed back hard against the accusation, comparing it to the American case, later discredited, that Saddam Hussein was stockpiling chemical weapons. Moscow has suggested that the nerve agent used on the Skripals could have been produced in Britain, Sweden, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or the United States.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov have each said that no Novichok program existed in either Russia or the Soviet Union.\n\nBut scientists have come forward to describe it. Leonid Rink, who worked at a Soviet chemical weapons laboratory, told the Ria Novosti news service that \u201ca big group of specialists\u201d had worked on the strains and that it would be \u201czero problem\u201d for laboratories outside Russia to produce the nerve agent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVladimir Uglev, who worked in the same laboratory as Mr. Rink, told The Bell news website that he helped produce four agents under the code name Foliant, from 1972 until 1988. He said he believed that, by analyzing the remains of chemical agents in the blood, it would be possible to determine \u201cwhere the specific dose was produced and by whom.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe added that, based on what he witnessed at that time, the victims were not likely to survive.\n\n\u201cI can say with nearly 100 percent certainty that if Skripal and his daughter are taken off life support, they will die,\u201d Mr. Uglev said. \u201cThey are now only technically alive.\u201d\n\nThe British authorities have been tight-lipped about the inquiry, but in recent days intensified their focus on vehicles the Skripals traveled in, where the agent, in powder form, could have been planted on a door handle or in a ventilation system. In an interview with RIA Novosti, Mr. Rink, the Russian scientist, scoffed at the theory that Novichok could have been planted in Ms. Skripal\u2019s suitcase, saying that it was so lethal that, as he put it, \u201cshe would not have reached London.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAt present, inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have a limited task: to take samples of the agent used in the attack and send them to independent laboratories to determine whether it is Novichok.\n\nIf the dispute escalates, however, Britain could request a so-called challenge inspection of Russian laboratories to look for signs of Novichok production \u2014 a measure that has never been invoked in the monitoring group\u2019s 21-year history. Russia, in turn, could request its own challenge inspections.\n\nChallenge inspections are designed to be intensive and carried out at short notice; inspectors are to be allowed access to a laboratory within 36 hours of arrival.\n\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention was designed to eliminate large stocks of chemical weapons that could be used on the battlefield. Russia committed to destroying 40,000 metric tons, and the United States to 31,500 metric tons. Russia announced last year that it had completed this task. The United States has eliminated seven of nine stockpiles, holding about 90 percent of its agents.\n\nNovichok, then an early-stage project, was not included on a list of banned chemicals compiled in 1987, so Russia was under no obligation to regularly report on its stockpiles and their destruction. But producing Novichok would be a serious violation, because the treaty broadly prohibits the development and use of chemical weapons, said Richard Guthrie, an independent chemical weapons expert and editor of CBW Events.\n\nMr. Johnson said on Sunday that Britain had evidence that Russia had stockpiled Novichok during the past decade and had investigated ways to deliver nerve agents for assassination. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to describe the evidence, saying only that \u201cclearly, the information the foreign secretary was referring to is very sensitive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts said that Britain could have learned of a secret program in various ways: communications intercepts, moles within laboratories, publications by Russian chemists reporting their synthesis of rare compounds, or a computer virus lurking within Western equipment sold for use in Russian laboratories.\n\nMr. Guthrie said that concerns about a Novichok program had surfaced occasionally, but that Britain probably chose not to raise the issue publicly with the weapons-monitoring organization for fear of derailing trade deals or other agreements with Russia.\n\n\u201cIf your information isn\u2019t perfect, you might think, \u2018We\u2019ll leave this allegation, maybe these aren\u2019t so serious,\u2019\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t feel it was important enough, and I think Novichoks would have stayed on the back burner if they hadn\u2019t been used in Salisbury.\u201d\n\nThis would not be the first time the chemical weapons watchdog was shaken by great-power politics. In 2002, its director general, Jos\u00e9 Bustani, was ousted amid divisions over whether Iraq maintained stockpiles of chemical weapons. Mr. Bustani, in an interview, said the United States pushed for his removal because he had persuaded Mr. Hussein to accede to the convention, which he said would have undermined the American case for invading Iraq.\n\nMore recently, Russia has used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council repeatedly to block action against Syria, its ally, based on the monitoring group\u2019s reporting on chemical weapons use there. Andrew C. Weber, a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said this had tarnished Russia\u2019s \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d in destroying 40,000 metric tons of stockpiled weapons.\n\n\u201cIt does take away from their achievement \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s disgraceful \u2014 and now the Russian Federation has apparently been caught in a flagrant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who emerged on Tuesday from a routine meeting with Russian chemical weapons experts on disarmament projects. They were \u201cembarrassed,\u201d he said, when Novichok came up in conversation.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to believe that their government actually did this,\u201d he said.", "title": "Russia, Praised for Scrapping Chemical Weapons, Now Under Watchdog\u2019s Gaze", "authors": ["Ellen Barry"]}

Though she never displayed any symptoms of the disease, she would be confined for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1906, health officials tied Ms. Mallon to outbreaks of typhoid fever in seven wealthy families for whom she had worked as a cook.\n\nShe was confirmed to be a carrier of the disease and quarantined. Doctors released her in 1910 under the condition that she no longer work as a cook. Shortly after, she disappeared.\n\nMs. Mallon was rediscovered in 1915 by officials investigating a typhoid outbreak in a Manhattan hospital. She had been working there as a cook under an assumed name.\n\nShe was then quarantined for 23 years, until her death in 1938 from the effects of a stroke.\n\nDuring her life, the public was fascinated by Ms. Mallon, above.

The chances of that happening, however, are near zero, not least because his would-be country claims territory, like the border town of Brcko, that does not belong to it and has a habit of belittling Bosnian Muslims as fanatics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe described the Night Wolves, a mix of Russians and Serbs, as harmless \u201ctourists\u201d who were far more welcome than \u201cmen in short trousers with beards but no mustaches,\u201d a reference to the dress code and shaving habits of Muslims who follow a rigid form of the faith promoted by Saudi Arabia and who many Serb nationalists believe, against all evidence, are numerous in Bosnia.\n\nWhile claiming not to know much about the Night Wolves, Mr. Dodik in January gave a medal to their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, a burly bruiser and friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s, to honor what he described as the biker\u2019s contribution to human rights, the rule of law and relations between Republika Srpska and Russia.\n\nThat the Night Wolves are not just another group of motorcycle enthusiasts, never mind human rights activists, however, has been evident since March 2014, when its members traveled, this time with their bikes, to Crimea to set up road blocks and provide other support for a Moscow-orchestrated takeover of the Ukrainian peninsula on the Black Sea.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of them went on to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels who seized power in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThey then reappeared in 2016 in Montenegro, joining events celebrating pan-Slavic solidarity and hostility to the West ahead of what the authorities there have since claimed was an unsuccessful, Russian-sponsored coup attempt aimed at blocking the country\u2019s entry to NATO.\n\nWashington takes such a dim view of the Night Wolves that the Treasury Department placed the gang on a sanctions list in December 2014, accusing the bikers of kidnapping, assault and close ties to Russia\u2019s security services. It has since added various affiliates, like a bike shop in Moscow, to the list.\n\n\u201cThese guys are not good-will ambassadors \u2014 we can all be sure about that,\u201d said Emir Suljagic, a former deputy defense minister in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.\n\nThe Night Wolves gang, which has local branches around the region, he added, is part of an \u201cextremist ecosystem\u201d nurtured by Russia through its ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church and radical Serb nationalists who still dream of a \u201cGreater Serbia.\u201d It was that idea that led to murderous ethnic cleansing in the early 1990s and also the creation of the Republika Srpska, whose founding president, Radovan Karadzic, was convicted in The Hague of war crimes in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Security Ministry in Sarajevo declared the bikers a security threat and barred Mr. Zaldostanov and the leader of the Night Wolves\u2019 Serbian chapter from its territory.

And though a native of New Orleans, he was much the New Yorker. At one time he owned two restaurants in Manhattan, Rusty\u2019s and Rusty Staub\u2019s on Fifth.\n\nStaub was especially respected, during his baseball career and afterward, for his community involvement and his charitable work.\n\nHe particularly endeared himself in Canada, where he played for the expansion team the Expos; he was an All-Star in all three of his full seasons in Montreal, from 1969 to 1971. Staub learned French and became a traveling ambassador for the team, hailing the advent of Major League Baseball in Canada.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe did so out of respect for the fans, he said.\n\n\u201cI was in Quebec \u2014 I couldn\u2019t talk to a child,\u201d he told The Montreal Gazette in 2012. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say something encouraging.

A year later, he helped propel them to a National League pennant, hitting three home runs \u2014 accounting for all his hits \u2014 in their five-game victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the National League Championship Series.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe also injured his shoulder in that series while making an outstanding catch. But he went on to bat .423 in the World Series, with two doubles and a homer, though the Mets were defeated by the Oakland A\u2019s in seven games.\n\nStaub drove in 105 runs in 1975, setting a Mets record that stood for 15 years. But he was traded that December to the Detroit Tigers, with the Mets receiving the pitcher Mickey Lolich, and served mostly as a designated hitter.\n\nStaub returned to the Expos in a trade in July 1979. In his first at-bat back at Olympic Stadium, Expos fans gave him a standing ovation.\n\nIt was a short second stint in Montreal. He spent the 1980 season with the Texas Rangers and then signed with the Mets as a free agent, playing his final five seasons with the team. As a pinch-hitter in 1983, he had eight consecutive hits in June and drove in 25 runs that season.\n\nStaub was also seen displaying his cooking techniques on television, but his love of food made it challenging to keep his weight down.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d he told The Times in 1985. \u201cI\u2019ll go into my favorite Italian restaurant, and there\u2019s this risotto dish that I just love.

He signed with the Houston Colt .45s organization in September 1961 out of Jesuit High School of New Orleans. The franchise, which later became the Astros, was preparing along with the Mets to enter the National League the next season as an expansion team.\n\nAfter playing in the minors, Staub made his debut with Houston in 1963. His breakout season came in 1967, when he batted .333 with a league-leading 44 doubles and was an All-Star for the first time.\n\nHe retired after the Mets\u2019 1985 season with 1,466 runs batted in and a career batting average of .279 to go with his 292 homers and 2,716 hits.\n\nPhoto\n\nBesides his brother, he is survived by his sisters, Sally Johnston and Susan Tully.\n\nAfter leaving baseball Staub became president of the Rusty Staub Foundation, which has supported emergency food pantries throughout New York in collaboration with Catholic Charities. He also created the New York Police and Fire Widows\u2019 and Children\u2019s Benefit Fund, which has raised millions of dollars for the families of uniformed personnel killed in the line of duty. (An uncle of Staub\u2019s died while working as a New Orleans police officer.)\n\nWhen Major League Baseball returned to New York for the first time after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with the Mets playing the Atlanta Braves, the Mets donated proceeds from the game, about $450,000, to the fund for widows and children.\n\nThat night, Staub said the organization had distributed $8.3 million in the 15 years before the attacks.\n\n\u201cSince then, we\u2019ve already raised $8 million,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cYou want to get money to the widows and children, we\u2019re the ones.\u201d", "title": "Rusty Staub, Durable Batter Who Won Pennant With Mets, Dies at 73", "authors": ["Richard Goldstein"]}

The public simply never heard much about them, according to the disclaimer, perhaps because no sports organization is better at concealing its soap operas than the Spurs.\n\nBut the veteran Spurs swingman Danny Green conceded in a recent interview that dealing with the stream of headlines about the club\u2019s tenuous relationship with Leonard \u2014 which Green called \u201cmostly just talk and rumors\u201d \u2014 is among the many adjustments that the Spurs have been coping with in their second season post-Duncan.\n\n\u201cUsually you don\u2019t hear any of that stuff around this organization,\u201d Green acknowledged.\n\nAs a longtime observer of the San Antonio machine from relatively close range, I\u2019d say what has changed is that the Spurs\u2019 centerpieces \u2014 Leonard and the All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge \u2014 are true modern-day stars who want to do things on their terms. This, of course, is the norm pretty much everywhere else in the basketball universe in these days of Player Power, with Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James as the league\u2019s foremost flexer. But it\u2019s a serious departure for the Spurs, who enjoyed 19 seasons of Duncan willingly doing things San Antonio\u2019s way \u2014 and everyone else in silver and black falling in line.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter its failed pursuit of Jason Kidd in the summer of 2003, San Antonio largely avoided big-name free agency for the next decade, until the summer of 2015, when the Spurs won the Aldridge sweepstakes thanks largely to some surprisingly dogged recruiting by their famously gruff coach. Popovich then surprised us all to an even greater degree in January, when he revealed that Aldridge last summer became the first Spur he had ever coached to request a trade. Popovich took the blame and vowed to use Aldridge offensively in the manner he preferred after a substandard 2016-17 campaign, which had the Spurs weighing whether to trade him.\n\nBut Leonard, after finishing third and second in Most Valuable Player Award voting the past two seasons, is San Antonio\u2019s most important player. So the resultant frenzy to try to pinpoint the true source of the media-shy Leonard\u2019s supposed discontent has been nonstop, whether it is dismay with how his injury was initially diagnosed, fears that he won\u2019t be offered the most free-agent money San Antonio can give or the fact that the Spurs have done so much to mollify Aldridge.\n\nPopovich appeared to give us a window into the Spurs\u2019 frustrations on Feb. 22 when he announced that he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if Leonard returned at all before season\u2019s end. Longtime Pop watchers quickly concluded that Leonard was the sole intended audience for that announcement, which was predictably soon followed by Leonard\u2019s first interview in nearly two months. He vowed to be back as soon as possible and said (albeit not in the firmest fashion) that he wanted to stay in San Antonio for the long term.\n\nReminders of how tranquil life used to be in the Alamo City are never far away because Duncan is a frequent visitor to the team\u2019s practice facility. It\u2019s completely normal for him to drop in while his children are at school to get in a workout or to occasionally tutor the little-known Matt Costello, who is in his first season as a Spur on a two-way contract. Yet it\u2019s unreasonable to expect anyone else to operate quite the way Duncan does.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs often as those pesky pundits (yours truly included) painted the spotlight-averse Leonard as the perfect next-generation franchise player for the Spurs, let\u2019s face it: There\u2019s only one Timothy Theodore Duncan.

It\u2019s really not hard to imagine Popovich and Leonard staging their own lunch summit after the season, as Popovich and Aldridge did, to sort this all out.\n\nPoint guard Tony Parker, for one, takes comfort in the knowledge that Popovich remains the man steering the Spurs through the storm. Popovich, 69, promised Aldridge that he would stay on the bench beyond Duncan\u2019s exit as part of his free-agent pitch nearly three years ago.\n\nAnd Pop, true to his word, is still there, trying to drag a team plagued by a defensive slump, constant lineup turnover because of injuries, spotty 3-point shooting and a slew of blown fourth-quarter leads through this most un-Spurs-like season.\n\n\u201cJust one of those years so far where some things haven\u2019t gone as they have in the past,\u201d Popovich said, trying to find the most benign terms possible.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s earning his salary now,\u201d Parker said with a laugh.", "title": "San Antonio Spurs Face an Unfamiliar Opponent Down the Stretch: Discontent", "authors": ["Marc Stein", "On Pro Basketball"]}

They have denied any allegations of abuse and have portrayed the Ritz episode as an orderly legal process that has wound down.\n\nBut extensive interviews with Saudi officials, members of the royal family, and relatives, advisers and associates of the detainees revealed a murkier, coercive operation, marked by cases of physical abuse, which transferred billions of dollars in private wealth to the crown prince\u2019s control.\n\nCorruption has long been endemic in Saudi Arabia, and many of the detainees were widely assumed to have stolen from state coffers. But the government, citing privacy laws, has refused to specify the charges against individuals and, even after they were released, to clarify who was found guilty or innocent, making it impossible to know how much the process was driven by personal score settling.\n\nPart of the campaign appears to be driven by a family feud, as Crown Prince Mohammed presses the children of King Abdullah, the monarch who died in 2015, to give back billions of dollars that they consider their inheritance, according to three associates of the Abdullah family.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd although the government said the campaign would increase transparency, it has been conducted in secret, with transactions carried out in ways that avoid public disclosure, and with travel bans and fear of reprisals preventing detainees from speaking freely.\n\nMost people interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the risk of appearing to criticize Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nThe government said in its email that \u201cthe investigations, led by the Attorney General, were conducted in full accordance to Saudi laws. All those under investigation had full access to legal counsel in addition to medical care to address pre-existing, chronic conditions.\u201d\n\nThe government, and several Saudi officials contacted separately, declined to answer further questions about the crackdown.\n\nThey have argued, however, that it was a necessarily harsh means of returning ill-gotten gains to the treasury while sending a clear message that the old, corrupt ways of doing business are over. And they have defended the process as a kind of Saudi-style plea bargain in which settlements were reached to avoid the time and economic disruption of a drawn-out legal process.\n\nIn a separate statement on Sunday announcing new anti-corruption departments in the Attorney General\u2019s office, the government said that King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed \u201care keen to eradicate corruption with utmost force and transparency.\u201d\n\nBut the opaque and extralegal nature of the campaign has rattled the very foreign investors the prince is now trying to woo.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the crackdown they promised transparency, but they did not deliver it,\u201d said Robert Jordan, who served as American ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President George W.

They could watch television and order room service, but had no internet or phones.\n\nOutside, their relatives panicked, and managers of their far-flung businesses drew up contingency plans to keep operations running, unsure of how long their bosses would be gone.\n\nEventually, the detainees were allowed to reassure their families through short, monitored calls.\n\nMany were prevented from contacting their lawyers, but Prince Alwaleed spoke weekly with some of his managers, his associates said.

One person who saw the corpse of the officer, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, said that his neck was twisted unnaturally as though it had been broken, and that his body was badly bruised and distended.

In some cases, the government brought in prominent international firms to help.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed first expressed interest in buying the Arab world\u2019s largest private media company, MBC, in 2015, according to three associates of the company\u2019s leadership. Although not considered highly profitable, MBC owns a range of satellite television stations beaming shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cArabs Got Talent\u201d into millions of homes, and the company has tremendous power to sway Arab public opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNegotiations over the sale had bogged down when a team from the international accounting firm PWC arrived to vet the company\u2019s books in October.\n\nThe company\u2019s owners and most of its board were arrested and detained on Nov. 4. Four days later, PWC\u2019s accountants visited the company\u2019s headquarters in Dubai to finish their report, according to two professionals with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nThen a second foreign firm, the British law firm Clifford Chance, drew up the paperwork to transfer the company\u2019s ownership, according to three professionals with knowledge of the deal.\n\nNeither firm publicly raised any concerns that the sellers had been detained by the buyer.\n\nA spokesman for Clifford Chance declined to comment, but one Clifford Chance lawyer involved in the work sought to distance the firm from the crackdown, saying its lawyers were retained after the detentions began and learned about them only from the news media.\n\nOne PWC accountant involved in the MBC valuation declined to comment. But another executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of client confidentiality rules, said PWC had played no role in helping the kingdom track the assets of those accused of corruption.\n\nNo set code of ethics governs the conduct of accounting and consulting firms in international cases but Western firms like PWC typically preach the virtues of predictable rules, transparent procedures and open markets, not state seizures of private assets.\n\nBritish law firms like Clifford Chance are subject to Britain\u2019s legal ethics code, which requires solicitors to uphold \u201cthe rule of law and the common administration of justice.\u201d\n\nStephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, said lawyers would not be penalized as long as they adhered to local laws \u2014 in this case, those set by the Saudi monarch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLawyers take the position that so long as they comply with the law in the nation in which they are representing their clients, they\u2019re acting ethically, even if the same conduct would be illegal or unethical in their home country,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nStill, he said, \u201clawyers can decline to assist conduct that they find morally objectionable even if it is entirely legal.\u201d\n\nWaleed al-Ibrahim, MBC\u2019s chairman, was released from the Ritz in late January, but has yet to return to Dubai, despite promises to his staff. In recent weeks, MBC representatives have met with Clifford Chance lawyers to finalize an agreement that will leave Mr. Ibrahim with 40 percent of the company, likely paving the way for his ouster as director, according to two professionals with knowledge of the deal.\n\nBut the company\u2019s programing has already changed. This month, it canceled six popular Turkish drama series, costing the company about $25 million, according to professionals familiar with the company\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Saudi government is at odds with Turkey over its ties with Qatar, which Saudi Arabia and its allies are boycotting. The professionals said the order came from a senior Saudi official close to Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Haul\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s public prosecutor said in January that the government had reached settlements worth $106 billion, and other officials have said they expect the process to yield $13 billion in cash by the end of 2018.\n\nBut separating those two figures is the fact that relatively little cash was seized, either because the detainees did not keep large sums in Saudi banks or because they hid their cash abroad, where the government could not take it without a substantive legal process. There have been no clear indications that the government seized any foreign investments in the kingdom, nor succeeded in taking Saudi assets held abroad.\n\nMost of the seized assets, according to financial advisers and associates of the detainees, were domestic real estate and shares of companies, which the government is expected to liquidate over time, a process that could take years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCiting privacy laws, the government has given no information on what was taken from whom, but interviews with associates of the former detainees have filled in some details.\n\nThe government has taken management control of Saudi Binladen Group, the construction giant founded by Osama bin Laden\u2019s father that for decades has served as the royal family\u2019s go-to contractor. Its chairman, Bakr Binladen, remains detained, and his relatives have lost much of their private wealth.\n\nLarge sums and pieces of land have been taken from Mohammed al-Tobaishi, the former head of protocol of the royal court; Fawaz Alhokair, a retail tycoon; Khalid al-Tuwaijery, a former chief of the royal court; Adel Fakieh, a former government minister who helped Prince Mohammed develop his reform plans; and Amr Dabbagh, the former head of the government body that oversees foreign investment.\n\nPhoto\n\nRoyal Rivalry\n\nOne target is the wealth of the offspring of King Abdullah, the previous monarch. They were seen as potential rivals for the Saudi throne and since Salman became king in 2015, he and the crown prince have moved to sideline them.\n\nOne of Abdullah\u2019s sons, Prince Turki, was removed from his post as the governor of Riyadh in 2015, while another, Prince Mutaib, was dismissed as the head of the National Guard in November. Both men, and a number of their brothers, were detained in the Ritz.\n\nKing Abdullah left tens of billions of dollars in the Abdullah Foundation, which was meant to finance projects in the king\u2019s name while also serving as a piggy bank for his heirs, according to three associates of his family. After he died in 2015, the foundation paid out billions of dollars to his more than 30 children, about $340 million to each son and $200 million to each daughter.\n\nThe crown prince is seeking to recover that money, which he believes was taken illegally from a charity, according to people familiar with the negotiations. King Abdullah\u2019s children, however, consider it their inheritance.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s administrator is Prince Turki, whose aide, General Qahtani, died in custody. Prince Turki is still detained and most of his siblings and their families are banned from traveling outside the kingdom. Others are abroad in London and elsewhere, afraid to return to the kingdom that their father recently ruled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to one relative and two associates of the Abdullah family, his children are allowed to withdraw $26,000 per week each from their accounts to cover their expenses.\n\nThe government said in January that 56 people are still being held because of \u201cpending criminal cases\u201d and will be put on trial.

Many scholars believe it to have been a Jewish response to the massacres of Jews of the Rhineland during the Crusades. Others have posited, based on a story about Rabbi Akiva, a leading second-century scholar, that the Kaddish was a response to the Christian concept of purgatory, and is intended as a plea to God to mitigate the eternal punishment of the deceased.\n\nWhatever its origins, the text of the prayer leaves me cold. Each day as I say the Kaddish, I struggle with the fact that I am praising a God who, according to Jewish tradition, created the world \u201caccording to His Will.\u201d Does God really will that the world endure the cruelty and suffering we see so often? And, on a more personal level, did God will that my father, an intellectual who suffered from dementia, would lose the ability to communicate and have the mental faculties of a 5-year-old during his last 18 months on earth?\n\nThe Kaddish is hardly the only prayer that troubles me. Take the 145th Psalm, which I say every day as an observant Jew. It proclaims that \u201cGod protects all those who love God, but will destroy all the wicked?\u201d Really? Do I honestly believe that\u2019s a true reflection of God or our universe?", "title": "Opinion | Saying a Prayer I Don\u2019t Believe In", "authors": []}

In the case of the air pollution studies, a rigorous follow-up examination was done by the Health Effects Institute, a nonprofit research group that studies air pollution.

And should Mr. Pruitt reconsider regulations now in place, this new policy could be a catalyst for the unraveling of existing public health protections if the studies used to justify them could no longer be used by E.P.A.\n\nSo why would he want to prohibit his own agency from using these studies? It\u2019s not a mystery. Time and again the Trump administration has put the profits of regulated industries over the health of the American people.

My left leg was stupid, lazy. I really had to concentrate to use it.\u201d\n\nIt was an early inkling of the tumor and the end of his dancing career. He was 30.\n\nOwen Sean Lavery was born on Aug. 16, 1956, in Harrisburg, Pa. His father, Eugene, was a supervisor at Bell Telephone, and his mother, the former Rose A. Flood, was a homemaker.\n\nHe began his ballet training at 10. He studied at the Pennsylvania Ballet School and, in 1973, joined the San Francisco Ballet. In 1975, he joined the Frankfurt Opera Ballet in Germany. The next year, he began taking classes at City Ballet\u2019s School of American Ballet. He was invited to join the company in 1977 and quickly became a reliable presence with his suave, solid partnering.\n\n\u201cMr. Lavery continues to impress with his forthright virtuosity,\u201d the dance writer Don McDonagh wrote in The Times in June of that year, and two days later, reviewing another performance for the paper, Clive Barnes said of him, \u201cA newcomer this season, he seems a very sound cavalier.\u201d\n\nMr. Lavery was promoted to soloist in early 1978 and later that year made a principal dancer. Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Mr. Martins all created roles for him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHis size, his proportions, are quite wonderful,\u201d Robbins once said of him, adding that \u201che has a very elegant line, but it is a very human line \u2014 never so aesthetic that the ability, strength and the vigor of the man are ever lost.\u201d\n\nThe company put his abilities to good use; sometimes he was featured in all eight performances a week. The spinal tumor, though, cut his career short. In January 1987 he underwent an eight-hour surgery to remove it.\n\nMany fans had not known why he suddenly disappeared from City Ballet\u2019s programs, but in November 1987 The New York Times Magazine chronicled his operation and slow rehabilitation. \u201cA Dancer\u2019s Nightmare,\u201d the article was titled.\n\nAfter the surgery, Mr. Lavery said, he could not feel his leg at first. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where it was unless I looked at it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe began intensive therapy and, barely a month after his surgery, insisted on attending a matinee at City Ballet, using a walker and accompanied by Marika Molnar, the company\u2019s physical therapist.\n\n\u201cMarika and I forgot that I hadn\u2019t learned how to do stairs on the walker yet,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe took a car to the theater, went in backstage, got to the stairs, looked at each other and burst out laughing. But she just told me what to do, step by step, and I did it.\u201d\n\nHe eventually recovered enough that he could teach dance, which he did at City Ballet and at Barnard College.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Alsedek, Mr. Lavery is survived by another sister, Patrice Lavery, and a brother, Michael.\n\nMr. Lavery retired from City Ballet several years ago.

What is this book-shaped thing that lies before us? Is it just a lark \u2014 a nutty novel you wrote because you\u2019re famous and they let you? Or is it more than that \u2014 a furious, despairing takedown of America as the country battles its own worst instincts? If it\u2019s the latter, why did you bury your truest feelings and loveliest writing so deep in muck? \u201cBob Honey Who Just Do Stuff\u201d might have had the power of a manifesto. Instead, it\u2019s a riddle wrapped in an enigma and cloaked in crazy.\n\nPenn originally created \u201cBob Honey\u201d for a short audiobook in 2016, which he narrated but playfully denied writing, insisting it was the work of a guy he\u2019d met in Florida named Pappy Pariah. Bob is a 56-year-old Californian with \u201can ultraviolent skepticism toward the messaging and mediocrity of modern times.\u201d Profession-wise, he is one of the following or some combination thereof: a globe-trotting entrepreneur, a contract killer who murders elderly people with a mallet or just a delusional homebody whose neighbors think he\u2019s weird.\n\nUnwaveringly true to its title, \u201cBob Honey Who Just Do Stuff\u201d has no formal plot. Our antihero sits on his sofa recalling possibly imaginary exploits and lamenting the state of the nation, which he regards as \u201ca shopping mall with a flag.\u201d He loathes his ex-wife, who\u2019s now happily coupled with her divorce lawyer and driving an ice-cream truck, the twinkly music of which punishes him from a distance. He pines for a sex-positive young woman named Annie, who may or may not exist and who inspires such purple rain as this: \u201cEffervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOccasionally, Bob will attempt to be more social by throwing a misbegotten barbecue \u2014 or he\u2019ll go out and dispatch a senior citizen with a blow to the head. (The folks who issue the kill orders believe the elderly stand in the way of marketing and globalization.) What narrative tension \u201cBob Honey\u201d does have comes courtesy of a man claiming to be an investigative journalist who shows up at Bob\u2019s door and, as Penn might put it, punctures his peace and piques his paranoia. If that sounds like an unfair swipe at the prose, take a look: \u201cThere is pride to be had where the prejudicial is practiced with precision in the trenchant triage of tactile terminations.\u201d That\u2019s a sentence about hunting, by the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo be fair, \u201cBob Honey\u201d is perplexing and unquantifiable by design. Penn has clearly ingested the Beats, as well as Hunter S. Thompson and Chuck Palahniuk, and he evokes their trippiness to advance a sincere argument: that right now, America is enough to drive any rational, empathetic person nuts. Some of Bob\u2019s adventures \u2014 helping victims of Hurricane Katrina, nosing around Baghdad at the outset of the Iraq War \u2014 overlap with the author\u2019s own habit of following his conscience and not waiting for invitations.

You need time to discover, to reflect, to have a conversation with a stranger. In my experience, that\u2019s when something really special can happen. Also, under-scheduling gives our minds a break from the regular grind. Slowing down can be really restorative and that\u2019s one of the many reasons that we travel.\n\nImage Sara Clemence. Credit Britney Young\n\nWhat are your tips for meeting people while traveling?\n\nStarting a conversation with a total stranger is challenging whether you\u2019re traveling or not. It really helps to ask a question. One of my favorite ways to start an actual conversation with somebody is to ask about food because so many people really like to give their opinions about food. So, ask them where they like to eat. There\u2019s a fine distinction between asking, where should I eat \u2014 I being the tourist \u2014 and where do you like to eat. Sometimes people will give a tourist-friendly place. But if you ask where they like to eat, it\u2019s more likely to yield a local, interesting restaurant or food stall or market.\n\nYou advise leaving the camera at home to focus on the experience. Is there some way to shoot and be mindful?\n\nIt can really help to be more thoughtful about how you use your camera. Say you\u2019re only going to take three photos a day or only photograph certain kinds of things. Photographers say everybody needs to be taking fewer better photographs. It has a dual effect. One, it makes you more thoughtful about what photographs you\u2019re taking and it also removes the temptation to photograph everything.\n\nHow can families practice mindfulness while traveling?\n\nLetting your kids help plan your travels is a big one, because then it becomes a team effort. They\u2019re invested in what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s important to set limits on devices just as you set limits on yourself. When your kids start getting bored, it can be really hard not to rush to fill their time with some sort of activity. It\u2019s perfectly healthy for children to be bored. When we were traveling for six months last year, my 5-year-old son started making toys out of whatever materials we had at hand. He would make a house out of tissue box, or he\u2019d make a bottle into an airplane. It made me feel we were accidentally enhancing his resourcefulness.", "title": "Secret to a Great Trip: Ditch the Devices", "authors": []}

Democrats have also wooed Brandon Presley, a cousin to Elvis Presley and the chairman of the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, to run for the Senate.\n\nMike Espy, a former Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said late Monday that he would consider running for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat.\n\nMr. Espy, who is African-American and from a prominent Delta family, could be a formidable candidate in a state where black voters make up much of the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats are watching which race Mr. McDaniel chooses, hoping to put their most formidable candidate against the state senator.\n\nMr. Cochran has been a genteel presence in the Senate for decades, but in recent years his physical decline has become apparent. On Monday, as the Senate voted on two judicial nominations, he was guided into the chamber by aides and was silent as reporters peppered him with questions.\n\nHis decision to leave opens up the coveted chairman\u2019s spot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where leadership is determined by seniority. The senator next in line is Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Asked if he wants the job, Mr. Shelby said, \u201cIt would be a great honor, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d and added, \u201cI would be interested at the proper time.\u201d\n\nLongtime members of the Senate said they were sorry to see Mr. Cochran go. \u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d said Senator Patrick J.

But by a vote of 55 to 44, the measure was ultimately referred back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for further debate without a final vote.\n\nIn a show of opposition, the Trump administration sent Pentagon and State Department officials to Capitol Hill last week to make the case in a classified briefing that the measure was misguided and could do lasting damage to the United States\u2019 relationship with a key Arab ally, Saudi Arabia. Tuesday\u2019s debate played out as President Trump met with the influential young Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, at the White House.\n\nTrump administration officials insist that American involvement in Yemen has been limited to noncombat support like intelligence sharing, logistics and military advice \u2014 and therefore is technically out of the senators\u2019 reach.

Whether the increased scrutiny that comes with being the only remaining investigation on Capitol Hill will change that remains unclear.\n\nIn a show of bipartisan resolve, nearly every member of the committee took part in Tuesday\u2019s announcement and those who spoke endorsed the committee\u2019s findings.\n\nThe committee\u2019s leaders had last updated the public on the investigation in October, when they said that a review had broadly confirmed the conclusions of American spy agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "I was determined to prove they could. That meant fighting many decades of opposition to having women in front-line combat roles. This was especially true in the Marine Corps, where we say, \u201cEvery Marine a rifleman.\u201d Those riflemen are the infantry troops who put themselves in the paths of bullets and bombs while carrying heavy rucksacks, who jump out of planes and otherwise subject their bodies to extreme wear and tear.\n\nUntil recently, women had been officially excluded from the infantry, even as they unofficially served in combat jobs \u2014 going on patrols as military police or medics, or getting caught in ambushes while driving in convoys. This all changed when the Defense Department required that by 2016 all military occupations, including the infantry, be opened to women.\n\nThe Marines were the only service to request a waiver to not integrate women into some combat positions. The Pentagon rejected that request, but statistics suggest the corps has dragged its feet. About 500 Army women serve in combat jobs, 10 have graduated from the elite Ranger school, and 74 have graduated from the infantry or armor basic leader\u2019s course. They have met the same exacting standards \u2014 for push-ups, speed and the weight they carry in their packs \u2014 as the men. But only 11 female Marines have made it into the infantry. And only one woman has made it through the punishing Marine infantry officer course.\n\nThe Marine Corps has taken some steps. It recently introduced women to Marine Combat Training at Camp Pendleton, Calif., which had been all male, and brought in male drill instructors to train female recruits at Parris Island. The Marine Corps says that where schedules permit, men and women sometimes train side by side in boot camp. But that is a far cry from full integration, where men and women compete against each other, work through problems together and learn to respect each other as teammates \u2014 all the things that happen in combat.\n\nIn the Marine Corps, the perception that women can\u2019t do some things as well as men quickly becomes reality, because of how we conduct entry-level training. For officers, it starts with little comments at the Basic School for new officers (which is gender integrated). At my own training, I heard comments like \u201cStay with your teams \u2014 make sure the females make it over the walls in the obstacle course.\u201d And \u201cWe\u2019re running fast this morning, so the women will be falling out.\u201d\n\nI went to Parris Island feeling like we could change the dynamic for women. That\u2019s the funny thing about recruits: They don\u2019t know any better. If you teach them \u2014 that shooting is all about breathing, that running fast is all about training, that ruck marches are all about mind-set \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do.\n\nAt Fourth Battalion, I heard the shooting coaches tell women that their arms were too short to shoot well. The slowest woman in the platoon set the pace for runs. I mapped out the hikes and discovered that they had been improperly measured, which meant that women hiked fewer miles than they were supposed to. They weren\u2019t being taught to stretch properly or were trained to build up their strength to avoid injuries. Those were fixable problems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore I arrived, between 67 percent and 78 percent of Fourth Battalion had qualified in marksmanship during their initial tests on the rifle range. The male units qualified at between 85 percent and 93 percent. The following year, we raised the women\u2019s weapons qualification rate to 92 percent. Our injury rate for women went down to a rate comparable with the men\u2019s when we instituted better strength training. And women ran faster when we placed them in groups based on ability.\n\nBut the Marine Corps didn\u2019t seem interested in building on what I had learned. I wrote an article for Marine Corps Gazette in 2015 outlining our changes and our success. It was killed after I was pushed out for my \u201ctoxic\u201d leadership. I felt that my immediate boss thought I was changing the status quo and, frankly, simply didn\u2019t like me. There was no mentoring. I was never written up for not following an order.\n\nThe things I saw in the Marine Corps raised questions that the #MeToo movement would later bring center stage. If a female Marine is seen as a weak link, based on stereotypes first bred at boot camp, why would anyone believe her if she reported an assault? With so few women in the Marine Corps \u2014 about 8 percent \u2014 what are the chances that someone in power will stop women from being pushed into clerical positions when they were trained to be medics, electricians or mechanics? If women start at a disadvantage because of segregated and unequal training, how can they catch up? And how will they escape the false double-binds of \u201cI only got this job because I\u2019m a woman\u201d or \u201cI have to act like a man to be respected\u201d?\n\nI want Congress to understand that there is still no such thing as separate but equal. And I desperately want female Marines to understand just how capable and competitive they can be. What might the possibilities be for the military if women were allowed to compete and lead?\n\nIf blatant sexism continues, we may never find out. Why would parents encourage a smart, talented daughter to join the Marine Corps if the first thing she would encounter is the message that she\u2019s simply not good enough?\n\nThis must change, not only because our military services are struggling to fill slots since so few Americans are willing or fit enough to serve, but also because future generations will not stand for it. The definition of female strength continues to change, redefined by CrossFit gyms and extraordinary female endurance athletes. Yet the Marine Corps continues to insist that women can\u2019t train with men.\n\nIt\u2019s silly. It\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s time to lead.", "title": "Separate Is Not Equal in the Marine Corps", "authors": ["Kate Germano"]}

When Serena, now 36, took the court on Monday night, she did so as a new mother, while Venus, 37, walked out as a new aunt \u2014 and as the favorite, which has not been her customary role as this increasingly lopsided rivalry has evolved.\n\nSerena is the one with 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one short of the record held by Margaret Court. Venus has had to make do with a very respectable seven, although she twice came close to an eighth during her resurgent 2017 season, when she reached the finals of the Australian Open and Wimbledon.\n\nSerena, as so often, played the spoiler on one of those occasions, defeating her in Australia when, unbeknown to the general public, she was already two months pregnant.\n\nShe did not play again for the rest of 2017, giving birth to a daughter, Olympia, in September, recovering from traumatic postnatal medical issues and then marrying Alexis Ohanian in November, before resuming training in earnest.\n\nThis was the first singles tournament of her comeback, and though it showed, she was hardly far off the pace, winning two matches and then giving Venus cause for concern as she tried to close her out.\n\n\u201cI just feel it\u2019s never over until it\u2019s over, and she just came right back,\u201d said Venus, who faltered in her first attempt to serve out her victory at 5-2 in the second set. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just lucky I played more matches than her right now.\u201d\n\nSerena still leads their sibling rivalry, 17-12, and has won eight of their last 10 matches.

And in a much clearer indicator of Serena\u2019s rust, Venus also won 52 percent of her second-serve points, despite struggling to generate depth and pace on many of those second serves.\n\nIn peak form, Serena would have pounced on them repeatedly.

In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency.\n\nThey will face stark choices. One is to apply legal principles established in a case that mostly protected immigrants to one that seeks to imperil them. Another is to revise those principles in light of the very different circumstances.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said history was repeating itself, but backward.\n\n\u201cThe suit is modeled on the Obama administration\u2019s successful suit against Arizona,\u201d he said. But he added that \u201csome of the key considerations are flipped.\u201d\n\nIn the Arizona case, conservatives insisted that respect for state sovereignty required letting states play a leading role in controlling immigration within their borders.

One restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officials. A second generally prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are to be released from state custody. A third requires state officials to inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal government.\n\nJennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the state laws had been carefully written to avoid direct conflicts with federal immigration laws. \u201cI think it is clear that California deliberately tried to draft laws that involved core exercises of state police power in a way that did not run afoul of federal law,\u201d she said.\n\nEach state law presents different issues, and courts may give varying answers depending on how directly the state laws conflict with federal ones. More generally, though, courts will take account of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case, which called for collaboration rather than conflict.\n\n\u201cConsultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote in the court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has said that consultation is fine but that federal officials should not use California\u2019s resources to pursue undocumented Californians.

In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions denied that anything like that was afoot.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are not asking California, Oakland or anyone else to enforce immigration laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions to stop actively obstructing federal law enforcement,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Professor Rodriguez said the commandeering issue was a substantial one. \u201cTo the extent the Trump administration\u2019s claims against California would produce an outcome that would effectively force states and localities to participate in immigration enforcement,\u201d she said, \u201cthere could be an unconstitutional commandeering.\u201d\n\nProfessor Spiro said that California may have the upper hand in the suit\u2019s early stages, as the issues in it are novel, leaving judges with substantial discretion.\n\nThe Trump administration has not fared well in federal courts in California in other cases concerning immigration, including ones challenging President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to rescind a program protecting some 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation.\n\nBut the ultimate fate of the suit will probably rest with the Supreme Court. In 2012, with what may have been unwarranted optimism, Justice Kennedy said he hoped that conflicts over immigration policy would be worked out through reasoned discussion.\n\n\u201cThe national government has significant power to regulate immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation\u2019s meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.\u201d", "title": "Sessions Targets California Immigrants Using a Ruling That Protected Them", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"]}

During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening the courthouse doors,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.\n\nBut over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that \u201cacknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims\u2019 trafficking\u201d but were \u201cpowerless to act,\u201d Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.\n\nThe liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet.

Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: \u201cThe big guys can take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.\n\nDozens of victims\u2019 advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,\u201d said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims\u2019 rights. \u201cThey will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.\u201d", "title": "Sex Trafficking Bill Heads to Trump, Over Silicon Valley Concerns", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang", "Sheryl Gay Stolberg"]}
{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "The title of Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s new collection of stories, \u201cBeautiful Days,\u201d is drawn from \u201cLes Beaux Jours,\u201d a painting by Balthus of a girl reclining in a chair and examining herself in a hand mirror, while a faceless man tends the fireplace behind her. But it might equally refer to \u201cFleuve Blue\u201d or \u201cBig Burnt,\u201d the first two stories in the book \u2014 which are about (among other things) the strange disconnection that separates our romantic lives from the rest of life. \u201cFleuve Blue\u201d describes an affair between a prominent small-town lawyer and a younger woman, whom he first sees walking across a bridge. He thinks, \u201cI will marry her. That one.\u201d Except, of course, he\u2019s already married. Later, he offers her a ride when she gets caught wearing high heels in a downpour and they start meeting in the afternoon in a rented room. \u201cShe told him it would be the inside-out of the rest of her life, her relationship with him. \u2026 She meant, what they had together was a counter-world. \u2026 \u2018Because I\u2019m always lying. In that other life. In my \u201creal\u201d life. I tell people \u2014 I tell myself \u2014 \u201cI live for my children. I adore my children.\u201d\u2019 \u201d Unsurprisingly, their affair turns out to be susceptible to the same sort of forces that she wants to escape in her real life \u2014 boredom and the passage of time.\n\nBut it\u2019s the lying, or deception, or really just the uncertainty about other people that dominates the rest of this collection. A woman desperate for marriage spends a weekend with a guy she used to date who hasn\u2019t always been particularly nice to her. She doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s tying up loose ends before killing himself, and afterward she has to deal with the puzzle of his intentions. Even years of shared life fail to produce real intimacy. Parents are just as untrustworthy as lovers. In \u201cOwl Eyes,\u201d a geeky kid at a math camp runs into a professor who tells him a story about how he used to be involved with the boy\u2019s mother \u2014 that he used to be a father to the boy himself. Vague memories come back to the boy, but it\u2019s hard to tell if they offer doubt or hope.\n\nImage\n\nIn general, Oates is dealing here with the academic world \u2014 professors and their kids, editors, writers, adjuncts \u2014 people who live in the provinces, on the outskirts of real success. Characters are often referred to by titles rather than names: mother, daddy, wife, husband, professor. \u201cExcept You Bless Me,\u201d one of the standouts in a very strong collection, recounts an early incident in a woman\u2019s teaching career. She has become convinced that a black student in her class \u2014 one she\u2019s been trying to help \u2014 has been sending her racist hate messages. Is the professor unusually patient and conscientious or completely delusional and possibly racist herself?\n\nSlowly the realism of the collection gives way to stories that are more experimental. Oates is a master of many different kinds of story, including the gothic and something like science fiction \u2014 \u201cFractal,\u201d for example, and the extraordinary \u201cUndocumented Alien,\u201d which follows a Nigerian man tricked into applying for a bogus degree at a New Jersey engineering college. Eventually, to stop himself from being deported, he agrees to take part in a secret government experiment designed to test the extent to which people can be denatured. The power of the conceit, of course, comes from the fact that this is happening anyway.", "title": "Sex, Lies and Subterfuge Roil Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s New Story Collection", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Starting an independent bookstore in a borough with few book-buying options might seem like a giant leap of faith, but for Ms. Santos of The Lit Bar, it\u2019s the culmination of a dream begun three years ago when she learned that the local Barnes & Noble would close. \u201cBeing an avid reader, that spoke to me on personal level,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I appreciated Barnes & Noble when it was there, you would never know that you were in the Bronx. It didn\u2019t offer a lot of opportunities for the community. If you were a local author, good luck in getting your book on the shelf. But with an independent store, you can feel the energy of the neighborhood reflected in the choices. I couldn\u2019t think of a better way for people to engage and become real neighbors.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between surviving and thriving for some indies. \u201cThriving is a tough word,\u201d said Christine Onorati of Word in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (with a branch in Jersey City). \u201cWe have people who are unbelievably loyal to us, and we\u2019re digging in, trying to make our mark, but it\u2019s a tough business.\u201d Rent is a challenge for many. Miles Bellamy opened Spoonbill and Sugartown in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood almost 19 years ago, long before there was a Whole Foods and an Apple store, but he recently saw his rent almost double, to $14,500 a month from $8,000 a month.\n\n\u201cJust as I go to both the local drugstore and Duane Reade, book lovers can support my store and buy books online,\u201d Mr. Bellamy said. \u201cI feel like a better person when I go into the small store. But the pressure is constant. It\u2019s a full-time hustle.\u201d\n\nThere is an opportunity for certain industries to reinvent themselves after a large shock in their business model or in technology, according to Ryan L. Raffaelli, assistant professor at Harvard Business School, who has been studying independent bookstores for about five years. (He even took a course in how to open one.) \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that the indies are able to compete on several dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is community. They championed the notion of \u2018shop local\u2019 and \u2018Small Business Saturday.\u2019 Another is curation: They\u2019re not just offering best-sellers but diamonds in the rough. They\u2019ve taken back a sense of pride in what they can provide: a deeper and ongoing relationship with their customers. In high-rent districts, because profit margins are relatively thin, success must come from multiple repeat customers, so that the customer can\u2019t imagine not visiting as part of his or her monthly routine. They\u2019re also flirting with adapting newer forms of technology.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Mr. Neller is banking on. Each of the planned new Shakespeare and Company stores will have an Espresso Book Machine (Mr. Neller is also head of the manufacturer, On Demand Books) that has the potential to print and bind any book not on the shelves while you\u2019re having a cappuccino at the store\u2019s cafe. (Since Mr. Neller is the former chief executive of Dean & DeLuca, the new stores will definitely have baristas and snacks.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a renaissance,\u201d he said, \u201ca new permutation that will have elements of the mom-and-pop blended with technology, allowing a store to have a practically infinite selection in a small setting. We\u2019ll take a digital file and convert it into an analog product, putting the warehouse inside a small footprint. That\u2019s transformative.\u201d It\u2019s almost like a new happy ending to \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d\n\nSomewhere, Nora is smiling.", "title": "Shakespeare and Company Is Coming Back to the West Side and the Village", "authors": []}

Lopez, the city\u2019s mayor, a diabetic who beat back dialysis by walking three miles a day and changing his preferred diet of fried pork rinds, pulled pork carnitas and at least 10 flour tortillas a day, he said. \u201cThe men love soccer big time,\u201d he added. \u201cWe needed something for the ladies.\u201d\n\nShared use agreements have been proliferating over the past decade, spurred by obesity and other chronic diseases, diminishing green space, and new research that links health to the man-made environment, said Jeff Vincent, deputy director for the Center for Cities and Schools at the University of California, Berkeley. The C.D.C.\u2019s recommended 60 minutes a day of physical activity for children and adolescents has also inspired schools to think beyond physical education.\n\nAlthough nobody tracks exact numbers, a 2012 survey by the C.D.C. found that out of 630 school districts that responded, 61 percent reported some form of shared use, with large Western urban school districts the most enthusiastic adopters. Promoting community health and other programs through shared use \u201cmay be an untapped resource\u201d for schools, the survey suggested.\n\nNevertheless, making it happen isn\u2019t always easy. The story of the Burroughs Elementary School in Fresno, where a group of parents rallied to the shared use cause only to see their efforts shelved after a yearlong pilot program, is a cautionary tale, albeit one with a happy ending.\n\nSusana Cruz, a 36-year-old mother of three, started a campaign to unlock the gates after school and on weekends because the closest park for children in southeastern Fresno, an area of concentrated poverty, was more than two miles away. Neighborhood children would routinely jump the school fence to play basketball or climb on the monkey bars. \u201cSome parks were not well maintained and unsafe for our children to go to,\u201d Cruz recalled. \u201cHaving the school gates unlocked was an immediate solution to our needs and one that we felt safe using.\u201d\n\nThe parents, all volunteers, made an informal arrangement with the school in which each adult took responsibility for a specific time slot to monitor the playground, passing the key back and forth. But reports of vandalism and the difficulty of handing off the key caused the school district to pull the plug. \u201cThat was frustrating,\u201d said Carlos Castillo, Burroughs\u2019s principal at the time. \u201cWe wanted this to be a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe pilot ended, but the idea stuck. Six years later, shared use has been embraced big time by Fresno, which was eager to escape its ranking as one of the nation\u2019s most park-poor cities. While the Burroughs pilot was based on an informal agreement with parents, the city initiative involved an investment of $1.2 million to open up playgrounds and other green spaces at 16 school sites on weekends; those spaces now offer organized fitness, sports, yoga and nutrition classes led by student-mentors from Fresno State University alongside grassy fields for picnicking and other activities. The partnership has been so successful that last summer, seven high school pools were opened up to public use and \u2014 no shock here \u2014 they were packed all season long.\n\nHistorically, the biggest hurdle to shared use, especially for schools, is concern over liability, which frequently becomes \u201ca nine-letter word for \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Winig said. Yet schools, he noted, are already under a legal obligation to safely maintain playground equipment and other facilities. \u201cA school doesn\u2019t suddenly become unsafe when the school bell rings,\u201d he pointed out. All states have laws that either fully or partly protect school districts from liability based on a negligence claims, he added.", "title": "Opinion | Sharing Public Spaces to Improve Public Health", "authors": []}

In it she confesses, \u201cI\u2019ve sinned a sin of pleasure / beside a body trembling and spent.\u201d She doesn\u2019t hide behind metaphor, and she isn\u2019t the meek beloved of the old poems. She acts on her own desires. When she pines, it isn\u2019t for a romantic savior but for a body. Tehran is scandalized.\n\nFarrokhzad was Iran\u2019s most celebrated \u2014 and controversial \u2014 female poet, and Darznik, the Iranian-born author of the memoir \u201cThe Good Daughter,\u201d recreates her sexual and creative liberation while exploring the threat she posed to social order in prerevolutionary Iran. By the year of Farrokhzad\u2019s debut, the \u201cNew Poetry\u201d of Nima Yooshij and Ahmad Shamlou \u2014 both men \u2014 had made Iranian verse more accessible, freer in form and subject matter. But critics instantly denounced Farrokhzad as a silly girl, dismissing her work as an outgrowth of the national fascination with the hedonistic West, a trend Tehrani intellectuals called \u201cWestoxification.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFarrokhzad was defiant, in life and in Darznik\u2019s fiction: \u201cBy writing in a woman\u2019s voice I wanted to say that a woman, too, is a human being. To say that we, too, have the right to breathe, to cry out and to sing.\u201d By the 1960s, she had come to represent Iran\u2019s New Woman. At once loved and hated, she was a literary sensation and an acclaimed filmmaker, who demanded that female desires, expressed in plain language, be given the weight of serious literature. Male poets had been writing breathlessly about women for centuries \u2014 why should the reverse be any less palatable?\n\nPhoto\n\nDarznik follows Farrokhzad\u2019s turbulent life from her abusive childhood \u2014 including a virginity check that turns violent \u2014 through her oppressive teenage marriage, motherhood, literary career and early death in a car crash in 1967. Her version is superbly dramatized and, with its cast of spineless lovers and hymen-breaking villainesses, a very Iranian tale, every scene designed to stir up fury or longing. Yet Darznik has composed her novel for Western ears, in elegantly simple language. She resists Persian flourishes in both her prose and her translations of Farrokhzad\u2019s work; I question whether the poet would recognize herself in Darznik\u2019s voice, compelling as it is. And here is a larger problem of poetic translation: How do you capture a language as floral and breathy as Farsi without access to its unique sounds? In Farrokhzad\u2019s poetry, each sigh carries meaning.\n\nPerhaps to replace these lost sounds, and to remind us that these events are happening far away, Darznik peppers her novel with everyday Farsi words. A hammam or a ta\u2019arof here and there is to be expected. But ordinary words like \u201cforeigner,\u201d \u201cfilthy,\u201d \u201cbride,\u201d \u201cbroken\u201d and even \u201cyes\u201d appear in Farsi every few pages, only to be translated in the next phrase or sentence; these are markers of casual exoticism, the American cousin of Westoxification. They don\u2019t capture the true sound of Farsi, its soft, easy rhythms, its heavy-hearted notes, often so grating to Western readers.\n\nNear the end of the novel, Farrokhzad evokes the charged political atmosphere on the eve of the revolution: \u201cWe bought plastic roses and decorated our lawns and courtyards with plaster swans. We saw the future in neon lights \u2026. Still our country wasn\u2019t our own.\u201d Today few Iranian women would say that their country is their own. They still argue about Farrokhzad. \u201cShe opened the tongues of women,\u201d they say, and it\u2019s not clear whether this is intended as a compliment. \u201cEvery poem I\u2019d ever written was entangled with my country\u2019s story,\u201d the Farrokhzad of Darznik\u2019s imagination says. \u201cI loved its downtrodden, small-minded, generous people. I loved them; I belonged to them.\u201d \u201cSong of a Captive Bird\u201d is a complex and beautiful rendering of that vanished country and its scattered people; a reminder of the power and purpose of art; and an ode to female creativity under a patriarchy that repeatedly tries to snuff it out.", "title": "She Dared to Write Poetry About Sex.

But one could make the case that the divide has never consumed us as much as it does today. The political parties are aligned more than ever around blue metropolises and red spaces in between. Economic growth is now so glaringly concentrated in certain urban areas that it has reignited the age-old debate over staying vs. going. Should the young and ambitious from struggling small towns and cities be encouraged to seek their fortune in the hotbeds of dynamism and overpriced Sunday brunch, or does this only sunder family ties and hasten the collapse of the interior?\n\nIt was this dilemma that helped make J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d a runaway best seller in 2016 \u2014 the tale of a young man who\u2019d overcome the dysfunctions of his transplanted Appalachian family to ascend to the Ivy League and Silicon Valley, with plenty of culture shocks along the way. Yet Tara Westover\u2019s new tale of escape, \u201cEducated,\u201d makes Vance\u2019s seem tame by comparison. Where Vance wrote affectingly of showing up at Ohio State and Yale Law with the limited preparation provided by his middling schools in Middletown, Ohio, Westover describes showing up in college with no schooling at all. Where Vance describes a family contending with the all-too-common burdens of substance abuse, Westover lays bare a family cursed by ideological mania and outlandish physical trauma. If Vance\u2019s memoir offered street-heroin-grade drama, Westover\u2019s is carfentanil, the stuff that tranquilizes elephants.\n\nThe extremity of Westover\u2019s upbringing emerges gradually through her telling, which only makes the telling more alluring and harrowing. The basics are these: Now in her early 30s, she was the youngest of seven in a survivalist family in the shadow of a mountain in a Mormon pocket of southeastern Idaho. Her father, Gene (a pseudonym), grew up on a farm at the base of the mountain, the son of a hot-tempered father, and moved up the slope with his wife, the product of a more genteel upbringing in the nearby small town. Gene sustained his growing family by building barns and hay sheds and by scrapping metal in his junkyard; his wife, Faye (also a pseudonym), chipped in with her income from mixing up herbal remedies and from her reluctant work as an unlicensed midwife\u2019s assistant and then midwife.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring his 20s, Gene\u2019s edgy and not uncharismatic intensity morphed into politically charged paranoia, fueled by what the reader is led to presume is a severe case of bipolar disorder. Around the age of 30, he pulled his eldest children from school to protect them from the Illuminati, though they, at least, had the benefit of a birth certificate, an indulgence the youngest four would be denied. In theory, the children were being home-schooled; in reality, there was virtually no academic instruction to speak of. They learned to read from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the speeches of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. The only science book in the house was for young children, full of glossy illustrations. The bulk of their time was spent helping their parents at work. Barely into her teens, Westover graduated from helping her mom mix remedies and birth babies to sorting scrap with her dad, who had the unnerving habit of inadvertently hitting her with pieces he\u2019d tossed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGetting hit with a steel cylinder square in the gut was the least of the risks in the Westover household. The book is, among other things, a catalog of job-site horrors: fingers lost, legs gashed, bodies horribly burned. No pointy-headed bureaucrat could make a stronger case for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration than do the unregulated Westovers with their many calamities. Making matters worse is Gene\u2019s refusal to allow any of the injured and wounded (himself included) to seek medical attention beyond his wife\u2019s tinctures \u2014 \u201cGod\u2019s pharmacy\u201d \u2014 a refusal that also greatly exacerbates the effects of two terrible car accidents. \u201cGod and his angels are here, working right alongside us,\u201d he tells Westover. \u201cThey won\u2019t let you get hurt.\u201d When she gets tonsillitis, he tells her to stand outside with her mouth open so that the sun can work its magic.

Handrahan\u2019s replacement, the 1998 Olympic goal medalist Jenny Potter, was fired after one season for multiple N.C.A.A. violations. Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith reassigned the women\u2019s hockey administrator, Shaun Richard. He put Diana Sabau, the executive associate athletic director, in charge and instructed her to find the next coach.\n\nSabau, who also oversees football, had no hockey contacts. So she searched the internet and called dozens of hockey people while assembling a list of candidates. Muzerall, a Canadian known as Muzz or Muzzy in the Minnesota hockey community, stood out as a winner who had paid her dues.\n\nHer 139 goals as a Gopher remain the school record. Muzerall coached and taught at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts from 2002 to \u201909, then played briefly in Switzerland before returning to Minnesota in 2011 to join Frost\u2019s staff.\n\nFormer Minnesota Coach Laura Halldorson described Muzerall as a \u201cspitfire\u201d who thrived under pressure. The day before the 2000 national semifinals at Matthews Arena in Boston, Muzerall tripped at practice, banged her head on the ice and was taken off immobilized on a stretcher as a precaution. Cleared to play the next day, Muzerall scored twice as Minnesota ousted Minnesota Duluth, 3-2, in the semifinals. Then she added a goal and an assist in the 4-2 championship victory over Brown.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe elevated the program, no question,\u201d Halldorson said. \u201cI say she\u2019s a character, and I mean that in an endearing way.

There was never an uninteresting day with Nadine Muzerall.\u201d\n\nTwo Ohio State teammates, Spring and Jincy Dunne, were part of the coaching search committee that interviewed the finalists. Muzerall was struck by how weary they appeared.\n\n\u201cThey looked sad, and they looked broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, this is ridiculous. If you\u2019re not having fun in college, when are you going to have fun? You have the rest of your life to be stressed out. You\u2019re supposed to enjoy college and enjoy your hockey.

Practices were harder, with more structure and greater accountability. Muzerall also instituted biweekly individual meetings with players to discuss hockey and life issues. She wanted her players to know she cared about them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf I coached them four years ago, I probably would have been a different coach,\u201d said Muzerall, who has two children. \u201cBut now being that I\u2019m a mom, you have that tough love where I\u2019m going to love you and take care of you and be loyal, but maybe I have to whip your butt a little bit from time to time.\u201d\n\nWhen the University of North Dakota dropped its women\u2019s hockey program last year, Muzerall hired its associate head coach, Peter Elander, a skills specialist. Under his tutelage at North Dakota, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson perfected the shootout move that won an Olympic gold medal for the United States last month.\n\nThe Buckeyes\u2019 roster features seven Minnesotans and seven Canadians, a terrific goaltender in Kennedy Sauve (10 shutouts), and a strong freshman class led by Emma Maltais (16 goals, 40 points), the Western Collegiate Hockey Association Rookie of the Year.\n\nSweeping Wisconsin, then top-ranked, in a two-game series at home in early February helped the Buckeyes land an at-large N.C.A.A. Tournament bid. In the quarterfinals, Sauve made 23 of her 38 saves in the third period as the Buckeyes handed Boston College its only shutout of the season.\n\nThe gloom over the Buckeyes program has lifted, and Spring credits Muzerall.\n\n\u201cWhen you have three different coaches in a span of three years, each coach comes with different beliefs and philosophies,\u201d Spring said. \u201cFor Coach to step in on that third time around and provide us with guidance and leadership, and the commitment to create a culture we can all thrive in and be successful, was extremely important for her. She\u2019s been dedicated from Day 1, and I think it shows through us and what we\u2019ve been able to do this year on the ice.\u201d\n\nOhio State has the worst record among the Frozen Four participants, but Muzerall is as undaunted as she was when she took the Buckeyes job.\n\n\u201cAs excited as we are to be here, and honored, we\u2019re not going to be the ones that are sitting back as the fourth-ranked team out of four, bedazzled by all the lights and the press,\u201d Muzerall said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win a tournament.

We would be married but for my condition, which has placed a question mark at the end of nearly everything. Will experimental treatments eventually fix me? Can I contribute to a family? Is it fair to ask that Dunia sustain a lifetime of my poor health?\n\nI left the vast Tourneau showroom that day lighter in the wallet but heavier on the wrist. The watch felt dense, luxurious. It delighted me. And yet, as I loitered in front of the store, I was struck by how unchanged the city appeared, how unchanged I felt. The cabbies honked; the clip of the pedestrian stream was as swift as ever; the summer humidity was thick and filthy; and I still felt dizzy and disoriented.\n\nI shuffled at my sluggish pace toward the subway and wondered what Dunia would make of the small fortune dangling from my arm.\n\nOur shared bedroom is a cloud of freshly painted white walls, soft sheets and warm bedside lighting.

But for now these are just dreams. A load of laundry overtires me. I can\u2019t imagine the marathon of work, parenthood and homeownership.\n\nLately I have concluded that the best thing for Dunia would be for me to leave her, free her from the burdens of a disabled partner, provide her the opportunity to find someone new and healthy with whom to build her vision.\n\nI said nothing of the shimmering fixture on my wrist when she arrived home from work.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d she said, having caught it in the light. \u201cWhat\u2019s that on your wrist?\u201d\n\nI held it up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cI fully support this. You deserve it.\u201d She asked to try it on and became fixated with it.\n\nI observed Dunia as she studied the Roman numerals on the dial, harking back to a distant, ancient time. As I watched her, my uncertainty about the future gave way to the certainty of the present, and I was overcome by the notion that she and I were moving through time together, like musicians playing from the same sheet music. A duet not yet completed, partially composed but largely improvised.\n\nOur future may be unsure, but such is the case for everyone and everything. As the second hand on the Datejust skated forward on Dunia\u2019s wrist, I saw that it portended nothing other than the now, the togetherness of Dunia and me alive and undeniable, good and right.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this sense, my timekeeper is a shield, an armor of steel defending against the gnawing fear of the unknown. I peered into the sapphire crystal of my wristwatch and saw that the future is merely an accumulation of present moments \u2014 moments I can choose to savor. A watch to keep time perfectly.\n\nI thought about the grandfather clock from my law school days, ticking by my nook in the reading room. Another hungry law student sits there now, reading doggedly about fairness and rightness, Lady Justice keeping vigil.\n\nI can no longer say whether time is kind or just, if I ever could.

Entrusting the shelters to a ministry would rob women of their only defense against so-called honor killings, they say.\n\nWestern embassies, for whom modest advances in women\u2019s rights are a tangible success of the war even amid battlefield setbacks, have blocked previous government efforts to roll back protections.\n\nThe Parliament came close in 2011 to passing harsh limitations on the shelters, and in 2013 it tried to gut a law barring violence against women.

Those objections include that the women are \u201csometimes sexually misused.\u201d\n\nMs. Musleh conceded, however, that no evidence had ever emerged that the shelters were prostituting abused women. The allegation is continually raised, endlessly infuriating women\u2019s rights advocates. Still, she said, the government needed more direct control as a means to refute the brothel rumors.\n\nGovernment control would also ease access for women at the shelters to state-run mental hospitals, she said, and allow the government to open shelters in unstable regions where nongovernmental groups do not venture.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Ministry drafted the proposal to take over financing of the shelters, which would change a decade-old decree legalizing the facilities. The cabinet has considered but not yet adopted it.\n\nAfghan culture, said Ms. Benafsha, of Women for Afghan Women, still lags behind the laws protecting women that Western nations pressed the government to pass.

Theranos\u2019s revenue in 2014 was barely $100,000, \u201cnowhere near\u201d $100 million, the agency said, and the $1 billion projection was a fantasy that \u201chad no basis\u201d in reality.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Holmes settled the S.E.C.\u2019s charges without admitting or denying them.

Though she lost voting control of Theranos, a private company, she remains chairman and chief executive.\n\nShe could still face criminal charges. It\u2019s unusual, though not unprecedented, for the S.E.C. to settle a case while a criminal investigation is underway.

When more facts emerge, her case may be more complex than it now appears. But on the face of the S.E.C.\u2019s complaint, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s crimes pale in comparison.\n\nAt the heart of both cases are lies: At Mr. Shkreli\u2019s sentencing, federal Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto referred to Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cegregious multitude of lies,\u201d and the same might be said of Ms. Holmes. But the financial consequences of her deceptions were in another league.\n\nJudge Matsumoto said it didn\u2019t matter that Mr. Shkreli later repaid the investors he defrauded, or that some of his investors made millions. Still, the magnitude of the fraud was just over $10 million.\n\nPhoto\n\nTheranos\u2019s was far greater. According to the S.E.C. complaint, from 2013 to 2015 Theranos used false claims to raise more than $700 million from investors. By late last year, Theranos was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy,\u201d the S.E.C. said.\n\nMr. Shkreli\u2019s victims were mostly wealthy individuals, presumably sophisticated investors. Many of Ms. Holmes\u2019 victims were, too; they included the media magnate Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle. But she also attracted venture capital funds whose investors included pension funds and endowments, affecting thousands of ordinary Americans.\n\nIn comparison to Mr. Shkreli\u2019s fraud, the Holmes allegations \u201care really a different order of magnitude,\u201d Ms. Apps said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the reactions of Ms. Holmes and Mr. Shkreli to the charges are also wildly divergent \u2014 a factor that may ultimately determine whether Ms. Holmes is charged, and, if convicted, whether she ends up in prison.\n\nBoth Ms. Holmes and Mr. Shkreli courted celebrity and seemed to revel in media attention. But in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s case, that impulse seemed only to intensify once he was charged.\n\nMr. Shkreli repeatedly defied Mr. Brafman\u2019s admonitions to keep quiet and avoid the limelight. He smirked through his trial, taunted prosecutors as the \u201cjunior varsity,\u201d called the case a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and was suspended by Twitter after he threatened to have sex with a freelance journalist who covered him. His bail was revoked and he was imprisoned after he offered a $5,000 bounty in a Facebook post for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair \u2014 a \u201csolicitation to assault,\u201d Judge Matsumoto ruled.\n\nIn theory, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s well-publicized bizarre antics, both in and out of court, should have had no bearing on his guilt or sentence. As Mr. Brafman put it in his opening statement, Mr. Shkreli shouldn\u2019t be found guilty for being \u201codd,\u201d \u201cweird,\u201d or having a \u201cdysfunctional personality.\u201d But prosecutors cited his behavior to assert in closing arguments that he \u201chad no respect for the law.\u201d At his sentencing, Judge Matsumoto suggested his actions called into question whether his purported remorse was genuine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a client who did more to hurt his own standing with the court than Martin Shkreli,\u201d Mr. Brafman said. His behavior and comments \u201cprobably added several years to his sentence.\u201d\n\nSo far, Ms. Holmes has followed the traditional route of the contrite potential defendant: She has maintained a low profile and said nothing to provoke the government or prosecutors.\n\nAfter the S.E.C. settlement, Ms. Holmes made no comment. In keeping with that strategy, John Dwyer, the Palo Alto, Calif., lawyer representing her, declined to comment for this column. Theranos issued a statement stressing that she had \u201ccooperated with the S.E.C. throughout its investigation\u201d and said its independent directors were \u201cpleased to be bringing this matter to a close.\u201d", "title": "Shkreli vs. Holmes: 2 Frauds, 2 Divergent Outcomes.

The stands were almost empty, though \u2014 although the Brewers opened the gates early for fans holding tickets to an afternoon game, few showed up.\n\nThe Brewers estimated the crowd at 60, nearly one for every pitch Ohtani threw in a tantalizing performance against minor leaguers. He recorded eight outs against 12 batters, all by strikeout, and two of the Brewers\u2019 four hits deflected off a fielder\u2019s glove.

While Ohtani had his choice of teams, his age restricted his maximum signing bonus. The Angels paid $20 million to the Fighters for his rights, but had less than $2.5 million to spend on Ohtani, who will make the major league minimum salary of $545,000 this season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is his dream,\u201d said Charles Nagy, the Angels\u2019 pitching coach. \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, very respectful, great poise and confidence.

While more than a quarter of Democratic voters, 26.3 percent, are \u201ccloser to the Republicans than to their fellow Democrats\u201d on cultural attitudes, nearly three quarters of Democrats, 73.9 percent, are more liberal on cultural issues.\n\nIn an email, Bartels described these culturally liberal Democrats as:\n\nrelatively more enthusiastic about atheists, gays and lesbians, and Muslims; more negative about Fox News, Walmart, and Christians; more willing to rely on \u201cexperts\u201d; less likely to say that \u201canyone who is willing to work hard can still achieve the American dream\u201d; more likely to deny that \u201cthe interests of ethnic and racial minority groups often conflict with those of the white majority\u201d; less \u201cauthoritarian\u201d (as measured by questions about child-rearing), further to the left in their ideological self-placements, and more pro-choice on abortion.\n\nAccording to Bartels, Democrats who are most firmly culturally liberal are overwhelmingly white.\n\nI exchanged emails with a Democratic consultant who has played a prominent role in presidential, Senate and House elections. He asked to remain anonymous in order to be more candid.\n\nThe first question I posed was: Could Lamb \u2014 who did not face a primary \u2014 have won the seat if the contest had been held in 2016, during a general election? The answer was no:\n\nWe know that PA-18 was not winnable in a year with Hillary at the top of the ticket. Democrats did not win any seat with the demographic profile of this one anywhere in the country in 2016 \u2014 save for handful of longtime incumbents.\n\nHow about 2020? Could a centrist like Bill Clinton get the nomination?\n\nI\u2019d say the answer is \u201cno.\u201d I think the politics of the Democratic Party have changed significantly since that time and while it may not be the MOST liberal candidate who wins the nomination, all viable candidates will have to pass a certain threshold of liberal-ness.\n\nOne of the best case studies of center-left intraparty schism can be seen in the upcoming May 22 runoff election for the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District in Texas \u2014 upscale suburban Houston.\n\nThe two candidates are Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a local lawyer who led the primary with 29.3 percent and is generally viewed as the moderate, establishment candidate (referred to as Republican-lite by her opponents), and Laura Moser, a liberal political activist, author and former journalist, who came in second with 24.3 percent, and was described by the Houston Chronicle as the candidate of \u201cthose who want a full-fledged push to the left to provide the starkest possible contrast with Trump.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Should Democrats Embrace the Center or Abandon It?", "authors": []}

This would be a boon to prisoners across the country, a vast majority of whom do not have a high school diploma. And it could help shrink our prison population. While racial disparities in arrests and convictions are alarming, education level is a far stronger predictor of future incarceration than race. The idea is rooted in history. In the 1920s, Howard Belding Gill, a criminologist and a Harvard alumnus, developed a college-like community at the Norfolk State Prison Colony in Massachusetts, where he was the superintendent. Prisoners wore normal clothing, participated in cooperative self-government with staff, and took academic courses with instructors from Emerson, Boston University and Harvard. They ran a newspaper, radio show and jazz orchestra, and they had access to an extensive library.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Before I joined Crampton and Michelle Clark, a biologist from the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, at the Lihue heliport for the 15-minute flight into the interior, Crampton warned me that journalists tend to underestimate the Alakai. She recalled how one photographer, who had planned to spend a full week with the team, made it just a few hundred yards before giving up; she spent the remainder of the day at the field camp. Another visitor, who regularly hiked the Sierra Nevada, was flown out after less than 24 hours. \u201cI guess she was used to pine trees or something,\u201d Crampton told me. \u201cAnd trails.\u201d\n\nBy the time I arrived in late May, the team had spent the past three months rotating in and out of a muddy field camp consisting of a single large tent with four cots, a Coleman stove, a laminated map and several musty plastic ration tubs. With the season winding down, the team that week consisted of just two people: Mandy Peterson and Marcus Collado, a wildlife biologist from Maine who was easygoing but prone to turning morose. Crampton called his bleaker comments \u201cMarcus musings.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to Kauai, Collado worked banding golden-eagle chicks, a task that required him to stand on the skid of a helicopter as it flew, then jump from the skid to the cliff-face ledge where an eagle had nested. By comparison, harvesting eggs in the Alakai qualified as a relaxing vacation, though Collado noted that \u201cit can get a little sad\u201d because akikiki are so scarce. \u201cIn the job interview, they warn you: \u2018You may not see any birds or find any nests,\u2019 \u201d Collado told me. \u201cAnd I thought, Man, this could be tough.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the akikiki\u2019s steep decline was discovered in 2012, the Fish and Wildlife Service convened a panel of experts to determine what, if anything, should be done to stave off extinction. After three days of debate, the group agreed to a set of interventions, including the construction of an eight-foot-tall, five-mile-long, pig-proof fence, and the installation of what would eventually be 300 reusable rat traps, each of which to be hand-placed in key areas and stocked with bait, to keep nonnative rats from eating the birds\u2019 eggs, their chicks and sometimes even the birds themselves, usually when a bird refused to abandon its nest.\n\nPeople tend to go into conservation biology to save species, but in practice, the job can be more about killing things. The camp keeps two binders for logging information. One is devoted to akikiki sightings and nests. Another tracks rat kills and is labeled \u201cCharlie work,\u201d a reference to the TV show \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\u201d in which a character named Charlie is regularly dispatched to kill rats. When I pointed out that the rat binder was almost four times thicker than the bird binder, Peterson shrugged. \u201cWe do a lot of rat killing. We probably kill more rats than we find birds.\u201d\n\nEither way, the work can be wearing. Earlier this season, the camp started keeping a dream journal, which ended up doubling as a kind of anxiety log. A few weeks back, Collado said, he had a dream in which he saw the last surviving akikiki drowning in a canal. He raced to save it but arrived too late. Not long after that, Peterson dreamed that she saw an akikiki made of Legos and knew, in that moment, that all the real akikiki had died.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI joined Collado and Clark one morning when they went to check on an akikiki nest in a valley known as Far Quarter, about two hours from camp. At a previous job on Mono Lake, the associate director of the Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project, Justin Hite, worked with a biologist who gave colorful names to the lake\u2019s islets \u2014 Little Norway, Little Tahiti \u2014 and in the Alakai, Hite carried on the tradition. A sharp-edged stretch became Titanic Ridge (\u201cI\u2019m on top of the world!\u201d). An area that shone with a rare forest rainbow was called Unicorn Paradise. One particularly inaccessible stretch became the Chasm of Doom, but when this nickname led field teams to avoid the area, it was rechristened Kasmadu.\n\nThat day, the forest had a sleepy feel. Clark stopped to admire a tiny, lacy fern known as lady of the mountain; later, she pointed out another, larger fern covered in soft brown hairs, which were once collected to make mattresses. Surprisingly, there was almost no bird song and not even much in the way of insects, just the occasional drone of a helicopter. (Though tourist helicopters aren\u2019t supposed to fly that low over the Alakai, Clark told me, some still do.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time we got to the site, it was almost midday and hot. Because the team had already harvested eggs from this pair of birds, Collado\u2019s task was to see whether the new clutch had hatched and, if so, to find out how many of the chicks survived. Sitting on the stream bank, Collado used athletic tape to lash a GoPro video camera to the top of a collapsible 30-foot aluminum pole. Fully extended, the pole had an alarming sway; maneuvering it close enough to see inside a nest, without hitting the nest itself, was a heart-stopping project.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat morning, though, the main problem was getting the camera high enough; even held directly overhead, the pole was almost 10 feet too short. Peering around, Collado considered the landscape. \u201cJustin wasn\u2019t kidding when he said it was nearly impossible to check this nest,\u201d he said. Spotting some scuff marks on a dead ohia tree, he began to shinny up. \u201cI know Justin managed it somehow,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also seen him fall a lot. He does sketchy stuff that the rest of us won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOnce he managed to climb about 10 feet, Collado asked Clark to hand him the pole, which he carefully levered into the canopy, only to find that the view was blocked by leaves. For the next 20 minutes, Collado patiently worked the camera closer, while Clark watched the video feed on her phone. Finally, a blurry image of a small gray bird came into view. \u201cThere she is!\u201d Clark said excitedly. Peering at the screen, I saw a small, disgruntled-looking bird with a slim tail and a tiny patch of white over its eye.\n\nOver dinner the night before, Crampton described akikiki as \u201cthe little guys that at first you think are really boring, but then you spend a little time with them and discover that they have all these talents that are totally endearing. They do flips around the branches.\u201d That morning, though, the only talent the akikiki exhibited was an unbudging perseverance.\n\nHoping to get a look inside the nest, Collado climbed down, assuming that the akikiki would eventually fly off to feed. It didn\u2019t. My notes from the time say: \u201cBeen here an hour. No change. Nothing to do but sit and watch.\u201d\n\nThe history of the planet is rife with extinctions, often sweeping ones. Roughly 250 million years ago, a cataclysmic eruption destroyed more than 95 percent of the life in the oceans and 70 percent of the animals on land, effectively erasing about 10 million years of evolution. In the past five centuries, extinctions have become less dramatic but arguably more constant: a slow drip of change as humans have spread across the globe, clearing forests, planting crops, building cities and roads.\n\nWhen the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, it was in response to a slowly dawning awareness of how the planet was changing under human dominion. Centuries of aggressive hunting and development had shrunk the once-spectacular abundance of American wildlife to a degree that prompted widespread bipartisan alarm. The new law, which was unanimously approved by the Senate, made it a federal crime to kill an endangered animal and, more radical, established the rigorous protection measures still in place today: that once a species reaches the point of endangerment, government agencies are required to take steps to save it. At the time, this inflexibility was considered a crucial bulwark against the pressure that would be brought by politically powerful industries, like logging and drilling. \u201cNothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed,\u201d President Nixon said while signing the act.\n\nThough it can be hard to imagine today, the Endangered Species Act was intended to be a starting point rather than an endgame; a last-ditch way to save species that were vanishing until more comprehensive and farsighted conservation plans could be put in place. As Chris D. Thomas, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of York, puts it, \u201cThe fact that we reach this point, with all the heroic measures, shows that we\u2019re not great at planning ahead.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that extinctions just seem to get to us. We make a modest effort as a species dwindles and then, when it\u2019s really on the ropes, we suddenly panic. \u201cThere\u2019s just something gutting about a thing being lost to us forever,\u201d Thomas says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore debatable is the degree to which extinctions are genuinely catastrophic. Do these disappearances represent the loss of rare, beloved plants and birds? Or are they simply the next evolutionary step in an ever-changing, increasingly global ecosystem? When I spoke with Thomas, he supported the idea that truly invasive species \u2014 the kind that transform the landscape \u2014 may need to be contained. But it\u2019s also true that the early isolation of the Pacific islands was itself an artifact. \u201cIf you look at it cruelly and unemotionally, Hawaii has native birds and introduced birds,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe native birds are dying out, and the introduced birds are malaria resistant. Are the introduced birds worse? Not necessarily. You could argue that this is simply a case where island species have lost out and continental species have won.\u201d\n\nIn this view, the loss of Hawaii\u2019s native birds and plants and their replacement by species that are more resistant to disease and predators, is just another case of the fittest surviving. If humans have accelerated this process by planting Argentine pampas grass in their gardens or by dumping tropical aquarium fish in their local lake, it\u2019s still just a faster, looser version of what has been happening on the planet anyway: Starbucks in Paris and McDonald\u2019s in Soweto; Australian brown tree snakes in Guam and Asian carp in the Great Lakes.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s fair to ask why, exactly, biodiversity matters. As Thomas says: \u201cEven if we were to lose 10 percent of all species in the next hundred years, would biology stop? Would ecology stop? No. In fact, most people wouldn\u2019t even be aware of the loss.\u201d Given how radically we\u2019ve already altered the landscape, how bad would it be if we just kept doing what we\u2019re doing: paving the land, overfishing the oceans and letting the chips fall where they may?\n\nFaced with this dilemma, some conservationists have tried to shift the focus to an economic argument known as \u201cecosystem services\u201d: the idea that we benefit from preserving biodiversity either because it saves us money (mangroves prevent coastal erosion that we would otherwise have to handle with an expensive engineering project) or because it contains something of value to us, either now or in the future. For instance, a biodiverse planet may provide a first defense against global warming. Or it may act as a repository of potential discoveries: new materials that mimic the strength of spider silk; drones modeled after insects; an anticancer drug derived from Amazonian moss.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile all this may be true \u2014 mangroves do prevent coastal erosion; research into new cancer drugs derived from plants is underway \u2014 it can also sound wishful, like a hoarder arguing that his pile of junk might someday contain collectors\u2019 items. The difference, Thomas says, is that unlike a hoarder\u2019s pile, ecosystems perform vital planetary functions, like keeping soil fertile, preventing desertification and absorbing carbon dioxide. The reason some conservationists want to prioritize genetic or functional diversity isn\u2019t that either of those things are inherently valuable to people, though they can be, but because they\u2019re essential to the health and resiliency of ecosystems themselves. The true problem, then, is not whether we would notice those vanished species and ecosystems; it\u2019s that there\u2019s no good way to quantify the opportunity cost of our loss, which in turn can lead us to underestimate it. \u201cThe species we have now are the ancestors of all future species,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we know enough about ecology or evolution, or how humans are going to affect the planet over the next thousand years, to bet on which animal or plant to keep.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes it hard to know where to draw the line. We can\u2019t put every ecosystem in the world under glass. (We can\u2019t even manage to do that on Kauai, a 500-square-mile island in the middle of the Pacific.) Even if we could, conservation isn\u2019t always an ethically straightforward choice; in countries like Brazil and Kenya, do we prioritize protecting wild animals and their habitats or the farmers facing hunger who hunt those animals and who log forests to plant crops?\n\nPresumably, though, we also don\u2019t want a planet that\u2019s nothing but pavement, cattle farms and monoculture farmland. The biologist E.O. Wilson eloquently argued against living in a world of crows and rats, and against the loss of beautiful, fragile species like snow leopards, white rhinos and tiny mouse lemurs; even if you never see a lemur or an arctic fox in person, the world can be a richer place by having such creatures in it. Others simply see conservation as a moral duty: because we\u2019re the ones creating these problems, isn\u2019t it up to us to fix them?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether we regard conservation as an ethical or an economic issue, we\u2019re still faced with the question of how we decide what to save. In an ideal world, Michael Scott told me, conservation science would have the resources to study this question, rather than being stuck reacting to the latest crisis. \u201cFiguring out which species and ecosystems are the most important to protect is a complicated project,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAt this point, just coming up with a list of qualities we want to investigate would be a good start.\u201d\n\nBut for such an approach to take hold, the conservation movement would have to undergo a profound shift \u2014 away from triage mode and toward a more coherent and deliberate plan for global conservation. And such a shift would most likely require more resources and more political support than currently exist. The question is whether it will happen in time to shelter us from some of the more significant changes that climate change and development are likely to bring.", "title": "Should Some Species Be Allowed to Die Out?", "authors": ["Jennifer Kahn"]}

Among the many examples: Devin Patrick Kelley, who murdered 26 congregants at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November, had been court-martialed by the Air Force for domestic violence; James Hodgkinson, who fired on members of Congress as they played baseball last June, had a court record of abuse against his foster daughter; Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who killed 84 people with a truck in Nice, France, in July 2016, was known to the authorities because he had assaulted his wife.\n\nHow can we make sense of the connection between domestic abuse and large-scale violence? The men (and they typically are men) who perpetrate private abuse often use violence to create a climate of fear for the women who live with them. The gunman in a mass shooting does the same thing, sowing terror among his targets and the public.\n\nThis is not to say that all those who commit domestic violence are at risk of becoming mass murderers. Only a small subset of people who abuse family members also commit large-scale murder. The link, however, is a crucial one. In fact, experts refer to particularly dangerous domestic relationships as \u201cintimate terrorism.\u201d\n\nWhen domestic violence follows the pattern of intimate terrorism, the perpetrator typically tries to control every aspect of the victim\u2019s life: her finances, clothes, contact with friends and family, even what position she sleeps in.

Why?\n\nIn \u201cWhy We Should Lower the Voting Age to 16,\u201d Laurence Steinberg writes:\n\nThe young people who have come forward to call for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting at their high school in Parkland, Fla., are challenging the tiresome stereotype of American kids as indolent narcissists whose brains have been addled by smartphones. They offer an inspiring example of thoughtful, eloquent protest. Unfortunately, when it comes to electing lawmakers whose decisions about gun control and other issues affect their lives, these high schoolers lack any real power. This needs to change: The federal voting age in the United States should be lowered from 18 to 16. Skeptics will no doubt raise questions about the competence of 16-year-olds to make informed choices in the voting booth. Aren\u2019t young people notoriously impulsive and hotheaded, their brains not fully developed enough to make good judgments? Yes and no. When considering the intellectual capacity of teenagers, it is important to distinguish between what psychologists call \u201ccold\u201d and \u201chot\u201d cognition. Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation. Studies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 At the end of the article, Professor Steinberg writes:\n\nThe last time the United States lowered the federal voting age was in 1971, when it went from 21 to 18. In that instance, the main motivating force was outrage over the fact that 18-year-olds could be sent to fight in Vietnam but could not vote.\n\nDo you agree with the writer\u2019s proposal to lower the voting age to 16 so that those most vulnerable to school shootings have a say in how those shootings are best prevented? Why or why not?\n\n\u2014 Do you agree that the brain science discussed in the article supports the argument for lowering the legal voting age in the United States? If so, how and why?\n\n\u2014 What other reasons might you have for lowering the voting age, or for keeping the status quo, and why?", "title": "Should the Voting Age Be Lowered to 16?", "authors": []}

For added protection, she signed up for a service, EyeOn App, that signals three friends if she does not reply within a half-hour to scheduled alerts on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cOnce, I didn\u2019t respond, and everyone called me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.\u201d\n\nAlthough no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. \u201cI know people would have my back,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Peveler is among a growing number of older Americans who are unmarried and childless. By 2030, about 16 percent of women 80 to 84 will be childless, compared with about 12 percent in 2010, according to a 2013 report by AARP.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Ms. Peveler is trying to control the risks of aging alone, many so-called elder orphans may not fare as well. Older single and childless people are at higher risk than those with children for facing medical problems, cognitive decline and premature death, according to a 2016 study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine at the Northwell Health system on Long Island. The study noted that about 22 percent of people 65 and older either are childless or have children who are not in contact.\n\nAdult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.\n\n\u201cPeople who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.\u201d Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank\u2019s trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank\u2019s decisions.\n\nChristina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a \u201cmicro board,\u201d which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. \u201cThe board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,\u201d Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.\n\nAs for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly \u201ccongregate living\u201d arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.\n\nWith no one to oversee their care, elder orphans who want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible could enlist a geriatric care manager, who monitors elderly clients and coordinates care.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.\n\n\u201cMore and more people were coming to us and saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K. now, but I\u2019m realistic enough to know my health status could change,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.\n\nPhoto\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of volunteer neighborhood groups are providing both social connections and practical help to older people who are at home alone. More than 200 organizations in the Village to Village Network, including \u201cvillages\u201d in the New York area, provide rides to medical appointments, snow removal, home repairs and computer support. Villages in 150 additional neighborhoods are in development. Tax-deductible membership fees can range from $100 to $400.\n\nEntrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,\u201d said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.\n\nFor example, the ride-hailing service Lyft is working with health care systems and retirement communities to provide rides to nonemergency medical appointments and other destinations. And because financial acuity often declines with age, childless singles can enroll in a service such as EverSafe, which monitors accounts for unusual spending and alerts the client or a trusted advocate of possible fraud.\n\nIn-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.\n\n\u201cIf I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,\u201d said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa \u201cto make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.\u201d\n\nFor those aging solo, expanding a social network is essential, according to experts on aging. Two years ago, Carol Marak, who is in her mid-60s and lives alone in Dallas, started the Elder Orphan Facebook Group.\n\n\u201cI wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,\u201d said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.\n\nMs. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being \u201cisolated and disconnected from the community.\u201d She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.\n\nDetermined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. \u201cI need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,\u201d she said.", "title": "Single?

But right away, we run into problems. It\u2019s raining hard in Lagos, where Rex is based, and his internet keeps going out. Once the rain eases up, I give him my eBay login information, but before long, eBay has noticed the unusual activity on my account and shuts it down.\n\nAfter we solve that issue, Rex needs my PayPal information, and I remember a conversation with Mr. Chen about protecting personal information. Magic and Fin guarantee security with data encryption, but Rex is working on his home computer. He keeps reassuring me it\u2019s fine, but I decide to switch up the task. Instead, I ask him to research the amount of time I have to find new health insurance.

In only a few hours, she accepts my invitation to do the job. With my budget running low, I decide to offer Corin as much as I think she could possibly do in one short hour: check on a medical insurance rule for me, call my bank about my car loan, list the items I still want to sell on eBay.\n\nBefore half the hour had passed, Corin has already sent me a Google doc answering my first two questions, and following up about my eBay products. By the end of the hour, she hasn\u2019t listed everything but tells me she\u2019ll finish the task for no extra charge.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "What books on life in New York City would you recommend?\n\nAnything by Joseph Mitchell and Dawn Powell. \u201cGone to New York,\u201d by Ian Frazier, and \u201cThe Colossus of New York,\u201d by Colson Whitehead, are delightfully nostalgic. Also: Edith Wharton (\u201cThe House of Mirth\u201d over \u201cThe Age of Innocence\u201d); John O\u2019Hara\u2019s stories; \u201cGo Tell It on the Mountain,\u201d by James Baldwin; \u201cThe Flamethrowers,\u201d by Rachel Kushner; \u201cLast Exit to Brooklyn,\u201d by Hubert Selby Jr.; and \u201cJust Kids,\u201d by Patti Smith. For dessert, read Joan Didion\u2019s essay \u201cGoodbye to All That\u201d while eating a peach.\n\nWhat are your literary guilty pleasures? Do you have a favorite genre?\n\nI never feel guilty about reading something. I was at a motel for a writers\u2019 conference recently and, ironically, found myself with nothing to read. So I borrowed one of the \u201cTwilight\u201d books from a communal shelf. It\u2019s not the worst thing that ever happened once you accept the parameters and decide it won\u2019t mar your brain to read it. What made me put it down was the frequency of the word \u201cglance.\u201d Everyone is always glancing at everyone else. Once you notice it, you can\u2019t not notice it. It\u2019s like snoring but with verbs.\n\nWhich books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelves?\n\n\u201cGrowing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teenagers,\u201d by Ruth Bockner, my maternal grandmother. This woman had no business giving advice to teenagers. In one section, she suggests pointing out the deformities of peers recovering from polio because this will prepare them for the real world. It\u2019s very funny if you read it as satire and not as a snapshot of my mother\u2019s childhood. Next to it (but on the opposite end of the lovability spectrum) is \u201cZero Dances,\u201d by Arthur Sainer. My paternal grandmother dated Zero Mostel for a long time and they remained close. Her chapters in this thing are priceless. She yells at him for smoking cigars and he carries her Kotex back from the store and everybody\u2019s always eating chicken soup to combat HUAC stress.\n\nWhat was the last book to make you laugh?\n\nI like dry humor with a stick of dynamite strapped to it. The forthcoming collection \u201cSome Trick,\u201d by Helen DeWitt, is probably the most recent example. The third story in that book, \u201cOn the Town,\u201d is her most accessible (and therefore not an ideal DeWitt calling card) but God, it\u2019s funny. \u201cThe Sellout,\u201d by Paul Beatty, and \u201cDear Committee Members,\u201d by Julie Schumacher, both made me burst out laughing. The latter is like a companion piece to \u201cStraight Man,\u201d by Richard Russo. \u201cOur Mutual Friend,\u201d by Charles Dickens, is always good for a laugh, as are \u201cDo the Windows Open?,\u201d by Julie Hecht; \u201cHome Land,\u201d by Sam Lipsyte; \u201cAt Freddie\u2019s,\u201d by Penelope Fitzgerald; and \u201cPnin,\u201d by Nabokov. I\u2019m a humorist, or at least I\u2019m shelved that way, so this question is too big for me. If you\u2019ve never read the actual play of \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d by J. M. Barrie, do that.\n\nThe last book that made you cry?\n\nOh, everything makes me cry. Nonfiction about refugees or mass shootings will do it. Any story line where an animal or a child dies. Genre-wise, short stories are the worst. Something about the emotional space they have to cover in a shorter amount of time, it\u2019s like there\u2019s no time for the anesthesia to kick in. If, for some reason, you felt compelled to make me recite the last lines of \u201cWhite Angel,\u201d by Michael Cunningham, or \u201cIn The Gloaming,\u201d by Alice Elliott Dark, I\u2019d cry on the spot.

Given his attack on Muslims\u2019 religious rights, the other parties blocked Mr. Glaser\u2019s election, while their own nominees were all approved. The AfD then won headlines when it complained it was being treated unfairly by the sore losers in the establishment. All in all, a tie.\n\nThe AfD\u2019s triple strategy of normality, provocation and self-victimization puts the other caucuses on the spot. But there has been some learning by their opponents as well. A broad consensus has emerged among the established parties that it is best to treat the AfD as normally as possible as long as it\u2019s possible. \u201cWe must not generally deny them certain positions in the Bundestag,\u201d Thomas Oppermann, the head of the Social Democratic caucus, wrote recently, and indeed the AfD heads three parliamentary committees.\n\nThree strategies can be identified in response to the AfD\u2019s provocations. First, the emotional response: Cem \u00d6zdemir, the leader of the Green Party, recently gave a passionate speech on the floor, calling the party \u201cracist.\u201d The video went viral. Second, pointing out the AfD\u2019s inconsistencies wherever it makes mistakes. Third, tackling false allegations with facts: A young representative from the Christian Democrats, Philipp Amthor, responded to the AfD\u2019s proposal to ban full veiling in public with an elaborate account of the rulings both by the German Constitutional Court and by the European Court of Human Rights that would stand against a ban. That video was widely shared, too.\n\nAll of these have pros and cons. The emotional response unites your own supporters but evokes an equal reaction on the other side. Pointing out inconsistencies and making a factual argument may work better, but that tends to reach a smaller, wonkier audience. For most hard-core AfD supporters, all three responses fall flat. The AfD has built a strong social-media presence that doesn\u2019t let anything through without adding its own spin.\n\nFour months into the experiment of countering parliamentary populism, it is too early to draw definite conclusions. The AfD\u2019s presence in the Bundestag seems to consolidate, but not increase, its support. In the general election, its share of the vote was 12.6 percent; in February, most polls saw the AfD at 13 percent to 15 percent. But the other side, too, has profited from the party\u2019s presence. It has directed media attention to the Parliament, to which the public usually pays just passing attention. It has invigorated the debates on the floor. It has made a very young backbencher\u2019s speech widely seen.\n\nMuch of this is specific to German politics and doesn\u2019t necessarily offer a model for Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries facing a populist incursion in their own Parliaments. But it does show that populist parties can have a positive and invigorating effect on mainstream politics \u2014 arguably the first step toward a new turn to the center.", "title": "Opinion | So You\u2019ve Got Populists in Your Parliament.

It would replace the largely inconsequential Confederations Cup, a World Cup dress rehearsal held in the host country the year before that event.\n\nFIFA had met with representatives from clubs, leagues and players\u2019 unions in February to discuss the possibility of expanding and moving the Club World Cup, which is currently played in December, but the officials said they were provided few details before the meeting.\n\n\u201cTo be presented with FIFA\u2019s \u2018solution\u2019 as a fait accompli and claim this to be consultation defies all definitions of best practice and good governance,\u201d Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of England\u2019s Premier League, wrote to Infantino on March 9. Scudamore was writing in his capacity as chairman of the World Leagues Forum, a grouping of top leagues from four continents.\n\nSeparate letters were written to Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European soccer confederation, UEFA, by officials representing clubs and leagues on that continent. Those letters were distributed to FIFA council members at this week\u2019s meeting. Their content was similar in style and tone to Scudamore\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe must share with you our concerns in relation to the process FIFA is engaging in by presenting what appears to be a completed document without any meaningful consultation with stakeholders or indeed their agreement as the basis for discussion,\u201d Andrea Agnelli, chairman of the European Club Association, wrote Ceferin.

Four smaller regional leagues also would play matches in a spring window.\n\nBut the larger European nations argued to the FIFA Council that the new women\u2019s league could clash with existing broadcast contracts.\n\nIt is not the first time clubs and leagues have faced off with FIFA. The organization has in recent years significantly increased the amount it pays to teams that release players for the World Cup, after a dispute that followed the 2010 World Cup. Several leading clubs were angered at the time because players returned injured from the tournament.\n\nShortly after his election victory, Infantino, 47, created a new committee to provide a voice for players, coaches and club executives.

Fortress and the Vision Fund would be the main cogs, but they would exist as separate entities.\n\nRajeev Misra, a top Wall Street financial engineer who now heads the Vision Fund, will take charge of the larger company, to be based in London.\n\nHe is an unusual choice to head a large asset management firm. During a 12-year career at Deutsche Bank, Mr. Misra oversaw the creation and distribution of the complex mortgage securities that were at the heart of the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nNor does he have substantial experience in private equity or venture capital. But his expertise in devising complex financing solutions appealed to Mr. Son, one of the larger players in global debt markets.

Cash flow is its lifeblood; without it, companies cannot repay debt and pay dividends to their investors.\n\nFor example, the Vision Fund has been making big bets on start-ups like Uber, WeWork (shared workplaces) and Wag (on-demand dog care) that are known for burning through cash, not generating piles of it.\n\nUntil recently, SoftBank\u2019s fledgling investment arm was little more than a group of analysts in Tokyo and London sifting through possible deals. Buying Fortress provided the group with a template to use as it moved to becoming an actual institution, with a formal investment committee, compliance department, trading desk and investor relations unit. The new entity is now 1,000 people strong.\n\nFortress, which manages over $40 billion, is a tier or two below leaders like Blackstone. It is run by Wesley R. Edens and Peter Briger Jr., who helped found the firm.\n\nMr. Edens, who oversees the firm\u2019s private equity business from New York and is a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, is the point man for the firm\u2019s more prominent projects. These include All Aboard Florida, a private railroad company; Onemain, the country\u2019s largest subprime lender; and Nationstar, which collects mortgage payments on behalf of lenders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Briger looks after the credit and lending business.

Assets under management have gone from about $30 billion to a bit more than $40 billion.\n\nHaving worked briefly at Fortress before jumping to SoftBank in 2014, Mr. Misra is confident it can accelerate that.\n\nThe Fortress deal closed late last year and Mr. Misra plans to market Fortress-branded private equity and debt funds to contacts he and Mr. Son have in the Middle East, the source of a large chunk of Vision Fund money.

We needed to be, and still need to be, much more serious, and generous, about creating \u201cwage insurance\u201d and community reinvestment policies for people and places whose employers are suddenly wiped out by a trade shock. Because this one won\u2019t be the last.\n\nAt the same time, we need to be much more serious about using every tool we have \u2014 tax incentives, Pell grants, community colleges \u2014 to create the conditions for every American to be constantly upgrading skills and for every company to keep training its workers. That will matter whether the challenge is China or robots.\n\nToo much of the economic discussion of late \u201chas been focused on the 1 percent versus the 99 percent,\u201d observed Autor. \u201cIt\u2019s become a kind of \u2018inequality porn\u2019 \u2014 where you get so focused on those two numbers that it becomes demobilizing.

It is about the inequality in the ability to acquire those skills. Too many people live in areas where they cannot get them. If you get educated in America today, and have a good work ethic, you are going to be rewarded. What does education do? It gives you a skill set and enables you to adapt to change better. And cities and towns anchored by universities tend to reinvent themselves more easily; they\u2019re engines of adaptation.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "In the late 1950s, when Albers\u2019s husband, Josef, was heading the Department of Design at Yale University, he introduced his wife to a student who\u2019d been turned on to textiles after seeing a picture of Peruvian mummy bundles. Now in her 80s, Sheila Hicks has woven, twined and wrapped her way around the world with fiber-based bas-reliefs and installations that snake through tall grasses (on view through the end of the month on Manhattan\u2019s High Line), pile up in brilliantly colored heaps (as at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale) or cascade from high places (as in a piece planned for a 22-foot tower on Capri). Her retrospective, which opened last month at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, also showcases the small, jewel-like weavings she calls \u201cminimes,\u201d incorporating shells, rubber bands, toothpicks and hair \u2014 eccentric, lyrical poetry of the everyday.\n\nHicks is sometimes linked with other \u201960s and \u201970s post-Minimalist sculptors, including Fran\u00e7oise Grossen and Jackie Winsor, female artists who turned to fiber (often rope) both for its formal properties and its associations beyond the art world, its household and industrial applications. Other artists of that era put textiles at the center of an explicitly feminist program, using conventionally \u201cdainty\u201d handicrafts \u2014 knitting, crocheting, embroidery \u2014 to express ambivalence about childbearing, or rage at women\u2019s domestic oppression. For \u201cWomanhouse,\u201d a fabled group installation organized by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro in an abandoned Hollywood mansion in 1972, the artist Faith Wilding created a room-size net of crochet work that recalled spider webs, Gothic horror films and human tissue, including uterine lining.\n\nThese artists weren\u2019t necessarily thinking of posterity. Textiles are notoriously difficult to conserve. Some fiber artists, taking their cues from the newly insurgent genre of performance art, intended their works to be temporary. Grossen, known for her sculptures and installations of braided rope that hang from the ceiling or twist along the floor, saw many of her largest works dismantled as the spaces they were created for (building lobbies, corporate offices) were altered or changed hands. The Polish-\u200bborn artist Magdalena Abakanowicz, who for nearly three decades beginning in the 1960s created haunting abstract sculptures in burlap and sisal, began working in bronze (a more traditionally \u201cheroic\u201d medium, valued for its durability) in the late 1980s. In fact, in the hierarchy of artistic materials, textiles (with the exception of tapestries) have often occupied a lowly rank. Toward the end of her life, even Anni Albers gave away her loom and her stock of threads, turning her attention to printmaking. \u201cShe said she realized that as a textile designer or weaver she would never be admitted to the magic circle of art,\u201d Sheila Hicks recalls.\n\nYET A GENERATION later, fiber art looks fresh again. Two years ago, for example, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas purchased one of octogenarian artist, author and activist Faith Ringgold\u2019s \u201cstory quilts\u201d for $461,000 \u2014 a record (times 30) for the artist. The quilts, which the painter began making in 1980 \u2014 inspired by Tibetan thangkas, her seamstress and designer mother and her great-great-great-grandmother, who quilted as a slave \u2014 combine painted canvas, fabric piecework and handwritten text to reclaim unexplored corners of African-American life and history. And for emerging artists, fiber offers renewed possibilities of eloquence and emotivity. Sophia Narrett, a recent Rhode Island School of Design graduate whose solo exhibition of embroideries opens at Brooklyn\u2019s BRIC Arts/Media center in May, wrote in an email, \u201cWhen an object is developed by human hands for hundreds of hours, it leaves a quality in the surface that can be sensed.\u201d Her wall hangings, stitched with cotton thread in a lush, painterly style, detail surreal encounters \u2014 naked figures cavorting in basements and woodlands; immolated princesses. Their hand-worked surfaces make them seem intimate and vulnerable, in keeping with her art\u2019s themes. \u201cThis physical commitment is a part of how I communicate my sincerity,\u201d Narrett explained. \u201cEmbroidery and its implicit history help specify the tone of my stories, one characterized by obsession, desire and both the freedoms and restraints of femininity.\u201d\n\nJane Austen, who sat writing \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d in a drawing room corner as her women friends whiled away the hours embroidering, might have arched an eyebrow. Can we really fight patriarchy with weapons borrowed from the history of upper-and-middle-class women\u2019s confinement? But then one remembers the one million knit \u201cpussy hats\u201d that appeared at last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March in Washington. Pussy hat co-creator Jayna Zweiman learned to knit while in architecture school and returned to it while recovering from an injury. \u201cI went with my friend Krista to a knitting store and discovered a place where you could be with people and listen,\u201d she said on the phone from L.A. \u201cThings kind of flow, and everyone is supportive.

Hoping to end the separatist challenge, Mr. Rajoy then called the election, which instead left Catalonia in a political deadlock.\n\nSince then, Mr. Rajoy has repeatedly called on the separatists to form a new government that recognizes Spanish sovereignty and is not led by one of the politicians indicted by Spain\u2019s judiciary. After the failed attempt to elect Mr. Turull, the separatist parties now have two months to form a government or force Catalonia to hold a new election, a possibility that Mr. Rajoy said Friday that he hoped to avoid.\n\nThe case against Catalan separatists is now led by Judge Llarena from the Supreme Court, but two other courts, one in Madrid and another in Barcelona, are also investigating officials accused of civil disobedience and other offenses, including organizing the independence referendum held last October, even after it was declared illegal by Madrid.\n\nProsecutors want the main Catalan politicians to stand trial before the end of the year, but it is unclear whether Spain\u2019s judiciary will be able to force the extradition of those who have fled the country. Judge Llarena is reactivating an arrest warrant that he dropped last year against Mr. Puigdemont and other former members of his cabinet, amid concerns that courts in Belgium, where he fled, would instead soften the charges against them.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Puigdemont agreed to drop his bid for re-election.

The issue of independence not only has generated a conflict with Madrid but also has split Catalan society.\n\nIn December, separatist lawmakers won 47.5 percent of the votes, but that was enough for them to keep their majority of parliamentary seats, under a system of proportional representation that favors their dominance in rural areas.", "title": "Spanish Judge Jails 5 Catalan Leaders in a Blow to Secessionist Movement", "authors": []}

When you read discussions of op-ed writers you see that we\u2019re often not thought of as individual thinkers, but as spokesmen who are here to represent a point of view. People get upset when a certain group is not represented on the page.\n\nI\u2019m searching for a line here, a distinction. Under what circumstances should we embrace the idea that collective identity shapes our thinking? Under what circumstances should we resist collective identity and insist on the primacy of individual discretion, and our common humanity?\n\nOn the one hand, the drive to bring in formerly marginalized groups has obviously been one of the great achievements of our era. When you put together a panel discussion or a work team, even on a subject like oncology, you don\u2019t want to have a bunch of white males sitting up there. We know that something valuable will be lost.\n\nWider inclusion has vastly improved public debate. For example, in the 1990s, African-Americans strongly supported tougher criminal justice laws. Now opinion has shifted and a majority of African-Americans strongly oppose them. That shift, born out of a direct and unique experience, reveals that, say, mandatory minimum sentencing laws have had harsh unintended effects.\n\nBut other times, group identity seems irrelevant to many issues. How does being gay shape your view of U.S.-German relations or breaking up big tech? How does being Latina influence how you read a black writer like St. Augustine?\n\nAnd there are other times when collective thinking seems positively corrupting. Why are people\u2019s views of global warming, genetically modified foods and other scientific issues strongly determined by political label? That seems ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m a columnist and I\u2019m supposed to come to a conclusion, but I\u2019m confused.\n\nOur whole education system is based on the idea that we train individuals to be critical thinkers. Our political system is based on the idea that persuasion and deliberation lead to compromise and toward truth. The basis of human dignity is our capacity to make up our own minds. One of the things I\u2019ve learned in a lifetime in journalism is that people are always more unpredictable than their categories.\n\nBut the notion that group membership determines opinion undermines all that. If it\u2019s just group against group, deliberation is a sham, beliefs are just masks groups use to preserve power structures, and democracy is a fraud.

But in 2014, the State of Indiana \u2014 under Mike Pence, then governor and now vice president \u2014 began requiring applicants to affirm their citizenship or \u201cqualified alien\u201d status on WIC intake forms. Women immediately began refusing to enroll, said Colleen Batt, an Indiana WIC agency director at the time.\n\nThroughout the first year of the Trump presidency, agencies in regions with high immigrant populations have reported canceled appointments, urgent requests for disenrollment and even subsequent requests to have any record of families purged from the database.\n\nImmigrants who have withdrawn from these services are reluctant to speak out about their plight owing to fears that identifying themselves publicly could result in legal repercussions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn New Jersey, three neighboring counties \u2014 Union, Essex and Hudson \u2014 have immigrant populations above 25 percent, according to census data. In those counties, participation in some elements of the Community FoodBank of New Jersey\u2019s outreach programming fell by almost half between 2016 and 2017, according to Julienne Cherry, the bank\u2019s director of agency relations.\n\nAs of November 2017, the New Jersey SNAP program also reported a decrease of 8.1 percent in statewide participants over a one-year period. Enrollment rates in Essex and Union Counties had dropped by more than 10 percent.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, Florida saw a 9.6 percent decrease in WIC participation over the one-year period from November 2016 to 2017. Texas lost 7.4 percent of WIC participants \u2014 and some offices in heavily Spanish-speaking communities there say they are considering laying off employees because of the drastically decreasing caseload.\n\nAdele LaTourette, the director of the New Jersey Anti-Hunger Coalition, said a church food pantry specifically organized as a safe space for immigrants has seen \u201cunprecedented decline,\u201d as have reduced-cost breakfast and lunch programs in schools. Ms. LaTourette, who also convenes the New Jersey SNAP Working Group and serves on the state\u2019s WIC Advisory Council, said the same concerns have echoed through every round-table discussion she has led for nutrition services since the start of the administration.\n\nNational WIC Association members in California, New York and Colorado have aired similar complaints.\n\nSome local agencies have begun planning training to help their staff navigate what could be ahead: interactions with immigration enforcement agents, increasingly anxious clients and final regulations. But they say they know \u2014 just as the White House does \u2014 that as the fear factor among immigrants outpaces the administration\u2019s crackdown, the question of whether new public charge policies ever come to fruition is, in some ways, irrelevant.", "title": "Spooked by Trump Proposals, Immigrants Abandon Public Nutrition Services", "authors": ["Emily Baumgaertner"]}

{"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "Hikes in early March are all about searching for spring. The coldest, bleakest part of winter is over, days are lengthening, and the ephemeral signs of spring are already evident. Tree buds are swollen, but still mostly shut. Only the hardiest frogs and salamanders are testing the edges of still largely frozen vernal pools. Half submerged in icy water, and calling for mates, spring peepers and wood frogs have particularly poignant voices. Spring is here, but barely.\n\nThe leaves of partridgeberry are ready for the season opener, however. The tiny trailing vine has actually been green all winter, but it doesn\u2019t climb and seems content to hide below the forest\u2019s leaf litter. At this time of year, its stems begin to creep toward the light, revealing a few tiny, white-striped leaves between all the brown mulch. The elongating stems gradually clear an opening in the detritus, never growing more to an inch or two above it.\n\nPartridgeberry, Mitchella repens, takes its name from its beautiful bright red berries, which start to form in early summer. Though it is eaten by many herbivores, there is no evidence that either the plant or its berries are any more popular than other woodland food sources for \u201cpartridges,\u201d which I generalize to be any woodland bird. Small rodents, like white-footed mice, eat the berries, but again, seem to show no preference for them. Humans, too, can eat berries, but despite the good looks, most people find them virtually tasteless. A few I\u2019ve tasted reminded me of a slightly bitter cucumber. Little wonder that the vines always seem to have a few remaining berries, even after winter has reduced the local rodents to dependence on survival foods.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t mind dirty knees and a quick biology lesson, the berries display a curious feature. In late spring, partridgeberry produces paired flowers, and each has a separate ovary. Only if both flowers are fertilized, the ovaries swell and fuse to become what is essentially a double berry. For this reason, partridgeberries are often more oval than circular. Before you taste one, look for its two small holes, each looking similar to the bottom of an apple, where the two flowers fell, from the ripening fruit. You might even find the dried remains of the flowers still clinging to the fruit, or nearby, in late summer or early fall.", "title": "Spring Awakens!

And as in years past, travelers looked to classics like Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico for their early spring getaways \u2014 even as the islands are recovering from hurricanes and the State Department has issued travel warnings about Mexico.\n\nIn North America, searches for January, February and March showed that Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, and Mexico City were among the top five long-haul destinations, along with London and Paris, according to Sojern, the travel research and marketing company. The most popular short-haul destinations were Miami, New York City, Orlando, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nOther industry groups have reported similar findings. Allianz Global Assistance, a travel insurance provider, said its own analysis of travelers\u2019 plans showed Orlando and Canc\u00fan to be the most popular domestic and international destinations for spring break (which the company defined as Feb. 23 through April 16).

Below, a look at the latest developments and coming changes.\n\nFirst things first: Passports\n\nBeginning April 2, the execution fee for a United States passport (which is in addition to the $110 application fee for a passport book) will increase to $35 from $25 for some travelers, including first-time passport applicants over the age of 16, children under 16 and people who are reapplying after reporting their passport lost or stolen.\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re eligible to renew your passport by mail (using an online form called the DS-82) rather than in-person at a post office or with a court clerk, you still pay the usual application fee ($110 for a passport book), but not the $35 execution fee. To find out if you\u2019re eligible to renew by mail, visit Travel.state.gov.\n\nNext: Changes at airport gates\n\nIn March, San Diego International Airport introduced an app called AtYourGate, a mobile ordering and delivery service that enables passengers to request food (from airport restaurants like Panda Express and Jack-in-the-Box) or an item they may have forgotten to pack (Dramamine, a phone charger, OK! magazine) through their smartphones and have everything delivered to them at their departure gate or elsewhere in the terminal. Before you check out through the app, you can get an estimate of the delivery time, and see the fee. For instance, on a Wednesday afternoon, while contemplating a foam neck pillow from the CNBC News airport store, I could see that delivery would take about 20 to 35 minutes, and that there would be $2.99 delivery charge.", "title": "Springtime Changes at the Airport", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "Where is Trump getting his misinformation? Probably from Peter Navarro, his trade czar, whose star is clearly rising. And the story of Navarro\u2019s rise tells you a lot about the nature of the Trump administration \u2014 a place that rewards sycophants who tell the boss what he wants to hear.\n\nFirst, how was Navarro recruited? According to reporting in Vanity Fair by Sarah Ellison, now at The Washington Post, during the campaign Trump told Jared Kushner to find some research supporting his protectionist trade views. Kushner responded by going on Amazon, where he found a book titled \u201cDeath by China.\u201d So he cold-called Navarro, one of the book\u2019s authors, who became the campaign\u2019s first economic adviser.\n\nNavarro has an economics Ph.D. but holds views very much at odds with the mainstream. True, taking advice from a heterodox figure can sometimes work out well, since orthodoxy isn\u2019t always right. But giving heterodox views a hearing only works if the people seeking advice are themselves open-minded thinkers, willing to put in the hard work of understanding opposing views and assessing the evidence. If this sounds to you like a description of Donald Trump, you might want to seek professional help.\n\nIn fact, Navarro\u2019s nonmainstream views mainly seem to involve basic conceptual and factual errors. One of these errors, which bears directly on the Trump-Europe spat, is a complete misunderstanding of the trade effects of value-added taxes (VATs), which the U.S. doesn\u2019t have but play a large role in most European countries\u2019 revenue.\n\nIn Navarro\u2019s version of the world, for example as expressed in a campaign white paper, VATs give European companies a huge, unfair trade advantage. U.S. products sold in Europe have to pay VAT \u2014 for example, they must pay a 19 percent tax if sold in Germany. This, says the white paper, is just like an import tariff. Meanwhile, German producers pay no VAT on goods they sell in America; this, the paper says, is just like an export subsidy. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what Trump means when he talks about \u201chorrific\u201d tariffs.", "title": "Opinion | Springtime for Sycophants", "authors": []}

In the group are ethnic Armenian and Assyrian Christians, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians, most of whom have relatives in the United States who sponsored them.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with calls from concerned family,\u201d said Martin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s office in Los Angeles, home to the largest Armenian community in the country.\n\nThe denials have drawn rebukes from religious leaders, human rights groups and lawmakers from both parties, who charge the United States with failing to live up to its promises and who say the applicants risk arrest and torture if they return home.\n\nRefugee arrivals have slowed to a trickle since President Trump, who took office vowing to overhaul immigration, cut the number of people that the United States agreed to admit. But Mr. Trump also promised to protect religious minorities, particularly Christians, and his administration has condemned Iran\u2019s treatment of them.\n\nEnacted in 1989 to enable Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union to settle in the United States as refugees, the Lautenberg Amendment was expanded in 2003 to include Iranian religious minorities. Austria agreed to serve as a transit point. The applicants cannot work, attend school or receive government benefits while they wait for the United States to process their cases.\n\nAmong those denied visas in recent weeks are several elderly and disabled people.

Like the Baha\u2019i, Mandeans, who follow the teachings of John the Baptist, lack even the nominal protections of the Iranian Constitution and are thus particularly vulnerable to persecution and pressure to convert to Islam.\n\nAmong the Mandeans marooned in Vienna are three relatives of Peiman Khamisi of Batavia, Ill., who arrived through the Lautenberg Amendment nine years ago. In Iran, his relatives pretended to be Muslim to avoid harassment, performed religious rites in secret and were denied access to higher education, he said.\n\nIn late January, Representatives Randy Hultgren, Republican of Illinois, and James McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairmen of the House human rights commission, urged Vice President Mike Pence to expedite approvals for the Iranians.\n\nAfter the denials, they called on the Department of Homeland Security to provide an explanation. \u201cThese Iranians are members of religious minorities fleeing a regime that has brutally oppressed their communities since 1979,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cThis being the case, they should be presumed eligible for admittance to the United States as refugees under the Lautenberg Amendment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the amendment, the government must justify a denial \u201cto the maximum extent feasible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut no reason was given, at least not to those stranded in Austria, or to their relatives in the United States.

Once in Vienna, they continue the screening process, pass interviews with Homeland Security and undergo medical exams. Typically, it takes a few months to complete the process, and the approval rate is close to 100 percent.\n\nA State Department spokeswoman said in an email that changes to the United States refugee admissions program in 2016 resulted in \u201ca greater number of denials in the Vienna refugee program.\u201d She did not elaborate, but other government officials said that the changes entailed enhanced vetting.\n\nThe rejections, she said, were unrelated to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders barring people from several majority-Muslim countries, including Iran, from entering the country. She added that the United States, Austria and others were working together to find alternatives for the group.\n\nSince 2003, about 30,000 Iranians have settled in the United States thanks to the Lautenberg program. In the fiscal year that ended in September, 1,275 Iranians were admitted, compared with 2,323 the previous year. Another 4,500 still in Iran have registered for the program.\n\nRefugee resettlement officials said that evangelical Christians, who make up more than 90 percent of the Lautenberg pool and hail mainly from Ukraine, continue to arrive as usual.\n\nSome of the Iranians have begun to file appeals with the help of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a nonprofit in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoharek Garmemasihi, an ethnic Armenian Christian in Los Angeles, said that she had sponsored her brother, sister-in-law, niece and nephew.

Thousands of families, mostly Tamil, are still looking for loved ones who were forcibly disappeared or trying to take back land taken over by the military.\n\nOne recent example of how tense relations remain was an episode involving the country\u2019s military attach\u00e9 to the United Kingdom. From the steps of the Sri Lankan high commission in London, video cameras captured Brig. Priyanka Fernando, who was in uniform, making a throat-slitting gesture to Tamil protesters gathered there, which many saw as a threat.\n\nThe foreign ministry suspended him from his job but the president stepped in to reinstate him.\n\nEventually, Brigadier Fernando was recalled from London \u2014 not to be disciplined but for his own security, the army said.", "title": "Sri Lanka Declares State of Emergency After Mob Attacks on Muslims", "authors": ["Mujib Mashal", "Dharisha Bastians"]}

Those rebels later ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, a staunch ally of the United States, who was once praised by American officials as a leading partner in the fight against terrorism.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Yemen\u2019s neighbor and a major regional power, began a concerted bombing campaign in early 2015 to help push back the Houthis. But that campaign has long raised the ire of human rights organizations for repeated bombings on civilians, something the Pentagon has admitted it has little oversight of.\n\nOne of the last acts of the Obama administration, in December 2016, was to block a transfer of precision munitions to Saudi Arabia because of concerns about civilian casualties that American officials attributed to poor targeting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat decision blocked the sale by Raytheon of about 16,000 guided munitions kits, which upgrade so-called dumb bombs to smart bombs.

Colbert was thrilled to hear Clifford\u2019s account of her alleged affair with President Trump \u2014 but even the juiciest details didn\u2019t shock him.\n\n\u201cThe interview covered everything: The president had sex with a porn star, she spanked him with a magazine with his face on it, he didn\u2019t wear a condom, later they watched \u2018Shark Week,\u2019 then his lawyer paid her to keep her mouth shut, and now Trump\u2019s suing this porn star for $20 million. It\u2019s an insane, salacious tale about a sitting president \u2014 and the least surprising story I have ever heard.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cIt all felt real, it all felt true. That felt truer than him getting elected.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nAt one point in the interview, Clifford described turning the tables on Trump. Early in their first romantic encounter, she said, she suggested the president should stop talking about himself as much, and spanked him with a magazine featuring his photograph. After that, she said, Trump opened up to her, and started acting \u201cmore appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, a couple of spanks and Donald Trump started acting more appropriate.

Whether Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving and Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry will be ready when the postseason starts seems doubtful.\n\nThe Celtics said that Irving would need three to six weeks to recover from a procedure performed on Saturday to relieve irritation on his left knee, that news coming almost simultaneously with word that Curry has a sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left knee. The Warriors said Curry, who was hurt when his teammate JaVale McGee fell awkwardly into him during a victory on Friday night, would be evaluated again in three weeks.\n\nBased on those timetables, it would appear that both the Celtics and the Warriors will not only be without their All-Star point guards for the rest of the regular season, but very easily could still be without them for when their first-round playoff matchups begin on April 14 or 15.\n\nIn the short term, it would seem that being without Irving or Curry for the final games of the regular season will not have a pronounced effect on either club. Boston is fairly well locked into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs, trailing East-leading Toronto by 4\u00bd games but leading Cleveland by six. Golden State, four games behind first-place Houston in the Western Conference and 10 ahead of third-place Portland, will almost certainly finish No. 2 in the West.", "title": "Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving Are Sidelined by Knee Problems", "authors": []}

But it is also a measure of the amount of information \u2014 the number of bits \u2014 needed to describe what is in a black hole. Curiously, the number of bits is proportional to the black hole\u2019s surface area, not its volume, meaning that the amount of information you could stuff into a black hole is limited by its area, not, as one might think, its volume.\n\nThat result has become a litmus test for string theory and other pretenders to a theory of quantum gravity. It has also led to speculations that we live in a holographic universe, in which three-dimensional space is some kind of illusion.\n\nAndrew Strominger, a Harvard string theorist, said of the holographic theory, \u201cIf it\u2019s really true, it\u2019s a deep and beautiful property of our universe \u2014 but not an obvious one.\u201d\n\nTo \u2018Know the Mind of God\u2019\n\nThe discovery of black hole radiation also led to a 30-year controversy over the fate of things that had fallen into a black hole.\n\nDr. Hawking initially said that detailed information about whatever had fallen in would be lost forever because the particles coming out would be completely random, erasing whatever patterns had been present when they first fell in. Paraphrasing Einstein\u2019s complaint about the randomness inherent in quantum mechanics, Dr. Hawking said, \u201cGod not only plays dice with the universe, but sometimes throws them where they can\u2019t be seen.\u201d\n\nMany particle physicists protested that this violated a tenet of quantum physics, which says that knowledge is always preserved and can be retrieved. Leonard Susskind, a Stanford physicist who carried on the argument for decades, said, \u201cStephen correctly understood that if this was true, it would lead to the downfall of much of 20th-century physics.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, he characterized Dr. Hawking to his face as \u201cone of the most obstinate people in the world; no, he is the most infuriating person in the universe.\u201d Dr. Hawking grinned.", "title": "Stephen Hawking Dies at 76; His Mind Roamed the Cosmos", "authors": []}

That, he always said, was media hype, driven by the public\u2019s thirst for heroes.\n\nAs someone who might have contributed in some small way over the years to this impression, I have to say I agree.

He discovered that black holes, the fearsome hungry pits of bottomless gravity, were not final death but would leak and radiate, eventually exploding, recycling matter and energy in ways that still challenge physicists\u2019 understanding.\n\nDr. Hawking often said that he wanted a formula describing what is called Hawking radiation \u2014 a fizz of particles and energy appearing to come from the surface of a black hole \u2014 engraved on his tombstone.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "Stephen could compose his sentences at a rate of only about six words a minute. At first I would sit impatiently, daydreaming on and off as I waited for him to finish his composition. But then one day I was looking over his shoulder at his computer screen, where the sentence he was constructing was visible, and I started thinking about his evolving reply. By the time he had completed it, I had had several minutes to ponder the ideas he was expressing.\n\nThis was a great help. It allowed me to more profoundly consider his remarks, and it enabled my own ideas, and my reactions to his, to percolate as they never could have in an ordinary conversation.\n\nWhen I argued a point of physics with Stephen, I always lost. I would scribble equations on a pad or a whiteboard, trying to sway him, but when I was done, I would find that the answer was the one he had already worked out in his head.\n\nHe was no less certain in his ideas about how to write our books, though when we disagreed on those matters, there was no right or wrong answer, only preference. And so we might argue at length \u2014 on one occasion we did so for two hours \u2014 over a single sentence.\n\nThere was an important difference between us here. Making my arguments took little effort. To oppose my ideas, Stephen had to struggle to type every letter of every word. Yet it was I, not he, who ceded points out of exhaustion. Once, during a particularly heated discussion, I waited several minutes for him to respond, and then, when his response finally came, it was a joke. Even when contemplating the cosmic, he had a keen sense of the comic.\n\nStephen\u2019s expertise was gravitation, the weakest of the four fundamental forces of the universe. Yet Stephen himself was a strong force. When, as a student, he started his work on black holes, most scientists thought it was a dead-end field. His doctors made a similar assessment regarding his prospects in life.\n\nProving people wrong turned out to be his strength \u2014 and his gift to all of us.", "title": "Opinion | Stephen Hawking, Force of Nature", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "So here\u2019s the thought experiment: Throw a book into the black hole. The book carries information. Perhaps that information is about physics, perhaps that information is the plot of a romance novel \u2014 it could be any kind of information. But as far as anyone knows, the outgoing Hawking radiation is the same no matter what went into the black hole. The information is apparently lost \u2014 where did it go?\n\nThus we have the \u201cblack hole information loss puzzle,\u201d perhaps Dr. Hawking\u2019s most profound gift to physics. At issue is the fate of the principle of the conservation of information. Without general relativity, quantum mechanics predicts that information is conserved; likewise, without quantum mechanics, general relativity predicts that information is conserved, even if some of it is hidden inside a black hole. It is therefore bothersome that putting the two theories together seems to lead to information just disappearing.\n\nFor a long time Dr. Hawking argued, against the intuition of most other leading physicists, that information was simply erased from the universe, and we would have to learn to deal with it. But eventually he changed his mind (something he always was admirably willing to do), conceding in 2004 that information was probably somehow retained in the outgoing radiation. The matter, however, is very far from settled.\n\nDr. Hawking\u2019s information-loss thought experiment is the single biggest clue we have to how quantum gravity might operate. Even if we don\u2019t have the full theory yet, we know a lot about quantum mechanics and a lot about gravity. Together those are enough to convince us that Hawking radiation is real, even if it has never been directly observed. This means that any eventual theory of quantum gravity will have to explain either how information somehow escapes from black holes or how it is destroyed.\n\nBlack-hole radiation and the information-loss puzzle were certainly not Dr. Hawking\u2019s only contributions to modern physics. Back on the firmer ground of classical relativity, he proved a number of fundamental theorems about the behavior of black holes and the expansion of the universe. On the more speculative side, Dr. Hawking and the physicist James Hartle proposed a candidate for the \u201cwave function of the universe,\u201d the quantum state describing all of reality. In between, Dr. Hawking found time to make contributions to deep questions like the origin of structure in the universe and whether it is possible to build a time machine. (It\u2019s not, he argued.)\n\nHe did all of this, of course, in addition to reaching a broad popular audience and sharing with it his passion for physics and the mysteries of the universe. Dr. Hawking was an extraordinarily influential scientist, as well as a courageous and determined human being. He has left us a lot to think about.", "title": "Opinion | Stephen Hawking\u2019s Most Profound Gift to Physics", "authors": []}

Hawking, 1942-2018: Seated, He Explored Universe and Awed World\u201d (front page, March 15): Stephen Hawking, the author of \u201cA Brief History of Time,\u201d had a remarkable gift for timing. He was born on the 300th anniversary of the death of Galileo. It was also a time when the Nazis were killing handicapped people. Yet during his lifetime, people with physical limitations were increasingly accepted and accommodated.\n\nAs his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressed, computer technology did, too, allowing him to continue to contribute to our understanding of the universe. The development of general relativity and quantum mechanics opened the door to the study of black holes.\n\nHis most renowned discovery, \u201cHawking radiation,\u201d resulted serendipitously from a dispute he lost with another young theoretical physicist, Jacob Bekenstein, over whether black holes had entropy.\n\nEven his entry into celebrity owed a nod to timing: The Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg\u2019s book \u201cThe First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe\u201d (1977) and Carl Sagan\u2019s book and PBS series \u201cCosmos\u201d (1980) set a precedent for theoretical physicists and astrophysicists writing about cosmology for a general audience.

Pinker is particularly sharp on the dangers of ignoring or overriding the systems that make nuclear war unlikely.\n\nHaving said this, he argues that catastrophism is itself a risk \u2014 that is, the pessimistic tendency to fix on the worst imaginable outcome, and to panic. Authoritarian populism itself has fed on the feeling that everything is going wrong: that crime and terrorism have run amok, that immigration is disastrous and that the world has lost its ethical direction in some terrible way. Meanwhile, fear and despair play havoc with the opposition too. In general, people are more likely to work constructively if they think problems are solvable, or that progress has already been made and can be extended. As Pinker says, considering the fact that we have not yet blown the world up in a nuclear war, our best approach is \u201cto figure out what has gone right, so we can do more of whatever it is.\u201d Optimism does not mean lying back and relaxing. He cites the economist Paul Romer, who distinguishes the \u201ccomplacent optimism\u201d of a child waiting for presents with the \u201cconditional optimism\u201d of a child who wants a treehouse, and gets hold of the wood and nails to make one. Someone who thinks a treehouse is impossible, or assumes someone will instantly come and knock it down, is unlikely ever to start hammering.\n\nThis book will attract some hammering itself: It contains something to upset almost everyone. When not attacking the populist right, Pinker lays into leftist intellectuals. He is especially scathing about newspaper editorialists who, in 2016, fell over themselves in their haste to proclaim the death of Enlightenment values and the advent of \u201cpost-truth.\u201d His (rather too broadly painted) targets include humanities professors, postmodernists, the politically correct and anyone who has something nice to say about Friedrich Nietzsche. \u201cProgressive\u201d thinkers seem to consider progress a bad thing, he claims; they reject as crass or na\u00efve \u201cthe notion that we should apply our collective reason to enhance flourishing and reduce suffering.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there may already be signs of a change in mood, with chirps of optimism being heard from varied directions. The musician David Byrne has just launched a web project entitled \u201cReasons to Be Cheerful,\u201d celebrating positive initiatives in the realms of culture, science, transportation, civic engagement and so on. Quartz, a business journalism site, ended 2017 with a list of 99 cheerful links to the year\u2019s good news: snow leopards being taken off the endangered species list; a province in Pakistan planting a billion trees over the last two years as a response to the 2015 floods; a dramatic fall in sufferers from the hideous Guinea worm (from 3.5 million in 1986 to just 30 in 2017); and a slow but steady increase in women holding parliamentary seats worldwide, from 12 percent in 1997 to 23 percent now.", "title": "Steven Pinker Continues to See the Glass Half Full", "authors": []}

Monday was a good example. Stocks plunged initially on news that Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, had resigned, only to recover those losses by the end of the day.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing extreme volatility here \u2014 it is the Goldman Sachs business model,\u201d said Adam Sender, the founder of Sender Company & Partners, a hedge fund the specializes in making quick bets in up-and-down markets. \u201cThings are moving around like crazy \u2014 the opportunities are tremendous.\u201d\n\nMr. Sender was so frustrated by the long period of markets grinding higher, absent any sharp moves, that he simply stopped trading last November and took a three-week tour of Sweden, Iceland and Japan.\n\n\u201cIt made me sick looking at my screen all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was wasting time.\u201d\n\nNo longer. On a day last week when stocks plunged, Mr. Sender was in and out of the market all day \u2014 buying a stock here, betting it would fall there.\n\nOf course, a choppy, fun-to-trade market could easily turn ugly if the economy suddenly slows or a trade war erupts with China, to name just two risks. And these days of roiled markets might not last, or the volatility could grow so severe that traders seeking to profit from the turbulence are instead capsized by it.\n\nAfter the stock market plunged in early February, Charlie McElligott, a derivatives strategist at Nomura, said that his clients were eager to put on trades that would capitalize on increased volatility.\n\nBut by last week, when markets plunged again, many of those same investors had had enough. They sold their shares in a panic, trying to cut their losses. \u201cIt is the second sell-off that scares you \u2014 there has been a change in psyche,\u201d Mr. McElligott said. \u201cPeople were burned when they bought the dip.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestors who make bets on stocks, currencies and bonds based on where they think the overall economy is headed argue that the recent market spasms are healthy, if nerve-rattling, for the financial system.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When that happens, investors largely remove the prospect of losing money on an investment from their calculations.\n\nTraders say that much of the selling in recent weeks has come from funds that gambled that markets would remain calm. When they instead became volatile, the funds \u2014 many of them programmed to automatically buy or sell based on computer-driven strategies \u2014 started selling en masse. The clearest manifestation of the heightened volatility is an index known as the VIX, whose levels have doubled in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe machines had taken control \u2014 now they are selling everything,\u201d said Philippe Jabre, founder and chief investment officer of Jabre Capital in Geneva, which manages $1.5 billion in assets.\n\nMr. Jabre made his name as a hedge fund investor in the 1990s, a time when markets were turbulent and unpredictable. He pointed out that higher volatility does not necessarily mean lower markets; they are just more challenging to navigate. That was why he got into the business in the first place. \u201cWe have made our name in these up-and-down cycles,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are more interesting today because we are more nimble and we can find great picks.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, there has been a vast migration of investor money \u2014 more than $1 trillion, analysts estimate \u2014 from funds run by stock pickers to those, such as exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that are designed to track major market indexes.\n\nSuddenly, funds that have human beings in charge of investment decisions are looking more attractive to anxious investors.\n\n\u201cLast year, people were saying, \u2018Why am I paying all this money to a hedge fund? I can just buy an E.T.F.,\u2019\u201d said Said Haidar of Haidar Capital, a hedge fund in New York with $440 million under management. \u201cBut with all this volatility, you might want someone who can trade around these markets.\u201d\n\nIn other words, investors are now looking for hedge funds \u2014 investment vehicles that engage in a wide range of trading, including making bets that markets will fall \u2014 to actually live up to their names and offer protection, or hedges, against falling stock markets. That could mean, for example, buying stocks that didn\u2019t benefit from the bull market and thus are less likely to fall as sharply as the broader index.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is the strategy being followed by Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer for Forester Capital Management in Chicago.\n\nHis fund used to manage $250 million. It\u2019s now down to $40 million. When markets seem to go up forever, the very idea of protecting your downside, thus missing out on returns, seems foolish to many \u2014 and that was what Mr. Forester was doing.\n\nIn the past month, though, Mr. Forester\u2019s phone has started ringing. Wary investors want to give him their money, and he is finally seeing stocks that might be cheap enough to buy.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer watching reruns,\u201d Mr. Forester said, referring to the stock market\u2019s regular rise each year. \u201cYour stomach starts churning, it\u2019s more dicey \u2014 but it is a lot more fun.\u201d", "title": "Stock Markets Are Scary.

It proceeded despite an arbitrator\u2019s ruling reaffirming an agreement that she reached with Mr. Trump in October 2016 to remain silent about their alleged relationship in exchange for $130,000.\n\nShe has said she had a consensual relationship with Mr. Trump that started in 2006 and lasted several months.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has led a publicity blitz, appearing frequently on cable news shows, since she filed a lawsuit on March 6 seeking to break her 2016 agreement. She asserts that the nondisclosure agreement was void because Mr. Trump did not personally sign it.\n\nThat lawsuit came after Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyer who said he paid her $130,000 legally pressured her to stay silent. Days before Ms. Clifford sued, Mr. Cohen secretly obtained a temporary restraining through an arbitrator in California to prevent her from speaking about her alleged affair.\n\nMr. Avenatti wrote in a letter to Mr. Cohen on Monday that Ms. Clifford would be willing to pay back the $130,000 to end the deal to stay quiet. The offer had a deadline of noon Tuesday for Mr. Cohen to answer, which came and went.\n\nHer interview with Mr. Cooper raised the prospect that Mr. Cohen might seek an injunction to stop CBS News from showing it. Over the weekend, CBS said it had not received any legal threats.", "title": "Stormy Daniels Interview to Air on \u201860 Minutes\u2019 This Month", "authors": []}

Bennett, the Washington lawyer who represented Mr. Clinton in the Paula Jones case. The questions could include, \u201cHave you paid other people money?\u201d he said.\n\nDavid A. Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, said the lawsuit Ms. Clifford filed on Tuesday centered on a limited contract law matter, but he noted that it also specifically stated that Ms. Clifford would amend her complaint in the future to add the names of people who she said participated in wrongdoing with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen.\n\nHe suggested that Ms. Clifford and her lawyer might be starting with a narrow argument aimed at getting the contract declared invalid, perhaps intending to broaden it later to include claims that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen coerced her into silence. \u201cIf that happened,\u201d he said, \u201cthey certainly could seek to depose Trump.\u201d\n\nAnd in that case, he said, \u201cI can certainly imagine how it might get broader. And if it did, the wide array of Trump\u2019s sexual interactions could be addressed, just as the wide array of Clinton\u2019s sexual interactions was addressed in the Paula Jones case deposition.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGetting into a public court setting, however, is a big hurdle.\n\n\u201cIf the parties agreed to binding arbitration, they have waived their right to file a lawsuit,\u201d said H. Christopher Bartolomucci, a law partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington who previously worked in the White House as associate counsel to President George W. Bush. Ms. Clifford\u2019s signature on the contract, and acceptance of the money, could count as a clear sign of agreement.\n\nBut other legal experts were struck by the sweeping nature of the nondisclosure agreement Ms. Clifford signed, and expressed skepticism that it would hold up in court. Beyond the circumstances of the alleged sexual relationship, the agreement barred her from doing anything, even indirectly, to \u201cpublicly disparage\u201d Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Noble, a former top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission who is now the general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group. \u201cWhat she signed amounts to a gag order, and she has rights if this agreement is not found to be valid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Avenatti is building his case on what he calls \u201csloppy\u201d lawyering by Mr. Cohen, dating to October 2016 when Mr. Cohen negotiated the agreement for Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence. Ms. Clifford has claimed that she met Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006 and began a relationship that included sex and promises from Mr. Trump to get her on his NBC show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and to give her a condominium. A close friend of hers, Keith Munyan, confirmed several of those details in an interview this week, saying he heard Mr. Trump offer her the apartment when Ms. Clifford invited him to eavesdrop on the conversation. Mr. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nMr. Avenatti\u2019s argument hinges on a blank signature line by the alias used for Mr. Trump, David Dennison, on the contract. Ms. Clifford, identified as \u201cPeggy Peterson,\u201d and Mr. Cohen, representing the shell company he used to facilitate the payment, both signed the document. Mr. Avenatti argues that because Mr. Trump did not sign it himself, the agreement is invalid \u2014 a point Mr. Super, the Georgetown professor, basically agreed with and Mr. Noble said might have merit.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe initial contract is not confined to the commitments Ms. Clifford makes to Mr. Trump \u2014 to never speak of their affair and to relinquish any material she might have relating to him, like emails, photos and video. It also includes commitments Mr. Trump makes to her, such as a promise not to take any legal action against her for her claims.\n\nSo, Mr. Avenatti argues, Mr. Cohen is improperly acting as a stand-in for Mr. Trump as he seeks to enforce the deal, including the provision he cited in bringing the temporary restraining order.\n\nThe extent to which Mr. Cohen was acting on his own in striking the agreement with Ms. Clifford and paying her is crucial not only to Ms. Clifford\u2019s case but also to the complaint against the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization filed with the Federal Election Commission. That complaint, brought by Common Cause, alleges that Ms. Clifford was bought off because she posed a threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential prospects, and argues that the $130,000 payment was effectively a contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign that should have been reported to the commission. Common Cause has also filed a complaint with the Justice Department demanding an investigation.\n\nImportant factors in the case would include just how closely Mr. Cohen coordinated the payment to Ms. Clifford with Mr. Trump and whether it was intended to help the campaign avoid negative publicity.\n\nMr. Cohen has said that he \u201cfacilitated\u201d the payment with his own money and was not reimbursed by Mr. Trump\u2019s company or campaign, and that the payment was \u201cnot a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d But in her suit, Ms. Clifford tries to implicate Mr. Trump in the transaction, saying the offer of money was intended to buy her silence to help \u201censure he won the presidential election.\u201d\n\nPaul S. Ryan, the vice president for litigation and policy at Common Cause, said that assertion makes clear that the payment was connected to the campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s a threshold legal issue, establishing that the purpose of the payment was to influence the election,\u201d he said.\n\nJan Baran, a former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, said the facts so far do not support the notion that the payment to Ms. Clifford was \u201cindisputably directly for the campaign itself.\u201d It could have simply been a personal matter, he said, of Mr. Trump wishing to keep a secret from his wife.", "title": "Stormy Daniels Lawsuit Opens Door to Further Trouble for Trump", "authors": ["Jim Rutenberg", "Mike Mcintire"]}

She said she was in a parking lot with her infant daughter when a man approached and said: \u201cLeave Trump alone. Forget the story.\u201d Then, she said, he looked at the baby and warned, \u201cA beautiful little girl \u2014 it would be a shame if something happened to her mom.\u201d\n\nThere was another, less direct threat earlier this year, Daniels said, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen had arranged a $130,000 hush money payment to her before the 2016 election. Both her former attorney and her former business manager, she told \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d pressured her to sign statements denying the tryst and the payoff, saying of the Trump camp, \u201cThey can make your life hell in many different ways.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from his lawyer on Monday, Cohen denied threatening Daniels, and said he didn\u2019t believe the parking lot encounter ever happened. But Michael Avenatti, the aggressive, mediagenic lawyer who took on Daniels\u2019s case this year, is convinced the attempted intimidation originated with the Trump camp, and he told me he \u201cabsolutely\u201d has evidence about the threat that has not yet become public.\n\nAvenatti has been strategically \u2014 if maddeningly \u2014 coy about just what he\u2019s holding back.

{"date": "2018-03-25 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Clifford\u2019s interview \u2014 which made for the most anticipated episode of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in recent memory \u2014 was something of a national event, one marked by viewing parties and \u201cDark and Stormy\u201d cocktail specials at bars, a nod to her professional name, Stormy Daniels.\n\nAnd it was a quintessential moment of the Trump presidency \u2014 a tabloid-ready scandal and must-see television \u2014 that carried potential legal implications for Mr. Trump and his longtime lawyer and personal fixer, Michael Cohen. Until Sunday\u2019s broadcast, Ms. Clifford had kept her public appearances to the strip club circuit \u2014 what she called her \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d tour. But, in speaking with Mr. Cooper, she chose businesslike attire that was in keeping with the seriousness of the legal case she is making, that she had been silenced in a cover-up effort to protect the presidential prospects of Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Clifford is one of two women who have recently filed suit seeking to get out of agreements they said they entered during the last stretch of the 2016 campaign to give up the rights to their stories about what they have said were affairs with Mr. Trump. The other woman, a former Playmate named Karen McDougal, sold her rights to the company that owns The National Enquirer \u2014 which never published it \u2014 and spoke to Mr. Cooper on CNN on Thursday. Representatives for Mr. Trump have denied that he had an affair with either woman.\n\nBoth cases present potentially consequential legal challenges for Mr. Trump, forming the basis of complaints that have been filed with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department saying that the payments constituted illegal campaign contributions.\n\nMs. Clifford\u2019s appearance on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d showed that the effort to keep her story from public view had failed spectacularly \u2014 just as statements from Mr. Cohen that he would seek millions of dollars in damages from her for violating a hush agreement had not kept her from appearing on what is often the highest-rated program in television news.\n\nShortly after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Brent H. Blakely, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Ms. Clifford\u2019s new lawyer, Michael Avenatti. It accused him and Ms. Clifford of defaming Mr. Cohen in relation to the threat she says she received and demanding a public apology.\n\n\u201cMr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,\u201d Mr. Blakely wrote. \u201cYou and your client\u2019s false statements about Mr. Cohen accuse him of criminal conduct and constitute, among other things, libel per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the interview Mr. Cooper asked Ms. Clifford why she was taking the legally risky route of sitting for a nationally televised interview. \u201cI was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I\u2019m not O.K. with being made out to be a liar,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Clifford had first threatened to speak out in February, after, she said, Mr. Cohen broke his part of the previously secret 2016 agreement by telling The New York Times that he had paid the $130,000 from his own pocket. He has denied Mr. Trump had an affair with Ms. Clifford.\n\nVideo\n\nThe White House was quiet ahead of the airing of Ms. Clifford\u2019s interview, though an ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s, the Newsmax founder and editor in chief, Christopher Ruddy, told ABC News earlier on Sunday that Mr. Trump considered her story \u201ca political hoax.\u201d Mr. Trump spent the evening before the interview dining at his club in Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, with Mr. Cohen.\n\nMs. Clifford said during the interview that while she had seen Mr. Trump more than once, she had had sex with him a single time, unprotected. That happened shortly after they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in 2006. (Ms. McDougal has also said that she, too, was intimate with Mr. Trump during that event.) Mr. Trump was 60 at the time; Ms. Clifford was 27.\n\nMs. Clifford said that Mr. Trump had invited her to his hotel suite for dinner, and that their banter began with him showing her a magazine cover featuring his photograph. \u201cI was like, \u2018Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it,\u201d\u2019 she said. \u201cSo he turned around and pulled his pants down a little \u2014 you know, had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple swats.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was done in a joking manner, she said, and the flirtation \u2014 which included Mr. Trump comparing Ms. Clifford to his daughter \u2014 led to intercourse, though, she said, she had not been particularly attracted to Mr. Trump and had not wanted to have sex with him. (She said she nonetheless went along of her own accord.)\n\n\u201cHe said that it was great,\u201d she said, and told her he had had \u201ca great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lot of people must underestimate me \u2014 that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again, and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, she said, had raised the possibility that he get her onto his reality show, \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d but it would not come to be.\n\nShe said that he had invited her to his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow in 2007 to fill her in on that promise. The entertainment for the night, she said, was a \u201cShark Week\u201d documentary. Mr. Trump, she said, wanted to have sex but this time she did not go along with it, and when he did not have an answer for her about being on the show, she left. She said he told her over the phone a month later that he would not be able to get her onto the program and that was effectively the end of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut when her story threatened to surface again in 2016, Ms. Clifford said, her lawyer, Keith Davidson, called her. \u201cI think I have the best deal for you,\u201d she said Mr. Davidson told her, presenting Mr. Cohen\u2019s offer. (Mr. Davidson had also represented Ms. McDougal.)\n\nWhen Mr. Cooper said some viewers would be skeptical that Ms. Clifford had made her decision because of a threat made years earlier, she said she \u201cdidn\u2019t even negotiate\u201d and \u201cjust quickly said \u2018yes,\u2019 to this very, you know, strict contract, and what most people will agree with me, extremely low number.\u201d Ms. Clifford also said that she had \u201cturned down a large payday multiple times.\u201d\n\nMs. Clifford said that she can remember the man\u2019s face to this day and would recognize him immediately. Mr. Avenatti said earlier this month that she had been threatened, although he did not provide any details. At the time, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, \u201cObviously we take the safety and security of any person seriously, certainly would condemn anyone threatening any individual.\u201d\n\nWhen the story about the payoff first broke earlier this year, Ms. Clifford had signed a statement emphatically denying that an affair had taken place. She told Mr. Cooper that she had been told that if she failed to sign it, \u201cthey can make your life hell in many different ways.\u201d That sentiment, she indicated, was based on the terms of the agreement, not on any new threat of physical violence, though, she said, she felt both \u201cintimidated\u201d and \u201cbullied.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Mr. Cohen have said that Ms. Clifford faces $20 million in penalties for violating an agreement to remain quiet and that the agreement was still binding.\n\nMs. Clifford\u2019s suit hinges on Mr. Avenatti\u2019s argument that the agreement is invalid because Mr. Trump had not signed it. Mr. Cohen signed the agreement, representing the Delaware shell company Essential Consultants, through which he paid Ms. Clifford.\n\nMr. Cohen has denied any involvement by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. But Mr. Avenatti, through his various media appearances, has been trying to build a case that Mr. Cohen was acting in his capacity as a lawyer at the Trump Organization when he worked on the agreement. He presented new evidence on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: a FedEx envelope showing that Mr. Davidson had sent the contract to Mr. Cohen at his office at the Trump Organization, and addressed a cover letter to him in his official Trump Organization capacity.\n\nMr. Cooper pressed Ms. Clifford on whether she was not coming forward to cash in on her affair now that Mr. Trump had become president. She did not apologize for the extra money she says she is already making as a dancer because of the surrounding publicity, but noted that she was also opening herself up to real financial risk.\n\nAsked what she would tell the president if he was watching, she said, \u201cHe knows I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d", "title": "Stormy Daniels Tells \u201860 Minutes\u2019 That Fear of Trump Kept Her Silent", "authors": ["Jim Rutenberg"]}

When Andrew made the radical decision to join the Army just before we married, I hadn\u2019t guessed I\u2019d one day be considering this question. I hadn\u2019t anticipated an Army life at all when we fell in love, and yet, when he made the impassioned argument for joining, I wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. My husband is not an easily categorizable man: He\u2019d be equally at home at a gun range and a poetry reading. He found a way to fit in at Fort Benning because he is skilled at negotiating different worlds. He gets lonely too, but he has the architecture of the Army to hold him up, and I\u2019m the home he always returns to.\n\nArmy wives, on the other hand, are left to erect their own scaffoldings. Andrew is in a rapidly deployable combat unit with backbreaking daily hours. As the saying goes among wives in his unit: \u201cEven when they\u2019re here, they\u2019re not really here.\u201d It is the kind of life that one later apologizes to a spouse for: \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d I watched a soldier say to his wife at his retirement ceremony, his voice breaking.\n\nThose wives are the toughest people I\u2019ve ever known. Before we moved, I\u2019d snobbishly envisioned my stint at Fort Benning as a kind of anthropological study, a view into another world.\n\nBut from almost the moment we arrived, I sensed just how much I\u2019d need these women, so I made every effort to inch my way into their lives. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t even navigate a conversation with most of them. We had nothing in common; we were separated by the chasms of life experience, education, politics, cultural vocabulary.\n\nStill, we forged relationships in the iron of showing up. We flew to emergency rooms, school pickups, maternity wards, kitchen counters. During my high-risk pregnancy with Fiona, Andrew was deployed; I spent so many nights at a friend\u2019s house in those months that my Maps app registered her address as \u201cHome.\u201d\n\nMy life with the other wives was like life with family: intense, necessary for survival, claustrophobic and never enough. By the time we left Georgia I was hungry for freedom from the Army, so I made sure we lived a freeway ride away from base, in a city full of progressive Seattle transplants. But now, surveying this circle of hip Tacoma strangers, I feel unmoored.\n\nThe librarian announces the start of \u201cfree play,\u201d which means parents can mingle.

Even though I was a mystery to them, arriving childless at 28, they brought me into their fray. I became the de facto babysitter, the honorary aunt at Mother\u2019s Day lunches.\n\nThey taught me everything I know about parenthood: You get through the days by force of will, by relying not on family or husbands but on friends \u2014 and often, brutally, on just yourself. You welcome people\u2019s help with open arms, but recoil from anyone\u2019s pity. And on the overwhelming days, you let your kids cry, walk into the summer heat of the backyard, and chug a beer.\n\nYou also snuggle them past dawn and nurse them through every sickness and let them sleep in your bed when they cry. You need those kids as much as they need you. They are your anchors. Without them, you might drown or drift away.\n\nAfter free play, my blind date and I walk home, our babies cuddled in carriers. In the past week, spring has come to coastal Washington, the winter rains finally gone. Snowy white blossoms shower the ground and bursts of rhododendron fill front yards.

The wives and I never came to understand each other, really, but we allowed life to happen to us together, appearing on each other\u2019s doorsteps with children in pajamas after blowout fights with husbands, after pipes bursting and miscarriages and late night phone calls alerting us of casualties overseas.\n\nMaybe that is all there is to know or understand in any human exchange: the asking to be let in.

However, after elements of the proposed railway overhaul became clear, the unions decided to join.\n\nWhile the largest protests were in Paris, there were also large turnouts in Marseille, Nantes, Lyon and other cities.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Paris, public workers converged with railway workers at the Place de la Bastille, the traditional gathering site for political protests. There were minor skirmishes mostly involving masked protesters, who often represent anarchist groups and who on Thursday threw projectiles at the police.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rail workers\u2019 mood seemed at once boisterous and bleak. They played loud music, sang protest songs and set off so many smoke bombs that it was hard to see at times.

But during a closed-door fund-raiser outside St. Louis late in the day for Josh Hawley, a Republican running for Senate, Mr. Trump argued that he had helped Mr. Saccone come back from a seven-point deficit to a virtual tie. Moreover, Mr. Trump asserted that Mr. Lamb\u2019s strong showing was really a validation of the popularity of the president\u2019s own policies.\n\n\u201cThe young man last night that ran, he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.\u2019 He ran on that basis,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to The Atlantic, which obtained an audio recording of the event. \u201cHe ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, \u2018Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile he searched for the best possible interpretation, the stinging message could hardly have been more pointed for a Republican president mired in low approval ratings, burdened by investigations and facing the growing likelihood that Democrats may seize power in the House this year.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Lamb, 33, defied political geography and appeared on the verge of capturing the state\u2019s 18th District despite a torrent of Republican money and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal intervention. At a rally Saturday, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Lamb as \u201cLamb the Sham,\u201d promised that Mr. Saccone would \u201cvote for us all the time,\u201d and rambled about his own achievements as he sought to transfer his own political success to the Republican candidate.\n\nIn the end, none of it seemed to be enough. Democratic enthusiasm appeared to overwhelm a part of the state that has long been a Republican stronghold. For the president, the vote is an ominous echo of Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama, where his political efforts were shrugged off or counterproductive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tally was also a blunt rejection of the president\u2019s political calculation that tax cuts and steel tariffs would persuade voters in a region once dominated by the steel industry to embrace the Trump agenda on behalf of Mr. Saccone. \u201cSteel is back,\u201d he repeatedly said at the rally, apparently to little effect.\n\nA Republican victory in Pennsylvania might have helped deflect attention from the continuing collapse of the president\u2019s inner circle, which Tuesday included Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the forced resignation of John McEntee, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest personal aides, who is under investigation for financial crimes and was marched out of the White House.\n\nInstead, Mr. Saccone\u2019s lackluster performance was a grim bookend for a day in which the president\u2019s trip to the Mexico-California border to view wall prototypes was completely overshadowed by the churning turnovers in his national security team.\n\nMr. Trump and Republican Party leaders had desperately sought to head off an outcome that was once thought of as politically impossible. Conservative groups spent more than $10 million in the hopes of defeating Mr. Lamb, who received similar help from Democratic politicians like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nA barrage of Republican advertisements condemned Mr. Lamb as a \u201cRubber Stamp for Nancy Pelosi,\u201d the Democratic leader in the House. One flier sent to voters showed Mr. Lamb firing an assault weapon, an attempt to weaken the Democrat\u2019s support among liberal voters. A deceptive video purported to show Mr. Lamb in a fight with labor unions.\n\nBut in recent weeks, polls in Pennsylvania consistently showed Mr. Saccone\u2019s popularity slipping, and Mr. Lamb gaining traction. Visits by Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials did little to buck up the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nBy the time Mr. Trump arrived in Moon Township, Pa., for the rally, the race had tightened significantly, and many White House and Republican Party officials were already worried that he was lending his support to a lost cause.\n\nAs it turned out, they may have been right. During the rally, Mr. Trump called Mr. Saccone \u201can extraordinary person\u201d and dismissed Mr. Lamb as someone who should not be trusted by voters in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb because he\u2019s not going to vote for us,\u201d Mr. Trump said.

We received excellent comments from students all over the country who organized and participated in the national student walkouts on March 14, as well as those who chose to opt out. Here are their thoughts on the protest and teenagers\u2019 roles in politics:\n\nKate Silver from Wilmington, N.C., shared her experience:\n\nOn Wednesday March 14th, thousands participated in Nationwide walkouts to protest gun violence and honor the 17 lives lost in the Parkland shooting. Among the participating schools was mine, Hoggard High School. At 10 am when the protests began, hundreds of students marched to the forum with their voices ready to be heard. I came prepared with my \u201cArms are for Hugging\u201d t-shirt and \u201cNo more silence, end gun violence\u201d written on my poster. 17 students were standing on a wooden bench and came forward one by one, passionately representing each of the 17 victims. The experience was amazing. I felt as though anything was possible and that we could make a difference. Seeing so many students vying for change made me proud of my generation. I felt like my father, who years earlier, marched on Washington to protest the Vietnam War. As a teenager, adults look down on us. They see us as hormonal children that only care about themselves. But during the walkout, we showed them that we will not stay silent and afterwards, they were looking up to us.\n\nSydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., also participated in the walkout, though for a different reason:\n\nTeenagers are usually looked down upon in politics, like our opinion doesn\u2019t matter, we don\u2019t know enough about politics to have a say. It\u2019s important for teenagers to be able to speak out for what they believe in. This enforce good political habits, speaking your mind, standing up for what you believe in, participating in voting, etc. I participated in the walkout on Wednesday, March 14th. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with what my school was preaching about. I went to honor the victims. The walkout turned into a ban guns rally. Guns aren\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s the ones behind the trigger that are the problem. In the article \u201cNational School Walkout: Thousands Protest Against Gun Violence Across the U.S.,\u201d they mention a 16 year-old who stayed in class during the protest, saying that banning guns isn\u2019t the issue and that the real issue is the people doing it.\u201d That was his way of participating in political activism. He stayed because it\u2019s what he believed in. Teenagers should participate in political activism. It feels good to be a part of something bigger than you could imagine and trying to make a change in the world. In the article \u201cWhy Demonstrating is Good for Kids,\u201d it mentions a study in the journal Child Development, teens and young adults who voted, volunteered, or engaged in activism went farther in school and had higher incomes than those who didn\u2019t advocate for change. It is so important that we develop our voices at a young age. It only helps us in the long run.\n\nLeah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., was proud of her classmates:\n\nPersonally, I am proud of all of the adolescents that participated in the walkouts for gun violence or for memorializing the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting. Even if our efforts to promote change are denied by legislation, at least we were able to experience the unity that comes with standing up for what we believe in. I hope that the nation wide walkout sparked adults to see teenagers in a more respectable way. After all, just a week before the walkout I saw an upsetting post on social media that stated something along the lines of \u201cHow am I supposed to listen to teenagers talk about gun laws when earlier this year they were eating tide pods?\u201d To conclude, I can say with pride that after my positive experience from the national school walkout, I plan on being a lot more politically active in the years to come. Political activism allows teenagers, adults, and people in general to align their beliefs and engage in the world.\n\nCollin from Lawrence was less impressed with his school\u2019s demonstration:\n\nI feel like at my school, Walkout was the wrong term. At my school there was a rally. Disappointed. That was my reaction. Disappointed because instead of being a respectful memorial. It was a political charged anti gun rally. Now, there is nothing wrong with expressing your own political beliefs but school is not the place to hold a political protest. I was under the impression there was going to be 17 minutes of silence but what I got was quite the opposite. People with megaphones, yelling and screaming, chanting. It was far from a memorial. Do I think young people should protest? Yes go right ahead but school is not the place. A large portion of people who went to the \u201crally\u201d didn\u2019t even know why they were there. Conflicted Ideas about guns swarmed around the place. \u201cBan all guns!\u201d \u201cBan Assault Rifles\u201d Some people didn\u2019t even know what they stood for. The worse thing about it is, The school can practicality host an anti gun rally, but if a student walks into class wearing a shirt or a hat that portrays their conservative beliefs or lifestyle, they are asked to take it off. It reminds me of a court case we learned about in Civics. Tinker vs Des Moines. This court case ruled that students have the right to protest as long as they don\u2019t disrupt the learning environment. Although the verdict stands true to this day, I don\u2019t see the law being enforced in America\u2019s High Schools.\n\nKalpana from New York, N.Y., was also confused about the message protesters were sending, but remained hopeful:\n\nI\u2019m not sure about the message my school was trying to send. I know that the students and teachers believe gun violence is bad, and I do too, but it confuses me why we were not doing 17 minutes of silence. I wish we had. I thought the walkout was supposed to be for students in Parkland, Florida, and we would be supporting them by walking out and doing 17 minutes of silence and reading their names. Instead, we did 20 minutes of shouting and rallying for gun control. The message we were sending out was not \u201cParkland we sympathize with you\u201d but \u201cNRA, we\u2019re going to take you down!\u201d I do hope, still, that our rallies help convince Trump to make some gun control laws so there will be fewer incidents involving guns.\n\nThough some students doubted the effectiveness of the walkouts, Sydney G. from New York thought they had the potential to make a difference:\n\nI think that it was very important that us children, the future of our world went out and stood up for something that we believe in. It is very significant that as individuals at this age that we use our voices, because our opinions are very powerful and influential. I believe that we did make a difference just by going out among millions of others to support the people who have suffered and are still suffering and stand up for what we believe in. When I see photos of the other young adults going out and protesting, I feel proud that there is a group of people who are not afraid to share their true feelings to the nation and that there are people who are willing to protect and support each other no matter how frightening it is.\n\nAs did Cam from Maine, who hoped young people\u2019s voices wouldn\u2019t be silenced by adults:\n\nI think that it is more important than ever for teens to participate in political debates and issues. Sadly, we are the generation that has grown up with mass shootings being a norm, and it needs to stop. I think that students taking a stand will make a difference because we are also the next generation of voters. My school had a snow day on the day of the national walkout so we weren\u2019t able to participate, but from what I saw it got plenty of news coverage and attention, which will help with raising awareness even more. Personally, I also believe that teachers and administrators should allow students to have open, honest conversations about what they believe in without punishment. I also think that is wrong to not allow students to walkout and threaten them for standing up for what they believe in.\n\nBut Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thought there were better ways for students to voice their concerns:\n\nMany problems are being noticed around the country nowadays such as school shootings, and students may want to protest. Recently, there was a peaceful protest on March 14, where students across the nation walked outside of their classrooms in order to spread awareness about the issue of gun violence in schools. As a student, I didn\u2019t take part in the protest as I believed that walking outside of my classroom for 17 minutes was not the best way to spread awareness about the issue and was not the most efficient way to address nationwide problems. I believe that the idea of teenagers trying to spread their opinions on problems is great, but I just think that there are better ways of accomplishing their goal. Spending class time in order to give respect to the murdered students may not have been the best idea. Letting others know about issues through social media and the internet is a great way to spread awareness and still save class time for learning. While the intentions of protesting students or teenagers may be good, I think that some teenagers may be more prone to act on their emotions, and I feel that teenagers may cause something similar to a riot if their opinions are not agreed upon, or if their actions are not recognized.\n\nMany students were passionate about teenagers\u2019 involvement in politics, like Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., who wrote:\n\nPersonally, if the teenagers are being active in political issues, we see different aspects and different views on problems being discussed today. Also, what would happen if the issues being discussed today are about the teenagers and the youth? How could they not be apart of that discussion if they are the discussion. For example, the tragic shootout that recently happened in Florida. Would those in danger be silent and not say what is on their mind? It would be unjust. The teenagers of today will be those making those influential decisions of tomorrow. Being quiet will not only danger today, it will also danger the future.\n\nNelly3D from YC CLIP agreed:\n\nThese days is very important to raise our voices to get changes. I think is important to teach the teenager to participate in political activism because some teenagers do not how good or bad is to fight to get some positive change. Nowadays, some of our teenagers do not know how to choose good decisions, because some parents do not allow that their children grow independently, this makes us create children unable to make their own decisions. Some of them are influence negatively of bad persons. However, some teenager are more mature than an adult. I think that we have to allow the teenagers participate in different way like political activism in this way in this way they get involved in positive things so that they grow up to be wise people with a lot of knowledge and they can take advantage of it in the future. If we want to see in the future good resolve for this country, we as parents have to educate our children. They are our future.\n\nRobert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., argued that civic participation is one of the most important things citizens \u2014 young and old \u2014 can do for their country:\n\nI believe that the willingness of teenagers to take a stand against the government is the most important factor in regards to the reversal of the socioeconomic damage previous generations have dealt to our country and planet. I participated in the walkout last week at my high school along with hundreds of others. Many people, though, opted out of the protest to sit in class and do nothing for seventeen minutes. These people have their reasons, the vast majority of which I disagree with, however the one excuse I heard from a few people that frustrated me the most was that they didn\u2019t \u201cwaste their time\u201d because \u201cone person won\u2019t make a difference\u201d. This mindset is the antithesis of meaningful change, which is also shared by people such as those that abstain from exercising their right as an American citizen to vote. As the study referenced in the first article stated, both voting and participating in political activism have a high correlation with going far in school and higher incomes, most likely because proactivity lends itself to success more so than complacency. As far as school staff are concerned, I believe they should remain neutral on the topic and allow students to make their own decisions. I felt pressured to not participate last week because my teacher was clearly biased against the protesters. When school staff share their opinion, it can scare students into doing the opposite of what they believe in, which isn\u2019t a good way to acclimate students to taking a stand.\n\n_________", "title": "Student Walkouts, March Madness and Risk-Enhanced Playgrounds: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

Koch. Those business factions, always important to Republicans in a campaign year, do not like new tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump, on the other hand, has for years preached about the dangers and disadvantages of free trade and the harm it has done to once-leading American industries. Republicans now hoping to talk the president down from his tariff stance may find that his campaign promises about protectionism are ones he truly wants to keep.\n\nIt is a similar situation with gun safety. Mr. Trump has in the past backed the idea of an assault weapons ban. But congressional Republicans figured that his strong campaign embrace of the National Rifle Association would keep him securely in the anti-gun-control corner.\n\nThen, in last week\u2019s extraordinary public White House meeting after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, Mr. Trump embraced multiple aspects of the gun control agenda. He even uttered the words \u201ctake the guns first\u201d \u2014 a phrase previously unthinkable for a top Republican politician given the party\u2019s history on gun rights.\n\nRepublicans were aghast. They also figured that, under pressure from his allies at the N.R.A., Mr. Trump would quickly return to the fold and let his enthusiasm for gun control wane. More important, congressional Republicans also knew that gun control legislation was really in their hands, not the administration\u2019s, and that they could easily bottle up any proposal.\n\nBut tariffs are a completely different matter, with the president given wide latitude to act on international trade policy. Republicans, who say they have little legislative recourse, are now engaged in a furious effort to pull the president back from making too sweeping a decision.", "title": "Suddenly, the G.O.P.

For the themed Midis, we kept the themes pretty simple, so I decided to try a NUTTY-themed puzzle for fun. I was a pretty green constructor at the time, so I accidentally split the grid in half in my attempt to keep the fill clean, not realizing it would be an issue. David got a good kick out of both the silly theme and poorly laid out grid, and so the NUTTY puzzle became a running joke between the two of us. When he sent me an idea for an updated, more sophisticated version of my initial idea, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh about how the infamous NUTTY puzzle had come back to haunt me. However, I couldn\u2019t turn the opportunity down. I loved David\u2019s ingenious idea to have the word NUT enclosed in the \u201cshell\u201d of the themers, and we spent a good amount of Skype hours working on the grid together to reach our final product. The end result is something I think we\u2019re both quite happy with, especially some of the fun fill (PIZZA FACE, GIANT SQUID) that we were able to squeeze in. Most of all, I\u2019m thrilled to be making my New York Times print debut, and am happy to finally be redeemed from my initial attempt.

Justice Kennedy seemed to agree. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the challengers had waited too long to file suit.\n\nMr. Kimberly, representing the plaintiffs, argued that Democratic state lawmakers there had redrawn a district in northwestern Maryland to retaliate against citizens who supported its longtime incumbent, Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Republican. That retaliation, he said, violated the First Amendment by diluting their voting power in a district that had been controlled by Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bartlett had won his 2010 race by a margin of 28 percentage points.

Others have said partisan gerrymanders may violate the Constitution.\n\nJustice Kennedy has taken a middle position, leaving the door to such challenges open a crack, though he has never voted to sustain one.\n\nIn 2004, he wrote in a concurring opinion on a gerrymandering case that he might consider a challenge if there were \u201ca workable standard\u201d to decide when such tactics crossed a constitutional line. But he said he had not seen such a standard.\n\nIn the Maryland case, a divided three-judge panel of the United States District Court in Maryland in August denied the challengers\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. In dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who ordinarily sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., wrote that partisan gerrymandering was a cancer on democracy.\n\n\u201cThe widespread nature of gerrymandering in modern politics is matched by the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy,\u201d Judge Niemeyer said. \u201cIndeed, both Democrats and Republicans have decried it when wielded by their opponents but nonetheless continue to gerrymander in their own self-interest when given the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is cancerous,\u201d he wrote, \u201cundermining the fundamental tenets of our form of democracy.\u201d", "title": "Supreme Court, Again Weighing Map Warped by Politics, Shows No Consensus", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"]}

Lopez. Mr. Lopez was accused in 2012 of sexually harassing several female staff members, graphic incidents, including groping, which later led to his resignation.\n\nIn 2014, a Buffalo-area assemblyman, Dennis H. Gabryszak, a Democrat, stepped down amid accusations that he sexually harassed several female staff members. In 2016, Angela M. Wozniak, a first-term Republican from western New York, was censured after an affair with a male staffer; she did not seek re-election.\n\nAnd as recently as last fall, the former Assemblyman Steven T. McLaughlin, an outspoken Republican, was disciplined for asking a female staff member to send him naked pictures of herself.\n\nDuring the Lopez scandal, Sheldon Silver, then the speaker of the Assembly, was also harshly criticized for authorizing secret financial settlements to harassment victims. Such payments are now the subject of proposals from both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who introduced a bill last week that would outlaw such confidential settlements, echoing a similar push by Senate Democrats in January.\n\nThe Assembly has already passed internal rules banning confidential settlements, and has made other reforms, including the mandatory reporting of any sexual harassment complaint. It, too, is expected to introduce legislation confronting sexual harassment on Monday, after establishing a work group of members last month to study the issue.\n\nThe seeming commonality of purpose greatly increases the likelihood of a deal on the issue, even if the question of who will be doing the negotiating remains unsettled.\n\nThe traditional \u201cthree men in a room\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cuomo; the Senate majority leader, John J.

A new partnership in a similar vein has been developing at Cadman Congregational Church in Clinton Hill, home to Brooklyn Studios for Dance since 2015.\n\nMr. Wilson said he was intrigued not just by churches but also by other spiritual sites hospitable to not-necessarily-spiritual arts, such as the Jewish-affiliated 92nd Street Y and the former Sufi mosque in SoHo that once housed Dia Center for the Arts. For Ms. Hussie-Taylor, the complex subject always leads back to St. Mark\u2019s: \u201cWhere are we actually standing?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is this place?

How did that happen?\n\nThe numbers: Timothy J. Sloan\u2019s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016.\n\nIs the increase justified, given the bank\u2019s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan\u2019s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow does Mr. Sloan\u2019s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million.\n\nBut Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.\u2019s pay with that of the median employee\u2019s pay. Mr. Sloan\u2019s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo\u2019s median earner.

If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Thiel\u2019s views echo those of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nTheranos and its C.E.O. are accused of fraud by the S.E.C.\n\nThe blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most lauded unicorns.

I took the theme a little too far at the beginning, as the title plus a couple of entries made me think of a particular actor (in a particular role), but by the last few I was trying to figure out answers with no letters to help, as well as trying to come up with some of my own.\n\nTricky Clues\n\nUnderstandably, there were an inordinate number of Q\u2019s in this puzzle, which helped me greatly in solving. But there were also several clues in this puzzle that could go more than one way; even though I filled the grid out pretty quickly, it got sloppy because of a few wrong choices. Mr. Raymon availed himself of some oddball variations like AEON, STRIVEN, and EAMONN, and some just plain old oddball words like APERY, HISN and TWINY.\n\nIn addition, there were some cute hints for the fill, so hopefully you were pleasantly struck by a clue or two. I liked those for SPIN, SANG, ASL and AAA, among others.\n\n21A: I filled in \u201cShoshone\u201d for this clue, \u201cMembers of an Oklahoma tribe,\u201d instead of SHAWNEES. The Shoshones were further east, but there were tons of different groups in Oklahoma.\n\n29A: Similarly, I had \u201cOsteo\u201d for OSSEO, which is clued far less frequently than the prefix I chose, for \u201cbone\u201d or \u201cbony.\u201d\n\n66A: Because of some crosses, I incorrectly entered \u201cloathe\u201d for \u201cInterest\u2019s opposite.\u201d Much as the opposite of love is indifference, the opposite of interest is APATHY.\n\n17D: \u201cBishop\u2019s group, once\u201d had me searching for religious terms, or maybe chess.

Most of the Taliban figures reached for comment by The New York Times preferred to remain quiet, referring the queries to representatives in Qatar.

Anytime they set the date for leaving, we will be willing to talk on peace.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne senior Taliban commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was talking to the news media without the leadership\u2019s permission, insisted that the insurgents were not ready to negotiate directly with the Afghan government.

Mattis, visited Kabul recently, the two men spent most of their time discussing the technical measures that would be needed to implement the government\u2019s offers and get peace talks underway, according to Afghan officials briefed on Mr. Mattis\u2019s visit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Taliban are no longer the united force they were under their former leader, Mullah Omar, but they are also reeling from heavy battlefield losses \u2014 as is the government side. While the insurgents have continued to gain territory, no clear victory is in sight for either side.\n\nIn addition, the Pakistanis have come under heavy pressure from the United States over the issue of Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.\n\nThe Afghan government hoped that the Tashkent conference would help bring the Russians on board, as well, particularly with the involvement of their Central Asian allies, Uzbekistan and its neighbors. The Uzbek president, Shavkat Myrziyoyev, offered to host eventual peace talks.\n\nBut the conference convened in the midst of widespread expulsions of Russian diplomats by Western countries, and Russians were reported to be unhappy with what they see as sidelining Moscow from the peace process.\n\nThe American military has accused Russia of working behind the scenes with the Taliban. In a recent interview with the BBC, the American commander, Gen. John W. Nicholson, said the Russian \u201cactivity really picked up in the last 18 to 24 months.\u201d He said, \u201cPrior to that we had not seen this kind of destabilizing activity by Russia here.\u201d\n\nThat led to a furious response from the Russian Embassy in Kabul. \u201cThose who are really responsible for the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan are trying to put the burden of guilt for their failures on Russia and damage the Russian-Afghan relations,\u201d the embassy said in a statement.\n\nDespite such setbacks, Mr. Ghani\u2019s recent offer was the most concrete sign of progress in at least the past three years.\n\nThe high point came in 2015, when the two sides actually met in person near Islamabad, Pakistan, for exploratory talks. But the next session was scuttled when it turned out that the Afghans were, in effect, negotiating with a dead man: The Taliban\u2019s founder, Mullah Muhammad Omar, had died more than two years earlier, and the talks fell apart amid those revelations.\n\nBut even if the Taliban are willing to join the peace process, said the senior diplomat, a long process of confidence building and pre-talks lies ahead before any actual, face-to-face peace negotiations.

Research indicates that overall, there are few serious adverse events related to using alternative therapies. But when they do occur, they can be catastrophic, in some cases because caregivers or alternative care providers are poorly informed on how to recognize the signs of serious illness.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health, now refers to these alternative treatments as complementary health approaches, or C.H.A. They are defined as \u201ca group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products not presently considered to be part of conventional Western medicine.\u201d In some cases they complement traditional care.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "President Trump pushed forward with a two-pronged trade offensive this week, enacting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel on Friday, a day after announcing levies on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods. The target of both actions is China, a country that Mr. Trump has called \u201can economic enemy\u201d of the United States.\n\nFor now, the administration has given exemptions from the first set of tariffs to multiple nations, making it clear that the main point is to curb the influx of cheap Chinese metals.\n\nBeijing\u2019s initial response has been muted, setting the stage for what could be a methodical escalation of retaliatory measures. The Chinese government announced Friday that it planned to impose tariffs on just $3 billion in American products, including fruit, pork, wine, seamless steel pipes and more than 100 other goods. Missing were vulnerable prey like aircraft and soybeans, which experts say may come next if tensions continue to build.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly uncertainty about how the tariffs will play out. Here\u2019s what we do know.\n\nWhat\u2019s directly at stake?\n\nMarkets around the world tumbled on the news of the new tariff package, but for now, the panic seems premature. Sixty billion sounds like a big number, but the reality is that the measures would barely dent the $11 trillion Chinese economy. And the Chinese retaliation for the aluminum and steel tariffs, at least initially, is even milder.", "title": "Tariff Battle: Where the U.S. and Chinese Moves May Lead", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "Looking from behind the wheel of the SQ5, the road has far more twists than the administration may anticipate. The president seems to think that tariffs will strong-arm manufacturers and suppliers into basing more production in America, or somehow get Europeans to buy Chevys. But supply chains have become so sophisticated as to be borderless, and Audi and other foreign companies have already invested billions of dollars in the United States.\n\nForeign-badged cars aren\u2019t the only ones that have foreign parts. The Chevrolet Bolt EV \u2014 an important vehicle for General Motors \u2014 is composed of 26 percent American/Canadian parts. The sales sheet isn\u2019t more specific because the parts don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re made in Ontario or Michigan. The motor and transmission \u2014 more than half the total parts \u2014 are from South Korea, which has already been frosted by President Trump\u2019s refrigerator tariff. The Bolt is then bolted together at G.M.\u2019s Lake Orion, Mich., plant. In terms of origin, the Chevy Bolt is as American as a karaoke bar \u2014 a venue that has become increasingly popular in the United States. Maybe Mr. Trump should slap a tariff on bad singing.\n\nUnlike the president, automakers have realized that free trade isn\u2019t a policy; it\u2019s essential to manufacturing efficiency. They source globally and manufacture locally when it makes economic sense \u2014 one reason Audi\u2019s owner, Volkswagen, is investing in more production capacity in Tennessee. American automakers haven\u2019t been able to make small cars very profitably in the United States, so some of that production, such as that for Ford\u2019s Focus, goes to Mexico. Or China. President Trump is now revving up duties on up to $60 billion in unspecified Chinese imports to punish that country for stealing American technology. He might want to avoid autos. Buick\u2019s Envision crossover S.U.V., a potential Audi competitor, is manufactured in Yantai, China, from 88 percent Chinese-made parts. Buick is a best-seller in China; indeed, G.M. sells more Buicks there than here. Cadillac sales increased 50 percent in China last year.\n\nOne company that is helping the administration close the automotive trade gap with Germany is Mercedes-Benz. It builds and exports S.U.V.s in Tuscaloosa County, Ala. Mercedes says there are about 200 suppliers tied to the plant, the majority of them international firms that have followed the Germans to the United States and built plants here. They\u2019ve added thousands of jobs and pay millions in taxes. Many of these suppliers also export components to other Mercedes-Benz plants worldwide, the company says.\n\nThis is how trade works in a rational world \u2014 a world the president apparently doesn\u2019t visit. Ford uses fewer than a dozen global platforms, meaning that any car built here can be built the same way (with some local modifications) in China or Brazil. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s all-American Jeep Renegade is assembled in Melfi, Italy. You can order a Renegade with a Tigershark engine built in Dundee, Mich., or with Fiat\u2019s highly efficient 1.4 liter MultiAir version. Both power plants combine expertise and technology from Chrysler and Fiat. Small world. That\u2019s how Jeep can compete with Range Rover and Toyota outside the United States.\n\nBefore he became president and had to give up the wheel, Mr. Trump had a taste for foreign models like Lamborghini and Ferrari. (And for foreign models in general.) Mr. Trump liked bespoke Rolls-Royce motorcars as well. For rich boys and their auto toys, a 10 percent or 20 percent tariff added to the price of exotic metal is meaningless.

After Republicans rammed through their big tax cut, there were a rash of stories about corporations using the tax break to give their workers bonuses. Have the media learned nothing from the Carrier debacle? After all, companies have every incentive to curry favor with a sitting administration by attributing nice things they would have done in any case to Dear Leader\u2019s glorious policies. Amid tightening labor markets lots of firms would have been trying to attract or hold workers by offering a bit of money; why not use the occasion to hype something that raises your after-tax profits?\n\nAnyway, now we have enough information to start assessing the real impact of the tax cut. No, it isn\u2019t going into wages; you should never have expected that in the short run anyway. What\u2019s more, we aren\u2019t even seeing the kind of response that would raise wages in the long run. And it\u2019s even possible, as I\u2019ll explain, that the tax cut could reduce wages.\n\n1. The optimists\u2019 theory of the case\n\nWhat was the theory of the case for those who believed, or at least claimed to believe, that a cut in corporate taxes would be passed through into wages? The story, as told by people like Kevin Hassett or the Tax Foundation, was that (a) markets for goods and labor are close to perfectly competitive, and (b) America is part of a global capital market that more or less equalizes after-tax rates of return. The idea, then, was that by reducing the rate of taxes on corporate profits, America would attract inflows of capital from the rest of the world. A rising capital stock would drive pre-tax returns on capital down and, by increasing competition for labor, drive wages up. In the long run, they claimed, all the benefits would go to workers.\n\nThere were multiple reasons not to believe in this story. One reason is that the U.S., if only because of its sheer size, doesn\u2019t face a perfectly elastic supply of capital from the rest of the world; even in the long run, we would expect a tax cut to raise after-tax profits. Another is that we\u2019re nowhere close to perfect competition: a lot of corporate profits represent some kind of monopoly rent, and there\u2019s no reason to expect capital inflows to compete those rents away.", "title": "Opinion | Tax Cuts and Wages Redux (Slightly Wonkish)", "authors": []}

Most of its costs come from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 and all three programs are becoming more expensive as ever more baby boomers reach retirement age. This means that unless we cut back sharply on benefits that middle-class Americans count on, we will need to raise more revenue than in the past.\n\nYet even before the tax cut, federal tax receipts were looking weak for an economy with low unemployment and a rising stock market \u2014 for example, far lower as a percentage of G.D.P. than the tax take during the Clinton boom of the 1990s, and even a bit lower than they were at the end of the Bush-era expansion.

To learn more, read \u201cArctic Boyhood.\u201d Mr. Collardey writes:\n\nI started making documentaries by shooting fragments of my family\u2019s life on their farm, in the snow-covered mountains of Jura, in eastern France. My fascination with documenting rural, snow-covered and remote worlds on film is what led me to Greenland.\n\nI first visited Greenland in 2015. That was when I met Julius, a villager who guided me through the five villages around Tasiilaq, which with around 2,000 inhabitants is the largest town on Greenland\u2019s east coast. It quickly became obvious I would focus my film on Julius\u2019s own village, Tiniteqilaaq. The village has only around 60 inhabitants and is isolated from the rest of the world by ice for about nine months every year. Over the course of the next year, I spent several months there and learned to share the lifestyle of its inhabitants: I went hunting and fishing with the men, shared family dinners of seal and narwhal, and attended baptisms and funerals. Little by little, I was accepted by Julius\u2019s friends and family. After all, we shared more in common than it might have seemed: Since I come from a village of 250 in Jura, there is nothing less exotic to me than a village half that size.\n\nUltimately, I wound up using my time in Julius\u2019s town to make my fourth feature film, \u201cA Polar Year,\u201d from which this short documentary is adapted. Just as my feature film traces the village\u2019s life over one year, through the changing seasons and rhythms of life and death, for this short I followed one of its young residents during the routine of a single day.\n\nThe result is a portrait of Asser Boassen, an 8-year-old Tunumiit boy who wants to become a hunter. Like many children of his village, Asser has not been raised by his biological parents. Instead, he lives with his grandparents, Thomasine and Gert Jonathansen. In many ways, Asser\u2019s daily life as a young boy, fed by the hunting tradition passed on by his grandfather and by the mythical stories told by his grandmother, represents challenges many in modern Greenland are navigating. When Asser turns 12, he will have to leave his village to attend middle school in the city, far away. When he returns to his village, he will be 16, effectively an adult, and uprooted from the traditions and knowledge he spent his childhood absorbing from his grandparents. Across the country, Inuit children are torn between two conceptions of education, one rooted in their native identity and the other imposed by a globalized world \u2014 knowledge that is essential for navigating that very world. The outcomes are often problematic. But for now Asser is just a child dreaming to become a great hunter. As great as Qajaarngaa, the mythical hunter who triumphs in Asser\u2019s grandmother\u2019s tale.", "title": "Teaching With: \u2018Arctic Boyhood\u2019", "authors": ["Caroline Crosson Gilpin", "Film Club"]}

I didn\u2019t understand how anyone could represent people who did terrible things. \u201cCriminals\u201d were not people I wanted to help.\n\nThen, in 2009, while working in the legal department at A&E Television, I met Jonathan Rapping, the founder of what\u2019s now Gideon\u2019s Promise. He invited me to his client-centered legal training program in Alabama. At the start of training, Mr. Rapping asked each lawyer to articulate why he or she chose to become a public defender. One young man said he had a brother with Down syndrome, so he wanted to help people who could not navigate the legal system for themselves. Another said he had been arrested as a teenager, so he wanted to help kids like him who didn\u2019t know their rights. Their stories moved me. I learned more about the true state of the criminal justice system during that week than I knew from all my years practicing law. I wanted other people to learn about what they were doing and so I decided to make this film.\n\nI was horrified by what I learned about the criminal justice system. Innocent people, in prison for months or years, sometimes plead guilty to get out of jail; onerous sentences are too often given for minor crimes; people can lose civil rights, like the right to vote, as a result of criminal convictions. In America, a felony conviction can be a lifelong sentence because of this multitude of collateral consequences.\n\nI also saw what a difference it made to have lawyers like Travis fighting hard for poor people\u2019s rights. I saw him tell clients and their families that they were facing long sentences, outrageous bail terms or prison. But I saw him deliver even the worst news with compassion, and I saw him fight for every client. He\u2019s inspired me to judge less and listen more, to try to put myself in the position of people who face a terribly structured system that often provides justice to neither the victim nor the accused. Thanks to Travis and the other young lawyers I met on this journey, I can proudly say I\u2019m a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in their cause.", "title": "Teaching With: \u2018True Believers in Justice\u2019", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "Dr. Megan Moreno, a pediatrician who is vice chair of digital health at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said: \u201cMy main message would be for parents to step back for a minute from the alarmist nature of the word \u2018sexting\u2019 and think about developmentally appropriate foolish romantic things teenagers do.\u201d Parents might, for example, think about the risky things they did themselves when they were younger, and when they discuss it with their teenagers, \u201ctry to view sexting through that lens: here is something that might feel like a normal thing to do and a normal thing to ask, and other people are doing it, but it\u2019s a risky thing for you to do and if you find yourself in that situation we can talk about it.\u201d\n\nAs kids get older, the parenting guide by Dr. Moreno in the journal suggests, conversations can \u2014 and should \u2014 become more direct. Let kids tell you what they know, what they think, what they\u2019re seeing, what they\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s part of talking about safety, online and offline, and part of talking about social behavior, friendships and romantic relationships and how people treat others and want to be treated. For teenagers themselves, there is a thorough handbook available from Common Sense Media, which will walk a kid through the scarier scenarios.\n\n\u201cParents are very invested in the idea that sexting is a terrible thing,\u201d Dr. Englander said. \u201cThey want to be able to turn to their kids and say, this could be the end of your life as we know it, it could ruin your chances for college, it could ruin your chances for jobs.\u201d\n\nBy focusing on those possible but worst case scenarios, parents are not necessarily addressing the much more common problems: About 13 percent of sexters report bad experiences, and another 7 to 8 percent mixed experiences; the negatives are for the most part emotional.\n\nSo those conversations should include the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios: What if you feel pressured to send a sext and you don\u2019t want to, what are the right strategies? Who would you turn to, how could you get help and advice?\n\nThe most upsetting statistic to come out of these studies is that one in nine teenagers report forwarding sexts without consent. Those are the scenarios parents worry about most; images end up in someone else\u2019s hands, or made public. The sender\u2019s trust has been violated, and there can be legal implications.\n\nBut Dr. Ellen Selkie, an adolescent medicine specialist in the University of Michigan department of pediatrics, said, \u201cIt\u2019s far more common for kids to be doing it as part of a relationship with a boyfriend or girlfriend.\u201d When she is counseling parents about sexting, she said, \u201cI do try to present it as a manifestation of typical adolescent development \u2014 sexual experimenting is something kids have always done, and now we have digital media.\u201d", "title": "Teenagers Are Sexting \u2014 Now What?", "authors": []}

They said it was too soon to discuss any other specific plans.\n\n\u201cWe can dream about what you can do as a brand, but let\u2019s first establish the brand as much as we can,\u201d Mr. Dekking said. \u201cWe want to focus on the vetting committee, and I think we need a few years to establish the New York fair.

The first was discovering, in a box of musty newsletters that my father dragged out of the barn, that he had also given me his journals. For the first time, I saw Haiti through his eyes. It was a perspective shift that changed how I remembered those hard years. We fought so much when I was a teenager that I didn\u2019t understand how much he loved Haiti.\n\nImage Apricot Irving Credit Tyler Merkel\n\nLater, when I returned for the first time with my parents and my husband in 2003, 12 years after we\u2019d left the missionary compound, I was surprised by how much beauty and strength and dignity was still flourishing in Haiti, despite the odds stacked against it. The story we\u2019d told in our missionary newsletters was consistent with the usual caricature of Haiti: desperately poor and in need of our help. That was not what I saw when I returned. In trying so hard to forget the pain and fear of those politically volatile adolescent years, I had also unwittingly forgotten the beauty and strength of Haiti.\n\nIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\n\nI\u2019m a reluctant memoirist, and in one early draft I wrote, quite confidently: \u201cThis is not my story.\u201d I felt so safe behind those words. I was far more interested in interviewing the missionary dynasty that ran the hospital compound, and in telling the story of the rise and decline of the missionaries. I was at best an ancillary character. Over time, at the insistence of wise editors, I began to understand that the story needed to be grounded in my own subjectivity. I had to include my utter delight in Haiti as a six-year-old girl, swept away by its beauty and energy. And I had to include my years as a resentful teenage missionary\u2019s daughter. I had to lay bare my grief and fears and longings alongside the research and the interviews. To make it sing, I had to let my voice be heard.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nThe Scottish land artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work is featured in the documentary \u201cRivers and Tides,\u201d is an inspiration. His book \u201cEphemeral Works\u201d is folded open in our living room, and my husband and I take walks in the woods with our 10- and 12-year-old boys, creating art out of moss and icicles and river rocks and leaves. Goldsworthy describes how he listens to the materials \u2014 the ice, the stones, the branches \u2014 as he creates, which is how I would describe the process of weaving together the interviews, transcribed cassette tapes, journal entries, historical research and memories that compose this memoir.\n\nIn another life, I would so much prefer to be a land artist. Sentences are so permanent and exacting.

I assumed the book would be about how my team and the people of New Orleans rebuilt a great American city, what we actually did to turn the city around. Part of taking the monuments down, as much as it was about how the past informs the future, was also an aesthetic choice about how you rebuild a city and where you put physical structures.

When he came home, he relied on notes he kept during his time in combat to write these stories, three of which have appeared in The New Yorker. Below, Mr. Mackin talks about the experiences that inspired the book, why he chose to write fiction, a Pink Floyd lyric that has influenced his life and more.\n\nWhen did you first get the idea to write this book?\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to write, as long as I can remember. The idea for this particular book came out of the sensory details of the wars. When I was deploying with a SEAL team in Iraq and Afghanistan, our mission was night raids, and we wore night vision. There was a disconnect between the actual image and the image I was seeing in the goggles, and in some of the transmission \u2014 I could hear the guy next to me speaking on the radio, and a few seconds later I\u2019d hear his voice in my head on delay. The voice would sound different but all the words were the same.\n\nNothing directly appears as what it is. Especially at night, when you\u2019re seeing things basically in three different forms: the heat-and-light image in night vision; the silhouette in darkness I\u2019d see in my peripheral or if I looked under the goggles; and the image I knew \u2014 like, if I was looking at a teammate, the guy I was familiar with, my memory of what he looked like in daylight. That sort of sensory confusion really stuck with me.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?\n\nProbably how much of writing isn\u2019t writing. My work ethic prior to this, in terms of writing, was: More is better. I tried to sit at the desk and generate more. If I was stuck, I thought, \u201cAll I have to do is just sit here and think about it more.\u201d But I learned that I had to take a break when it just wasn\u2019t working. I did stuff around the house \u2014 things that were repetitive and didn\u2019t require a lot of thought. We live out near Albuquerque, and we have grass, which is rare. Our sprinkler system was broken. I dug up a line to fix, and then another, and I ended up digging up the whole network of lines in the backyard. It was hard work.

It can be resolved only at the negotiating table. So, the bold offer last month from President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan to negotiate with the Taliban \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d is a welcome initiative. But it faces daunting obstacles.\n\nMr. Ghani\u2019s proposal envisions an outcome in which the Taliban would be recognized as a legitimate political party, prisoners would be released and United Nations sanctions against the group would be lifted. In exchange, the Taliban would have to recognize the Afghan government and respect the rule of law, including women\u2019s rights.\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis, during a surprise visit to Afghanistan this week, said there was evidence that some Taliban factions are interested in talks. The Taliban have not responded formally to Mr. Ghani\u2019s proposal, but in the past they have refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, which they deem an American puppet. Instead, the Taliban have insisted on direct talks with the United States that exclude the Kabul government, as a way to discredit it. The United States has long supported an Afghan-led peace process, in which Washington might play a role but would not stand in for the Afghan government.\n\nAssuming the Taliban refuse Mr. Ghani\u2019s offer, it\u2019s timely to ask: Is there an alternative to an indefinite United States military presence in Afghanistan?", "title": "Opinion | Tell the Truth About Our Longest War", "authors": []}

His arrogance leads to misdeeds that, when revealed \u2014 his \u201cHarvey Weinstein moment,\u201d Mr. Fitch said \u2014 bring about his downfall and death.\n\n\u201cThere are so many issues here about how one deals with power, and even love and consent,\u201d Mr. Balter said of the piece, which he added was conceived years before the #MeToo movement but now has even more relevance.\n\nStill, the production eludes attachment to a specific time or place. It has the feeling of a primitive ritual, or a \u201cvery long s\u00e9ance,\u201d as Mr. Balter put it. By using Lingua Ignota \u2014 a secret language invented by Hildegard of Bingen, the polymathic medieval abbess and composer \u2014 for the libretto, he also aimed to strip the storytelling of connections to any particular culture.\n\nPhoto\n\nPerforming in an invented language is just one more challenge for the part of Pan, played by Ms. Chase on an array of flutes as small as the piccolo and as large as the mammoth contrabass flute. The music is dizzying in its rhythms and endlessly shifting dynamics. At times, Ms. Chase vocalizes while inhaling, then sounds the flute on the exhale. She does all of this while also acting, which under Mr. Fitch\u2019s direction requires dancelike movement.\n\nFor the opening scene, the death of Pan, Mr. Balter wanted to create \u201csomething that would look exhausting,\u201d he said. Ms. Chase said that she feels like she\u2019s \u201cgoing to die\u201d most of the time, but added that her relationship with Mr. Balter has always involved pushing each other\u2019s limits.\n\n\u201cPart of \u2018Density\u2019 has always been a line of inquiry,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve reached a threshold and the body\u2019s been extended, it\u2019s time to ask how you extend even further.\u201d\n\nPreparing the rest of the cast is not unlike passing on oral history. Rehearsals have been almost as ritualistic as \u201cPan\u201d itself, with Mr. Fitch and Mr. Balter explaining scenes and acting them, then asking the performers to follow their lead. Kingmelvin Brown \u2014 a 65-year-old from the Roundtable Center with his face shaved clean down the middle, including one eyebrow \u2014 said he appreciated the rehearsal style because it was \u201cout of the box, just like me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the children, learning the piece with Mr. Balter, Mr. Fitch and Ms. Chase was like school, \u201conly fun,\u201d said Sean Little, an 11-year-old student at All City Leadership Academy in Brooklyn. His friend Raymond Hughes Bullard, also an 11-year-old student at the school, said that learning \u201cPan\u201d was like playing a video game in which opening night is the same as facing a final adversary.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t just accepted \u2018Pan,\u2019\u201d Ms. Chase said of the boys, who have been with \u201cPan\u201d since its early stages of development. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly interrogating it.\u201d\n\nAll the creators are, in fact. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t fight like cats and disagree,\u201d Ms. Chase added, \u201cbut my definition of a great rehearsal is one in which I\u2019m transformed, leaving with different ideas and new worlds opened up. I get that with Doug and Marcos.\u201d\n\nEven as she is immersed in preparations, Ms. Chase is plotting future installments of \u201cDensity,\u201d which will feature collaborations with female composers including Pamela Z, Olga Neuwirth, Liza Lim and Phyllis Chen.

Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.\n\nIn November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that\u2019s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.\n\nAnd it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.", "title": "Tesla Looked Like the Future.

Because of that and Carolina\u2019s reputation, what was numerically a blowout felt a little more tenuous. When Berry hit a 3-pointer with just under 10 minutes left, the crowd came alive as though he had cut the Aggies\u2019 lead to 5, not 19.\n\nThe Tar Heels were able to make up a little ground late with an aggressive, trapping defense and a dash of Aggies conservatism on offense.

But the Republican speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran, who has pushed for a crackdown, said the ruling on Tuesday in the Texas case would help their cause.\n\n\u201cThe linchpin of the sanctuary defenders\u2019 argument was that courts would find such legislation unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said in a statement. \u201cWe knew they were wrong, and today the court agreed. Any elected official who thinks they can choose which laws they will and will not follow is sadly mistaken and this ruling reinforces that fundamental American truth.\u201d\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sanctuary policies, S.B. 4 threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. The measure was backed by the state\u2019s Republican governor and lieutenant governor, and passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nAustin, Dallas, Houston and other cities and counties sued Texas to block the law, saying it was unconstitutional, opened the door to racial profiling and would make documented and undocumented immigrants fearful of reporting crimes and cooperating with the police.\n\nThe ruling on Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit only complicates the situation. Parts of the law went into effect after a court ruling in September. The Fifth Circuit opinion allows nearly all of the law\u2019s provisions to kick in, although lawyers for the localities and groups suing the state said they were considering appealing the decision to either the full Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite upholding most of the law\u2019s provisions, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision could narrow the effect of the law. The ruling suggested that local officials who limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement because of limited resources were not necessarily violating the law.\n\n\u201cIt is not 100 percent obvious what is allowed and not allowed as far as policymaking,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents San Antonio and other jurisdictions and groups in the lawsuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be put into effect in the field.\u201d\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges struck down one provision of the law \u2014 a clause that had barred officials even from endorsing policies that limit immigration enforcement, which the judges said violated the First Amendment. But some local leaders are concerned that the free speech rights of city employees remain restricted by the law, because the judges lifted the endorsement prohibition only for elected officials and not for nonelected government personnel.\n\nOn Wednesday in San Antonio, some of those dynamics seemed to be at play. Shortly before the start of a news conference held by groups opposed to the law, Councilman Rey Salda\u00f1a wondered whether the city\u2019s police chief, William McManus, would speak at the event.

Griswold makes a distinction between forgiveness and mercy but does not explain the difference. He is correct that someone can only forgive for the way he or she was deeply hurt. However, forgiveness falls under the category of mercy because when someone forgives, that person is showing mercy, a sort of kindness, to the offender, who does not necessarily deserve this mercy because of his or her hurtful actions.\n\nGriswold accurately points out how forgiveness is not condoning or accepting further injury, but the working through and letting go of anger and other negative feelings. It is courageous and difficult to forgive, and it is not something often done overnight. It took the incest survivors I worked with, on average, 14.3 months to forgive their abusers.

Pew found by 2017, a year into the Trump presidency:\n\nVoters who have completed college make up a third of all registered voters. And a majority \u2014 58 percent \u2014 of all voters with at least a four-year college degree now identifies as Democrats or leans Democratic, the highest share dating back to 1992. Just 36 percent affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward the G.O.P.\n\nThis danger has become more acute, according to the Pew study:\n\nThe share of women identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic is up 4 percentage points since 2015 and is at one of its highest points since 1992.\n\nAt the same time, though, Trump appears to be strengthening Republican support among noncollege whites:\n\nVoters with no college experience have been moving toward the GOP: 47 percent identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, up from 42 percent in 2014.\n\nThe Pew and CAP studies received relatively little publicity compared to the massive coverage of the exit polls, raising the question of how much the political community will adjust to the conflicting data.\n\nMichael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who studies the intricacies of polling, is not optimistic:\n\nIn real time on election night, the exit polls set a narrative, and for a long time there is no other data that changes that narrative, and that narrative solidifies into place and it\u2019s really hard to get past it.\n\nPolling that provides an inaccurate picture of the electorate does more than undermine partisan strategy and media analysis. Trevor Tompson, vice president of NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago, emailed me:\n\nThe overrepresentation of college-educated voters, and especially those with postgraduate degrees, has long been a known issue with the in-person exit poll.\n\nHe then added:\n\nThe bottom line is we need to have much better data for the health of our democracy.\n\nFor Democrats, these questions are a matter of competitive survival.\n\nTeixeira of the Center for American Politics and William Galston of The Brookings Institution, two longtime Democratic strategists, suggest different but complementary directions in which to take the Democratic Party going forward.\n\nGalston, writing in the March 16 Wall Street Journal, argues that Democrats need to moderate their stand on immigration in order to win over white noncollege voters.\n\n\u201cNo issue has done more than immigration to feed populism, and finding a sustainable compromise would drain much of the bile from today\u2019s politics,\u201d Galston writes. He continues:\n\nDefenders of liberal democracy should acknowledge that controlling borders is a legitimate exercise of sovereignty, and that the appropriate number and type of immigrants is a legitimate subject for debate. Denouncing citizens concerned about immigration as bigots ameliorates neither the substance nor the politics of the problem. There\u2019s nothing illiberal about the view that too many immigrants stress a country\u2019s capacity to absorb them, so that a reduction or even a pause may be in order.\n\nTeixeira points out that if Clinton had done as well with white working-class voters as Obama\n\nshe would have carried, with robust margins, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, as well as Florida and Ohio. In fact, if Clinton could simply have reduced the shift toward Donald Trump among these voters by one-quarter, she would have won.\n\nIn Alabama\u2019s special Senate election, Doug Jones, the winning Democrat, would have lost if he had not made substantial inroads with the white working class, Teixeira argued:\n\nWithout the hefty swing among the white non-college population, particularly women, there is no way Jones would have won the state, or even come close.\n\nTeixeira concluded:\n\nThere is no way around it \u2014 if Democrats hope to be competitive in Ohio and similar states in 2020, they must do the hard thing: find a way to reach hearts and minds among white non-college voters.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Galston, writing on the Brookings website, presciently, in June 2016. I will quote him at some length, because in my opinion no one captures the situation better than he does:\n\nMost working-class whites have incomes below $50,000; most whites with BAs or more have incomes above $50,000. Most working-class whites rate their financial circumstances as only fair or poor; most college educated whites rate their financial circumstances as good or excellent. Fifty-four percent of working-class whites think of themselves as working class or lower class, compared to only 18 percent of better-educated whites \u2026.\n\n\n\nIn many respects, these two groups of white voters see the world very differently. For example, 54 percent of college-educated whites think that America\u2019s culture and way of life have improved since the 1950s; 62 percent of white working-class Americans think that it has changed for the worse. Sixty-eight percent of working-class whites, but only 47 percent of college-educated whites, believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influences. Sixty-six percent of working-class whites, but only 43 percent of college-educated whites, say that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities. In a similar vein, 62 percent of working-class whites believe that discrimination against Christians has become as big a problem as discrimination against other groups, a proposition only 38 percent of college educated whites endorse.\n\nThis brings us to the issue of immigration. By a margin of 52 to 35 percent, college-educated whites affirm that today\u2019s immigrants strengthen our country through their talent and hard work. Conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters say that immigrants weaken us by taking jobs, housing, and health care. Seventy-one percent of working-class whites think that immigrants mostly hurt the economy by driving down wages, a belief endorsed by only 44 percent of college-educated whites. Fifty-nine percent of working-class whites believe that we should make a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries; only 33 percent of college-educated whites agree. Fifty-five percent of working-class whites think we should build a wall along our border with Mexico, while 61 percent of whites with BAs or more think we should not. Majorities of working-class whites believe that we should make the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States illegal and temporarily ban the entrance of non-American Muslims into our country; about two-thirds of college-educated whites oppose each of these proposals.\n\nOpinions on trade follow a similar pattern. By a narrow margin of 48 to 46 percent, college-educated whites endorse the view that trade agreements are mostly helpful to the United States because they open up overseas markets while 62 percent of working-class whites believe that they are harmful because they send jobs overseas and drive down wages.\n\nIt is understandable that working-class whites are more worried that they or their families will become victims of violent crime than are whites with more education. After all, they are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of social disorder and criminal behavior. It is harder to explain why they are also much more likely to believe that their families will fall victim to terrorism. To be sure, homegrown terrorist massacres of recent years have driven home the message that it can happen to anyone, anywhere. We still need to explain why working-class whites have interpreted this message in more personal terms.\n\nThe most plausible interpretation is that working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability. On every front \u2014 economic, cultural, personal security \u2014 they feel threatened and beleaguered. They seek protection against all the forces they perceive as hostile to their cherished way of life \u2014 foreign people, foreign goods, foreign ideas, aided and abetted by a government they no longer believe cares about them. Perhaps this is why fully 60 percent of them are willing to endorse a proposition that in previous periods would be viewed as extreme: the country has gotten so far off track that we need a leader who is prepared to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right.\n\nThe bottom line, as the 2016 election amply demonstrated, is that if the Democratic Party does not take the bull by the horns, someone else will.", "title": "Opinion | The 2016 Exit Polls Led Us to Misinterpret the 2016 Election", "authors": []}

If the 463,000 members reject the coalition, Germany faces the prospect of an unstable minority government or new elections or both. In any case, it would likely spell the end of the Merkel era. That would be fine with Mr. K\u00fchnert.\n\n\u201cGoing into another coalition with Merkel is bad for social democracy and bad for democracy,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said, summing up his pitch as he rushed to another campaign stop in an eastern district of Berlin.\n\nMany in his party agree. One recent afternoon Mr. K\u00fchnert arrived at its headquarters in Berlin wrapped in a thick scarf and nursing a cup of peppermint tea. He was not feeling well. Back-to-back speaking events in 23 cities with multiple television interviews every day, not to speak of Facebook Lives and podcasts, were taking their toll.\n\nWhile a volunteer dabbed makeup on his blotched cheeks in preparation for a camera interview, Mr. K\u00fchnert recounted how energized he had been when his party had campaigned against Ms. Merkel last year on the premise that they would either win or go into opposition.\n\nThe leadership had reiterated that pledge on election night, after they had just got the worst election result since World War II. But the mood was combative, upbeat even. They would rebuild in opposition, they would come back.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a new beginning,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert recalled.\n\nThat feeling did not last. Within weeks, the party leadership spectacularly reversed course and entered coalition talks with the chancellor. \u201cHow can voters trust us if we can\u2019t even trust our own leaders?\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe makeup was done. Mr. K\u00fchnert checked his watch and popped an aspirin. He was, he said, \u201cready for the next round.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a battle between hope and fear. It pits those, like Mr. K\u00fchnert, urging the party to regroup in opposition with the hope of growing back into the formidable political force it once was, against those who fear that new elections now might just kill it.\n\n\u201cSuicide for fear of death,\u201d has become a common refrain for those urging comrades to work with Ms. Merkel one more time.\n\nMr. K\u00fchnert sees it differently. \u201cBeing a dwarf today so we can be giants in the future,\u201d is one thing he likes to say. And, \u201cIf we do politics because we\u2019re scared, we\u2019re lost.\u201d\n\nThe Social Democrats are Germany\u2019s oldest party. In its proud 155-year-history it has fought for workers\u2019 rights, battled fascism and helped shape Germany\u2019s postwar welfare state. But like many of its sister parties elsewhere in Europe, it has been self-destructing at an alarming pace.\n\nIts vote share has halved over the past two decades. Many blame the cozy working relationship with Ms. Merkel, which critics say has stripped the party of its identity and its place as the leading voice of opposition.\n\nThe Social Democrats were still winning 34 percent of votes when they entered their first coalition with Ms. Merkel in 2005; in September that had shrunk to 20 percent.\n\nIn one poll last week, the far-right Alternative for Germany, pulled ahead of them for the first time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Trickle-down economics, already the default ideology on the right, was embraced by the left, too. Some say that is when the problems of social democracy began.\n\nMr. K\u00fchnert joined his party when he was 15, the same year Ms. Merkel became chancellor and formed her first coalition with the Social Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike a whole generation of young Germans, he came of age in a period when the traditionally opposing camps on left and right governed jointly, blunting political debate and pushing voters in search of an opposition to the extremes.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is in their mid-20s today has pretty much only known Merkel and these grand coalitions,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said in an interview. \u201cShe embodies this style of politics.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs for the Social Democrats, he said, \u201cWe have become the party that governs with the conservatives, the party that makes things get worse a little more slowly.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. K\u00fchnert\u2019s view, the Social Democrats have failed to offer distinctive answers to the most pressing issue of the day: The future of the welfare state.\n\nThe tension over migration, he argues, is in large part a proxy conflict at a time when large parts of the population feel neglected by the state and see migrants as competing for scarce public goods.\n\nLater, addressing an attentive crowd in Berlin, he boiled down his argument to a question. \u201cWhy should we exist as a party in the 21st century?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat do voters get from us that they don\u2019t get anywhere else? Right now: Nothing.\u201d\n\nPolitics has been a keen interest for him since childhood. According to his grandmother, Mr. K\u00fchnert watched parliamentary debates on television when he was in primary school. (He is a little embarrassed about that.)\n\nThe only child of two civil servants, he was named after Kevin Keegan, an English soccer player his mother adored, and soccer has shaped his politics. His team, a plucky little 5th league club called Tennis Borussia Berlin, has a proud Jewish history and several Turkish players, and regularly encounters anti-Semitism and racist slurs from hostile fans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe club\u2019s purple colors sometimes draw homophobic jeers, too. Mr. K\u00fchnert is himself gay, but he never talks about it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do identity politics,\u201d he said.\n\nBreathless commentators already compare him to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former chancellor, who had also been a leader of the party\u2019s youth wing. The tabloid Bild recently printed extracts of Mr. K\u00fchnert\u2019s high school yearbook, where friends bet he would be chancellor one day.\n\nHe dismisses such predictions as \u201cmedia hysteria\u201d but rules nothing out.\n\nIf Mr. K\u00fchnert prevails on Sunday, it would not be the first time he beat the odds and his elders. As a freshman in high school, he was elected student representative on the back of a rousing speech, beating his contenders, who were all seniors.\n\nLater, aged 20, when his local soccer club faced financial problems, he convened an extraordinary members\u2019 meeting and persuaded them to fire the entire board. He then founded a charity to raise money for the club, printing T-shirts and selling them for $25 a piece.\n\nWhat worries Mr. K\u00fchnert most is that once again too many party members might opt for short-term stability over long-term democratic revival.\n\nOne party member recently challenged him during a rally. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d the young man said, noting that the coalition deal gives the Social Democrats three powerful ministries and a governing program which by some estimates contains a majority of their proposals.\n\nWhy reject this?\n\n\u201cWe should not just worry about the next four years but about the next 40,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last generation that had an SPD.\u201d", "title": "The 28-Year-Old Socialist Who Could End the Merkel Era", "authors": ["Katrin Bennhold", "The Saturday Profile"]}

Having served on the boards of global conservation organizations for more than 30 years, I know very well the sweat, tears and even blood shed by those who dedicate their lives to saving species. Their efforts have led to major achievements, but they have been only partly successful.\n\nThe extinction of species by human activity continues to accelerate, fast enough to eliminate more than half of all species by the end of this century. Unless humanity is suicidal (which, granted, is a possibility), we will solve the problem of climate change. Yes, the problem is enormous, but we have both the knowledge and the resources to do this and require only the will.\n\nThe worldwide extinction of species and natural ecosystems, however, is not reversible. Once species are gone, they\u2019re gone forever. Even if the climate is stabilized, the extinction of species will remove Earth\u2019s foundational, billion-year-old environmental support system. A growing number of researchers, myself included, believe that the only way to reverse the extinction crisis is through a conservation moonshot: We have to enlarge the area of Earth devoted to the natural world enough to save the variety of life within it.\n\nThe formula widely agreed upon by conservation scientists is to keep half the land and half the sea of the planet as wild and protected from human intervention or activity as possible. This conservation goal did not come out of the blue. Its conception, called the Half-Earth Project, is an initiative led by a group of biodiversity and conservation experts (I serve as one of the project\u2019s lead scientists).

But a growing number of courts \u2014 including the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld California\u2019s law \u2014 have held that many restrictions on occupational speech are governed by what they call the professional speech doctrine, a rule that says professionals like doctors are entitled to less First Amendment protection than ordinary citizens because of the reliance clients place on their expertise. Applying that rule to the California case could give government officials broad authority to compel or prohibit speech by crisis-pregnancy centers.\n\nThat idea may seem appealing to readers whose sympathies lie with California in this case, but it is nonetheless a recipe for widespread, ideologically motivated censorship.

On Monday, as Ms Nixon said that she would run, Mr. Cuomo directed the state attorney general to review the ways in which the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., had handled \u2014 or mishandled \u2014 a 2015 allegation of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn her speech on Tuesday Ms. Nixon called for a greater investment in the city\u2019s ever-deteriorating public housing system. Only a few days earlier, during an appearance at the Jackson Houses in the Bronx, the governor, who served as the federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency in the buildings of the New York City Housing Authority \u2014 which would allow him to replace its failing management team, appointed by the city. He also promised to release $200 million of state funds to the agency once an independent monitor had been appointed to oversee all that has gone wrong.\n\nIn the continuing war between the governor and Mayor Bill de Blasio, it has been Mr. Cuomo who has been continually advancing, amounting to another hindrance for Ms. Nixon. A longtime public education activist, she has been a strong supporter of the mayor\u2019s, but Mr. de Blasio, who is so intensely disliked by so many of his own Democratic constituents, could provide her with little advantage in her own race. Within two hours of Ms. Nixon\u2019s speech on Tuesday, the former City Council speaker Christine Quinn, openly gay and an ally of the governor\u2019s, declared via The New York Post that Ms. Nixon was an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u2019\u2019 who should not have opposed her own more viable bid to become the mayor of New York several years ago when Mr. de Blasio won his first term.\n\nMs. Quinn lost, in part, because she was unable to come up with a pitch that voters found as resonant as Mr. de Blasio\u2019s \u201ctale of two cities\u201d rhetoric, his focus on the vast gaps between the rich and the disadvantaged. Ms. Nixon wants to stand in the same philosophical space, railing against the unaffordable city, the tyranny of urban plutocrats. But she earned her celebrity and fortune through a pop cultural product, \u201cSex and the City,\u201d that promoted a vision of New York that stands entirely in opposition to her professed values. It was the HBO series, beyond any other entertainment, that helped solidify the image of the city as a luxury brand \u2014 an elite, fantastical consumer paradise where it was never too early or late in the day to buy an $800 pair of shoes.\n\nIs Cynthia Nixon, ultimately, the best vessel for her own invaluable message?", "title": "The Actress, the Governor and Performance Politics", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "So when I get home from the theater with my notebook bristling with scribbles like \u201cwhat is happening?\u201d and \u201ckill me now,\u201d I ask myself a few questions. Was there anything at all I admired? Can I imagine why someone else might like it? Are there people I would send to the show despite my own distaste for it?\n\nWith \u201cEscape to Margaritaville\u201d (which I kept typing as \u201cEscape From Margaritaville\u201d while drafting my review), there was indeed one element I admired: the cast. Though it bothered me that such top-notch performers were made to do such inane things, I had to admit they did them well.\n\nAnd, yes, I could imagine why others might like the show. Perhaps those who already felt connected to Mr. Buffett\u2019s country-calypso ditties would relish the chance to hear them in a new context. Or perhaps those who aspire to the laid-back lifestyle his alcohol-fueled empire promotes would enjoy another taste of it.\n\nThat insight allowed me to recommend \u201cEscape to Margaritaville\u201d heartily to two groups: Parrotheads and people sloshed enough not to care about its theatrical merits.\n\nI am not, by profession or temperament, either of those things. I did bring my twentysomething nephew with me as a control subject, but although he had two margaritas, he liked the show only marginally better than I did.\n\nWhat I couldn\u2019t control for is taste. Arts criticism is in some ways a paradox, like Marianne Moore\u2019s \u201cimaginary gardens with real toads in them.\u201d Critics try to make objective judgments based on responses they know to be subjective.\n\nSo when readers are stung (or just annoyed) by my pans, I remind them that fighting about theater is often the best part of the show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd when they insist, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong: I had a great time,\u201d I respond that I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t need them to agree with me.\n\nBut I have to agree with myself, which is why I said that it was my \u201cresponsibility\u201d to pan \u201cEscape to Margaritaville.\u201d Not just because the theater needs to set a higher bar for musicals. And not just because \u2014 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 writing pans is invigorating. Every critic savors Oscar Wilde\u2019s observation, in \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest,\u201d that on certain occasions \u201cit becomes more than a moral duty to speak one\u2019s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\u201d\n\nWhat really makes a pan a responsibility is that criticism is a form of journalism, which is, in theory, a form of truth. A critic reports honestly on his own thoughts and feelings, as if they were a war or a trial. They often are both.\n\nSo when I see something as objectionable and cynical as \u201cEscape to Margaritaville,\u201d I believe I have no choice but to say so, in terms that match the size of the feeling. That other critics may feel otherwise (though in this case few did) doesn\u2019t matter, because the point is to let readers navigate by a steady aesthetic star.\n\nIdeally that means more than just denunciation, even in a pan. It means providing theatrical or social context, arguing a position clearly and, yes, getting in a few zingers.\n\nIn that sense, \u201ctheater snob\u201d isn\u2019t really an insult.

And they said, \u201cVery well. O.K. I\u2019ll do this in order to get my food. And you can watch me while I do it.\u201d\n\nQ. And what are you watching for?\n\nA.

If I were to stick an elite Olympic athlete, a cross-country skier, onto a cycle ergometer and ask them to wear a mask and say, \u2018O.K., go as hard as you can go, and I want to measure your peak metabolic rate,\u2019 one of the ways we can quantify that is in oxygen consumption. So I can say, \u2018This human athlete is consuming four milliliters of oxygen per gram of body weight per hour.\u2019\n\nA hummingbird can easily hit 40 milliliters of oxygen per gram per hour. And if I ask the hummingbird to do extra, if I give it a little bit of extra weight to wear, that can go up to well above 60. So, their tissues are using oxygen at rates that are many, many times what we can possibly achieve.\n\nQ. And they need the oxygen to help them metabolize the relatively enormous amounts of sugar they are taking in to get the energy to power their muscles?\n\nA. I did a calculation back in graduate school. It turns out that when they\u2019re hovering around and foraging during the day, they\u2019re pretty much exclusively burning the sugar that they\u2019ve been eating in the last 30 minutes to an hour. And so, they have this incredible ability to move sugar through their system. And I did the calculation and said, \u2018O.K., if I scale one of my hummingbirds up to adult male human size, my size, how much sugar would I need to drink per minute if I were theoretically a hovering hummingbird as big as I am?\u2019 It turned out to be right around the amount of sugar that\u2019s in a can of Coca-Cola per minute.

Wearing a paint-splattered brown mechanic\u2019s suit, crowned with her signature Frida Kahlo-esque braids and vibrant coral lips, she is a portrait of elegant incongruity. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in contrast,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s something I always want in my life.\u201d\n\nOn this morning, there is just over a week until DiMattio\u2019s latest show opens at Salon 94 Bowery in New York City, and her new paintings and sculptures are not yet finished. This is largely the result, she says, of her hectic reality in the two-plus years since her last solo show; she has been hopscotching between city and country living, juggling work and her two-year-old son, Bruno, with her husband, the artist Garth Weiser. \u201cI left months to make this show, which should have taken a year and a half,\u201d she says.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo, on this wintry day, with a sleet storm looming over the Berkshire Mountains outside her expansive windows, she\u2019s working briskly amid an indoor blizzard of paint pots, ladders and chicken wire. Dotting the space are classical torsos, animal figurines and cartoonishly large children\u2019s shoes made of porcelain and stoneware \u2014 elements she will later combine in her complex, hybrid pieces. One of her new ceramic sculptures for the show, tentatively titled \u201cShe-Wolf,\u201d still lies in parts around an armature of steel pipes. When it is finished, its form will resemble a kind of buffalo-llama chimera, with a bisonlike sculpted head, a Turkish Iznik-patterned leg, and breasts on its underside referencing the maternal wolf from the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe theme of contrast has been a lifelong \u2014 and career-defining \u2014 preoccupation for DiMattio, who grew up in Manhattan in the 1980s and 1990s and spent summers at her parents\u2019 country home in Saugerties, N.Y. (her mother is also a ceramist). Since earning her M.F.A. from Columbia in 2005, she\u2019s steadily garnered acclaim for her large-scale paintings and sculptures, which interweave a dizzying array of art historical references, craft techniques and decorative styles. In her sculptures, DiMattio has spliced together elements as diverse as Delft pottery, S\u00e8vres porcelain, Wedgwood china and spikes reminiscent of nail-studded Nkondi religious idols. Her paintings have toyed with unlikely intersections of architectural space, abstract patterns and textile prints.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDiMattio\u2019s new show, \u201cBoucherouite,\u201d which opens on March 6, takes its name from the colorful, tufted rag rugs woven from torn and recycled clothing by Berber women in Morocco. The works \u2014 two paintings and three sculptures \u2014 continue her fascination with cultural and aesthetic sampling, using the pieced-together patterns and textures of boucherouite as a leitmotif.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs DiMattio walks me around her studio, the sculptures tower over us in twisting configurations. At the far end of the studio stands \u201cVenus I,\u201d a bright-pink female figure in classical Greek style with a Louise Bourgeois-esque cluster of breasts on her backside. Her hand clasps a phallus adorned with Ming dynasty porcelain motifs. An aberrant arm juts out from one side, sporting a Mickey Mouse glove glazed with Viennese florals. All around the figure encroaches the colorful pile of sculpted boucherouite (made by extruding clay through a garlic press, DiMattio notes).

Perhaps: A list of nominees for this year\u2019s Oscars that included \u201cLogan\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner: 2049\u201d might have boosted the nominees\u2019 popular appeal without sacrificing quality.\n\nBut there\u2019s already been a respectable attempt to nominate the better genre efforts, from \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d and \u201cArrival\u201d (probably the best movies of their respective years) to this year\u2019s garlands for the low-budget racial horror of \u201cGet Out.\u201d And there\u2019s little to be gained from having the academy go down the same path as certain fanboy (or bullied-by-fanboys) critics and ask us all to pretend that \u201cWonder Woman\u201d was more than just a fun vehicle for the charismatic Gal Gadot, or that \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d really deserves its absurd 90 percent \u201cfresh\u201d rating on Rotten Tomatoes, or that Marvel\u2019s assembly-line showcases are actually good movies the way \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d or \u201cApollo 13\u201d or \u201cBraveheart\u201d were.\n\nBut the alternative to such a lowering of standards, as the sharp Hollywood observer Richard Rushfield notes, is an Oscars that increasingly resembles the Independent Spirit Awards \u2014 which in turn tends to politicize the awards beyond the movie business\u2019s usual broadly liberal bent.\n\nOne of the virtues (both civic and artistic) of the old mass-audience, high-middlebrow model was that it forced Hollywood to temper its own partisan inclinations because of the size of its intended audiences, to produce tacitly conservative Big Movies as well as liberal ones and reward them both at Oscar season. (That reliable right-wing favorite \u201cBraveheart\u201d won in the year I cited earlier, and the prior year\u2019s undeserving but entertaining winner, \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d wore a Reaganite conservatism on its simpleton hero\u2019s sleeve.)\n\nThis tempering still happens in the superhero factory (despite being marketed as event movies for the woke, films like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d play it safe with their political messages), even if there the goal is sometimes appeasing Red China rather than Red America, and of course a certain kind of pulp entertainment will always tend to skew right-wing. But the more the only plausible Oscar nominees in terms of cinematic quality are passion projects and message movies \u2014 the kind of movies, to quote Kimmel, that are made \u201cto annoy Mike Pence\u201d \u2014 the more the film industry\u2019s inevitable liberalism seems less one reliable theme of Oscar season than the symphony entire.\n\nFor some people in the movie business and the press that covers it, this may seem like a happy evolution, a shift toward more of a vanguard role in pursuing social change, with fewer political compromises and greater moral clarity in what messages the academy offers to the world.\n\nBut even if, as is fervently hoped, we are entering an age of stronger minority and female representation in cinema, without the mass audience that high-middlebrow cinema once enjoyed that representation\u2019s influence on the American imagination will be limited. \u201cLady Bird\u201d is a lovely mother-daughter movie and may God send many more female-centric movies like it \u2014 but 35 years ago a little mother-daughter movie called \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d won Best Picture and made the equivalent of $300 million, numbers that only superhero movies tend to hit today. Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d are talented and charismatic, but they ultimately serve the superhero brand, and they are unlikely to gain the kind of black stardom-in-its-own right enjoyed by Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington. No matter how much more enlightened the movie industry becomes, what was 20th-century America\u2019s most influential and unifying mass art form is increasingly a business of niche markets and lowest-narrative-denominator blockbusters \u2026 and it is not only conservatives who might reasonably regret that shift.\n\nLike many cultural rituals the Oscars are peculiar and arbitrary and frequently absurd, but like many they have supplied a thread of unity and memory and shared experience for the millions who watch them every year. For the show to become a boutique affair for American liberals that\u2019s sponsored by a globalized superhero content provider is not, I think, a happy change \u2014 and for all that it seems overdetermined and inevitable, it\u2019s a transformation that filmmakers and moviegoers and academy members, in all their various ways, should still make an effort to resist.", "title": "Opinion | The Autumn of the Oscars", "authors": []}

Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

But after the American Institute of Architects was founded in 1857, the professions split. Architects began to garner all the glory while engineers toiled in their shadows. At the 1964 dedication of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, then the world\u2019s longest suspension bridge, Robert Moses actually seemed to forget the name of Othmar Ammann, its designer and arguably the greatest engineer of the last century, referring to him only as \u201ca Swiss.\u201d\n\nSuch oversights have become rarer these days in the face of societal and environmental changes that demand we use and waste less. Engineers are responding with astonishing solutions culled from multiple disciplines. Supertall buildings like One World Trade Center, Shanghai Tower and the Shard are touching new ceilings of safety, sustainability and efficiency. Mimicking nature, infrastructure can now self-diagnose and self-heal when problems arise. Uses for graphene, one atom thick and the strongest material yet, are still a twinkle in the structural imagination, but not for long. Engineers are saving the world.\n\nIf that sounds like a grand claim, it\u2019s because engineering is so seamlessly integrated into every facet of our lives that it is all but invisible. Drawing on varied examples across centuries and continents, Roma Agrawal\u2019s \u201cBuilt\u201d seeks to tell this untold history \u2014 for, as the author claims, the \u201cengineered universe is a narrative full of stories and secrets.\u201d\n\nAgrawal is a rarity: a female structural engineer in an adamantly male profession. A self-proclaimed \u201cgeek,\u201d she shares her discoveries far above and below ground with an enthusiasm worthy of Dora the Explorer. She will inspire young women who are considering a career in engineering.\n\nIn early chapters, Agrawal slowly builds a foundation on familiar concepts, but your patience will soon be rewarded with more esoteric investigations into \u201chidden engineering.\u201d Two of the most interesting chapters \u2014 \u201cPure\u201d and \u201cClean\u201d \u2014 examine water and the technologies that have been developed to collect and process it.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo one cares \u201cabout poo,\u201d a drainage engineer complains in \u201cClean.\u201d Agrawal disagrees. In fact, she shines when explaining the sorts of things people might be too shy to admit they find inherently fascinating. In Japan, for instance, Agrawal tries out an amped-up toilet, itself an engineering marvel of heat, water and music. She then leaps back to the 18th century, when Japan traded in solid human waste, a valuable agricultural commodity for an island with little land and a growing population. As the \u201cturd trade\u201d boomed, laws were enacted that entitled landlords to their tenants\u2019 feces (but not their urine).\n\nAgrawal hopscotches to London and its once sewage-filled Thames, commemorated as \u201cMonster Soup\u201d in an 1828 etching, one of the book\u2019s many black-and-white illustrations. The river\u2019s stench was so rank that at last, in 1859, city officials approved Joseph Bazalgette\u2019s proposal for a new sewage system. Nearly 20 years in the making and 1,300 miles long, that network also created space for the London Tube, the first underground railway. The sewers moved untreated effluent from central London and out to sea. Agrawal notes that \u201cit may come as a surprise to learn that we use exactly the same system today.\u201d\n\nEnter the engineers. Work has begun on the Thames Tideway Tunnel. When completed in 2023, this massive infrastructure project will expand the existing system and divert waste to treatment plants before releasing it to the sea. Most of this super-sewer will run beneath the riverbed, eliminating the need to dig up city streets and the strata of foundations and utilities beneath them. Equally ingenious is their plan to use the river to transport 90 percent of construction material. The amount of wastewater into the Thames will be reduced from 62 million to 2.4 million tons annually.

In a new article in Reason magazine, Jacob Sullum makes this case. The federal crackdown on opioids has failed to solve the overdose problem \u2014 indeed, it has made it worse \u2014 while also saddling many people with chronic pain, Sullum writes. Among his points:\n\n\u2022 \u201cContrary to the impression left by most press coverage of the issue, opioid-related deaths do not usually involve drug-naive patients who accidentally get hooked while being treated for pain,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead, they usually involve people with histories of substance abuse and psychological problems who use multiple drugs, not just opioids.\u201d\n\n\u2022 So making it harder for people with chronic pain to get opioid prescriptions is a mistake, Sullum argues. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat patients who take opioids for pain rarely become addicted.\u201d A large majority of opioid deaths don\u2019t come from prescribed medicine; they come from illegally produced substances like heroin.\n\n\u2022 Illegal use of pain medications has declined in recent years, even as deaths have surged \u2014 another sign that the main problem isn\u2019t prescribed medicine.\n\n\u2022 You often hear that patients in pain can simply switch to other, nonopioid drugs. Some can, but some can\u2019t. Many get far less relief from nonopioids than opioids, and the piece quotes several of them.\n\nI encourage you to read Sullum\u2019s piece, especially if all you\u2019ve read about opioids are the horror stories. I still believe the government should be aggressively responding to the situation, given the death toll \u2014 and the abhorrent behavior of many drug companies.

Beginning with Dre\u2019s origins as a music-obsessed boy in Los Angeles \u2014 and Iovine\u2019s early career as an engineer and producer for the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty \u2014 \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d continues through the dawn of gangsta rap and the rise and decline of the CD era, examining the way new technologies and social movements continue to change music.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cHomeland\u201d Season 6 (March 1), \u201cQueen of the South\u201d Season 1 (March 1), \u201cGhost Wars\u201d Season 1 (March 2) and \u201cThe Hollywood Masters\u201d Season 2 (March 15).\n\nNew Netflix Original TV Series\n\n\u2018Flint Town\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFlint, Mich., is infamous for the recent crisis involving lead-contaminated water, as well as for the General Motors downsizing covered in Michael Moore\u2019s documentary expos\u00e9 \u201cRoger & Me.\u201d The docu-series \u201cFlint Town\u201d describes a different problem, noting how the city\u2019s poverty has led to an underfunded police department, an escalating crime rate and citizens who live in fear. The show tracks the efforts to rectify the problem, which involves a lot of missteps, but also some genuine will to squeeze hope out of a hopeless situation.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 Season 2\n\nStarts streaming: March 8\n\nMarch 8 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix\u2019s Marvel shows vary wildly in quality, but \u201cJessica Jones\u201d is one that even a lot of the franchise\u2019s skeptics like. Give a lot of credit to the star, Krysten Ritter, who\u2019s both cool and heartbreaking as a crusty, superstrong detective, clobbering creeps while indulging in multiple vices to numb her pain. Three years after the show\u2019s first season became a critics\u2019 darling, it finally returns, with the heroine determined to crack a case that could lead her back to how she got her powers in the first place.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Collateral\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nCarey Mulligan stars as a dogged, London-based Detective Inspector in this BBC Two mini-series, about a seemingly random murder that leads the police to a larger criminal conspiracy, potentially involving the government and the church. Not just another gritty British crime drama, \u201cCollateral\u201d has been given a sophisticated polish by David Hare, a writer best-known for the Tony-nominated plays \u201cPlenty\u201d and \u201cSkylight,\u201d and for the Oscar-nominated screenplays for \u201cThe Hours\u201d and \u201cThe Reader.\u201d Expect more subtle character building than surprising twists.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018On My Block\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 16\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFans of the darkly comic, painfully real MTV series \u201cAwkward\u201d should be thrilled to hear that the show\u2019s creator, Lauren Iungerich, is back to making television, once again taking on high school but from a different perspective. Shifting her focus from the ritzy Palos Verdes region of Los Angeles to the more hardscrabble South Central, Iungerich should bring her usual snappy dialogue \u2014 and her sensitivity to adolescent emotions \u2014 to a part of the city where life is often more complicated than just finding a date for prom or mastering Snapchat.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Wild Wild Country\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 16\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nReaders who lived through the 1980s may recall the name of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, a guru whose small Oregon cult briefly made national news because of his followers\u2019 alleged involvement with bioterror and an attempted political assassination. The docu-series \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d uses rare archival footage and recent interviews to help explain where Rajneesh\u2019s movement came from, how it took hold in America and how it all came to a violent end.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Alexa & Katie\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 23\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe former \u201cHannah Montana\u201d writer Heather Wordham and the former \u201cWonder Years\u201d and \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d writer Matthew Carlson bring their knack for family-friendly tales of teen angst to this, another of Netflix\u2019s growing stable of old-fashioned multicamera sitcoms. Paris Berelc and Isabel May star as high-school freshmen who struggle with this latest phase of their lives while discovering that making a good impression isn\u2019t entirely within their control.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Mechanism\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 23\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFrom the mind of a \u201cNarcos\u201d producer, Jos\u00e9 Padilha, comes another true crime story, based on the still-unfolding \u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d money-laundering scandal in Brazil. \u201cThe Mechanism\u201d (or \u201cO Mecanismo\u201d in the original Portuguese) follows a team of investigators who start looking into kickbacks and bribes in a state-run petrochemical company. Things get hairy as they realize they could be exposing corruption on a scale that could destabilize the social order, not only in Brazil but also around the world.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cB: The Beginning\u201d Season 1 (March 2), \u201cLove\u201d Season 3 (March 9), \u201cEdha\u201d Season 1 (March 16), \u201cSanta Clarita Diet\u201d Season 2 (March 23), \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d Season 2 (March 30) and \u201cTrump: An American Dream\u201d Season 1 (March 30).\n\nMovies New to Netflix\n\n\u2018What We Do in the Shadows\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nMarch 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d director Taika Waititi collaborated with his old friend and comedy partner Jemaine Clement on this horror mockumentary, in which the two men play ancient vampires leading sad lives in a shabby Wellington, New Zealand, neighborhood. It\u2019s funny enough just to watch these classic movie monsters engaging in mundane roommate squabbles, but eventually \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\u201d does develop a surprisingly engaging story, concerning the arrival of younger creatures with different values and habits. Waititi and Clement root their jokes in the anxieties of very old men, struggling to keep up with the times.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Anomalisa\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 8\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (\u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d \u201cEternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind\u201d) turns to stop-motion animation for this wonderfully weird movie, which follows a depressed self-help guru on a business trip to Cincinnati. Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) imagines that every person he meets has the same face and same voice, until he meets an \u201canomaly\u201d named Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who bewitches him even though she\u2019s otherwise completely ordinary. Both a character sketch about an arrogant man and a hilariously accurate depiction of what it\u2019s like to stay in a Middle American luxury hotel, \u201cAnomalisa\u201d is stunning to look at and rewarding to argue about after the credits roll.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Dope\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 17\n\nMarch 17 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAn electrifying combination of caper picture and high-school comedy imagines what would happen if three teenage nerds from Inglewood, Calif., stumbled on the cache of drugs that their neighborhood\u2019s local dealers are literally killing one another to retrieve. As the three friends come up with clever, cutting-edge ways to sell their unexpected stash, the writer-director Rick Famuyiwa revels in the specific slang, codes and status symbols that mean the most to poor kids today. That\u2019s how \u201cDope\u201d stays both energetic and up-to-date for the 2010s.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Spotlight\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 17\n\nMarch 17 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe winner of the 2015 Academy Award for best picture is based on the true story of a Pulitzer-winning Boston Globe investigative reporting team, which uncovered a disturbing pattern: Higher-ups in the Roman Catholic church were paying off parishioners who complained of having been sexually abused by priests. Tom McCarthy, who directed and helped write \u201cSpotlight,\u201d is primarily interested in examining the recent and sudden decay of venerable American institutions, from the church to the government to the media. He does this by focusing on minute details, as a talented cast (including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams) buries itself in the roles of diligent professionals doing work that matters.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 20\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBoth a blockbuster and a cultural phenomenon, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d is the rare superhero movie that stands strong on its own, telling a story that\u2019s complete and entertaining story if viewers never watched anything else from \u201cthe DC Extended Universe.\u201d Anchored by charismatic performances from Gal Gadot (as Diana, the titular heroine) and Chris Pine (as the American pilot and spy Chris Trevor, working to win World War I), \u201cWonder Woman\u201d is a stirring throwback adventure, which has resonated with the many, many people who have been eager to see a big-budget action picture with a female lead.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cI, Robot,\u201d (March 1), \u201cThe Purge: Election Year\u201d (March 1), \u201cRicki and the Flash\u201d (March 3), \u201cBushwick\u201d (March 15), \u201cCars 3\u201d (March 18) and \u201cAustralia\u201d (March 31).\n\nNew Netflix Original Movies\n\n\u2018Les Affam\u00e9s\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA hit at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, this arty French Canadian zombie thriller \u2014 with a title that translates as \u201cThe Ravenous\u201d \u2014 crosses \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d with muted neorealism and a touch of \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d When a rural Quebecois community begins to succumb to a ghoulish plague, the survivors regroup in the surrounding forests and fight to reclaim their home. But will they become as horrible as the monsters they\u2019re aiming to expel? The writer-director Robin Aubert asks that question subtly, in a horror movie that is as thoughtful as it is creepy.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Annihilation\u2019\n\nStart streaming: March 12\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA surefire candidate for \u201cBest of 2018\u201d lists, this Alex Garland adaptation of the Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s novel opened in theaters in the United States and China just a few weeks ago, but it is already arriving on Netflix in other international territories. The reasons are an endorsement, not a red flag. A story about five troubled women who investigate a mysterious energy-bubble that\u2019s been obscuring a vast stretch of the American wilderness (the women are played by Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson and Tuva Novotny), \u201cAnnihilation\u201d has been called too smart and surreal for mainstream audiences. Fans of brainy, ambitious science-fiction should probably jump on it right away.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Game Over, Man!\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 23\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nProducers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg join forces with the team behind the Comedy Central series \u201cWorkaholics\u201d to put a stoner-comedy twist on \u201cDie Hard.\u201d Anders Holm, Adam Devine and Blake Anderson play Los Angeles waiters who work in a building that gets seized by terrorists. Determined to be rough-and-tumble, blockbuster-style heroes \u2014 with guns and cool catchphrases \u2014 the three waiters bumble their way into even more trouble, and end up fighting with one another as much as with the bad guys.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cThe Outsider\u201d (March 9), \u201cLayla M.\u201d (March 23), \u201cHappy Anniversary\u201d (March 30) and \u201cThe Titan\u201d (March 30).", "title": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix Australia in March", "authors": ["Noel Murray"]}

He makes her a \u201cbummer\u201d mixtape, saying of its contents: \u201cThey\u2019re truly miserable, pit of despair-type songs. I think you\u2019ll love it.\u201d The music serves as shorthand: We know that the mechanic, Connell (Ryan Reynolds), is a poseur because he claims he once jammed with Lou Reed; that the preening Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva) is superficial because she dances to Falco; and that the fumbling James and the guarded Em could be a good match because they both love H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. It\u2019s all wonderfully cynical, and yet sweetly earnest.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson in \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Sony Pictures\n\n\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis 1984 smash isn\u2019t really about ghosts. It\u2019s about the effortless chemistry among the three leads: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Bill Murray. Or, to be honest, it\u2019s about Murray. The story, now firmly imprinted in our national comedy DNA, is a woozy swirl of proton packs, shape-shifting Sumerian gods and, of course, the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Sigourney Weaver is on hand, too \u2014 also in top form. But Murray is the deadpan master who fuels the movie.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cMoon.\u201d Sony Pictures Classics\n\n\u2018Moon\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nMarch 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cMoon\u201d is an underrated debut and a must-see before viewing director Duncan Jones\u2019s most recent film, \u201cMute,\u201d which feels like something of a successor. Sam Rockwell is absorbing as Sam Bell, an off-world corporate caretaker who, after being alone on the moon for three years, is starting to unravel. Aided by Clint Mansell\u2019s eerie score, the film examines the toll taken by living in total isolation, what it\u2019s like to confront ourselves and the lengths to which corporations might go to protect its interests. It\u2019s a haunting movie.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in \u201cRevolutionary Road.\u201d Francois Duhamel/Paramount Vantage\n\n\u2018Revolutionary Road\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cMarried, two kids \u2014 it should be enough,\u201d Kate Winslet\u2019s character despairs. But what if it\u2019s not? In this 2008 film from director Sam Mendes, an ill-suited couple (Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) tries to escape what the husband calls the \u201chopeless emptiness\u201d of settled-down conformity in the 1950s suburbs, but they can\u2019t agree on how. Winslet is devastating in her rage and disillusionment as she cycles through limited options. Then, a sizzling Michael Shannon steps in, who, because his character is certifiably insane, has no fear of telling it like it is.\n\n\u2014\n\nGeorge Clooney in \u201cUp in the Air.\u201d Dale Robinette/Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018Up in the Air\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nMarch 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAs the traveling corporate hatchet man Ryan Bingham, the ever-charming George Clooney flies around the country firing workers he has never met before, often with a smile. He\u2019s a man with no personal life to speak of, whose main interest is racking up frequent-flier miles. (To him, loyalty means rewards programs.) But as he trains a chipper subordinate (Anna Kendrick) and connects with a fellow road warrior (Vera Farmiga), he\u2019s forced to confront the emptiness of his transient life. Some of the movie\u2019s most affecting moments are provided by real people who describe on-camera the trauma of losing their jobs.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe title character in \u201cBenji.\u201d Disney, via Photofest\n\n\u2018Benji\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 6\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWith a new \u201cBenji\u201d coming to Netflix on the March 16, Netflix is making the \u2026 er \u2026 \u201cclassic\u201d titles available, including this 1974 original, the first of five written around the scrappy little stray. In a twist on the typical family-dog scenario, the pup begins the franchise as a homeless freelancer who works his way into the hearts of the townspeople, especially a pair of siblings who feed and play with him behind their parents\u2019 backs. When the children are kidnapped, it\u2019s up to Benji to do the sleuthing necessary to find them.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix Original TV Series\n\nA scene from \u201cFlint Town.\u201d Zackary Canepari/Netflix\n\n\u2018Flint Town\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: March 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFlint, Mich., is infamous for the recent crisis involving lead-contaminated water, as well as for the General Motors downsizing covered in Michael Moore\u2019s documentary expos\u00e9 \u201cRoger & Me.\u201d The docu-series \u201cFlint Town\u201d describes a different problem, noting how the city\u2019s poverty has led to an underfunded police department, an escalating crime rate and citizens who live in fear.

In a TV commercial, he declared, \u201cI think welfare is demeaning and destructive of the human being and of his family.\u201d He didn\u2019t blame \u201cwelfare queens\u201d for cheating the system, as Ronald Reagan later would, but said he envisioned a policy of full employment in which a person could say to himself: \u201cI helped build this country. I am a participant in its greatest public venture.\u201d\n\nOn issues of national security, Kennedy took a principled position in opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 whose very morality he questioned \u2014 but threaded the needle in a way that also made clear to working-class voters that he differed sharply from upper-middle-class white college students who avoided service or even sympathized with the North Vietnamese Communists. At Notre Dame, Kennedy was booed for saying college draft deferments should be abolished. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the unfair advantage while poor people are being drafted,\u201d he said. Remarkably, in Indiana he polled as well among those who favored Johnson\u2019s conduct of the Vietnam War as he did among those who opposed it.\n\nKennedy\u2019s campaign to woo working-class voters across racial lines worked. The candidate most identified with advancing civil rights did well not only with black and Hispanic voters but also among working-class whites, some of whom had supported Wallace\u2019s segregationist candidacy in 1964.\n\nA half-century later, how could progressives try to rebuild the Bobby Kennedy coalition? Kennedy\u2019s appeal was based in part on being the brother of a revered and martyred president, of course, and the most salient issues were different in 1968 than they are today. But Kennedy stressed fundamental themes that travel across time and transcend specific policy issues.\n\nFirst, to appeal to a sizable number of white working-class voters in 1968, Kennedy did not forfeit his basic principles or change his positions on civil rights, or war and peace \u2014 and neither should progressives today. Ignoring the rights of women, gay people and people of color is both morally wrong and politically stupid if your aspiration is an inclusive populism.\n\nSecond, progressives should fight for economic justice in a manner that is relentless rather than episodic. On the campaign trail, Kennedy consistently hit themes of economic inequality and named the names of wealthy individuals, like the oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, who paid little in taxes. By contrast, in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton de-emphasized economic issues in favor of attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s qualifications, according to research by Democracy Corps and the Roosevelt Institute, and his support among white non-college voters rose considerably. Progressives also need to vigorously punish Wall Street malfeasance. It is difficult to imagine that Kennedy, a tough prosecutor, would have argued, as some members of the Obama administration did, that some companies are \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d\n\nThird, progressives should explicitly signal the inclusion of working-class whites in their vision for change by applying civil rights laws to issues of class inequality, consistent with Kennedy\u2019s view that \u201cpoverty is closer to the root of the problem than color.\u201d I have long argued that we should extend the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against workers of all races engaged in labor organizing; integrate elementary and secondary schools not only by race but also by socioeconomic status; combat discrimination in housing by economic status as well as race; and adopt affirmative action programs in higher education for economically disadvantaged students of every color.", "title": "Opinion | The Bobby Kennedy Pathway", "authors": []}

Two days later, two more bombs, one of which detonated, were found at FedEx facilities. Those last three bombs (if these are indeed the last ones) changed everything. The authorities stopped invoking possible hate crimes and seemed to drop racial motivation from their statements altogether.\n\nBut that has done nothing to alleviate the fear among residents of East Austin that they were being targeted. The House and Mason families are stalwarts of the African-American community with deep ties to the city\u2019s civil rights movement. Families like theirs are becoming a rarity in this rapidly gentrifying part of the city. Over the past four years, I have been studying black displacement from Austin, trying to understand why it was the only major growing city in America to see an absolute numerical decline in the African-American population during the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nWe recently completed a survey in the Masons\u2019 neighborhood, asking longstanding residents what they thought of the changes taking place around them. Respondents described a neighborhood that had lost its children. For them, this was distinguishing feature of gentrification: the families with children moved out and were being replaced by newcomers without children. Draylen and his family were the exception to this rule.\n\nFor Draylen\u2019s neighbors and others in the area, there was nothing coincidental about three bombs being planted and detonated on that side of the interstate. The people I spoke with were dismayed at how hesitant city leaders were to recognize the terror that gripped their community. Gilbert Rivera, a lifelong East Austin resident, told me he was hurt that elected officials \u201cdidn\u2019t acknowledge that black and brown people were under attack after the first three.\u201d\n\nThis subtle erasure of their sense of safety recalls a much earlier wave of crimes that gripped Austin near the end of the 19th century, in 1884 and 1885. They were known as the \u201cservant girl killings,\u201d in which a serial killer murdered eight people, six of them black. At the time, the authorities insisted that these crimes could not have been racially motivated, and they refused to consider the possibility that a white man could have been responsible. Their investigation centered on black male suspects, but the crime was never solved.

He has flown passenger jets crammed with advanced electronics and software and has a keen professional interest in technology. What concerns him and other safety experts is that industry executives and government officials are rushing headlong to put self-driving cars on the road without appropriate safeguards and under the unproven hypothesis that the technology will reduce crashes and fatalities. The Senate, for instance, is considering a bill that would exempt self-driving cars from existing federal regulations and pre-empt state and local governments from regulating them. And Arizona became a hotbed of self-driving testing by telling auto and technology companies \u2014 like Uber \u2014 that it will not ask too many questions or institute a lot of new rules.\n\nEven as officials place a big bet that autonomous cars will solve many of our safety problems, American roads are becoming less safe. More than 37,000 people were killed on American roads in 2016, up 5.6 percent from 2015, according to government data. The National Safety Council, a research and advocacy organization, estimates that the death toll was more than 40,000 in 2017.\n\nExperts who are skeptical about the unceasing forward march of technology say fatalities are rising because public officials have become so enamored with the shiny new thing, self-driving cars, that they have taken their eyes off problems they could be solving today. In the federal government and most states, there appears to be little interest in or patience for doing the tedious work of identifying and implementing policies and technologies with proven track records of saving lives now, as opposed to some time in the distant future.\n\nConsider automatic braking systems. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates that there is a 42 percent reduction in rear-end crashes that cause injuries when this technology is installed on cars. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and other public interest groups asked the Transportation Department in 2015 to require that all new trucks, buses and other commercial vehicles have such systems, which have been around for years. The department accepted that petition but has yet to propose a rule. The government did reach a voluntary agreement with 20 automakers to make automatic braking a standard feature on cars and light trucks by September 2022.\n\nEven as American regulators have dragged their feet, other industrialized countries have made great strides in reducing traffic crashes over the last two decades. Road fatality rates in Canada, France, Germany and Sweden, for example, are now less than half the rate in the United States. And no, these countries don\u2019t have fleets of self-driving cars. They have reduced accidents the old-fashioned way. Some of them have worked to slow down traffic \u2014 speed is a leading killer. They have added medians and made other changes to roads to better protect pedestrians. And European regulators have encouraged the use of seatbelts by putting visual reminders even in the back seat. Germany, which has the high-speed autobahn, also requires much more rigorous driver education and testing than most American states do.\n\n\u201cThe things that have been killing us for decades are still killing us: speed, impaired driving, not using seatbelts,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who now heads the National Safety Council. \u201cThe things that we know can save lives, some of them don\u2019t cost any money, like seatbelts.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Bright, Shiny Distraction of Self-Driving Cars", "authors": []}

But the priority of goods is different: Free-traders tend to believe that only by making economic efficiency the supreme goal of public policy can those other ends be achieved. Division of labor produces greater wealth, and so free trade makes everyone better off, with the harm to those whose manufacturing jobs are lost outweighed by the good that comes from, say, cheaper flat-screen televisions. Dollars decide. The figures are the outward and visible signs of the fundamental economic truth.\n\nThe middle class, by this reckoning, must take care of itself, finding new ways to make a living if the factories close. With more wealth available in the aggregate, thanks to the efficiencies of trade and specialization, some happy outcome is sure to materialize. If we cannot say what it is, that only means that spontaneous order has a pleasant surprise in store for us.\n\nAs for national security, exceptions might have to be made; even The Wall Street Journal has recently editorialized against the takeover of the United States communications chip manufacturer Qualcomm by the Singapore-based Broadcom on national-security grounds. But free-trade ideologues say exceptions should be made only case by case, with the benefit of the doubt falling on the side of trade and foreign deals.\n\nTo free-traders, economic nationalism is simply unnatural, an effort to artificially prolong the lives of aged industries. And since technology eliminates more jobs than trade does, the free traders ask, is the economic nationalist\u2019s next step Luddism?\n\nThe fact that technology reduces well-paid industrial employment is no reason to reduce it further through open trade policies.

Nationalist economies have some of the world\u2019s most impressive records of growth and technical advancement.\n\nTariffs are not magic.

Steel towns throughout the Northeast and Midwest have been losing a trade war for decades because they cannot count on their leaders in Washington to fight for them.\n\nFree trade is a clear and simple rule, and the economic theory of which it is a part is elegant and logical. But it is only a partial truth. The value of the middle class has to be weighed in political terms, not merely economic ones, and national security has a strategic logic all its own that springs from different and darker assumptions about human nature than the hopeful logic of economic efficiency.", "title": "Opinion | The Case for Trump\u2019s Tariffs and \u2018America First\u2019 Economics", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-17 00:00:00", "text": "Beef and dairy cattle together account for an outsize share of agriculture and its attendant problems, including almost two-thirds of all livestock emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That\u2019s partly because there are so many of them \u2014 1 billion to 1.4 billion head of cattle worldwide. They don\u2019t outnumber humanity, but with cattle in this country topping out at about 1,300 pounds apiece, their footprint on the planet easily outweighs ours.\n\nThe emissions come partly from the fossil fuels used to plant, fertilize and harvest the feed to fatten them up for market. In addition, ruminant digestion causes cattle to belch and otherwise emit huge quantities of methane. A new study in the journal Carbon Balance and Management puts the global gas output of cattle at 120 million tons per year. Methane doesn\u2019t hang around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide. But in the first 20 years after its release, it\u2019s 80 to 100 times more potent at trapping the heat of the sun and warming the planet. The way feedlots and other producers manage manure also ensures that cattle continue to produce methane long after they have gone to the great steakhouse in the sky.\n\nThe French researchers, from the Toulouse School of Economics, decided to take a look at a carbon tax on beef because the European Union has committed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than half by midcentury \u2014 and that includes agricultural emissions. The ambition is to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, widely regarded as a tipping point at which cascading and potentially catastrophic effects of climate change could sweep across the planet. Their study found that a relatively steep tax, based on greenhouse gas emissions, would raise the retail price of beef by about 40 percent and cause a corresponding drop in consumption, much like the sugar tax on sodas and the tax on tobacco products.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it make more sense to put a carbon tax on fossil fuel, a larger source of greenhouse gas emissions? You bet. But many people who now commute in conventional gas-fueled automobiles have no better way to get home \u2014 or to heat their homes when they get there. That broader carbon tax will require dramatically restructuring our lives. A carbon tax on beef, on the other hand, would be a relatively simple test case for such taxes and, according to the French study, only a little painful, at least at the household level: While people would tend to skip the beef bourguignon, they could substitute other meats, like pork and chicken, that have a much smaller climate change footprint.\n\nThe tax would also reduce the substantial contribution of beef and dairy cattle to water pollution, deforestation, biodiversity loss and human mortality. (A 2012 Harvard School of Public Health study found that adding a single serving of unprocessed red meat per day increases the risk of death by 13 percent.) Those factors have already driven down beef consumption in the United States by 19 percent since 2005.", "title": "Opinion | The Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef", "authors": []}

We were spread out in what were called pickets of six men each. Five groups were in a line on the left separated by about 25 yards each. Five more were on the right as the choppers descended onto our positions. You could figure out quickly which bird was coming for you and it was easy to follow it right to the ground. In this case as my eyes followed our chopper, I noticed a short length of barbed-wire fence just a couple of feet off the ground. It seemed too low to make any difference but the chopper came in a little fast, causing the pilot to lift the nose and drop the tail just enough for the tail rotor to hit that wire. The next events happened so fast it\u2019s hard to imagine even now how we survived.\n\nAt the moment the tail rotor hit the strand of wire, the chopper flipped onto its left side. The main rotor was driven into the ground and splintered into a thousand pieces. It was just our good fortune to have been on the right side of the chopper or we probably would not have survived. We had dived onto the ground but we could still see the right side door gunner and the co-pilot climbing out just as the now crashed chopper burst into flames. The co-pilot must have known that was going to happen because he exited the wreckage with a fire extinguisher. But it wasn\u2019t to put out the fire. The fire was already beyond that. He sprayed it directly on the plexiglass windshield in front of the pilot who was struggling to get out. The cold spray of carbon dioxide shrank the hot plastic and the windshield literally popped out. He pulled the pilot to safety as the fire raged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe left-side door gunner never had a chance. He was pinned under the chopper right next to the fuel tank that was exploding into black smoke. By now we were all up and everyone thought to flip the burning chopper upright, but searing heat prevented us from getting near it. The gunner died very quickly.\n\nThe pilot was distraught beyond all description. Anyone would call this a tragic accident, but in his mind it was pilot error. In his mind his mistake had taken the life of one of his crew. There isn\u2019t much worse for a guy in his position.\n\nIt was a very bad scene. A smoldering chopper. A dead door gunner. Scared soldiers and this inconsolable pilot sitting on the ground wailing.\n\nA few minutes into this drama several new choppers arrived on the scene, one carrying a guy who was clearly the man in charge of this whole chopper squadron. He was all business. He walked straight over to the pilot and told him to get up off the ground. He never asked what happened. No arm around the shoulder. He just walked the crying pilot over to the helicopter he had just arrived in and ordered the pilot to get in and take the stick.\n\nThe scene drove things home to us. This was a war. If you are going to be an effective pilot in the future, there is no time for grieving now. It was the ultimate version of getting back on the bicycle. But that\u2019s how they did things. There was no time for sentiment.\n\nI met up not long ago with a former Vietnam chopper pilot who had been a few years ahead of me in our high school. He said it was the best job he ever had, despite all the dangers. He still missed it. As we talked I could tell that even now, 50 years later, he would happily get back in the cockpit.

He became accustomed to the sight of hustlers and junkies and the stench of human feces, urine and weed. In local playgrounds children as young as 13 smoked pot. Mokhtar found it hard to avoid trouble and became \u201ca fast learner, a fast talker, a corner cutter.\u201d His adventures included trips to the city\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, where he and his friends dropped their trousers to moon the residents. Aimless and without ambition, he did not appear destined for much.\n\nBut there was another side to Mokhtar \u2014 the autodidact who loved to read and who crammed all the books he had found or stolen onto a shelf in the kitchen pantry: the Goosebumps novels, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d and especially the Harry Potter books. When Mokhtar daydreamed, \u201chis mind drifted and allowed the possibility that maybe he was, like Harry, part of this hardscrabble world for now, but destined for something more.\u201d\n\nBy the time Mokhtar was in eighth grade, his parents worried he was going astray and decided he should spend time with his wealthy grandfather in Yemen.

It is also about his personal journey, as he learns to navigate two identities and begins to find his true self.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike Mokhtar himself, however, the book loses focus for long stretches, following him from job to job in arduous pages that go nowhere until Mokhtar, working as a doorman at a luxury building, sees a 20-foot-tall statue of a Yemeni man drinking from a giant coffee cup. He learns about the beverage\u2019s origins \u2014 \u201cYemenis basically invented coffee. You didn\u2019t know this?\u201d his mother tells him \u2014 and feels at last that he has a mission. Finally we get a jolt of excitement and the book starts to flow.\n\nEggers traces the often contested history of coffee, from the Ethiopian shepherd who noticed that his goats were jumping and prancing after eating the fruit of a nearby tree, to Ali Ibn Omar al-Shadhili, a Sufi man living in Mokha who first brewed the drink we know today. Later Eggers tells us about the rogue adventurers who stole coffee and spread it to the rest of the world: Indonesia, Latin America, Africa.\n\nMokhtar imagines himself one of those adventurers, aiming first to revive Yemen\u2019s 500-year-old coffee culture and then to export its high-quality arabica beans. By persuading distributors to pay a premium, he hopes to convince farmers their future is in coffee rather than khat, a shrub grown for its highly addictive chewable leaves.\n\nSimple, right? Yet there are drawbacks. For one, coffee cultivation has almost disappeared in Yemen. For another, Mokhtar knows practically nothing about coffee. He came to the crop not because he loved it \u2014 he\u2019d drunk only a few dozen cups his entire life \u2014 but because Yemen\u2019s historical role in its cultivation and dissemination appealed to him so much.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: In Yemen, any project \u2014 even one much smaller than resurrecting an ancient trade \u2014 is a serious challenge at the best of times. Access to international markets is difficult, bank loans are nonexistent, and trips outside Sanaa can require hours of haggling with petty bureaucrats and local tribes. Security risks include bandits, feuding tribesmen and jihadis. Throw in an unfolding political crisis, militias taking over the capital, the collapse of the state and a subsequent civil war, and Mokhtar\u2019s mission seems purely impossible. Still, in Eggers\u2019s telling Mokhtar is no ordinary man, and he has more than ordinary luck. Friends offer emotional and financial support; Yemeni farmers treat him as a guest even if they don\u2019t expect to see him again.\n\nEggers describes Yemen, with some justification, as the world\u2019s most misunderstood country. Yet he seems mostly uninterested in closing that gap, serving up clich\u00e9s that only exacerbate the problem. His portrait of Yemen is a cheap cup of instant coffee. Then again, this is less a book about Yemen than the old-fashioned American dream. As Mokhtar makes his way through mountains and villages collecting samples of coffee beans, he grows more and more capable. No longer an ignorant American who can\u2019t distinguish between an olive tree and a coffee tree, he becomes an enthusiastic expert who can capture the attention of a roomful of skeptical farmers with a passionate speech \u2014 admittedly fueled by khat \u2014 about the glories of Yemeni coffee. No longer a dreamer, he is a visionary businessman and leader.\n\nIn an age marked by entrenched identities, nationalism and ideological purity, Mokhtar emerges as a confident member of two cultures, both Yemeni and American. He is a reminder, as Eggers says, that America is \u201ca blended people united not by stasis and cowardice and fear, but by irrational exuberance and global enterprise on a human scale \u2026 driven by courage unfettered and unyielding.\u201d If he seems more symbolic than complicated or deep, well, isn\u2019t that American too?", "title": "The Coffee-Flavored American Dream", "authors": ["Ghaith Abdul-Ahad", "Dave Eggers"]}

Temperatures hover within a degree or two of freezing, and in the inky blackness, a flashlight illuminates nothing but naked branches and thawing pools of jet black water. But in early March, the first calls of the wood frog are like the creaking sounds of an enormous, primitive machine awakening. These ancient voices make my skin crawl and my heart quicken, but these same sounds may have inspired relief in our ancestors; despite the bleak nights, winter was finally at its end.\n\nWood frogs are hardly songsters. Their nasal croaks are best described as resonant, or memorable. They provide a counterpoint to the bell-like clarity of the chorus of spring peepers, which inevitably accompany them. The soft whinnying of screech owls, even the somber hoots of great horned owls, are often a part of this primitive performance. There are few occasions when the elemental vitality of spring is as nakedly exposed.\n\nMeasuring about 3 inches long, and weighing a quarter of an ounce, wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) are woodland wanderers, often traveling long distances between vernal pools. For frogs, they are surprisingly independent of water most of the year, but they are not at all toad-like. Wood frogs have the smooth, thin skin of true frogs, and possess the same long legs. Later in summer, when these frogs are silent, their long leaps are often the only sign they\u2019re present.\n\nPerhaps the wood frog\u2019s most iconic feature is its dark, raccoon-like mask. It is the only masked frog in the Northeast, and though its cowl is almost a clich\u00e9 for roaming the city\u2019s dark corners, it must be one of the least intimidating creatures in the forest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe wood frog often makes a three- or four-foot leap to escape disturbance. I have often chased these jumpers, only to find they were not where they seemed to land. If you\u2019re fast enough, you\u2019ll observe the trick behind the frog\u2019s hop. Often, just after landing, the animal shuffles under the nearby leaf litter and freezes. If you\u2019re patient, a leaf or two rustles and you find your frog \u2014 but this hide-and-seek technique is about as close to a magician\u2019s trick as you\u2019ll find in our local woods.\n\nDuring the winter, an icy wood frog is no magic act; the wood frog\u2019s ability to survive with up to 65 percent of its body frozen may have very real biological implications for humans. The animal lies dormant under the leaf litter, not breathing and without a pulse, through the coldest months of the winter. The frogs resume their lives as the local pools thaw in March, not just uninjured, but eager to mate.", "title": "The Croaky Sounds of Spring", "authors": ["Dave Taft"]}

Norton & Company. $25.95.\n\nClassical mythology brings us the tale of the Sibyl of Cumae, a prophetess who bargains with Apollo for endless life, and centuries later comes to yearn for death. She failed to negotiate for eternal youth, you see, and with the years she grows shrunken and decrepit and miserable. The story echoes a sentiment that endures in contemporary life: However much time kale, yoga, spa weekends and wonder drugs may buy us, we accept that at some point we\u2019ll become so enfeebled that we\u2019ll be ready to pack it in, once and for all.\n\nBut what if rolled into endless life were endless youth, and we kept looking and feeling our best, century after century? Would we still, like the Cumaean Sibyl, wish to die? Yup. This is the answer provided by the hero of Dara Horn\u2019s captivating new novel, \u201cEternal Life.\u201d When we meet Rachel, she\u2019s a suburban great-grandmother, recently widowed, with a ne\u2019er-do-well adult son living in the basement. What her family doesn\u2019t know is that she\u2019s 2,000 some-odd years old. And while she may look like a senior citizen now, anytime Rachel burns to death (happens more than you\u2019d think over the course of millenniums), she wakes up in her 18-year-old body, physically equipped to begin life all over again.\n\nBut every new \u201cversion,\u201d as Rachel calls her countless iterations of work, family and home, brings another cycle of grief and loss. The loved ones who surround her in the 21st century mostly remind her of the scores of loved ones who\u2019ve died. For Rachel, the present is coated in thick layers of the past. And her relationships, particularly with her children, have taken on a numbing predictability. As Horn writes, \u201cAt one point she tried to estimate how many thousands of times she had nursed an infant, how many meals she had cooked for others, how many spoons of medicine she had raised to other people\u2019s lips, how many withered hands she had held at bedsides, how many bodies she had buried in the earth.\u201d Rachel\u2019s perspective as a fixed point among ordinary mortals heading from cradle to grave makes her feel isolated, detached \u2014 not fully alive, despite (or really because of) her immortality.\n\nSo Rachel is eager to die. Her problem is she can\u2019t. And she\u2019s given it her best shot: attempted suicide in numerous forms, sought the counsel over the centuries of everyone from ancient holy men to cognitive behavioral therapists.\n\nThe origins of Rachel\u2019s predicament date back to the days of the Roman occupation of Jerusalem, a world Horn recreates with a deft and convincing touch. As a teenager, Rachel falls in love with Elazar, rakish son of the high priest. As their illicit romance twists and turns, the lovers end up making a vow at the Temple, the consequences of which \u2014 eternal life for both of them \u2014 only become clear decades later. As is often the case in Horn\u2019s fiction, Jewish history and the lives of her fictional characters wrap around one another, as Rachel\u2019s realization of her inescapable immortality coincides with a brilliant and brutal depiction of the destruction of the ancient Temple, one of the novel\u2019s high points.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the centuries roll along, Elazar keeps popping up in Rachel\u2019s life. While she has good reason to hate him for a betrayal that had fatal consequences, she can\u2019t forsake him, either. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s the only other person on earth who knows what it\u2019s like to live forever. Rachel\u2019s undying love for Elazar helps her at least understand why life is something to which everyone else around her is clinging to so fiercely.\n\n\u201cThe hard part isn\u2019t living forever,\u201d Rachel observes. \u201cIt\u2019s making life worth living.\u201d And the question at the heart of this wise and appealing novel is finally not how Rachel finds meaning in her eternal life. It is how we, despite our portions of sorrow, tedium and disaster, persist in finding meaning in ours.", "title": "The Downside of Immortality", "authors": ["Joshua Max Feldman", "Dara Horn"]}

The work of the marshals was but one part of an extraordinary puzzle that made up the last 24 hours of the serial-bomber investigation.\n\nIn the predawn hours of Wednesday, emotions were on edge among the dozens of officers lying in wait. Some had hardly slept in days. Like other residents of this fast-growing city, they had grown apprehensive about going near anything resembling a package. Pressure to catch Mr. Conditt was growing intense.\n\nWas he inside the hotel? Mr. Filla wondered.\n\nAgents checked with the hotel management, who confirmed that Mr. Conditt was not checked in as a guest. They kept their eyes trained on the Nissan in the parking lot. Then an officer peering through binoculars glimpsed exhaust coming out of the tailpipe.\n\nThe headlights were off. But the vehicle started to move out of the lot.\n\nA Slip-Up Accelerates the Case\n\nThe authorities knew Mr. Conditt would send or place another homemade bomb \u2014 the question was when, not if. A series of leads had brought investigators to him, including surveillance footage inside and near a FedEx store where he had shipped two packages loaded with explosives. Starting with the license plate from a different truck he drove, agents were able to track his cellphone number and the construction gloves he had worn while shipping the bombs.\n\nThe clues all came together to where Mr. Conditt was on Wednesday morning, in the darkened parking lot off Interstate 35.\n\nThe showdown started with an apparent mistake.\n\nAt one minute past 4 p.m. on Tuesday, paramedics were notified about an \u201cunknown medical alarm\u201d at Mr. Conditt\u2019s home in Pflugerville. Two paramedics from the Pflugerville Fire Department responded. A person inside the home \u2014 it was unclear whom \u2014 answered the door and told the medics no one there had called 911. The paramedics cleared out at 4:11 p.m.\n\nFrom an incident report released Friday by the Pflugerville Fire Department, it now appears that a request by investigators for paramedics to remain near the house was relayed instead as a call for immediate medical aid to the residence. It is possible that Mr. Conditt himself had come to the door or was home at the time, and began to suspect that the authorities were closing in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At some point in the hours to come, he left a roughly 25-minute recording on his phone that officials described as a confession. Law enforcement officials said the miscommunication involving the paramedics was under review.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClosing In\n\nOn Tuesday night, investigators were still sorting through a multitude of tips and blind alleys.\n\nThe local, state and federal agents hunting the bomber wondered if he had struck again. About an hour after the paramedics had left Mr. Conditt\u2019s residence in Pflugerville, the team of investigators had converged on a Goodwill store in south Austin shortly after 5 p.m. in response to a report of an explosion. That incident ended up being unrelated: Military-style ordnance that someone had donated had ignited and injured a worker. It took attention away from Mr. Conditt.\n\nBut not for long. Later that evening, the police closed Main Street in Pflugerville.\n\nIt was not until later that they traced his vehicle to the Courtyard by Marriott in nearby Round Rock. When Mr. Conditt pulled his Pathfinder out of the parking lot, a stream of vehicles slowly followed. Mr. Filla, the deputy marshal, described it as the opposite of a high-speed chase. Agents, he said, were hoping to capture Mr. Conditt alive and avoid any harm to themselves.\n\nUsing what he described as a \u201ctactical vehicle maneuver,\u201d the SWAT team managed to cautiously push Mr. Conditt\u2019s vehicle onto the edge of a service road just off Interstate 35. Officers approached the vehicle, but were stunned by an explosion triggered by Mr. Conditt as they moved in.\n\n\u201cBomb, bomb, bomb!\u201d some in the vicinity yelled. At one point, one of the officers fired his weapon; another was thrown back by the blast and injured.\n\nOther officers quickly tried backing up their vehicles but found they couldn\u2019t go very far since so many official cars \u2014 from the marshals to local police departments, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the F.B.I. \u2014 had arrived at the site.\n\n\u201cIt resembled a law enforcement funeral procession,\u201d Mr. Filla said. \u201cThat\u2019s how many of us were there.\u201d\n\nHours after it was all over on Wednesday, the Austin police chief, Brian Manley, told reporters assembled nearby that the bomber was dead, although he declined to identify Mr. Conditt at the time.\n\n\u201cLate last night and early this morning, we felt very confident that this was the suspect in the bombing incidents that took place in Austin,\u201d Chief Manley said.\n\n\u201cThe suspect,\u201d he said, \u201cis deceased.", "title": "The Dramatic Last Hours as Agents Stalked the Austin Bomber", "authors": ["Simon Romero", "Manny Fernandez"]}

A camel track was used for a sprint, a mile contest, and a one-and-a-half mile race.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until 1992 that the Dubai Racing Club was formed, and that March, Nad Al Sheba Racecourse, the first home of the World Cup, opened. The following year, the Dubai International Jockeys\u2019 Challenge was held, with riders representing Australia, Europe, Japan, the U.A.E. and the United States.", "title": "The Dubai World Cup, a Story of Horses and Money", "authors": []}

Since he became chief of staff last July, Mr. Kelly has toiled to control access to Mr. Trump to try to ensure that his actions are informed by an orderly process in the West Wing \u2014 a pursuit that flies in the face of the president\u2019s freewheeling style.\n\nThe tension between the White House and the E.P.A. over the red team, blue team idea reflects a broader rift within the administration over whether and how directly to attack climate change science itself. While the words \u201cclimate change\u201d have been removed from many federal websites, and Mr. Trump has mocked global warming in tweets, the administration has stopped short of using the power of the federal government to attack the science.\n\nPhoto\n\nHolding national debates on climate change could have serious policy implications.\n\nThe fundamental science, that man-made pollution is overwhelmingly responsible for warming temperatures and rising sea levels, is widely accepted among mainstream scientists. That science formed the basis of a key 2009 E.P.A. decision known as the endangerment finding, which declares that climate change is a threat to human health and welfare. That finding is the legal backbone for almost all federal climate policy and requires the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in some manner. A government critique of climate science could lay the groundwork for challenging the endangerment finding in court.\n\nClimate denialist groups like the Heartland Institute have urged Mr. Pruitt to challenge the finding, while industry associations have expressed little interest in doing so. Tim Doyle, vice president of policy for the conservative business organization American Council for Capital Formation, said the companies he works with have not expressed any interest in a public forum to challenge climate change science.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe definitely haven\u2019t heard any of our members supporting the red team, blue team concept,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been, if anything, radio silence about it.\u201d\n\nThe idea for red team, blue team climate debates originated with Steven Koonin, a physicist at New York University who was an energy undersecretary under Mr. Obama. Mr. Koonin in April wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for using the military-style exercise \u2014 in which one team attacks and another defends \u2014 to test the robustness of climate change science. One week later, he paid a visit to the E.P.A. at Mr. Pruitt\u2019s invitation to discuss the idea further.\n\nMr. Koonin, in an interview, said he has \u201cno dog in this fight\u201d \u2014 meaning that he is willing to be persuaded that climate change is an urgent threat \u2014 but that he believes there are uncertainties in the science that are worth exploring.\n\nIn talking with federal officials, Mr. Koonin said he outlined a vision for a debate including not only the E.P.A. but also the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, both of which collect data and conduct studies on Arctic ice melt, global temperature modeling and other issues. The White House science adviser should coordinate any such exercise, he said, to ensure all relevant government offices participate.\n\n\u201cIt would need to be governmentwide, certainly multiagency, in order for it to be robust and taken seriously as a scientific endeavor,\u201d Mr. Koonin said.\n\nClimate scientists and others who oppose the debate idea note that the studies that make up the body of knowledge on climate change already are subject to rigorous peer review. They contend that the red team, blue team exercise would be a politically motivated way to inject doubt into findings that have already been scientifically established.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a red team approach is used to test how well forces, or strategy, will perform against an adversary. But climate science is not our adversary,\u201d said Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense under President Bill Clinton and now a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center.\n\nMr. Pruitt planned to announce his red team, blue team debate in early November, according to a news release that was written but never issued. According to four people who have read the draft news release, the debates were to be organized by the E.P.A.\u2019s science advisory board and not include other agencies.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe announcement of the debates would have coincided with the release of an exhaustive scientific report from 13 United States government agencies that definitively found human activity to be responsible for almost all of the warming that has occurred in the past half-century. It would have also coincided with the start of a United Nations meeting in Germany to discuss the Paris agreement, the global climate accord from which Mr. Trump intends to withdraw the United States\u2019 participation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff learned about the news release, he demanded the debates be delayed until cabinet secretaries and top White House officials could discuss it, according to three people familiar with the discussions. That initial meeting never occurred, but on Dec. 13, the White House convened senior officials to discuss the matter.\n\nAccording to two people who attended, the meeting included a presentation of the red team, blue team plan by two E.P.A. officials \u2014 Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff and the head of the agency\u2019s air office. Other attendees included senior officials from the Department of Energy, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Economic Council.\n\nThe meeting was run by Mr. Dearborn and Michael Catanzaro, who is a member of the economic council and the president\u2019s domestic energy and environment policy director.\n\nThe takeaway, according to people in the room, was that every office within the White House was opposed to the idea. At one point, Mr. Dearborn said the notion of red team, blue team debates was \u201cdead\u201d and should not be mentioned again. \u201cThe chief doesn\u2019t want it,\u201d Mr. Dearborn said, referring to the White House chief of staff, according to one person who attended.\n\nE.P.A. officials were taken aback, the person said.\n\nIn the weeks since that meeting, however, Mr. Pruitt said the red team, blue team debates were still under consideration. In January, he told Congress that a report in E & E News, a news organization focusing on energy and the environment that first reported that the White House had killed the plan, was false. White House opposition to the debates was \u201cuntrue,\u201d he said under questioning by a senator.\n\nFor the moment, even those who have championed the red team, blue team idea like Mr. Koonin are doubtful the debates will happen. \u201cMy optimism that we can get this done in a quality way is pretty low at this point,\u201d Mr. Koonin said. \u201cIt needs to be a governmentwide exercise and there\u2019s nobody that I know of that has picked up the ball in the White House.\u201d", "title": "The E.P.A.

They combined that personal data with home air-quality data in order to study the link between chronic exposure to air pollution and mortality.\n\nAcademics aren\u2019t typically required to turn over such private data when submitting studies for peer review by other specialists in the field, or for review and publication in scientific journals, which is the traditional way that this kind of research is evaluated. If academics were to turn over the raw data to be made available for public review, the agency would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a federal estimate , to redact private information.\n\nThe bottom line, critics say, is that if the E.P.A. is limited to considering only studies in which the data is publicly available, the agency will have a narrower and incomplete body of research to draw on when considering regulations. \u201cIt sends a pretty chilling message to scientists that their work can\u2019t be used or won\u2019t be used,\u201d said Sean Gallagher, a government relations officer with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a nonprofit science advocacy organization .\n\nMr. Pruitt laid out his plans for the new transparency policy in an interview last week with The Daily Caller, a conservative news site. The proposal is based on legislation named the Honest and Open New E.P.A. Science Treatment Act, also known as the Honest Act, a bill sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican. The bill has failed to gain support in Congress for years despite having the support of the energy, manufacturing and chemical industries.\n\nThat legislation aimed to preclude the E.P.A. from using any studies that could not be independently reproduced. According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign finance data, versions of the bill have received support from Exxon Mobil, Peabody Energy, Koch Industries and the American Chemistry Council, which provides policy and research for major chemical companies including Arkema, DuPont and Monsanto.\n\nMr. Smith, the sponsor of the stalled Congressional legislation, applauded the E.P.A.\u2019s proposed move. \u201cOur citizens have a right to see the data that the E.P.A. says justifies their regulations,\u201d he said in a statement.

At the time, after surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, Silicon Valley companies were adding anti-surveillance protections including encryption to their data centers and messaging tools. Washington accused tech companies of going too far, and the F.B.I. pressed companies like Apple to weaken their encryption or build in a government back door.\n\nIn February 2015, at a cybersecurity conference in Washington, Mr. Stamos stood up to Adm. Michael S.

Some at the social network worried aloud whether he was too much of a firebrand to join the social network, according to three current and former Facebook employees who declined to be named because of nondisclosure agreements.

From the start, the current and former employees said, he got off on the wrong foot with some executives, including Ms. Sandberg, over how best to police the platform.

The findings pit him against executives in the company\u2019s legal and communications groups. While Mr. Stamos argued to disclose more, others said that by proactively disclosing what they had found, Facebook had become a target of further public ire, according to seven current and former Facebook employees.\n\nInternally, Mr. Stamos repeatedly argued that Facebook needed to act more like a defense contractor in dealing with security, given that the social network was becoming a similar target for nation states.\n\nIn audio leaked in October to ZDNet, a tech news site, he told his security team that he explained to management \u201cthat we have the threat profile of a Northrop Grumman or a Raytheon or another defense contractor, but we run our corporate network, for example, like a college campus, almost.\u201d\n\nThe tape infuriated Mr. Stamos\u2019s bosses, according to the current and former employees.

Nor does he trust in the National Electoral Institute. After losing the 2006 election by a wafer-thin margin (0.58 percent), he declared the election fraudulent and led his followers in occupying the Paseo de la Reforma, the central artery of Mexico City, an action rejected by the public. Defeated by a larger margin (6.63 percent) in 2012, he again claimed fraud. He has continued to show disdain for the institutions of liberal democracy. \u201cTo hell with their institutions,\u201d he famously said in 2006 and has not disavowed his assertion. And he recently accused the Supreme Court of being an instrument of the oligarchy used to dominate the people.\n\nThere is a genuine linkage of religious fervor (which it seems just to call messianic) between Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his followers. Confident in that connection, he has shown an unbending intolerance toward criticism from the media and intellectuals. He has a disqualifying adjective for every group that doubts or opposes him: \u201cfakes,\u201d \u201cconservatives,\u201d \u201csellouts.\u201d He has called the press \u201cfif\u00ed\u201d (bourgeois).

He shows a real concern for alleviating poverty though is as yet insufficiently specific in his proposals. Many liberal Mexicans fear that he will reverse the opening to private and foreign investment in Mexican oil production and will choose to protect the domestic economy from international competition.\n\nMy own major concern, however, is his attitude toward our still fragile democracy. In his defense, his supporters point to his record as mayor of Mexico City (2000-05), but that position did not remotely involve the power that would accrue to him as president. Were Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to choose to incite popular mobilizations and plebiscites, his government could call for a Constituent Assembly, and move toward annulling the division of powers and subordinating the Supreme Court and other autonomous institutions after restricting the freedom of the media and silencing any dissenting voices. In such circumstances, Mexico could once again become a monarchy, though messianic and in the style of a caudillo without republican costuming: \u201cthe country of a single man.\u201d\n\nIt is to be hoped that the legitimate discontent of Mexicans and the urgent need for change does not lead to the demise of our fledgling but genuine democracy.", "title": "Opinion | The End of Mexican Democracy?", "authors": []}

I remembered that the last time I said goodbye to my girlfriend, her oldest sister told me that whatever happened they would try to go to the main gate of the base and wait for me there.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

I asked them what was going on. They said they got caught trying to steal airplanes. I was puzzled. Then they told me that the war was fast coming to an end, and we were losing: The N.V.A. had already taken over most of the cities, and they were marching to Saigon, the capital.\n\nEarly the next morning, the police came in, opened the jail cells, gave us all our IDs and left in a hurry. I thought about what my girlfriend\u2019s sister had said, so I ran toward to the main gate. As I got closer to the gate, I could see Air Force security and military police with tanks and guns trying to prevent people outside from coming to the base. It was like a war zone; they were shooting at each other. I dropped to the ground to avoid being shot, then crawled and crouched to get to the gate. The gunfire continued. People were running in all directions, panicked and scared. I couldn\u2019t find my girlfriend or her family.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround 11 a.m., a radio announcement came over the loudspeakers. Saigon had fallen. Then things really got out of control. Soldiers ripped off their uniforms, grabbing whatever civilian clothes they could find. Intelligence personnel burned their documents. I saw overloaded helicopters hover and crash, with people coming out bloodied, badly injured. Smoke came from the runway. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI ran toward the hangars and bumped into the pilot who was in the jail cell with me the previous night. We ran down to the end of the runway and jumped into an empty UH-1 \u201cHuey\u201d helicopter. As soon as we started the engine, about 20 guys jumped on. The weight was too much; we could barely hover at 10 feet. Fortunately there was another Huey parked nearby, and half of us jumped in and took off. Airborne, we flew out to the sea, like birds escaping a net. I would not set foot in Vietnam again for almost 20 years.\n\nWe landed on an island called Con Son, where the South Vietnamese government incarcerated political prisoners. There were some high-ranking Air Force officials there; they had arrived the night before from Saigon with their families. We refueled and made a plan. We sent two of the several Hueys on the island to look for an American aircraft carrier, which was stationed farther out in the South China Sea.\n\nWhile we waited, we met the newly freed prisoners; in exchange for some money and jewelry, they fed us lunch with food they had grown on the island. They had no idea what had just happened in Saigon.\n\nA few hours later, the Hueys returned \u2014 they had found the carrier. There were Chinooks on the island as well, and we all boarded them and flew east. I sat in the tail, with a headset, and listened in on the radio. Vietcong operatives had found our transmissions, and a female voice kept calling us, pleading with us to come back to Saigon, saying that our families were waiting for us, that our country would take us back with open arms and big rewards.\n\nI could hear the pilots arguing in the cockpit. They had in fact left their families behind. Suddenly I felt the helicopter turn around.\n\nI screamed into the headset: \u201cNo, no, we can never trust them! All those words are just lies! We all will be caught and sent to jail! Maybe executed!\u201d Finally they turned back around, and we tried to catch up with our group.\n\nA few minutes later, we arrived at the aircraft carrier Midway. As we approached, I saw one Chinook and a couple of Hueys floating upside down in the water near the ship. I thought some of us had missed the landing and crashed.\n\nThe flight deck below us was crowded with people, planes and helicopters. We had to circle for a while, but eventually the deck crew allowed us to land. As soon as we were out, crewmen took away our helmets, headphones and handguns, and directed the passengers off the flight deck. Then a group of us helped them push the Chinook off the side into the water to make room for more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI watched it bob in the water.

The problem was that Arie blindsided Becca and ambushed her with cameras and then refused to leave when she politely asked him to do so \u2014 seemingly because he wanted her to absolve him of his guilt. Producers be damned, he should have split with her off-camera.\n\nLindsey: I actually appreciated the \u201cunedited and uncut\u201d footage. For once, Chris Harrison didn\u2019t lie to us. It was unlike what we normally see on \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and on reality TV in general. It also made many viewers truly uncomfortable, probably because we saw a lot of the real emotions that we\u2019re normally shielded from. We\u2019re used to seeing contestants cry. But we don\u2019t normally see them truly wronged.\n\nMany of the scenes in the first part of finale, and the cuts to Chris Harrison staring at the camera with the studio audience sitting in stunned silence, were jarring. It felt really icky that someone\u2019s pain was shown for our entertainment. But the way it was shown wasn\u2019t highly manipulated for once.\n\nJon: I would argue that this is the exact point of the show \u2014 to remind you that happiness comes with a price, and not always the one you expect. Naturally, there is going to be a backlash against Arie, who proposed and then recanted and then proposed again. But to me, it\u2019s more interesting that the default position about the show has, over the years, shifted from skepticism \u2014 \u201cCan you believe these people are getting married?\u201d \u2014 to credulousness that can be fractured \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t believe he dishonored his proposal!\u201d That tells you loads about how popular perception of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d and reality television in general, has evolved.\n\nBonnie: Sitting on that couch talking to Chris Harrison, Becca put it plainly: \u201cI signed up for this.\u201d If she can live with that, I think we can too.\n\nLindsey: Right, and by the end of last night\u2019s episode, my roommate and I were grinning at the TV as Becca met her new suitors. We fell for the whole redemption charade.\n\nCarla: The second night was a smart move by producers. Here\u2019s why: The season was flat. Ratings were down. Arie was the wrong choice for the lead. Then he proved to be the ambivalent man that sleuthing viewers (well, Reality Steve) had revealed him to be. There was no good way to end this season unless ABC split the show in two and incorporated fans\u2019 ardent reactions to his betrayal on social media in the second part of the episode.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Chris Harrison was able to show fan engagement \u2014 most incredibly, that some paid to put up anti-Arie billboards, and other bought drinks for Becca by sending her money on Venmo. (Becca then said she\u2019ll donate the thousands of dollars to charity, and Harrison said the show would match it. What a public relations win!) Then Becca was announced as Bachelorette. Once again, ABC has a beloved lead for its hit reality show and viewers will tune in for next season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJon: Arie had been without a personality for so long that it came as something of a relief that he finally secured one: villain.\n\nIn truth, Arie did what many people have done. He made a poor choice, then tried to make it right. This is not radical stuff. It takes on extra dimension because it\u2019s the gasoline for a network television reality-competition franchise, loved and reviled by millions. But while you can quibble with how he handled things, especially by not leaving the room when Becca persistently asked him to after he dumped her, he was \u2014 or was presented as \u2014 a reasonably stand-up guy.\n\nLindsey: But that\u2019s the thing with The Bachelor that gets to me. We learn so little about the people on the show, that it\u2019s hard to see why they even like each other beyond the physical. I loved when Arie asked Lauren a \u201ctough question\u201d about what she imagined a day in their life would look like outside of the show. She said they\u2019d wake up and have coffee, walk their dogs, go to work, come home, make dinner and drink some wine. He agreed. What a unique life, so glad they found each other! If that\u2019s not a connection, I don\u2019t know what is!\n\nCarla: Early on, viewers saw Lauren say to Arie: \u201cI know you want someone who has a flexible schedule, but what else are you looking for?\u201d A flexible schedule? How romantic.\n\nBonnie: I went into Monday night\u2019s episode expecting Arie to walk away single, based on his apparent indecision and the hyperbolic promos. But that quick turn from melodrama to \u201ceverything is fine!\u201d repeats itself every season in some fashion, and we keep falling for it.\n\nJon: By the end of the two-night spectacle, Becca had been raised high and given a new chance at love; Arie had been redeemed, then erased; and Lauren was rescued from her couch and given a new, albeit imperfect, romantic fantasy.\n\nIt was hard not to feel bad for Lauren last night \u2014 not because she\u2019s choosing a life with Arie, but because her proposal came in rushed fashion, in front of a studio audience skeptical of her man, and with Becca in the green room, waiting to come back out and steal the narrative back.\n\nThe innovation this season was the choice to split-screen the breakup, and to present it without editing \u2014 that\u2019s a nod to the intensity of the raw footage. In the just-released book \u201cBachelor Nation,\u201d the journalist Amy Kaufman details the production and editing chicanery that goes into making the show\u2019s emotional arcs so effective.\n\nBut it turns out that the show had one more trick to deploy: letting the feelings speak for themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLindsey: Here\u2019s one positive thing I have to say about this season: I was glad that they mostly returned to having rose ceremonies at the end of each episode rather than cliffhangers all the time.

There is no murder mystery. The book details the wrongful convictions of two men, Kennedy Brewer and Levon Brooks, in the separate murders of two girls in the same rural Mississippi town in the early 1990s. But the real killer of both 3-year-olds is revealed to the reader before the wrong men are even put on trial. We are also spared the anguish of wondering if the system will ever get it right, for we know the men have already been freed thanks to the work of the nonprofit criminal exoneration organization the Innocence Project.\n\nThe crime having been solved early on, Balko and Carrington devote the bulk of the book to pulling back the curtain on the justice system\u2019s little-known but systemic problem that put Brewer and Brooks behind bars: faulty and biased forensic evidence. Junk science convicted these men; real science set them free. The inability of judges and jurors to tell the difference is why innocent men languish in jail while the prosecutors who put them there run for higher office.\n\nPhoto\n\nMississippi would have been better served by the actual actors from \u201cCSI\u201d conducting its forensic investigations than the autopsy specialist Steven Hayne and his \u201csidekick,\u201d the bite-mark analyst Michael West.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "Little in Hollinghurst\u2019s early life would seem to have predisposed him for the role of epochal silence breaker. An only child, he was born in the small market town of Stroud in 1954. His parents were Churchill-worshiping Conservatives. At the time, daily existence was still permeated by the war. Rationing ended a few weeks after his birth, but because many people who had been called up continued to use military titles in civilian life, Hollinghurst spent his childhood referring to neighbors and family friends as \u201cMajor This\u201d and \u201cWing Commander That.\u201d To keep him in line, his father would sometimes bark at him in a parody of military drill. (\u201cStand up straight, boy!\u201d Hollinghurst said in a booming, somewhat camp disciplinarian voice, recalling the routine. \u201cPut your shoulders back!\u201d) At the nearby all-boys boarding school to which he was sent at age 7, he was studious and well behaved, terrified of being punished by the masters. It was there that he discovered Wagner, the English poets and, a few years later, with the onset of puberty, a keen interest in his fellow schoolmates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike olive oil or color TV, open homosexuals were not a feature of this straitened world; it wasn\u2019t until Hollinghurst went to Oxford to read English in 1972 that he encountered his first unmistakably gay person. As a graduate student in the late 1970s, he took up the newly permissible project of constructing a gay canon. He read \u201cSexual Heretics\u201d (1970), the groundbreaking anthology of gay Victorian writing, and Aleister Crowley\u2019s \u201cWhite Stains\u201d (1898), a volume of erotic verse that had to be published abroad under a pseudonym, in Oxford\u2019s Bodleian Library. \u201cThere was so little material in those days, so I was rather turned on by this sort of terrible gay pornography,\u201d he told me. His thesis, by contrast, a study of \u201cthe creative uses of homosexuality\u201d in the novels of Ronald Firbank, E.M. Forster and L.P. Hartley, sought to elucidate \u201cthe stimulating effects of constraint.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in graduate school, Hollinghurst paid intermittent visits to London, where, in his words, \u201cthe gaying up of Soho\u201d was well underway. The dazzling world of bars and clubs and public cruising spots of which he caught a glimpse stood in bracing contrast to Oxford, with its dour emotional atmosphere of thwarted longing and romantic starvation. (There was a gay social club at his Oxford college, Hollinghurst told me, but \u201cthe other members didn\u2019t necessarily make you keen to join it.\u201d) When he moved to the city for good in 1981 and took a job as an editor at The Times Literary Supplement, he embarked on a process of euphoric discovery. \u201cThe whole idea of London became sexualized for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seemed it would be very interesting to try and capture some of that on the page.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1984, Hollinghurst sat down to begin writing \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library.\u201d Conscious of several previous novels he failed to finish, he\u2019d recently acquired a yearlong desk diary and set himself the goal \u2014 a kind of New Year\u2019s resolution \u2014 of filling up a page a day. Although he didn\u2019t quite maintain this pace, he was several chapters in and feeling good about his progress when, in November, he received shattering news. Nicholas Clark, a close friend from Oxford who introduced him to London\u2019s gay scene, had died suddenly. It had been clear for months that Clark was unwell; he always seemed to have a cold, and once, after he cut himself shaving, his face was swollen for weeks. AIDS was still little understood \u2014 it was something going on, or so Hollinghurst and other members of England\u2019s gay community liked to tell themselves, elsewhere: i.e., America.\n\nClark was one of the first people in England to succumb to the disease, and his death signified a rupture with all that had gone before. The unexplored world that Hollinghurst had set out to chronicle was itself being radically transformed before his eyes. As he pressed ahead, he was confronted with the question of whether to incorporate this changed reality into his novel. He considered having Will, stricken with AIDS, narrate the entire book on his deathbed, or using a framing device in which the book is presented as being transcribed from posthumously discovered tapes. Finally he decided that any such gesture would be surplus to requirements. History didn\u2019t need to be wedged into the book; the book was already inevitably permeated by it. Four years later, when \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d was published to critical and popular acclaim, the summer of 1983, during which much of the novel takes place, had acquired a similar poignancy to the summer of 1913.\n\nWhen the English writer Geoff Dyer read the book shortly after it was published, it made him realize how \u201ctimorous and discreet\u201d his own debut novel, \u201cThe Colour of Memory\u201d (1989), had been. \u201cI became interested in seeing to what extent one could do a heterosexual equivalent,\u201d he said on the phone. Garth Greenwell, whose celebrated debut novel, \u201cWhat Belongs to You\u201d (2016), drew comparisons with Hollinghurst, told me in an email that \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d gave him \u201can immense sense of permission\u201d when he discovered it at age 20 in 1998. \u201cThere was a great liberating thrill in reading, at that time when there was so much pressure to conform to a politics of respectability, a book that was so unapologetic in its representation of men having sex \u2014 pleasurably, promiscuously \u2014 with other men. It felt radical in its indifference to the moral judgments of straight people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a need to do something defiant,\u201d Hollinghurst said of the reactionary political climate in which his first novel was written and published. \u201c \u2018The Sparsholt Affair\u2019 has come out into a world that\u2019s so different.\u201d This new world \u2014 in which gay rights are increasingly recognized and sexual truth-telling is ubiquitous \u2014 is one that Hollinghurst played his part in creating. What kind of literature it might demand is a question that \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d tries to answer.\n\nThe novel opens one evening during the Blitz in the autumn of 1940, \u201cin that brief time between sunset and the blackout when you could still see into other people\u2019s rooms.\u201d A group of male students at Christ Church College, Oxford, has gathered in a dormitory to discuss literary matters. The conversation is quickly derailed, however, when one of them, Evert Dax, who is gay, spots a handsome young man in a singlet lifting weights in a room across the quad. They gather around to admire this alluring new figure, who, they soon learn, is in trouble with the college authorities for the \u201crhythmical creaking\u201d that has been coming from his room. For Evert, \u201ca strictly raised boy in an unusually good suit who seemed to gaze at pleasure as at the far bank of a river,\u201d an erotic obsession is born. Its object, the young David Sparsholt, is already engaged to his boyhood sweetheart, but by the end of term he and Evert will have slept together. It is a powerful sequence, as good as anything Hollinghurst has written, made all the more thrilling by the sexual invigilation to which the characters are subject.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Johnny inherits a world of sexual freedom inconceivable to his father, sleeping with numerous men before finally settling down in his 50s (and then getting back in the game once again after his longtime partner dies). While most of Hollinghurst\u2019s previous books ended on a note of poignant suspension, abbreviating the lives of his young protagonists, \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d keeps on going, skipping over decades as it closes in on the present. During that time, we witness the growing normalization and acceptance of gay people, relatively new terrain for Hollinghurst. The scandal that upended David\u2019s life and continues to haunt his son\u2019s comes to seem ever more cruel and benighted, the relic of a culture now receding into history.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet this isn\u2019t a story of straightforward progress and liberation; Hollinghurst knows that the present is never as enlightened as it likes to think it is, nor the past quite as backward. \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d opens in a world in which private life is fiercely inspected and surveilled; by the end, that world has given way to one in which private life is turned inside out and posted online for all to see. Toward the end of the book, a recently widowed Johnny is on a date with Michael, a young man he has met online. They begin to fool around, though Michael seems to be more interested in showing Johnny amateur porn on his laptop than in having actual sex with him. Through Johnny\u2019s eyes we witness an inventive but, it seems, rather joyless act of self-stimulation: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t remotely the sort of thing he was used to looking at, and he was giddy for a moment at the sequence of casual revelations, that people did this, and that they filmed it, and that others watched it.\u201d\n\nLike the window through which Evert and his friends first see David Sparsholt, the browser window on Michael\u2019s computer frames an object of male desire, though this one is rather less enticing. If \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d shows how society has been transformed by sexual liberation, a process with its roots in people\u2019s innermost desires, it also shows how people\u2019s innermost desires have in turn been conditioned by a transformed society. Baring all, the novel suggests of our present moment, may not be the best way to hold an admirer\u2019s \u2014 or a reader\u2019s \u2014 attention.\n\nHollinghurst\u2019s genius, in \u201cThe Swimming-Pool Library\u201d and beyond, has been to speak in a voice steeped in English heritage about a subculture that England\u2019s rigid and stratified society long refused to acknowledge, let alone accept. Naturally, such audacity has met with its detractors. When Hollinghurst\u2019s third novel, \u201cThe Spell,\u201d a game of amorous musical chairs involving four gay men of differing ages and a good deal of MDMA, appeared in 1998, its lack of interest in history, gay or otherwise, was perceived by many critics as a slackening of moral seriousness.\n\nOne of the most disparaging voices was that of John Updike, who, in a review for The New Yorker, complained that Hollinghurst\u2019s novels were \u201crelentlessly gay.\u201d After a while, he wrote, the (presumably straight) reader begins \u201cto long for the chirp and swing and civilizing animation of a female character.\u201d For Updike, even subpar novels of heterosexual coupling still concerned themselves with \u201cthe perpetuation of the species and the ancient, sacralized structures of the family,\u201d and thereby possessed a certain inherent interest; in \u201cThe Spell,\u201d by contrast, \u201cnothing is at stake but self-gratification.\u201d\n\nImplicit in this critique is the notion that to write about gay life is necessarily to limit oneself as a novelist. Updike had this exactly backward. For Hollinghurst, homosexuality is a democratizing force; it brings people together across boundaries of race and class and age. Had he been straight, his social canvas would have been restricted immeasurably. As Geoff Dyer told me, \u201cHe could\u2019ve ended up just reinventing some literary wheel if he\u2019d been a heterosexual, comedy-of-manners novelist with a more than passing fondness for toffs.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Hollinghurst\u2019s breadth and range more evident than in \u201cThe Line of Beauty,\u201d the novel in which he finally addressed the subject of AIDS head on. The book\u2019s protagonist is Nick Guest, a graduate student from a solid if unglamorous middle-class background who is lodging with the family of his Oxford friend Toby Fedden, the object of an unvoiced crush. It is 1983, Margaret Thatcher is prime minister and Toby\u2019s father, Gerald, is a newly elected member of the ruling Conservative Party. Nick, who has recently come out, divides his time between the elite world of the Fedden family, with its black-tie dinners and country-house weekends, and the gay underground of pre-AIDS London. Although he is at pains to keep a wall between these two domains, the book is at its most electrifying when Nick\u2019s fraught compartmentalization comes under pressure.\n\nNick is not the only one who strives for a rigid social compartmentalization. The Feddens, while seemingly a tolerant bunch, make it subtly but unmistakably clear that Nick\u2019s being gay is perfectly all right \u2014 so long as it\u2019s never discussed. This prohibition recalls the philosopher Michel Foucault\u2019s suggestion that what society finds so disturbing about homosexuality isn\u2019t the act of gay sex itself but gay relationships, which demonstrate that procreative heterosexual monogamy is not the only way to manage the chaotic energies of erotic life. It is striking how much the Feddens\u2019 attitude toward Nick resembles Updike\u2019s attitude toward Nick\u2019s creator. One is seen as a threat to the institution of heterosexual family life, the other as a threat to the literary form that has traditionally taken heterosexual family life as its principal subject matter. Yet far from threatening the novel, Hollinghurst has rejuvenated it, revealing how many more kinds of experience \u2014 how many previously unrepresented gestures and impressions and longings and relationships \u2014 it was possible to include in a novel than had been dreamed of by literature\u2019s straight gatekeepers.\n\nAfter he begins seeing Leo Charles, a working-class man of West Indian descent, Nick receives a visit from his new lover at the Feddens\u2019 opulent Notting Hill townhouse. Gerald answers the door and summons Nick. There follows a moment of flustered intimacy:\n\nIt was the first time in his life he\u2019d had a lover call for him, and the fact had a scandalous dazzle to it. Gerald didn\u2019t ask Leo in, but stood back a little to let Nick pass and to see if there was going to be any kind of trouble.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHello, Nick,\u201d said Leo.\n\n\u201cLeo!\u201d\n\nNick shook his hand and kept holding it as he stepped out onto the shallow porch, between the gleaming Tuscan pillars.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d said Leo, giving his cynical little smile, but his eyes almost caressing, passing Nick a secret message, and then nodding him a sign that Gerald had withdrawn; though he must have been able to hear him saying, \u201c ... some pal of Nick\u2019s ... \u201d and a few moments later, \u201cNo, black chappie.\u201d\n\nThe queer theorist Sara Ahmed has enjoined readers to \u201cthink of the kinds of experiences you have when you are not expected to be\u201d in a particular place or environment. \u201cThese experiences are a resource to generate knowledge.\u201d \u201cThe Line of Beauty\u201d \u2014 the entire Hollinghurst oeuvre \u2014 is a horde of estranged, surreptitiously acquired knowledge about English high society, generated by the experience of not belonging to it, of being tolerated without being accepted. Consider the centuries of tortured history that haunt the short, ostensibly rather comic sentence, \u201cGerald didn\u2019t ask Leo in, but stood back a little to let Nick pass and to see if there was going to be any kind of trouble.\u201d Or consider the fathomless ignorance \u2014 always a sure index of privilege \u2014 betrayed by the following exchange from later in the book. The AIDS crisis is at its height, and Nick is doing his best to speak reasonably with a friend of the Fedden family\u2019s, the kind of comic gargoyle at which Hollinghurst excels, who believes that \u201cthe homosexuals\u201d have brought the disease on themselves:\n\n\u201cBut as we all know,\u201d Nick went on flatteringly, and with a sort of weary zeal now the moment had come, \u201cthere are other things one can do. I mean there\u2019s oral sex, which may be dangerous, but is certainly less so.\u201d\n\nSally received this stoically. \u201cKissing, you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the more ghastly recent accessions,\u201d Hollinghurst murmured enthusiastically as we paused before Paul Emsley\u2019s painting of a sallow-faced, almost vampiric Kate Middleton (the cause of much public consternation when it was unveiled several years ago) on the second floor of the National Portrait Gallery in London\u2019s West End. Fifteen minutes earlier, in the basement cafe, he had been somewhat subdued, stoically hunched over a cup of coffee. His rumbling drawl, lent even more texture and resonance by a persistent cough, was only faintly audible above the reverberating din of trapped voices. Months of promotional events for \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d had taken their toll, and soon he would head to the United States to do it all again. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite got my pep back,\u201d he conceded apologetically.\n\nIt quickly returned, however, once we climbed the stairs. Surrounded by canvases, Hollinghurst seemed to come to the surface of himself, moving from one source of delight to another in a state of observant rapture. The visual arts have always been central to his work; his novels are themselves galleries, abounding in descriptions of paintings, sculptures, photographs, ornaments, interiors, buildings. I thought of a sentence from \u201cThe Line of Beauty\u201d: \u201cNick stayed on in the church, and the loneliness heightened his pleasure and his pride in his own responsiveness.\u201d Solitude is the natural state of the Hollinghurst protagonists and, also, it would seem, of the man himself. \u201cI love to just put a line through the diary and go into purdah,\u201d he said of his appetite for seclusion while writing \u2014 a capacity he attributes to the experience of growing up an only child. Though there have been exceptions, he has lived alone for much of his life.\n\nAt the same time, Hollinghurst is an avid socializer. \u201cHe moves in an exalted realm,\u201d said the philosopher Galen Strawson, who met Hollinghurst when they worked together at The Times Literary Supplement in the early 1980s. \u201cHe seems to know everybody in a high sphere of English cultural life.\u201d The novelist Edward St. Aubyn, who spoke of Hollinghurst\u2019s \u201caltruistic stamina,\u201d asked Hollinghurst to be his son\u2019s godfather. Susannah Clapp, the theater critic at The Observer, told me that whenever his friends have an \u201cO birthday\u201d (40, 50, 60), he takes them to see an opera of their choice. He has also been known to deliver speeches in rhyming couplets at his friends\u2019 momentous occasions. Naturally, the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s former director, Sandy Nairne, was another old friend of Hollinghurst\u2019s. A decade ago, Nairne asked him to be a selector for an exhibition at the museum called \u201cGay Icons.\u201d\n\nWe turned a corner into a room dominated by another royal portrait \u2014 John Lavery\u2019s immense, obsequious painting of King George V with his wife and children from 1913. \u201cSort of the manner of Sargent,\u201d Hollinghurst commented, \u201cbut nothing like as brilliant.\u201d In the final section of \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair,\u201d which is set in 2012, Johnny, now in late middle age, takes a commission from the nouveau riche Miserden family. Bella, the matriarch, a vain TV personality, wants him to model his painting on Lavery\u2019s. Rankled by the Miserdens\u2019 self-importance, Johnny instead envisions a work of scalding honesty (Bella\u2019s husband, Alan, a dot-com millionaire, \u201cfit and sleek in tight jeans, with no apparent genitals, had the overall smoothness of features that expects good fortune but never attracts much personal devotion\u201d) before finally settling on something, if not exactly flattering, at least more respectful and sedate.\n\nThe episode underscores one of the novel\u2019s central themes \u2014 postwar English decline. A century earlier, Johnny would have been painting the Windsors; now, in a society made by and for such pampered materialists as the Miserdens, he is left with a less-exalted subject. To be clear, Hollinghurst is no Tory; his reverence for the past is scrupulously qualified. As a gay man, he certainly harbors no nostalgia for an earlier time. As a novelist, however, he admits to finding the present a little thin.\n\nAt the NPG, Hollinghurst acknowledged certain paintings as though he were greeting, or purposely avoiding, the regulars at a private members club. \u201cDear old Vaughan Williams,\u201d he said as we passed Gerald Kelly\u2019s portrait of the composer in old age, with his immense jowls and tragicomic hearing aid. \u201cClement Attlee there,\u201d he said, not pausing to look at George Harcourt\u2019s rendering of the prime minister. In a hushed tone, Hollinghurst said, \u201cVery dull picture.\u201d My guide was especially eager to see the John Singer Sargent portrait of Henry James, one of Hollinghurst\u2019s personal gods, that a group of admirers commissioned for the writer\u2019s 70th birthday. \u201cHave they moved the Master?\u201d he said, as we entered a smaller room. \u201cHe was here just the other day.\u201d I wondered aloud if we should ask one of the attendants, but Hollinghurst gracefully accepted defeat. \u201cThey must have taken him down \u2014 part of the perpetual rotation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe paused in front of a self-portrait by Glyn Philpot, an early-20th-century painter who, when he was still in his early 20s, established himself as one of the most successful society portraitists of his time. Philpot, who lived with a male partner, painted dashing young men with a boldness and fervor that now seem patently gay. In the self-portrait, smartly dressed in a waistcoat and cuff links, he stares out at you with a languid composure that, after a while, in its decorous way, begins to take on a hint of the confrontational. Hollinghurst stood before the painting, returning the young artist\u2019s gaze.", "title": "The Evolution of One of Fiction\u2019s Gay Liberators", "authors": ["Giles Harvey"]}

It was planted in me \u2014 why is this woman not in a hijab? Why is this woman in heavy makeup? But I am not a god to hold people accountable. If I consider things wrong, I learned that I should not do them, but others can do as they please. What I\u2019ve seen here in Europe, of the kuffar, as we used to call them, I\u2019ve met people who are so much better than the people I met in jihad. They mind their own business and are respectful of others.\u201d\n\nBut did he mean it? Could a man like that really change? Were his old extremist ideas merely dormant, awaiting activation? He spoke with sincerity, but could Saleh really assimilate into a society he\u2019d once despised? Was he a threat to Europe, or is redemption possible, even for a man like him?\n\nHe had entered the world of Salafi jihadism in his late teens, exposed to the banned writings of Islamist leaders before he was detained by the Syrian regime, just shy of his 19th birthday. He didn\u2019t even pray regularly, let alone consider himself an Islamist, before he was imprisoned. \u201cI was a kid,\u201d he said, jailed with Qaeda members. The prison, he said, \u201cmade me what I became.\u201d A six-year \u201csleep\u201d (in prisoner parlance) ended when the regime opened his cell door in April 2011, releasing him with no formal charge as part of an amnesty.\n\nWith Syria in the throes of revolution, he formally joined his freed cellmates in Al Qaeda. \u201cTen years of my life like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t lived a normal day. You know what I do now? I work in a restaurant. I clean tables after customers. I wipe them down. That\u2019s my job and I\u2019m happy doing it. When I wipe a table, I feel normal, like this is what a normal person might do.\u201d It was also one of the few jobs he could get. \u201cWhat was I going to put on my C.V., that I\u2019d graduated from a sniper training course?\u201d\n\nHe had European friends who surprised him with the kindness they showed a Syrian refugee. His former Nusra Front colleagues didn\u2019t know where he was. He avoided Syrians and other Arabs, lest they learn his background. Only his family knew his whereabouts. He had once been an \u201camni,\u201d a security agent, tasked with finding and surveilling Al Qaeda\u2019s enemies and defectors in Turkey \u2014 men like him. He knew what might happen if an amni found him. He didn\u2019t dwell on it, although he had trouble sleeping, sometimes for days.\n\nA European friend introduced him to a psychiatrist, thinking he was traumatized from witnessing war, not knowing he had been a senior member of Al Qaeda. Saleh attended a few sessions and then stopped. \u201cWhat was the point?\u201d he said. \u201cI was lying to the doctor and to myself.

You could learn, during the final walk-through after a blizzard in March, that the Brooklyn townhouse you\u2019re about to buy has no heat. Or maybe you discover the IRS has a lien on the Chelsea condo you\u2019re about to buy, as happened to one buyer last year.\n\n\u201cIf somebody has a misstep, everything goes kablooey,\u201d said Richard Pisnoy, a principal of Silver Fin Capital, a mortgage brokerage in Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nYou would think someone like Christopher Kromer, who is an associate broker with Halstead and presumably knows how the process works, would have sailed through his first buying experience like a champ. But no.\n\n\u201cIt was gut wrenching, I was anxious every day,\u201d said Mr. Kromer who, with his wife, Stephanie Vo, a lawyer, bought a three-bedroom co-op in Park Slope in 2015, winning a 12-person bidding war by offering 10 percent over list price with no contingencies. No contingencies meant they couldn\u2019t get out of the contract even if any surprises arose. And surprise! \u201cWe didn\u2019t think through scenario one, two or three,\u201d Mr. Kromer, 44, said.\n\nScenario one turned out to be the appraisal. The appraiser valued the apartment, with treetop views in a doorman building, for $75,000 less than the contract price, which meant the bank wouldn\u2019t give them as much money for the mortgage, so Mr. Kromer and Ms. Vo had to come up with roughly $35,000 to make up the difference. (If they\u2019d had a mortgage contingency, they might have been able to renegotiate the price, or even back out of the deal.) They closed for $1.552 million.\n\nAnd then the sellers asked to stay in the apartment after the closing, meaning Mr. Kromer and Ms. Vo, 42, had to find temporary housing because they needed to vacate their Prospect Heights loft. They ended up staying in a friend\u2019s vacation house in Garrison, N.Y., saddling Mr. Kromer with a two-hour commute.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They also decided to renovate their kitchen before moving in, and then Mr. Kromer decided to strip the doors and remove some ceilings too. Oh, and Ms. Vo\u2019s mother was visiting to help with the new baby, staying with them first in Garrison and later in an Airbnb in Brooklyn. \u201cIt was decision overload,\u201d Mr. Kromer said. \u201cIt was overwhelming.\u201d\n\nLooking back on it, Mr. Kromer blames a lack of perspective for his late-night anxiety attacks. \u201cI needed someone who was objective, who I could trust.

Debbas, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan whose firm handles hundreds of closings a year, including the one last year with an IRS lien on the property \u2014 it eventually got sorted out, and the one earlier this month where the Brooklyn townhouse buyers discovered that the heating system was not working the day after a snowstorm.\n\n\u201cHow do you let a client close on a townhouse that doesn\u2019t have heat?\u201d Mr. Debbas said. This is how: You get the sellers to put money in an escrow account to cover the cost of repairs and everyone signs the paperwork and that\u2019s that.\n\nIt also helps to choose a seasoned team, or at the very least, people who actually work in the real estate business.

In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.\n\nThe beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.\n\nThose losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.\n\nThe Postal Service attributes much of its financial woe to a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail \u2014 bills, birthday cards and, for example, bridal shower invitations.

Mr. Mattis, though he has supported adherence to the deal, reportedly pushed for General McMaster\u2019s ouster and considers Iran an implacable threat to regional security and stability. Tearing up the Iran deal would provide a pretext for unleashing American forces \u2014 about 10,000 of which are already deployed in Iraq and Syria \u2014 against Iranian proxies in the Middle East, including Hezbollah and Iran-backed Shia militias.\n\n[RELATED: During negotiations for a nuclear deal with Iran, John Bolton wrote an op-ed in 2015 calling for military action to cripple the country\u2019s nuclear program.]\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s exit should have a smaller impact on North Korea policy, but that is no less unfortunate. He appeared to share Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the United States should leverage military threats and sanctions while downplaying diplomacy vis-\u00e0-vis the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in an effort to curb his nuclear and ballistic missile programs and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. At the president\u2019s bidding, General McMaster pushed the Pentagon to develop military plans \u2014 including the so-called \u201cbloody nose\u201d option involving a limited pre-emptive strike on a single North Korean missile or related site \u2014 that could bolster American deterrence while avoiding escalation to major war and collateral damage in the form of artillery and rocket strikes on South Korean civilians. The consensus is that no attack plan could confidently preclude escalation or collateral damage.\n\nHaving ceded the diplomatic initiative to Pyongyang and Seoul, the Trump administration had little choice but to accept Mr. Kim\u2019s offer of talks on the current crisis. In replacing Mr. Tillerson with Mr. Pompeo, however, the president has made sure he has a reflexively hawkish secretary of state in place. So the talks, even in the unlikely event that they occur, probably won\u2019t bear fruit. In that case, the administration would inevitably resume its hard-line \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy devoid of a serious diplomatic component, and could even start a war. Mr. Bolton publicly advocated a pre-emptive strike in a Wall Street Journal piece on Feb. 28, without mentioning collateral damage.\n\nMore generally, a national security team led by Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton is likely to face less resistance from Mr. Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \u2014 the remaining putative \u201cadults in the room.\u201d These two principals, alongside Mr. Tillerson and sometimes General McMaster, had reportedly blunted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s recklessly aggressive impulses. Now outnumbered, the two will face greater pressure to acquiesce to them. Mr. Trump has self-consciously chosen Mr. Bolton as well as Mr. Pompeo on the basis not of their collegiality or bureaucratic skills \u2014 traits that the president, judging by his other appointments, clearly does not value highly \u2014 but rather their like-minded ideological tilts, penchants for contrarianism, perceived telegenicity and personal compatibility.\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s frustrations, somewhat like Mr. Tillerson\u2019s, have demonstrated that, except for Mr. Mattis and General Dunford, a principal in the Trump administration responsible for any issue the president cares much about cannot enjoy appreciable bureaucratic clout without becoming a cheerleader who trumpets his ignorant views and endeavors to impose them. Mr. Trump himself has made it increasingly clear that for all his talk about liking conflict, his real intention is to pull together not a \u201cteam of rivals\u201d but a gang of sycophants.

They forced him to drink vinegar, believing he had swallowed gold and family jewels that the vinegar would help expel. Then they made the 17-year-old their slave, forcing him to dig wells.\n\n\u201cSometimes the soldiers got drunk and took me out and put AK-47s to my head so I would pass out,\u201d Mr. Tran said.\n\nEight months after he was caught, Mr. Tran\u2019s captors traded him to aid workers who carried humanitarian supplies. He still remembers the items that bought his freedom: a kilo of rice, two boxes of canned tuna, two boxes of sardines in tomato sauce, antibiotics and some other medical supplies.\n\nThe aid workers took him to Thailand. From there, the International Organization for Migration helped him reach the United States.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful,\u201d Mr. Tran said. \u201cHere I am, an American citizen.\u201d\n\nHis first job in America was scrubbing pots in a restaurant kitchen. Soon after that, he got his first call center job, in the payment processing division of a local bank. He said in an interview that he had worked in call centers for a total of 25 years.\n\nIn 2002, he began working in a call center for Wells Fargo\u2019s collections unit in Vancouver, Wash.

Butch Otter didn\u2019t see it as a rejection but as an invitation to \u201ccontinue discussing the specifics\u201d). And while the Trump administration approved a request to add work requirements to Medicaid in Arkansas, it has held off on approving a rollback in enrollment.\n\nThere are practical virtues in some of these initiatives: Efforts to expand the availability of cheaper, less regulated plans, for example, can provide alternatives to Obamacare\u2019s ever-rising premiums. But there are risks as well. Thanks to the way the health law\u2019s subsidies are structured, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off subsidy payments is likely to increase overall federal spending. The design of the cost-control board was legally questionable, but it represented an effort to cap the growth of America\u2019s largest entitlement program, and Republicans replaced it with nothing.\n\nAnd at times, the tweaks and fixes seem to be at war with one another. Those same short-term plans are likely to pull healthy people out of the exchanges, further destabilizing the markets and creating pressure to prop them up with subsidies and stabilization funds, which cost the government money.\n\nSupporters of the health care law might describe many of these changes as sabotage, and it\u2019s certainly true that many of them are not being made out of love for the law. But the changes also suggest that Republicans are belatedly engaging with the particulars of the law and its operation, cobbling together a not entirely coherent replacement on the fly.\n\nHaving failed in their repeal effort, Republicans are now in something of an arranged marriage with the health care law. These alterations are being made in a predictably haphazard fashion, with little in the way of guiding theory, but the cumulative effect is to turn Obamacare into a law that they can, if not love, at least learn to live with.\n\nTo be sure, the embrace is not without reservation. A group of conservative states recently unleashed another legal challenge to the law. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah recently called it the \u201cstupidest dumbass bill that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d But in arranged marriages, love often grows over time.\n\nThe end result of this process is likely to be a system that offers cheaper insurance for many but is more fractured, more frustrating and perhaps more expensive for taxpayers \u2014 more of a safety net than a support system.", "title": "Opinion | The G.O.P.

Crook never slips out of that voice for a moment. This is no small feat given that the tale involves Benjamin\u2019s demented half sister, the infamous massacre of Union-sympathizing German immigrants by local Confederates, and a giant panther.\n\nAny first-person voice involving a young Southern boy invites comparisons to Huck Finn. But dialects have complexities, and Crook appears to be a master of them. Benjamin\u2019s voice swings between the rhythms of the Southern hills and the lofty, elevated tone encountered in Twain and contemporary westerns (which ultimately comes from an acquaintance with the King James Bible). His speech can switch from hyperbole to understatement in the same sentence \u2014 and it is a wonderfully deadpan understatement. When he describes, for instance, his younger, mulatto half sister, left physically and emotionally scarred by the same panther that killed her mother and already having endured the death of their father by fever, Benjamin\u2019s drawl is particularly dry: \u201cShe is not a joy to look at nor be with.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nYet Crook\u2019s marvelous dexterity with language does not help her with narrative. Plots need to coalesce around characters with agency, characters who make things happen. They need to move beyond mere observation. Since Benjamin simply reports on what everybody else is doing, and reacts instead of taking initiative, the plot has no anchor and becomes chaotic. Benjamin is left with the care of his half sister, Samantha (or Sam), who has become obsessed with killing the giant panther \u2014 think Ahab in the Texas Hill Country. In the tailwind of her pursuit the girl accumulates people, or perhaps aggregates their stories. She precipitates most of the action but remains one-dimensional \u2014 less a character than a mania. (It\u2019s not easy to show the inner life of an obsessive, much less from the perspective of such a young narrator.) Very little is made of the fact that Benjamin\u2019s stepmother was African-American and his sister is of mixed race. That\u2019s not the story. The story is that they end up at the house of a frontier preacher to look at his aged, frail panther-tracking dog:\n\n\u201cI said, We will not take your dog.\n\n\u201cSam said, You are speaking for you and not me. I don\u2019t like the dog but what other chance do I have. I ain\u2019t leaving this house without him.\n\n\u201cThe preacher said, Well then, little girl, take your seat by the fire and be at home.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more, of course. They have the panther in their sights repeatedly but nobody can shoot straight. A villain named Hanlin comes and goes. A flash flood, like time, sweeps everybody downstream.\n\nThere are too many layers. Benjamin writes out his story to a local judge; then we have a couple of letters from 1925, commenting on the case years after it was closed and on Benjamin as an old man. The language is arresting, the plot is a mess and, in the interest of full disclosure, I must relate that the villain Hanlin\u2019s name is one of my own family names. My great-great-grandfather George Hanlin fled Texas in 1863, supposedly because of his Union sentiments, with his wife, a baby girl and a wagon pulled by two pinto ponies. They fled to Missouri, where they thought life was safer. It was not. I know they carried with them multilayered tales like this one, with extremely messy plots. \u201cThe Which Way Tree\u201d is a commendable and very readable addition to the tale-spinning tradition and its beautiful use of language.", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Panther", "authors": ["Paulette Jiles", "Elizabeth Crook"]}
{"date": "2018-03-25 00:00:00", "text": "There are surely multiple reasons that the college-graduation gap is growing. For one thing, neighborhoods have become more economically segregated, which probably increases gaps in the quality of K-12 schools \u2014 and, by extension, academic preparation. Many colleges that serve poor and middle-class students have also suffered cuts in state funding. And tuition has risen.\n\nWhatever the causes, the gap makes the United States a less fair country. Thousands of students who work hard, overcome tough neighborhoods or family situations and do well in school are nonetheless falling by the wayside. They\u2019re not failing so much as the rest of society is failing them.\n\nDoing right by them would require a lot of changes, in tax policy, housing policy and other areas. The Trump administration clearly has no interest in these changes. Instead, it\u2019s pushing an agenda that will worsen inequality.\n\nBut improving college graduation rates does not, for the most part, depend on the federal government. It\u2019s an area where people who want to help fix our economy \u2014 people in the nonprofit sector, in state and local government and, obviously, on college campuses \u2014 can play a meaningful role.\n\nAlready, some colleges have started to make impressive changes. Georgia State has raised its six-year graduation rate sharply. A network of 11 universities, including Kansas, Michigan State and the University of California, Riverside, are working together \u2014 imagine that \u2014 to share student-success strategies. In New York, community colleges in the CUNY network have created a program that nearly doubled graduation rates.\n\nI\u2019m convinced that the college-graduation problem is one of the big barriers to economic mobility \u2014 and yet also one on which we can make real progress. In the coming months, I will be telling some of the unknown success stories in higher education. I\u2019ll also look at campuses that should be doing better.\n\nThere are few things I find more inspiring than listening to teenagers from difficult backgrounds talk about their future, usually with optimism and ambition.

One study found that men are less likely to want a date with a woman who is more intelligent or ambitious than they are. In contrast, women penalize neither intelligence nor ambition in a man.\n\nWomen know, or at least intuit, that such taxes exist. That emerges from a recent paper by Leonardo Bursztyn, an economist at the University of Chicago; Thomas Fujiwara, an economist at Princeton; and Amanda Pallais, an economist at Harvard. They studied M.B.A. students who were asked by a career counselor about future job preferences. These answers would be used to help place them in jobs. For some students, the answers were private, while others were discussed in a class with their peers.\n\nFor men and women who were already in relationships, the distinction did not matter: They reported the same job preferences whether or not they were private.\n\nNot so for single women: When they thought their peers (and presumably potential mates) would see the answers, they said they wanted a job with fewer hours per week and a smaller salary. They also said they wanted less of a leadership role and had smaller professional ambitions than women who were able to answer privately. These women most likely feared that ambition, willingness to work hard and the desire to earn a lot would make them less appealing as mates, if these preferences were openly expressed.\n\nWhat should we make of all of these findings? My initial reaction was dismay at the widespread existence of such sexism among other men. With time, though, I realized my mistake: I was focusing on other men when I am surely just as complicit. If the average man is sexist in these ways, the odds are that I am, too.\n\nIn day-to-day life, I may not realize that I\u2019m contributing to these problems, but neither, probably, do other men. So fixing these problems is my responsibility \u2014 and the responsibility of other men, too. We can help through introspection, by asking questions of those closest to us and by listening to the painful answers.\n\nOld habits die hard, but these are surely worth killing.\n\nTax policy can be hard to change in Washington.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Beginning at age 30, testosterone levels drop, on average, about 1 percent a year. About 5 percent of men between the ages of 50 and 59 have low levels of testosterone along with symptoms like loss of libido and sluggishness, according to a few small studies.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approves testosterone gels and shots only for men with levels under 300, including those who have diseases that cause hormone levels to plummet, such as a pituitary tumor or injury to the testicles. Those men are truly lacking the hormone, so returning the levels to normal can help restore sex drive and energy. Insurance companies typically require two morning testosterone readings of less than 300 nanograms per deciliter plus symptoms of low testosterone before they reimburse for supplements.\n\nIn March, The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism published the Endocrine Society\u2019s latest guidelines, which concur with the F.D.A. The group stated that testosterone therapy should only be given for men who have proven low levels of testosterone and avoided in men who have had a stroke or heart attack within the last six months or who are at high risk for prostate cancer.\n\nBut testosterone numbers are far from an exact science.\n\nKeith Hall, a 48-year-old petrochemical operator from Baytown, Tex., sought out a men\u2019s health doctor at Baylor College of Medicine because he was tired and lacked libido. His initial testosterone level was below normal, around 202. The urologist he ended up seeing, Dr. Alexander Pastuszak, offered him testosterone shots that raised his levels into the normal range and made him feel better.\n\nEdward Blake, a 53-year-old forklift driver from Houston, sought out the same doctor for the same reasons. His testosterone measured 450, within the normal range. \u201cI was feeling kind of tired and stuff, but after the third shot, I\u2019m lifting things with no problem,\u201d said Mr. Blake. He said in addition to feeling stronger, his sex drive improved.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

But is that the power of suggestion or the power of the hormone?\n\n\u201cThe reality is we don\u2019t have the answer,\u201d said Dr. Pastuszak, noting that there\u2019s a big gray area. \u201cI have to take their word that they feel better on it, whether that\u2019s real or whether it\u2019s placebo.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters, testosterone levels fluctuate, peaking around 8 a.m. and diminishing throughout the day. Levels tend to be lowest around 8 in the evening, then climb during the night. The peaks and valleys are larger for men 40 and younger compared to men in their 70s. (For a 40-year-old, a morning testosterone reading may be 200 points higher than in the evening, versus a 50-point difference for a 70-year-old.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd all sorts of things can nudge levels in either direction.\n\nResistance training increases levels, as does a high-intensity workout. Even watching your favorite sports team win can nudge numbers up, as a 1998 study that measured testosterone among basketball fans before and after a game found. (Testosterone levels declined among those rooting for the losers.) Still, any gains from such activities tend to be fleeting; levels generally return to the individual\u2019s normal within a half-hour or so.\n\nAnd just as there are things men can do to boost levels, there are activities that lower testosterone scores. Endurance exercises, such as marathon training or cycling long distances, can lower levels, as can stress. Dr. Bhasin said that the kind of training endured by special armed forces \u2014 tough exercise, lack of sleep and food \u2014 can cause testosterone to drop to the levels of men who have been castrated \u2014 lower than 50.\n\nObesity causes testosterone levels to plummet \u2014 while losing 10 percent of body fat can increase levels by 100 points. Even taking care of the kids for several hours can cause levels to drop, a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported. Flu and other viral illnesses can also cause levels to drop, so you should hold off testing until you\u2019re fully recovered.\n\nAs for alcohol, a few beers won\u2019t make a difference in the short term. But the liver damage by chronic alcohol abuse thwarts the production of testosterone.\n\nFurther complicating matters, every testosterone-making lab has its own methods of calculating testosterone, so a man may register 300 with one company\u2019s machine but 400 with another. To find a reputable lab, patients can refer to a website from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that lists accredited laboratories.\n\nSo what about the man who reaches a top reading of 1,000?\n\nJust learning about the score might make him feel so good it boosts his confidence and libido.

Among these were the Arrow Store, Morvilles, Diamonds, Irving\u2019s and Jacob Reed\u2019s Sons. Today, professionals no longer need be dapper, and only one store from that period remains in business: Boyds. Like the Liberty Bell and the stone Rocky Steps, Boyds is a local landmark, and one equally impervious to the shifting seasons.\n\nFor 80 years, the family-owned business has outfitted lawyers, bankers, doctors, politicians and famous athletes, with all-American brands like Hickey-Freeman, groovy European labels like Pierre Cardin and Tiger of Sweden and lately high-end Italian suiting and sportswear from Brioni, Isaia and Brunello Cucinelli.\n\nWhen the former basketball star Julius Erving flew into the city for a visit from the Bahamas during the January cold snap and found himself in need of warmer clothes, he called Boyds, as he has since back when he was Dr. J., slamming dunks for the 76ers.\n\n\u201cBoyds was the place to shop,\u201d said Mr. Erving, who all these years later still deals with the same salesman, Bill Bolling. \u201cThey always had somebody who would make sure everything was just so: sleeve length, cuff length.

Chinese mythology to the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. Most often she is a princess of the depths, with alabaster skin, a giant fin in place of legs and breasts covered by a mess of long, tangled hair. Her appeal, though, is not merely aesthetic. For centuries, men have braved the open waters, knowing full well they may never make it home, and the mermaid has served as either a kind of ballast in times of trouble, saving sailors from floods and deadly storms, or a figure of seduction, luring them to their deaths at the bottom of the ocean. Her passivity, as well as her beguiling exoticness, is an escape from whatever drudgery awaits these men back on land \u2014 the mermaid is a fantasy, yes, but also a way to explain the unexplainable in nature. The admiral on one of Christopher Columbus\u2019s expeditions once mistook a manatee, its silky gray curves moving gently through the Caribbean waters, for one.\n\nLately, though, it\u2019s the mermaid\u2019s male counterparts who\u2019ve surfaced as objects of desire. In Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d Sally Hawkins plays a mute woman named Elisa who works as a cleaning lady at a government laboratory. She falls for a mysterious amphibian captured at sea \u2014 he\u2019s less merman, more creature of the lagoon, complete with webbed fingers and gills, but he enchants her nonetheless, gently swaying in his tank to the jazz music Elisa plays for him. The film echoes Rachel Ingalls\u2019s recently reissued 1982 novel \u201cMrs. Caliban,\u201d in which a lonely California housewife falls for a sexy frog man (\u201c \u2026 as for the rest of the body, he was exactly like a man \u2014 a well-built large man \u2014 except that he was a dark spotted green-brown in color and had no hair\u201d). Finally, Melissa Broder\u2019s racy debut novel, \u201cThe Pisces\u201d (out this May), tells of a young woman who, strolling Venice Beach one night, meets a handsome merman named Theo. \u201cThe tail starts below all that,\u201d he reassures her. Their love, as in all of these stories, is doomed, but it is passionate and refreshingly free of judgment.\n\nAre real men these days so unwanted? In these interspecies romances, women aren\u2019t looking to be saved by convention (these frogs don\u2019t turn into princes when kissed). Their love also demonstrates a kind of compassion that feels profoundly absent right now. In light of #MeToo, such narratives of feminist reclamation force us to ask ourselves: Who is actually dangerous, and what is truly safe?

(Breakingviews)\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree?\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads, it\u2019s almost as if the economy\u2019s parents are fighting. The kids, stock investors and borrowers in this analogy, just don\u2019t know who to side with.\n\nThis dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and, in turn, set off panicked selling in the stock market.\n\nNow, as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times, differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more.\n\nThere is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets. But that didn\u2019t stop us having a go.\n\nOne approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note with Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts for the central bank\u2019s target rate. Several times a year, the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future. In this exercise, we compared the 10-year\u2019s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year.\n\nIn December of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the 10-year\u2019s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in December last year, the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly. The yield was only 0.26 of a percentage point above the forecast.\n\nOne interpretation of this narrowing: The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength. And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state, it did so sharply. The 10-year yield is now 2.88 percent, up from 2.39 percent before the meeting in Dec. 2017.\n\nWith that increase, there was a 0.77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Monday.\n\nBut if the 10-year yield moved up to reestablish a 1-percentage point difference, it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark.\n\nThe problem, of course, with using Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years.\n\nTo get a much longer perspective, we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets, which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10-year\u2019s yield.\n\nSecond Guessing the Fed The difference between the 10-year Treasury note yield and the effective federal funds rate, compared with the median difference since the early 1960s, in percentage points. pct. pts. 4 3 2 1 0 -1 Median Difference 1990 2000 2010 pct. pts. 4 3 2 1 0 -1 Median Difference 1990 2000 2010\n\nOn Monday, that spread was 1.46 percentage points. How does that compare? It\u2019s tighter than the median for the past eight years, 1.95 percentage points. The 10-year yield would have moved a lot higher to take the spread back there.\n\nBut there is a less alarming viewpoint. The current 1.46 percentage point spread is only slightly higher than the median 1.24 percentage points for the 50-plus years we studied.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd, perhaps most reassuringly, 1.46 percentage points is very close to the 1.67 percentage point median for June 2003 till the end of 2006, a period in which the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nCigna shows that health care deal mania is alive and well\n\nCigna finally got a big deal done by buying Express Scripts, one of the U.S.\u2019s largest drug benefits managers, for $69 billion, including debt.\n\nThe bigger point: as always, health care companies want to get bigger and gain negotiating leverage, while branching out into different businesses.\n\nThe details: The insurer agreed to pay $48.75 a share in cash and 0.2434 of a newly issued share for each Express Scripts share.

Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.\n\nTheranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nInvestors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.\n\nTheranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.\n\nWhile Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.\n\nMs. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.\n\nHolmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.\n\nHolmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.\n\nMs. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.\n\nHolmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014. These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors. Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nSpotting a fraud\n\nThere is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn\u2019t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction.\n\nMs. Holmes and the company settled the case, although the former president, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, is fighting the charges. She will pay a $500,000 penalty, return her shares in Theranos, and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.\n\nWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, however, apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact. Thus, when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists, the false claims about the viability of its blood-testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud.\n\nFor Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\n\n\u2014 Peter J.

Mr. Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday.\n\n\n\nReaction\n\nMark Hamrick, Bankrate.com\u2019s senior economic analyst:\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWas Bear a bad deal for JPMorgan?\n\nTen year\u2019s ago almost to the day, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns, a troubled investment bank, for what looked like a steal. But Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s C.E.O., has since said he wouldn\u2019t do a deal like it again, citing the high legal costs that came later.\n\nBut was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.\n\nWhat caused the legal costs and how big were they? The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage-backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards. How big were those costs? In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan\u2019s nearly $19 billion in mortgage-related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that 35 percent of that $19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns\u2019 mortgages. The cost to JPMorgan then would be around $6.7 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.\n\nJPMorgan paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, far below the $11.8 billion of shareholders\u2019 equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007. This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the $6 billion of merger-related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrue, JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns\u2019 riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal, when market conditions got even worse. But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized. After 2008, \u201cprincipal transactions\u201d at JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank, the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns\u2019 assets, produced over $8 billion of annual revenue, far more than the $4.4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal. The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some $30 billion of Bear Stearns\u2019 assets. According to Kate Kelly\u2019s book on Bear Stearns\u2019 final days, JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed. JPMorgan did provide a $1.2 billion loan to the Fed\u2019s entity, in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets. But in the end, that loan generated a $665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012.\n\nThe Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives. JPMorgan, for instance, got Bear Stearns\u2019 leading prime brokerage unit, a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds. That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least $1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings, the bank\u2019s executives said at the time.\n\nAnd, of course, JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns\u2019 trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan. At the time of the deal, the building, at 383 Madison Ave., had an estimated value of $1.2 billion. According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market, the building is now worth at least $1.8 billion.\n\n-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "The John Grisham-worthy twist comes from the investigation of three rapes 1,300 miles away, in two suburbs and a city outside of Denver. The Police Departments in the three places in Colorado (Aurora, Golden and Westminster) pooled their clues and figured out they were probably looking for the same attacker. They found him \u2014 the break in the case came from a single detail about the spotting of a white truck. On the rapist\u2019s computer, they found the photos he took of Marie. Years later, here was incontrovertible proof that she had told the truth.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe parallel tales allow Miller and Armstrong to juxtapose the damage of a botched rape investigation and the triumph of careful and skilled police work. Though stranger rape isn\u2019t the norm for sexual assault, or the focus of the sexual misconduct fueling the #MeToo moment in which this book appears, it offers broadly relevant lessons. One of the valiant detectives in Colorado (this is a book that turns law enforcement characters into heroes) explains that her rule isn\u2019t simply \u201cbelieve your victim\u201d; it\u2019s \u201clisten and verify,\u201d which gives her space to refute or corroborate the account, depending on where the evidence takes her. Another detective in Aurora explains how he learned that there is no \u201cright way\u201d for a survivor to respond to an assault. The 65-year-old victim he interviewed was matter-of-fact rather than emotional, much like Marie, but he didn\u2019t discount her credibility, and that withholding of judgment helped catch the serial attacker.\n\nMiller and Armstrong point out a pattern in Lynnwood. The police there wrote off as unfounded 21 percent of the rape reports they received during the five years in which the book unfolds. That\u2019s five times the national average. An external reviewer said that if the two police officers who interrogated Marie hadn\u2019t documented their own \u201cbullying and coercive\u201d behavior, he \u201cwould have been skeptical\u201d that such conduct actually happened. Though Miller and Armstrong don\u2019t say so, it\u2019s one more telling illustration of who does or doesn\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the two officers who blew Marie\u2019s case comes across as a secondary villain. Jerry Rittgarn, who threatened Marie with jail if she failed a lie-detector test, left Lynnwood to work as a private investigator. He told Miller and Armstrong he would talk to them only if they paid him, while complaining about \u201cvictims who lie\u201d and \u201ca biased story.\u201d The other officer, however, is introspective enough to be the book\u2019s most complex figure. Sgt. Jeffrey Mason questioned whether he was qualified to do his job \u2014 after more than 20 years as a cop \u2014 when he learned he\u2019d helped prosecute a vulnerable rape victim. When Marie asked for an apology, he showed up and said he was sorry; she found him sincere. Peggy disappointed Marie at first with her muted response but then expressed her intense regret and worked to repair their relationship.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn Lynnwood, the Police Department didn\u2019t fire or discipline anyone, but it did try to learn from its mistakes, Miller and Armstrong reassuringly report. Lynnwood added training on the effect of trauma, which can cause rape victims\u2019 memories to fragment, and adopted well-respected guidelines, which train police officers not to doubt a victim because he or she doesn\u2019t behave as expected and \u2014 crucially \u2014 not to accuse one of lying without definite proof.\n\nMiller and Armstrong tell their story plainly, expertly and well. It\u2019s gripping and needs no dressing up. More confusing accounts of sexual assault, in which consent is disputed with anguish in a toxic swirl of partying and hook-up culture, have become part of the landscape, especially on college campuses. These contested stories divide our sympathies and spur angry debates. The doubt that Marie confronted, on the other hand, leaves no trail of did he or didn\u2019t he. In its moral clarity, it\u2019s possible to find Miller and Armstrong\u2019s project comforting. There is a bad guy. His name is Marc O\u2019Leary. He\u2019s now in prison for life. (Actually, 327\u00bd years, so several lives.)\n\nMiller and Armstrong interviewed O\u2019Leary in prison but it seems, understandably, as if it was hard for them to get into his head. In recreated flashbacks that rely on phrases like \u201cthe beast wouldn\u2019t rest\u201d and \u201cthe monster would gather strength,\u201d the authors show him stalking women and breaking into their homes by night. All the while, O\u2019Leary was secretly operating a group of specialized porn sites. He was also playing guitar with his friends and planning to have a baby with his wife. \u201cIt sounds clich\u00e9, I guess, but it\u2019s really kind of an actual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in real life,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at his own trial. That plus some idea about the duality of man, which he got from reading Carl Jung, are about as deep as it gets.\n\nMiller and Armstrong teamed up for the project that became this book when they discovered they were working on it separately. Miller was reporting on the Colorado angle for ProPublica, an investigative news organization, and Armstrong was chasing Marie\u2019s story for the Marshall Project, a group that focuses on criminal justice journalism. They won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for an article that led to this book (a Netflix series is also in the works).\n\nTwo years ago, \u201cThis American Life\u201d ran an episode (narrated by Armstrong and the producer Robyn Semien) that can serve as a nice companion to the book by giving us Marie\u2019s voice on tape. At 25, she is raw but also resilient. \u201cIt broke me,\u201d she said of the doubt she was raped and its repercussions. But when the police told her O\u2019Leary had been identified as her assailant, and that her criminal record would be expunged, she got her driver\u2019s license and then a job as a truck driver. She is now married and has two children. Marie is a testament to the harm of poor police work that derails a rape investigation. But she\u2019s also a person living her life. That\u2019s the larger lesson of a nonfiction narrative like this one: It continues, beyond a book\u2019s pages.", "title": "The Lesson Here Is Listen to the Victim", "authors": ["Emily Bazelon", "T.

And in that time, \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d has become a dorm-room staple, inspired an annual festival and spawned a pseudo-religion called Dudeism. A clever riff on the gumshoe fiction of Raymond Chandler, \u201cLebowski\u201d made its widespread theatrical debut 20 years ago, and although the academy has certainly favored the Coens\u2019 more serious films, nothing has compared in terms of cultural impact.\n\nWhile wandering the offices of the other Jeffrey Lebowski, the Dude notices a plaque dedicated to a children\u2019s charity called the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers; so, too, are the annals of cinema full of Little Lebowskis \u2014 movies that seem to take cues from the philosophy and style of the Coens brothers\u2019 film. Much of \u201cLebowski\u201d concerns the Dude\u2019s reproductive fertility, and true to form, he has cinematic children scattered all over.

A live-and-let-live hippie spirit links the Coens\u2019 Southern California of the \u201990s with Anderson\u2019s version of the \u201970s: As the spacey investigator Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) untangles a vast conspiracy, he encounters many like-minded burnouts who want nothing more than to kick back, smoke some dope and wax rhapsodical.

Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe portray two mismatched investigators who clear a brutal swath through the adult film industry of 1970s Los Angeles in pursuit of a missing teenage girl \u2014 a milieu teeming with the type of scheming lowlifes who make patsies out of the Dude and Walter a few decades later. The Dude stumbles into this same surreal Hollywood underbelly and immediately wants to find an A.T.M. Black gleefully embraces it as well, with his aesthetic of pool parties, hillside mansions and chintzy baroque decadence. But he takes it a few shades darker.\n\n0\n\nIf You Like Stoner Humor\n\nSeth Rogen, left, and James Franco in \u201cPineapple Express.\u201d Dale Robinette/Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018Pineapple Express\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBoth the Dude and Dale (Seth Rogen), the unmotivated process server stumbling his way through this brilliantly dim-witted farce from David Gordon Green, share a predilection for a certain kind of all-natural relaxation. But cannabis proves a fickle mistress for both men, leaving them slow on the uptake when they\u2019re thrust into high-pressure situations. In Dale\u2019s case, he endures a night-long freakout after getting an eyeful of a Mob murder, sending him and his volatile dealer, Saul (James Franco), on a mad scramble for their lives. Both films are keyed into a haziness of form that reflects its characters\u2019 favorite vice, with one scene melting into the next. Viewers may end up at some new juncture with little understanding of how they arrived \u2014 but happy to be there.\n\nIf You Want Another Coen-Bridges Collaboration\n\nHailee Steinfeld, left, and Jeff Bridges in \u201cTrue Grit.\u201d Lorey Sebastian/Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018True Grit\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAfter creating the Dude, Jeff Bridges and the Coen brothers went their separate ways until 2010, when they reinterpreted the esteemed cowboy novel from Charles Portis (and not, they\u2019ll have you know, the 1969 film starring John Wayne). There\u2019s a knowing Dude-ness about Bridges\u2019s rendition of the loutish, eyepatch-wearing lawman Rooster Cogburn. He agrees to escort young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) on her search for her father\u2019s killer, but he\u2019d rather spend his days puffing on his corncob pipe and slugging moonshine \u2014 the Old West version of the layabout individualism in \u201cLebowski.\u201d Ultimately, the Dude and Cogburn share a notion of duty, whether that means bringing a murderer to the gallows or ensuring that two rug-ruining thugs get their just deserts.\n\nIf You Liked the Slant on Film Noir\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt in \u201cBrick.\u201d Steve Yedlin/Focus Features\n\n\u2018Brick\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Starz, Amazon, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Coen brothers transplanted stock elements of film noir \u2014 the femme fatale, the double-cross, the red herring, the sweeping conspiracy \u2014 from the dank alleyways of the \u201940s to palm trees and strip malls of the \u201990s for \u201cLebowski.\u201d Rian Johnson\u2019s breakout debut, \u201cBrick,\u201d moves the same conventions into high school, where a bookish student named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to find his missing ex-girlfriend. Johnson\u2019s script has fun with the tough-guy language of Dashiell Hammett\u2019s private eyes, updating it to resemble more closely teen slang. The actors are young, but the perilous stakes and bruised cynicism are decidedly grown-up; the film chews Brendan up and spits him out, giving a hard-boiled edge to the usual coming-of-age narrative.\n\nIf You Want Another Bumbling Crime Yarn\n\nElijah Wood and Melanie Lynskey in \u201cI Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore.\u201d Allyson Riggs/Netflix\n\n\u2018I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIncompetence fuels the comic engine that makes \u2018Lebowski\u2019 so entertaining; it wouldn\u2019t be as fun if the Dude had even the slightest clue how to handle a hostage negotiation. Likewise, the assistant nurse in this film (Melanie Lynskey) doesn\u2019t let her lack of experience stop her from taking the law into her own hands after her apartment gets ransacked. Undaunted, she teams up with her unstable, nunchuck-wielding neighbor (Elijah Wood) and promptly gets in way over her head with a cadre of local criminals who have no intention of taking it easy on her. As in \u201cLebowski,\u201d the collision of poorly considered amateur heroics and the violent realities of criminal life makes for a potent combination of humor and brutality.\n\nIf You\u2019re Searching for the Dude\u2019s Closest Descendant\n\nAdam Driver in \u201cPaterson.\u201d Mary Cybulsky/Amazon Studios \u2014 Bleecker Street\n\n\u2018Paterson\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: iTunes, Vudu\n\n\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Dude is a humble creature of habit \u2014 most days he drinks the same cocktail, goes to the same bowling alley, wears the same sweater-robe. Paterson, the protagonist of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cPaterson,\u201d adheres to a similarly rigid routine: Each day, he drives his bus route through Paterson, N.J., dotes on his wife (Golshifteh Farahani), feeds their dog and treats himself to a single beer. Adam Driver took more than a few strands of the Dude\u2019s DNA when creating this soulful blue-collar poet, imbuing him with a quiet, Zen-like wisdom and a contentment with his lot in life. Both films test the happy stasis these kindred spirits enjoy, breaking their routines and watching as they adapt to new responsibilities. (Paterson has a slightly easier time; his predicaments don\u2019t involve German nihilists.)\n\nIf You Like the Layered Weirdness\n\nJohn Malkovich and Catherine Keener in \u201cBeing John Malkovich.\u201d Universal Studios\n\n\u2018Being John Malkovich\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne reason the \u201cLebowski\u201d fan base is so vast and intense is the Coens\u2019 symbol-laden approach. It\u2019s good sport obsessing over the Dude\u2019s journey as a revision of the Western, or as a thinly veiled commentary on American foreign policy, or as a surrealist parable about masculine anxiety. This feature debut from director Spike Jonze and its ingenious premise \u2014 What if crawling into a mysterious portal put you inside the actor John Malkovich\u2019s head for 15 minutes? \u2014 also provides fertile ground for multiple readings. Equal parts rom-com, corporate thriller and heady psychological experiment, the dense script, written by Charlie Kaufman (\u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d), draws from Freud and Jung, transgender theory and numerology, arcana and myth.\n\nIf You Loved the Unlikely Criminals\n\nRiley Keough in \u201cLogan Lucky.\u201d Claudette Barius/Fingerprint Releasing\n\n\u2018Logan Lucky\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWalter has experience in war, but he\u2019s still hilariously ill-equipped for an operation as delicate as a ransom handoff. The characters in this heist film from Steven Soderbergh, set in North Carolina, are the inverse: outwardly unskilled hayseeds who execute a complicated theft with finesse. A motley crew of rural types (a strong ensemble including Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough and Daniel Craig) pool their wits to rip off the Charlotte Motor Speedway during the year\u2019s biggest Nascar race, each character contributing special skills or knowledge. Soderbergh mines no shortage of levity from the Southern eccentricities of the characters \u2014 the feral twins Fish and Sam could have stumbled in from a Coens film \u2014 but their talents always command a measure of respect.\n\nIf You\u2019re Into Dark Humor\n\nColin Farrell, left, and Brendan Gleeson in \u201dIn Bruges.\u201d Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features\n\n\u2018In Bruges\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Starz, Amazon, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cLebowski\u201d isn\u2019t shy about gallows humor: a gust of wind blows a cremated friend\u2019s remains into the Dude\u2019s face; a severed toe disrupts coffee at a \u201cfamily restaurant.\u201d This rip-roaring crime comedy from Martin McDonagh extends that impulse to the extreme, using gunshots the way other films use jokes. An Irish hit man and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) cool their heels in Belgium after a killing goes slightly awry, although trouble soon finds them, along with a body count of Shakespearean proportions.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "To reverse the trend, Mr. Lighthizer is trying to rewrite global trade rules in America\u2019s favor. He has found his trade policy soul mate in Mr. Trump, who has elevated Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s role and given him his blessing to embark on an unapologetic mission to take away advantages from countries and systems that both men believe have cheated the United States.\n\nThat includes preparing a major trade action against China, which Mr. Lighthizer has been working on for months and will be aimed at curbing intellectual property theft. It includes efforts to overhaul the World Trade Organization, which trading partners describe as a plan to strip away that organization\u2019s power and clout. But, mostly, it includes sprawling and contentious negotiations with South Korea over the future of its trade deal with the United States and, especially, with Canada and Mexico over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nMr. Trump has dangled the potential for the two trading partners to be permanently exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, as long as they agree to a Nafta deal that satisfies the United States\u2019 demands. What that means, exactly, remains to be seen. The three countries have already been through seven rounds of negotiations over revising the 1994 pact, with little progress to show for it and fairly intractable views on several major provisions.\n\nMr. Lighthizer had a mixed view of the tariffs, supporting the plan during meetings in the Oval Office, but privately expressing concerns that broad measures could target allies rather than the real culprit, China, according to people familiar with his views who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nLike his boss, Mr. Lighthizer views China as the biggest offender in the global trading system, accusing the country of using state subsidies to build more factories than it needs and calling China\u2019s trade practices an \u201cunprecedented\u201d threat to the world trading system. He is spearheading an initiative to combat China\u2019s alleged theft of American trade secrets, an effort that may include tariffs on Chinese products and restrictions on Chinese investment flowing into the United States.\n\nAt times, Mr. Trump seems to have taken his China-bashing language straight from Mr. Lighthizer, including in late February when the president blamed the World Trade Organization for China\u2019s rise.\n\nIt is that combination of nationalist instincts and keen understanding of trade law that has aided Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s rise in the White House. Mr. Trump originally envisioned Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, as his trade czar and the person to coordinate trade policy across the government. But Mr. Ross drew the ire of the president as he failed to negotiate a sufficiently tough deal with the Chinese and faced allegations that he had inflated his wealth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lighthizer has emerged as the indispensable adviser, espousing the type of get-tough views on China and other countries that were red meat to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of his abilities, Lighthizer\u2019s profile is rising,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cHis own description might be that he\u2019s very keen on seeing that the rights of U.S. firms are not trampled on, and that international competition is fair and balanced. To my way of thinking, that adds up to a polite way of saying \u2018protectionist.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was Mr. Lighthizer who was most influential in counseling the president to reject a deal Mr. Ross negotiated with the Chinese in July, according to people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Lighthizer persuaded the president that when the United States had engaged in talks with China in the past, China had failed to keep its end of the bargain.\n\nThat advice also shaped the president\u2019s trip to Asia in November. At a meeting in the Oval Office just before the trip began, Mr. Lighthizer argued against presenting the Chinese with a list of demands for access to the Chinese market, people briefed on the matter said.\n\nHe recited all the market-access negotiations between China and the United States \u2014 going back to China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 \u2014 to make the point that none of them had prevented the trade deficit between the countries from ballooning.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s 11-day trip to Asia, Mr. Lighthizer was never far from his side. With Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the chief economic adviser who said on Tuesday he would resign over the planned tariffs, both staying back in Washington to lobby Congress for tax cuts, Mr. Lighthizer was the most influential economic official on the trip, and he had extended access to the president.\n\nStill, Mr. Lighthizer has not shied away from using the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs in his Nafta negotiations. Speaking in Mexico City on Monday at the conclusion of the latest round, Mr. Lighthizer described the potential for an exclusion as a carrot, \u201can incentive to get a deal.\u201d To his counterparts, it was just the latest stick the Trump administration has used to bully them into acceding to United States demands.\n\nWith Nafta, Mr. Lighthizer has pursued significant reforms aimed at retracting global supply chains back into the United States, and removing what he describes as incentives for corporations to take their investments abroad. His approach has put him at odds with business groups, Republican lawmakers and foreign ministers. But Mr. Lighthizer seems emboldened, not cowed, by the conflict. He has criticized foreign counterparts and dismissed the requests of Republican lawmakers who want the United States to avoid sinking trade deals that have been good for companies in their states.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents major American exporters, said Mr. Lighthizer shared \u201ca certain common theme\u201d with many of the hard-line trade advisers surrounding Mr. Trump: that \u201cthe United States has lost its greatness because it\u2019s lost many of its basic industries.\u201d\n\nMr. Yerxa added that the modern economy contradicted that argument. \u201cLook at the six or seven biggest companies in America: Most of those are bigger than the steel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the ones that are globally oriented, export-oriented. I don\u2019t think this crowd of people understand these industries.\u201d\n\nMr. Lighthizer set the stage for a tough negotiation in August, when he said his criticisms of Nafta echoed those of the president, who was \u201cnot interested in a mere tweaking\u201d of the agreement. \u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.\n\nHe has also been unsparing in his criticism of American companies that benefit from Nafta, likening the pact to \u201csugar\u201d that lures businesses to invest in Canada and Mexico, rather than the United States. He describes his mission as winning broader support from American businesses and workers, rather than the narrow pro-trade lobby that he says currently benefits from the pact.\n\n\u201cIf you can get some labor unions on board, Democrats on board, mainstream Republicans on board, I think you can get big numbers,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said in Montreal in January. \u201cIf you do, that\u2019s going to change the way all of us look at these kind of deals.\u201d\n\nBut to get there, he has said that the companies that currently benefit from the pact may have to surrender some of their advantages.\n\nThat view has been deeply unpopular with free-trade Republicans in Congress, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber, which usually operates in lock step with a Republican White House, argues that the drastic changes Mr. Lighthizer has proposed \u2014 like tightening the rules for manufacturing cars in North America, or scrapping a process for settling investment disputes that bypasses American courts \u2014 could destabilize American industry and the economy.\n\nLast year, the chamber began deriding those ideas as \u201cpoison pills\u201d for their potential to kill Nafta. A spokeswoman for Mr. Lighthizer fired back by saying the Trump administration always knew that it would be controversial to drain the swamp.\n\nMr. Lighthizer has taken a similarly tough line with Republican lawmakers. On a visit to Capitol Hill in October to meet with House Republicans about Nafta, lawmakers expressed concerns over controversial provisions like a five-year sunset clause that would cause the deal to automatically expire unless it was renewed, and a requirement that all automobiles sold under Nafta have a certain amount of American-made content.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen lawmakers cautioned Mr. Lighthizer that a Nafta deal with those provisions was unlikely to get enough votes in Congress, he responded that he had an \u201caudience of one\u201d to please, a reference to Mr. Trump.\n\n", "title": "The Little-Known Trade Adviser Who Wields Enormous Power in Washington", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

Nipped waists have long represented femininity incarnate \u2014 think of Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s famously petite Civil War-era midriff (17 inches), or the elaborate stays and busks worn by Elizabeth I, despite her claim that she had the stomach of a king.

A lot of things manage to do that nowadays, true, but the male waist trend only seems like another step toward neutered androgyny. This is not a look that erases sex, but rather emphasizes it. A Barbie doll\u2019s waist comes to a near V; so does Action Man\u2019s, an ideal propagated in Ancient Greece and revived in the 19th century (when men wore their own corsets). And so the silhouette hints at a different kind of gender fluidity altogether, one based on the notion that the shapes defining the hyper-masculine and the \u00fcber-feminine are remarkably similar. The British designer Antony Price knew as much when, in the mid-\u201970s, he dressed both Bryan Ferry and his girlfriend Jerry Hall in broad-shouldered and slinky-hipped ensembles that would come to symbolize glam rock itself. Grace Wales Bonner and Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen understand it now \u2014 both use age-old tailoring techniques to carve out severe, body-centric shapes for men and women alike.\n\nPerhaps the pulled-in midsection is a reflection of international belt-tightening, as more and more nations adopt grim austerity measures.

Surrounded by his family, he looked happy and relaxed, so different from when I\u2019d seen him in the clinic. He was wearing a vest to hold his batteries, and I could see part of the device bulging under his white T-shirt, but only if I looked closely.\n\nI settled into the seat he offered me and introduced myself to his sisters while he ducked into the kitchen to pull a steaming plate of baked potatoes, chives and sour cream out of the oven. He had found the recipe on Facebook, he explained. He was eager for us to try it.\n\nAs the plate cooled, he showed me around, down the narrow hallway to the bedroom, where he connected himself to a wall socket each night so his batteries could recharge. Limited to the electric cord\u2019s 20-foot radius, he was \u201clike a dog on a leash,\u201d until the morning. Luckily, his house was small enough that he could make it from the bedroom to the kitchen even when he was plugged in. The bathroom was even closer.\n\nOne time, he woke up at 2 a.m. to a jarring noise. Thinking there might be something wrong with his VAD, he changed his connection from the wall unit to a set of batteries. The sound continued. Frustrated, he fiddled around with the machine, doing things he definitely wasn\u2019t supposed to do, and still it wouldn\u2019t stop. He dragged himself out of bed to call his VAD team.\n\nIt was only when he saw the receiver hanging off the hook that Mr. Chauvin realized the source of the noise \u2014 it had been the phone all along. As he told the story, his assembled family members laughed appreciatively, though they\u2019d heard it before. I found myself laughing too, briefly forgetting that he was talking about life or death, about a sound that could have meant he was moments away from collapse.\n\nThe laughter quieted and there was a break in our conversation. In the moment of stillness, I found that I was curious about Mr. Chauvin\u2019s pulse. I asked him if I could feel for it and, seemingly amused, he offered his hand. I placed my fingers on his wrist, where I am used to feeling the rhythmic pulsations of the radial artery. But because the device moved blood through his vessels at a continuous, stable rate of flow rather than the pumping of a normal heart, melding human and machine, I found that I couldn\u2019t feel a thing.\n\nBy the time we met, it had been more than five years since Mr. Chauvin\u2019s heart had started to fail and over a year since he\u2019d been told he wouldn\u2019t get a transplant. So I asked him what it had been like to learn that he would spend the rest of his life with this machine, that the equipment would be with him until he died. That if he were to follow his doctors\u2019 instructions to the letter, he would never be able to shower the way he liked or take his boat out on the lake. I wondered if he regretted his decision, if he had been angry.\n\nBut Mr. Chauvin surprised me. He had a hole in his stomach and a vest to carry his batteries and a cord that tethered him at night and the ever-present threat of a stroke or a bleed or a problem with the machine. But without the uncertainty of a transplant that might or might not come, he had found that he was now free to focus on enjoying his life for what it was.

The effort comes as Mr. Trump is trying to tackle another intractable problem, North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, accepting an invitation last week to meet the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, sometime in the next three months for negotiations.\n\nTo lay the groundwork in the Middle East, the White House is convening a conference on Tuesday to discuss ways to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the Palestinian Authority said on Saturday that it would boycott the meeting.\n\nWhile officials declined to discuss the plan\u2019s content, in keeping with the veil of secrecy they have kept over it since Mr. Trump took office, they said it would not have a set of guiding principles, like the Arab Peace Initiative, first endorsed by the Arab League in 2002, which sketched out the broad contours of an accord and left the details for the two sides to fill in.\n\nFor example, the plan will not call for a two-state solution as one of its goals, though it will prescribe pathways for the creation of two states. Nor will it call for a \u201cfair and just solution\u201d for Palestinian refugees, though it will offer steps to deal with the issue of refugees.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides described a multipage document, with annexes, that proposes solutions to all the key disputes: borders, security, refugees and the status of Jerusalem. They predicted that the Israelis and the Palestinians would each find things in the plan to embrace and oppose.\n\nIn delving into the fine details, the White House is turning the traditional formula for peacemaking on its head. Previous presidents, from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, avoided going beyond broad strokes for fear that it would give both sides more to object to. But officials said that was no longer sufficient.\n\nThe aides who wrote the plan \u2014 Jared Kushner, Jason D. Greenblatt and David M. Friedman \u2014 had no experience in diplomacy when they took up their jobs. Mr. Kushner is Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser; Mr. Greenblatt was the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization; and Mr. Friedman is a bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNobody outside the administration has seen the document, officials said, though Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Friedman met for several hours with Mr. Netanyahu at Blair House, near the White House, last Sunday, the day before he met with Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

American officials said their planning was not dictated by foreign leaders.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump still sounds committed. Welcoming the prime minister to the Oval Office, he insisted that he still had a \u201cvery good chance\u201d to broker an accord. \u201cThe Palestinians, I think, are wanting to come back to the table very badly,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is little evidence to support that. By recognizing Jerusalem, and speeding up plans to move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv, the United States has forfeited its role as a credible broker, the Palestinians say. They have put their energies into trying to enlist other countries to replace the Americans.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s repeated declarations that he has taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table\u201d further antagonized the Palestinians, seeming to dash their aspirations to make the holy city the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nDiplomats from Arab countries said the Jerusalem decision had made it politically untenable for them to press the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, to return to the table because of the outcry it would cause within their own publics.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kushner have invested a lot in developing relationships with Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But officials said the White House was not counting on its Arab friends to promote the president\u2019s peace initiative.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides have faced other setbacks. Mr. Kushner was recently stripped of his top-secret security clearance, raising questions about his status as a top adviser and even his longevity in the White House. Officials said it would not hamper his ability to negotiate but could limit his access to sensitive intelligence.\n\nThe Gaza conference, which will be led by Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, is designed to give momentum to efforts to stabilize the Palestinian territory, which has been racked by shortages of medicine and water after years of a blockade by Israel and Egypt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a recent op-ed article in The Washington Post, Mr. Greenblatt blamed Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, for the suffering there. But he said that Hamas\u2019s role did not \u201cabsolve us of the responsibility to try to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are beholden to find a path to a brighter future for the Palestinians of Gaza,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAlleviating the crisis in Gaza is important to the peace initiative, officials said, because any accord between Israel and the Palestinians that does not account for the territory is incomplete. For the White House, however, the more basic question is whether it can ever reconcile with the Palestinians.\n\nOn Saturday, a senior Palestinian official, Ahmed Majdalani, said the Palestinians had turned down the White House\u2019s invitation to attend the conference because America\u2019s goal was to \u201cliquidate the Palestinian national project.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides said they had not abandoned hope that the Palestinians would come back.

For example, nearly three-quarters of Obama-to-Trump voters supported repeal of the A.C.A., while less than half of Obama-to-nonvoters did. The extremely high degree of support for repeal of the A.C.A. among Obama-to-Trump voters clearly played a role in the 2016 election and in the negative reaction to Mr. Obama among this group of voters more broadly. However, considering how strongly Obama-to-Clinton voters in particular favor the A.C.A., it is hard to imagine how Democrats could incorporate anti-A.C.A. voters into future Democratic coalitions.\n\nObama-to-nonvoters are most similar to Obama-to-Clinton voters on the minimum wage, though the proposal draws strong majority support from Obama-to-Trump voters as well. Obama-to-Trump voters are most out of line with the Democratic coalition on issues relating to race and gender. They are less supportive of a path to citizenship, and a supermajority (64 percent) of Obama-to-Trump voters support deporting undocumented immigrants. At 72 percent, Obama-to-nonvoters are also far more in favor of abortion rights than Obama-to-Trump voters are (55 percent). Over all, Obama-to-nonvoters are quite close to the emerging Democratic consensus on issues of class, race, gender and the environment.\n\nDemocratic strategists should recognize that Obama-to-Trump voters do not represent the future of their party. Obama-to-Trump voters diverge from the Democratic Party on many core issues, and in any case they are not particularly loyal Democrats: Less than one third of Obama-to-Trump voters supported Democrats down-ballot in 2016, and only 37 percent identify as Democrats.\n\nIn stark contrast, Obama-to-nonvoters share the progressive policy priorities of Democrats, and they strongly identify with the Democratic Party. Four out of every five Obama-to-nonvoters identify as Democrats, and 83 percent reported they would have voted for a Democrat down-ballot. A similar share of Obama-to-nonvoters said that they would have voted for Mrs. Clinton had they turned out to vote. In short, while reclaiming some Obama-to-Trump voters would be a big help to Democratic prospects, re-energizing 2012 Obama voters who stayed home is a more plausible path for the party going forward.\n\nWhether Democrats can mobilize these voters is an open question, however. Significantly, only 43 percent of Obama-to-nonvoters reported being contacted by a candidate in 2016, compared with 66 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters. While analysts have focused on why many conservative voters switched to the Republican Party, a better question might be why a campaign that sought to energize young voters of color failed to do so. That\u2019s the question that will decide the future of American politics.\n\nGetting these voters to the polls on Election Day is the most important task for progressives.

They came from humble roots, made a fortune in the 1800s in meatpacking, then in middle age fell spellbound by art. Their tastes as collectors were eclectic, from still lifes and landscapes to love-and-death goth by Franz von Stuck of the Munich Secession movement. Portraits of the Fryes hang in the museum\u2019s big salon, where about half of their collection of more than 240 paintings resides, crammed one over another with no particular order or fussy art history lessons.\n\nAll you know is that one of the Fryes, or both, loved what you see before you, and that the museum\u2019s curators have tried to continue the legacy with rotating exhibitions of mostly modern art in the front rooms.

The exhibits consist mostly of written stories, with some videos and replica baseball artifacts.\n\nThe museum hosts regular special programming, including films and discussions. And it occupies the same building as the American Jazz Museum. Both can be seen in a single day. JOHN ELIGON\n\nFort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nThere\u2019s an art museum in Fort Lauderdale, up the road from Miami, that feels like a sanctuary. Maybe all museums ought to feel that way. But the NSU Art Museum Fort Lauderdale really does. The art is strong and the stark white Edward Larrabee Barnes building makes a visitor want to linger.\n\nThe galleries flow nicely into one another under a high, white ceiling like the flat underside of a cloud. One curving wall creates a panoramic display surface. At an archway mid-museum, you can stand between two galleries, see four or five walls and size up a dozen paintings and sculptures at once.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFrank liked the layout,\u201d said Bonnie Clearwater, the director of the museum. She was talking about Frank Stella, the American abstract expressionist painter and sculptor, whose work is all over the museum until July.\n\nThe museum is celebrating 60 years of Mr. Stella\u2019s work and 60 years of its own existence. It started in an empty hardware store as a Junior League project. Many dazzling, fund-raising balls later, supporters hired Mr. Barnes. His Fort Lauderdale gem opened in 1986. In 2008, the museum merged with Nova Southeastern University.\n\nMs. Clearwater was a curator in New York. Then, for 16 years, she ran the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami. She helped build South Florida\u2019s art world and bring Art Basel to Miami Beach. She moved to Fort Lauderdale four years ago. JOSEPH B.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "Johnson\u2019s advisers understood that the primaries were mostly of symbolic importance. In 1968 only 15 states selected their delegates by popular vote. Roughly 60 percent of convention delegates were chosen by party bosses, and the bosses almost always stood by the incumbent. Nevertheless, as one top White House aide, Harry McPherson, told the president in a memo, they were staring down the barrel of a change election, and as \u201cthe incumbent president you are (to some degree, at least) the natural defender of the status quo. You represent things as they are \u2014 the course we are following, the policies and programs we have chosen.\u201d Standing against change, he added, \u201cis a tough position today.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt first, McCarthy did little to rattle the president\u2019s campaign. There was a good reason he was Lowenstein\u2019s last call. Though he had won election five times to the House and twice to the Senate, he was a cold, aloof character who preferred to hole up in his Senate office, reading poetry, rather than glad-hand in the cloakroom.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he proved an uninspiring candidate. He refused to appear before the multitude of state organizing conferences that were desperate to meet their newly anointed opposition candidate. Disengaged from campaign strategy and unfamiliar with many of the staff members and local activists whom Lowenstein recruited for the effort, he had to be dragged into canvassing on his own behalf. During his two-week campaign swing through New Hampshire, he regularly failed to show up at his own events and declined to make appearances at factory gates (\u201cI\u2019m not really a morning person,\u201d he demurred). When Johnny Carson, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight Show,\u201d asked what kind of president he might be, McCarthy offered simply, \u201cI think I would be adequate.\u201d\n\nBut then, on Jan. 30, 1968, the political winds shifted. Some 67,000 North Vietnamese troops and Vietcong attacked South Vietnamese cities and military facilities at the start of Tet, the celebration of the Vietnamese new year. They suffered crippling troop losses, but the offensive, which lasted several weeks, led many Americans to doubt the administration\u2019s repeated assurances that the generals could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Support for the war plummeted, and antiwar activists who had long represented minority opinion now saw an opportunity to seize the political offensive. Suddenly the unthinkable seemed possible.\n\nIf McCarthy was disengaged, his young staff and volunteers were anything but. From their headquarters at the Sheraton-Wayfarer Hotel in Manchester, N.H., Richard Goodwin \u2014 a former Johnson aide turned fervent critic of the war \u2014 assumed day-to-day control over the ragtag, amateur operation. Suddenly there were professional and disciplined radio and television spots saturating New Hampshire\u2019s airwaves and a robust field operation well suited to that state\u2019s peculiar brand of retail politics.\n\nStudents from Harvard, Yale, Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke and other New England colleges flooded the state. \u201cThey came with sleeping bags and ski boots,\u201d White wrote. \u201cBearded students had sacrificed their beards so as not to alarm the citizens on their rounds; bluejeans and sweatshirts were also proscribed.\u201d They were, as the slogan went, \u201cClean for Gene.\u201d\n\nSympathetic locals housed them in spare bedrooms, in church and synagogue basements, and on living room floors. \u201cThese college kids are fabulous,\u201d the chairman of the Nashua Democratic City Committee crowed. \u201cThere are so many people who have kids of their own of the same age, and they can\u2019t talk to their own kids, it\u2019s another generation. These kids knock at the door, and come in politely, and actually want to talk to grown-ups, and people are delighted.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The campaign season ended with Kennedy\u2019s assassination that June and with the fractious, debilitating Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which delivered the nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey.\n\nThe myth of Eugene McCarthy\u2019s New Hampshire crusade (and, somewhat related, the mystique of the New Hampshire presidential primary) has endured through the ages. To be sure, what his student army accomplished was remarkable. But did the results suggest a repudiation of the war in Vietnam? Not exactly. Exit polls suggested that a majority of McCarthy\u2019s New Hampshire voters thought of themselves as hawks. They were unhappy with Johnson, but because he hadn\u2019t escalated the war effort further, and they picked McCarthy to register their displeasure. The president\u2019s private polling revealed that 55 percent of McCarthy\u2019s supporters favored the bombing campaign against North Vietnam; only 29 percent opposed it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known as a war president,\u201d Johnson insisted in the summer of 1965. He vividly recalled how the exigencies of mobilization had forced his idol, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to transform himself from \u201cDr. New Deal\u201d to \u201cDr. Win the War,\u201d effectively drawing to a close a decade of liberal domestic reform. It was the story of every Democratic president in the 20th century, from Woodrow Wilson, who sidelined progressive economic and social reform after America entered the European conflict, to Harry Truman, who became bogged down in Korea and ultimately spent down his political capital to raise armies and manage a wartime economy rather than pursue his Fair Deal programs.\n\nYet, as he later rued, Johnson ultimately \u201cleft the woman I love \u2014 the Great Society \u2014 in order to fight that bitch of a war.\u201d\n\nHe did so in large part out of realism and fear. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go in now and they show later that I should have,\u201d he worried, the Republicans would push \u201cVietnam up my ass every time.\u201d This wasn\u2019t an unreasonable concern. A majority of the electorate remained committed to Cold War ideology well into the last year of his presidency \u2014 an ideology that made withdrawal unthinkable. As easy as it was then, or is now, to blame the war on one man, in reality, a large portion of the country demanded it, including most of the experts.\n\nThe McCarthy myth has misled historians and the public into believing that the country reached a turning point on the war in 1968. But Richard Nixon\u2019s victory that fall was of a piece with the votes that propelled an uninspiring Minnesota senator to a freak near-victory over the president earlier in the year \u2014 a frustration as much with the limits on the war as with its excesses.", "title": "The Myth of Eugene McCarthy", "authors": ["Joshua Zeitz"]}

Get your hands on a printed issue of NME, or lose out.\n\nAt Sounds, I had worked with the writer James Brown, and when I returned to Britain in 1985, he had moved to the NME as its features editor. He called me and said, \u201cWe know a lot about the Smiths and Marxist politics, but we don\u2019t know enough about rock music. Can you come and write some stuff for us at the NME?\u201d\n\nA front cover at the NME was considered a serious prize, both for an artist and for a writer. I fought hard to get the cover of the NME for Nirvana. In 1991, the band were breaking big in America, but they had yet to have the same impact in Britain. Before the age of high-speed digital hype, a band could become a phenomenon in one part of the world, but remain underground and virtually unknown in other territories.\n\nThe NME\u2019s editor, Danny Kelly, understood my belief in the band, and when two cover stories with Sonic Youth and the Cure fell through, he called me and said: \u201cYou have 48 hours to find Nirvana, get the interview and deliver 3,000 words to me. It better be the best thing you\u2019ve ever written.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNirvana were touring in Britain, and I interviewed them in a shabby hotel in the Bayswater district of London. Dave Grohl was goofing around, tossing cigarettes in the air and trying to catch them between his lips. Kurt Cobain was in real pain with stomach ulcers, and only interested in talking about women\u2019s rights. Krist Novoselic made some very astute political comments. None of them wanted to talk with me about their new album, \u201cNevermind.\u201d At all.\n\nI raced home afterward and transcribed the interview word for word from my cassette recorder. I spread the pages all over the floor of my bedroom, and sat before the flickering green screen of an Amstrad word processor for the next 30 hours with a stash of Marlboro reds, Jack Daniels and black coffee, trying to temper my emotions and write something Mr. Kelly would consider incisive enough to make a cover story.\n\nThe NME\u2019s office was situated on the 26th floor of an ugly tower block on London\u2019s South Bank. The place was loud, rowdy and full of joy. The wages were pitiful and the deadlines were brutal, but the NME was our whole world and we loved it. There was relentless sparring about headlines, about how much space on a page to give to photographs over written copy, and of course, about the artists we should be championing.\n\nCentral to the remit of the NME was the idea that we wanted to tell our readers something they didn\u2019t already know. We had a rule about never putting the same band on the cover twice in a year. A furious row broke out about the suggestion that the Stone Roses, at their peak, may get a second cover within 12 months, which divided us completely. Should we make this exception? Or would it set a new precedent that nobody wanted. (The Stone Roses got a second cover; the band deserved it.)\n\nWhat united us as a team was a commitment to making what we believed was the greatest music paper on Earth. Our work was unapologetic, confrontational, progressive and poetic, and the unique identity of each writer gave NME its rich diversity of ideas and perspectives. I will still read everything on any topic that I see written by my teen-hero Paul Morley, and also by Stuart Maconie, David Quantick, James Brown, Barbara Ellen and Steve Lamacq, all of whom I worked alongside.\n\nIn 2018, it\u2019s very simple to access music media online: There are blogs, streaming sites, and even algorithms to hold your hand if you feel faint at all the choices you could make. But there will be a melancholy feeling among all of us who read the paper in its glory days to see the printed NME retired, because those dirty pages remind us of the fury of youth and of the feeling of belonging that comes with being present and physically engaged.", "title": "The NME Bows Out of Print.

Start with the shots they are choosing. Brooklyn is taking 41 percent of its shots from 3-point range, second only to the mad-bombing Rockets. They are not shooting the 3s all that well, but they are hitting enough, 796 so far, that the extra points are adding up. Along the same lines, they are avoiding that most dreaded of shots, the long 2, taking only 7 percent of their shots from that inefficient range, second again to the Rockets.\n\nAs you might expect, they top the league in few categories, but are eminently respectable in a few key ones that are often overlooked: The team ranks 12th in getting to the free-throw line and defensively is 12th in opponent\u2019s effective field-goal percentage.\n\nCrabbe can really shoot from 3, and Dinwiddie can really pass (fifth in the league in assists).

In the three years since its inception, and the year since the release of its debut single, this eight-member group \u2014 based in London and made up of members from all over the world \u2014 has honed a style that\u2019s a rigorous take on D.I.Y., lo-fi indie rock. Its album is a full-spectrum auditory experience, the sound of renegade toys weeping after a bender \u2014 curious, saccharine, unsteady and twee, but not weak.\n\nIt is a wild contrast to the central sound of indie rock from a decade ago \u2014 Arcade Fire, LCD Soundsystem and so on \u2014 which was anthemic and demanding, as swaggering as any doltish arena rock (insomuch as indie rock was, at all, rock, which it sometimes wasn\u2019t). Back then, the music had a chip on its shoulder, but now the calculus has changed. The internet has given voice and lent strength to interiority, and also undermined seriousness. The result is a new sort of indie rock that is chipper, rinky-dink, self-consciously handmade with discount-store melodies and neon attitude. You hear it in Superorganism, as well as in the earnest cabaret soul of Rex Orange County, and also the bedroom confections of Clairo. Each reflects a movement toward pocket-size eccentricity and charm masking high-test pop perfectionism.\n\nOn \u201cSuperorganism,\u201d this sound manifests in a few ways: the slumpy march of \u201cEverybody Wants to Be Famous,\u201d the music-box waltz of \u201cSPRORGNSM,\u201d the oozing thumps of \u201cSomething for Your M.I.N.D.,\u201d which sounds like something from De La Soul\u2019s first album. The arrangements are unclean and confident, though they sometimes slip into messiness (like on \u201cNai\u2019s March\u201d). But more often, they nod to grand-scale pop, like the \u201cGrease\u201d-style interjections on \u201cNight Time.\u201d", "title": "The New Indie Pop: Off-Kilter, Handmade, Whimsical and Emotional", "authors": []}

It is nondescript on purpose. \u201cThe idea,\u201d Mr. Gorham said, \u201cis that its wearer is noticed, not the perfume.\u201d\n\nGlossier, You\n\nThe Glossier aesthetic is all about a glowing bare face and a youthful nonchalance, so it makes sense that the company\u2019s first fragrance is a transparent mist of girlish iris and a warm aromachemical called Ambrette that makes the skin smell milky. The perfumer Frank Voelkl (the man behind the cult hit scent Santal 33), who created You with Dora Baghriche, said that he engineered the scent ($50 for 50 milliliters) as \u201csimplistic but singular. What we are seeing with millennials is they like scent to be personal, not like the big florals.\u201d\n\nMr. Voelkl said that for young consumers, \u201cperfumey\u201d is a dirty word. They want to smell \u201cless complex, and more relatable.\u201d\n\nProenza Schouler, Arizona\n\nThe first foray into fragrance from the dynamic design duo Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, this brand-new bubble-gum-pink liquid is meant to stir the nomadic soul with a light glaze of cactus flower and a velvety undergirding of white musk. The scent ($100 for 50 milliliters) also relies heavily on cashmeran, a New Softie staple ingredient that smells like a fine pashmina and lands on the skin like goose feathers.\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons, Concrete\n\nConcrete, a subdued outing for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, is meant to evoke a city street after it rains. It does this with just one note: an essence of sandalwood, twisted and kneaded until it smells like Silly Putty. This Softie ($165 for 80 milliliters) is the strangest of the bunch, in that it sits close to the body but also smells eerily alien; a metallic tang keeps it interesting.\n\nNomenclature, Holy_Wood\n\nAnother gossamer creation from Mr. Voelkl, Holy_Wood is a showcase for an aromachemical called Clearwood, which the fragrance lab Firmenich calls \u201cthe 21st century\u2019s answer to patchouli.\u201d What it really smells like is the inside of a day spa sauna: immaculate, meditative, vaporous ($195 for 100 milliliters).\n\nGoest Perfumes, Dauphine\n\nJacqueline Steele, the creator of Goest, based Dauphine, an ethereal perfume that smells like almond macarons, on Marie Antoinette\u2019s quiet moments at the palace between gaudy costume balls. \u201cThe concept is extreme cleanliness when cleanliness was coveted; pastries with white sugar when white sugar was an almost abstract luxury object,\u201d Ms. Steele said. The scent ($140 for 60 milliliters) is knowingly innocuous, she said. \u201cMillennials want to show off a sort of luxuriant, well-considered, \u2018well-cared-for-ness\u2019 that doesn\u2019t traffic much in glamour, but still clearly messages wealth and taste.\u201d", "title": "The New Softies", "authors": []}

Beijing wants to build its own technology champions and is encouraging companies to acquire the engineering, expertise and intellectual property from big rivals in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nThe aggressive push has set off alarms in Washington, with policymakers and lawmakers fearful that American giants could lose their edge. President Trump is now building up the country\u2019s defenses, as the government investigates potential violations of American intellectual property rights and intensifies scrutiny of overseas deals.\n\nThe secretive panel that is reviewing the Qualcomm deal, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has taken on a central role in the resistance to Chinese investment. The panel, which is led by the Treasury Department and made up of representatives from multiple agencies, has the authority to block foreign acquisitions of American companies for national security reasons; it has effectively killed several acquisitions linked to Chinese buyers over the past year. Lawmakers are also calling to expand the powers of Cfius to reflect the broader scope of China\u2019s interests.\n\n[ What is Cfius? It is the \u201cultimate regulatory bazooka,\u201d according to an executive who works on mergers and acquisitions. Read more about the panel here \u00bb ]\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration turbocharged it,\u201d Tony Balloon, the head of the corporate China practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said, referring to Cfius. \u201cThere is now a recognition in government that foreign investors, particularly from China, are getting more and more sophisticated on how they get access to technology in the U.S.\u201d\n\nWith Qualcomm, the government has articulated its evolving vision for global economic leadership.\n\nThe company, which is a major supplier to the United States government, is a leading player in the race to build the next generation wireless technology, known as 5G. These high-speed mobile networks will form the infrastructure backbone that ultimately connects home appliances, streetlights and driverless cars to the internet. And Qualcomm\u2019s chips will be in the multitude of devices and machines that will run on those networks.\n\n\u201cHaving a well-known and trusted company hold the dominant role that Qualcomm does in the telecommunications infrastructure provides significant confidence in the integrity of such infrastructure as it relates to national security,\u201d the Treasury official wrote in the letter.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe government specifically cited Huawei, the Chinese telecom-equipment giant, as a potential competitor that could move into a breach created by a merger. The Chinese company has spent heavily on 5G, and the government said it owns 10 percent of the essential patents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is the new paradigm,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. \u201cThat implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.\u201d\n\nBroadcom said it was cooperating with Cfius, saying it was \u201cmaking the combined company a global leader in critical 5G and other technologies.\u201d Qualcomm, in an earlier statement, said the review was a \u201cvery serious matter.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With Qualcomm, Cfius is taking a proactive role and investigating before an acquisition agreement has even been signed.\n\nCfius has stymied several deals in the past year.\n\nMoneyGram, the money transfer company, and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronics payment company, called off their merger in January, citing regulatory concerns of Cfius. If the deal had gone through, Ant Financial would have had access to reams of financial data, which could have created security problems. Ant Financial has said that consumer data would have stayed in the United States.\n\nLast year, the White House blocked a Chinese-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, which is a supplier to the United States government. China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which was part of the investment group, is owned by state-backed entities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much an expansion of what is considered to be national security,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThis is about China\u2019s efforts to invest and acquire key parts of the U.S. innovation system.\u201d\n\nCfius could soon have even more muscle.\n\nThere is new legislation to broaden the jurisdiction of Cfius; it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Trump administration has expressed support for rewriting the rules governing Cfius, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said last year that the administration was working closely with the House and the Senate.\n\nThe bill, proposed by Senators John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, would give Cfius the authority to assess some types of joint ventures, minority investments and real estate transactions near military bases. The legislation would also widen the definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d slated for potential review to include \u201cemerging technologies that could be essential for maintaining the U.S. technological advantage over countries that pose threats, such as China,\u201d according to a news release on the bill.\n\nAdding to the scrutiny, the United States Trade Representative has also opened an investigation into whether China is \u201charming American intellectual property rights, innovation or technology development.\u201d One concern is that American companies have been forced to hand over technology, create joint ventures and otherwise help homegrown players, in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Qualcomm, for example, has been working with the Chinese government to develop drones, artificial intelligence and mobile technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTechnology companies are stuck in the middle of the fight between the United States and China. While there are concerns about Chinese encroachment, the industry also recognizes that such deals are the price for entry to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Companies have protested the proposed changes to Cfius, saying an expansion of its powers could be misused and that the new definitions of emerging technologies are unclear.\n\nIBM has said the bill would limit the \u201cability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.\u201d The Information Technology Industry Council, a tech trade group, has lobbied against the changes, saying they add complexity for Silicon Valley companies that often have intricate business ties in China.\n\n\u201cThey are between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that is sponsored by technology firms like Microsoft. \u201cThe Chinese government says you have to do this to operate here.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s also unclear whether the gains in New York will be durable. Gang-suppression efforts in other parts of the country rarely show long-term success, in part because teenagers in poor, racially segregated communities will continue to face the challenges of insecurity and hopelessness that drive youth violence.\n\nThrough the New York Police Department\u2019s use of conspiracy cases, these raids cover a wide range of behaviors that are not acts of violence, like marijuana possession. This approach misunderstands the nature of gangs and the dense social networks inhabited by these young people targeted for prosecution. Despite overheated rhetoric from the police, politicians and the media, there is often very little evidence in these conspiracy cases of an organized hierarchical structure to these alleged gangs, which instead are often loose affiliations without purpose beyond socializing and seeking mutual safety.\n\nMost of the raids in New York have been concentrated in and around public housing developments, where teenagers have little choice but to develop continuing relationships, even if those acquaintances are involved in violence. The police claim that because these young people spend time together in a park, were previously arrested together and are seen together in Facebook posts, they are in a well-defined gang engaged in ongoing crime and violence. But that is much too simplistic.\n\nProsecutors rely heavily on these conspiracy charges, not because they involve true criminal enterprises but because they can be used as leverage against defendants. State conspiracy and federal RICO anti-racketeering statutes allow prosecutors to threaten decades of prison time based merely on evidence of associations and potentially unrelated low-level criminal charges from the past.\n\nThe gang designation also usually makes defendants ineligible for bail, giving them a stronger incentive to provide evidence against others or take a plea deal. In many cases, the only evidence against a defendant accused of violence is the testimony of someone in jail hoping to avoid prosecution. Many young people have complained to their public defenders that during questioning, the police have pressured them to hand over social media passwords, even when they have not been charged with a crime and in the absence of a parent or legal representative.\n\nMany of the defendants in the New York City cases are jailed before trial for long periods of time and face possibly decades in prison, even though a vast majority of them are not being accused of actual involvement in violence. That leaves their families to choose either getting evicted from public housing or agreeing that their child will be banned from their home forever. Communities are undermined as young people are forced to testify against their neighbors to avoid prosecution.\n\nInstead of doubling down on gang-suppression policing, New York City should invest in better alternatives. The city supports 18 Cure Violence programs to reduce shootings. The program\u2019s sites, often a substantial portion of the area\u2019s police precinct, rely on community-based \u201cviolence interrupters\u201d who work with young people.

Paulson Jr., departed to be the Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush. Mr. Blankfein, 63, has joked that he intends to die at his desk, but he has signaled to people inside Goldman that he may leave as chief executive as early as this year, according to two people familiar with his thinking.\n\nThe possibility that Mr. Blankfein could soon step away intensified the competition between Mr. Solomon and Mr. Schwartz, who twice pressed the board for an answer in recent months.\n\nFor more than a year \u2014 since Mr. Cohn stepped down as the firm\u2019s president to be the director of the National Economic Council \u2014 Mr. Solomon and Mr. Schwartz, 54, have been auditioning to be Mr. Blankfein\u2019s successor. Each man held the title of president.\n\nLast month, Goldman\u2019s board met at its headquarters and evaluated the two candidates. Mr. Blankfein offered his view, and the directors decided that Mr. Solomon was their man, according to a person who was briefed on the meeting.\n\nThe anticipated elevation of Mr. Solomon, a Goldman veteran who moonlights under the name D.J. D-Sol, spinning electronic-dance music, marks a strategic shift for the bank.\n\nMr. Solomon, a native of Westchester County, N.Y., was a rare outsider to join Goldman as a partner when he was hired from Bear Stearns in 1999. He is a schmoozer who recognizes the importance of projecting a positive, inclusive image of the bank to its clients, its employees and the public.

Its bond-trading business, once a huge component of the firm\u2019s revenue, which hit nearly $1 billion a week in 2009, is now a shadow of its former self. The bank\u2019s limited presence in countries like Saudi Arabia and Mexico has meant Goldman has been left out of some lucrative transactions. And its belated attempts to muscle its way into businesses such as consumer lending have failed to transform the company into a real competitor of commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.\n\nSince his elevation to president was announced in late 2016, Mr. Solomon has been working to address those shortcomings. Last spring, he and Mr. Schwartz presented directors with a plan to generate $5 billion a year in additional revenue starting in the fall of 2020. It called for expanding Goldman\u2019s investment-banking franchise to midsize cities including Dallas and Seattle.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Solomon strayed beyond the traditional mold of a Wall Street power broker. He demanded, for example, that Goldman\u2019s recruiters increase their hiring of women with the goal of eventually reaching total gender parity.\n\nTo many inside Goldman, Mr. Solomon\u2019s ascension was far from a sure thing. Mr. Solomon himself was among the skeptics; associates said that he had told them that the top job was Mr. Schwartz\u2019s to lose.\n\nMr. Schwartz, who had been Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, knew the firm\u2019s business model cold and had played a central role in the firm\u2019s trading business during its heyday. Mr. Solomon, on the other hand, had won the respect of the banking division but was less well known in other parts of the bank.\n\nFor the past year, the relationship between Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Solomon has been chilly at times. They had never been close personally and, while striving to work together professionally, subordinates could tell that both men knew they were in the midst of a horse race.\n\nMr. Schwartz recently confided to friends that he was worried about being \u201cGary\u2019ed,\u201d said people familiar with the conversations. It was a reference to what happened to Mr. Cohn, who remained Goldman\u2019s president for more than 10 years in hopes of taking over from Mr. Blankfein, before joining the Trump administration.\n\nLate last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schwartz reiterated his demand to Mr. Ogunlesi this year, the people said.\n\nThe move didn\u2019t work as intended. On Feb. 21, during a meeting at Goldman\u2019s headquarters, the board took up the succession question in earnest. Mr. Blankfein expressed his preference for Mr. Solomon, said the person who was briefed on the meeting, and the board agreed.\n\nMr. Blankfein then left for a business trip to Asia and didn\u2019t tell Mr. Solomon the news for more than a week. Mr. Schwartz was notified last week. He immediately decided to retire, capping a career that started on Black Monday, the day in October 1987 when the stock market plunged 22 percent.\n\nMr. Blankfein announced Mr. Schwartz\u2019s exit and Mr. Solomon\u2019s promotion to be the firm\u2019s sole president at a weekly management committee early Monday morning, according to people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDuring the gathering, Mr. Blankfein also equivocated on his own time frame for retiring.

On his first day, he arrived at his new office and found a manila folder on his desk. Inside it was a scouting report, compiled by Sister Jean, detailing the strengths and weaknesses of each player he had inherited.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe scouting reports haven\u2019t stopped. Day after day, season after season, Sister Jean pores over box scores of Loyola\u2019s upcoming opponents, weighing what she finds against her insider\u2019s knowledge of Loyola\u2019s players. She is careful to note the smallest of details, which she conveys when she stands in a huddle to pray with her arms wrapped around players\u2019 waists. The moments, she said, are not as holy as some might guess: In between invocations, she also warns the players to watch out for the opponent\u2019s top performers.\n\nBut it is there, in the huddle, surrounded by players who tower over her, that Sister Jean says she can feel the goodness of the players enveloping her.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very special, and they\u2019re very good,\u201d she said. \u201cThese kids play with their hearts and their heads because they love their school and because they love basketball.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter each Loyola game, Sister Jean sends emails to Moser, to his coaching staff and then to each player. She limits her written words to the team to only a few paragraphs, she said, but then always adds a personalized message congratulating a player for his performance or encouraging the downtrodden.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been days throughout my last four years when I had a bad game, a down game,\u201d the Loyola senior Donte Ingram said. \u201cWe might have won. We might have lost. But at the end of the message, she always found a way to make me feel better.\u201d\n\nBefore she fell and broke her left hip on Nov. 14, Sister Jean had missed only two Loyola home games since 1994. She typically makes her way around campus in a pair of custom maroon basketball sneakers with her name stitched in gold thread on the back. When she was forced to miss eight home games this season after surgery to repair her hip, Sister Jean followed the play-by-play of Ramblers games on her iPad, envisioning each play without the luxury of a video feed.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd despite her absence, the prayers, the emails and the scouting reports never missed a beat.\n\nRestricted to a wheelchair, she even made her way to St. Louis to watch \u2014 and pray \u2014 as Loyola won the Missouri Valley Conference tournament title.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI promised God a lot of stuff,\u201d she said of her nonstop prayers during the final. \u201cSo I had to take care of that before I went to sleep that night.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She took copious notes throughout the television broadcast that announced the brackets, and she cried tears of joy when Moser and the Ramblers learned that they would be the 11th seed in the South Region, matched against Miami (Fla.) (22-9) on Thursday in Dallas.\n\nWith one more medical clearance from doctors, Sister Jean plans to head to Texas to cheer on her beloved Ramblers. If her health prevents the trip, she said, she will watch on television. It is the same way she watched Loyola\u2019s greatest basketball moment: a 60-58 victory over two-time defending champion Cincinnati in the 1963 national championship game.\n\n\u201cI know she\u2019s going to be there with us in prayer and cheering us on,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cAnd that means a lot to us.\u201d", "title": "The Nun in Loyola-Chicago\u2019s Huddle Has a Few Things to Say", "authors": ["Jeff Arnold"]}

The former network executive Preston Beckman \u2014 known on Twitter as \u201cthe Masked Scheduler\u201d \u2014 noted in a blog post that Fox probably intentionally showed it on Sunday night to counterprogram ABC\u2019s premiere of the revived \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d (\u201cThey probably don\u2019t want egg on their face if \u2018AI\u2019 returns with an impressive number,\u201d he said.)\n\nIn interviews leading up to the broadcast, both Ms. O\u2019Brien and Mr. Wrong stressed that Mr. Simpson didn\u2019t get a dime for this special. He was reportedly paid $800,000 for the book \u201cIf I Did It\u201d in 2006, but got no money for the interview then, according to Fox. Fox, on the other hand, definitely stands to benefit \u2014 which was one of the complaints levied before the broadcast was scrapped the first time.\n\nFox, Ms. Regan, Ms. O\u2019Brien and Mr. Darden have all insisted that \u201cThe Lost Confession\u201d is a vital document in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. The special was framed as a look inside the mind of a domestic abuser, and perhaps a warning to any woman who might be in a relationship with someone who talks the way Mr. Simpson does in the interview. Mr. Wrong also made sure to point out that unlike in 2006, the Brown and Goldman families gave their blessing to show this footage, ostensibly because they believe it makes Mr. Simpson look guilty.\n\nDoes O.J. Come Clean?\n\nIt certainly seemed that way. Bear in mind that this interview has been edited down from about four hours (according to Ms. Regan, in promos Fox sent to TV critics), and that throughout Mr. Simpson is referring to the \u201chypothetical\u201d confession in the book \u201cIf I Did It.\u201d In the six minutes in which he talks about the murders, he describes being on the scene with a friend named Charlie \u2014 whom the panel believes was just a voice inside his head. It\u2019s all very odd.\n\nThat said, when Mr. Simpson describes grabbing a knife (\u201cI do remember that part,\u201d he says), and recalls seeing copious amounts of blood, it doesn\u2019t sound all that hypothetical. The interview goes on to cover the aftermath of the crime \u2014 including the infamous Bronco chase \u2014 and Ms. Regan\u2019s questioning about what was going through Mr. Simpson\u2019s mind at that time keeps steering him toward explaining his feelings of anger, frustration, depression and yes, guilt.\n\n[ALSO READ: The O.J. Simpson Murder Trial, as Covered by the Times]\n\n\u201cThe Lost Confession\u201d also offers a glimpse into its subject\u2019s character. It\u2019s fascinating to see Mr. Simpson blasting the media, all while frequently reminding Ms. Regan of his past reputation as a successful and popular guy. He seems to cling to every half-truth about his relationship with Ms. Brown that makes him look like he\u2019s the real victim.", "title": "The O.J.

Not according to your critics. We live in the age of guilt by pull-quote, abetted by a combination of lazy journalism, gullible readership, missing context, and technologies that make our every ill-considered utterance instantly accessible and utterly indelible. I jumped at your abortion comment, but for heaven\u2019s sake, it was a tweet. When you write a whole book on the need to execute the tens of millions of American women who\u2019ve had abortions, then I\u2019ll worry.\n\nWe also live in an age \u2014 another one \u2014 of excommunication. This is ugly because its spirit is illiberal, and odd, because its consequences are negligible. Should The Atlantic foolishly succumb to pressure to rescind your job offer, you\u2019ll still be widely read, presumably at National Review. If you\u2019re really the barbarian your critics claim, you\u2019re already through the gates.\n\nThe real question, then, isn\u2019t what kinds of arguments are \u201cacceptable.\u201d It\u2019s what kinds are, or ought to be, acceptable to liberals. In The Huffington Post, one writer proposes that the answer is none. This is the liberalism of the 9- year-old sticking fingers in his ears and saying: nah-nah-nah-nah-nah. Anyone still wondering how Donald Trump became president need look no further.\n\nThe wiser test of acceptability is whether an argument is thoughtful, thought-provoking and offered in good faith. That holds true even if the views aren\u2019t politically representative. Last I checked, you and I were hired as columnists, not party ideologues or demographic segments.\n\nIt also holds true whether or not a given opinion is offensive. Offensive to tens of millions of intelligent and morally sincere Americans is the idea that abortion ought to be legal at all, much less in the second or third trimester. If those Americans can make their peace with pro-choice writers like me, the least liberals can do is not make war on pro-life writers like you.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there ought to be limitless tolerance for every shade of opinion: There are cranks and haters both left and right, and wise editors should not give them a platform. But your critics show bad faith when they treat an angry tweet or a flippant turn of phrase as proof of moral incorrigibility. Let he who is without a bad tweet, a crap sentence or even a deplorable opinion cast the first stone.\n\nWorse, they foreclose the possibility of learning something useful from someone smart. Learning does not require agreement. There\u2019s a reason this section of the newspaper is labeled \u201cOpinion,\u201d not \u201cAffirmation,\u201d \u201cReinforcement,\u201d or \u201cEmotional Crutch.\u201d Liberals used to know that.

But it was probably inevitable too. After four years in the Miles Davis Quintet, Mr. Coltrane had broken a hole in the parachute and was hurtling somewhere new at terminal speeds. And he was taking the band\u2019s consensus down with him. The live recordings on \u201cThe Final Tour: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6\u201d capture the tenor saxophonist just as he is starting to define the eruptive, gut-emptying style that would eventually revolutionize jazz\u2019s avant-garde. This remarkable new box set spans four concerts from the Davis quintet\u2019s fractious tour, which have been passed around for years in semiofficial packages but have never before received the proper Columbia remaster-and-release treatment. Mr. Coltrane bleats and heaves through his solos, spewing out odd clusters of notes, splitting acrid tones and repeating big windmill patterns until they seem to have broken free of their context. At the Paris show in particular, there\u2019s dissension in the crowd: The audience\u2019s squalling cries are often difficult to decipher (grateful catharsis? pique?). And then you hear something else: Did Wynton Kelly, the group\u2019s sturdily swinging pianist, catch some of Mr. Coltrane\u2019s bug?

On Sunday, Mr. Putin will be \u201cre-elected\u201d to a fourth term as president after a campaign as choreographed (and as dull) as those before.\n\nThough many have pointed out Russia\u2019s underlying weaknesses \u2014 a state-dominated economy eroded by corruption and mismanagement, along with voter malaise \u2014 the inevitable result will nonetheless underscore the resilience of the model he has created.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is a colossus on clay legs is irrelevant,\u201d said Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York and a co-author of the forthcoming book, \u201cIn Putin\u2019s Footsteps.\u201d \u201cPerception is more important than facts.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin, she noted, has mastered the craft of shaping one\u2019s image by imposing state control on the media \u2014 television, above all \u2014 while carefully corralling dissent on the streets and online. No one would have seen it coming in 1999, when Russia\u2019s first president, Boris N. Yeltsin, plucked Mr. Putin, then his unassuming deputy, out of obscurity and made him president. But Mr. Putin has come to embody the post-ideology, post-fact age of reality television and \u201cfake news\u201d that all the world is experiencing.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister of Italy and, now, Donald Trump, he has shown an uncanny ability to harness the harsh glare of public attention to build a devoted following \u2014 to be all things to all people or, as Ms. Khrushcheva put it, to be \u201ca collage of all movies, both villain and hero.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Constitution limits him to one more consecutive term, and far from entering it as a lame duck, Mr. Putin does so with his stature seemingly ascendant.\n\nExcept for an interregnum from 2008 to 2012 when he handed the office, but not actual power, to his loyal aide Dmitri S. Medvedev, Mr. Putin has been in charge since New Year\u2019s Day in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has already led the country longer than Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader best known for the country\u2019s stagnation in the late 1970s and \u201980s. With a new six-year term, he is set to remain in office at least until 2024.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s autocratic tendencies have become self-serving, reinforcing his control of the political and economic levers of power, but they have also evolved.\n\nWhen he first emerged on Russia\u2019s turbulent political scene, he appeared inclined to continue the embrace of the West that Mr. Yeltsin had pursued, however haphazardly. \u201cBy their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in which I participated in 2003. He once said, perhaps a bit rashly, that Russia could even join the NATO alliance.\n\nHe soon soured on European institutions, including NATO and the European Union, which he came to see as irreconcilably opposed to Russian interests.\n\nThe West\u2019s leaders, in his view, unfairly denounced Russia\u2019s war against Islamic separatists in Chechnya; his crackdowns on the media and the opposition; Russia\u2019s use of natural gas as political leverage; and the suspicious origins of cash flowing from Russia into Western banks and properties.\n\nUltimately, what Mr. Putin most hated was the post-Cold War dominance of the Soviet Union\u2019s old foe: the United States. It began with President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and invasion of Iraq. His opposition to Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was hardly unique; it put him in league with people across the political spectrum who distrusted America\u2019s unbridled use of military power.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

He embraced what in the United States would be the familiar terrain of conservatives: \u201cfamily values.\u201d He crusaded against the moral decline of the West, which he once went so far as to describe as \u201cinfertile and genderless.\u201d\n\nConservatives in the West began to write admiringly of him. In 2013, during rising tensions over the civil war in Syria, Matt Drudge, the conservative blogger, called Mr. Putin \u201cthe leader of the free world,\u201d joining Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing commentators who seemed attracted to Mr. Putin\u2019s willingness to oppose President Barack Obama\u2019s plans to bomb Syria over its use of chemical weapons.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s strongman style and warnings against Western decadence attracted more and more conservative admirers in the United States and beyond. Foremost among them, of course, was Donald Trump.\n\nAlina Polyakova, an expert on far-right populism in Europe at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Mr. Putin was offering to protect national identity against what are viewed as the threats of a liberalizing global world. These \u201cthreats\u201d included, among others, same-sex marriage, immigration and the surrender of political agency to distant international institutions.\n\nIt is a romantic idealization, Ms. Polyakova said, since few in Europe actually want to live in the sort of corrupted political and economic system that Russia has become. It is nonetheless a powerful one.\n\n\u201cIt gives people something solid to hold on to in a world that is becoming intangible,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s tangible. He\u2019s real. He represents a sense of nationhood.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasparov said the West itself shared the blame for Mr. Putin\u2019s enduring appeal as a model of authoritarian leadership. Governments and corporations were too willing to look past his repressive actions against opponents (Mr. Kasparov among them) and the corruption that afflicted the bureaucracy and business. \u201cThe real Putin model of government is nonideological kleptocracy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the free world decided 25 years ago that it was all right to repress your people at home while still enjoying the markets and acceptance of the free world, it was a deal with the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of liberalizing the dictatorships, the influence flowed the other way, spreading corruption and disdain for democratic ways.\u201d", "title": "The Poison Putin Spreads", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers"]}

The White House has denied the affair. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has acknowledged making the payment himself.

I had developed a relationship with her since her days as an activist in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown. Ms. Yates didn\u2019t hold back with me: She has already been open on social media about her struggles within the movement and had a very public falling out with its leaders.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Ms. Garner had a heart attack last year and later died; while she was in a coma, Ms. Yates shared an image on Instagram of a text message exchange in which Ms. Yates encouraged Ms. Garner to not be bothered by people talking negatively about her on social media.\n\n\u201cI have to make clear just how invisible some of the most heinous violence we experience is,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in the Instagram post in December. \u201cHow we are often left alone on the front lines grown cold because media and figureheads move on to the next hot story.\u201d\n\nI asked Ms. Yates, who moved to Oakland a couple of years back to work as an activist full time, if she ever had the urge to just say forget it, and take her college degree and go into a traditional profession. Of course she did, she told me, especially when you see someone dropping dead at 27 of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely scary,\u201d said Ms. Yates, 32. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you want to quit.\u201d\n\nBut more than just reflecting on the difficulties of activism and the trauma that comes with it, Ms. Yates ventured into another area that I had not thought about: self-care.\n\nAs it turns out, taking care of yourself is a big issue in the present movement, unlike in times past. There are trained \u201chealers\u201d in communities who run workshops and do private counseling for activists. Ms. Yates started seeing a therapist about a year ago. She also talked about the things that seem small but can make a big difference for her: going to the ocean, putting her toes in sand, remembering to eat, taking time to talk with her friends about things that have nothing to do with activism. Some of these might seem obvious, but for those immersed in the work, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nAs one reader commented on the story, young activists should temper their expectations for immediate results \u201cand put their personal health first in order to reduce their toxic levels of stress.\u201d\n\nBecause, he added, \u201cstress can kill; emotionally and spiritually, as well as physically.\u201d", "title": "The Quiet Casualties of the Movement for Black Lives", "authors": ["John Eligon"]}

This was to correct decades of damage the federal government caused by encouraging lenders to ignore black areas until the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act in 1968. The Reveal study found that affordable mortgages issued in historically black neighborhoods to comply with the reinvestment act were going to white newcomers instead of longtime black residents. This has accelerated a pattern of gentrification that forces out black residents.\n\nThese problems are rampant throughout the United States. Three years ago, for example, a striking study commissioned by the city of Richmond, Va., found that black applicants were less likely to receive home purchase loans or refinance loans regardless of their incomes.\n\nUpper-income black people were even more likely to be denied loans, as compared to similarly situated whites, than lower income black people were to their white counterparts. This underscored yet again that African-Americans cannot escape economic discrimination simply by becoming wealthier, especially when financial institutions persist in punishing them for living in majority minority neighborhoods. A destructive bill pending in the Senate would deepen this problem by exempting 85 percent of banks from reporting mortgage data that allows regulators and fair housing groups to ensure that home loans are being issued in a nondiscriminatory way.\n\nBy denying African-American families mortgage credit, the financial industry also denies them the opportunity to accumulate household wealth \u2014 part of the reason that white median family net worth is nearly 10 times that of black families. Beyond that, the decision to withhold credit from minority neighborhoods has turned too many of them into hollowed-out areas with high poverty, failing schools, lower property values and a markedly worse quality of life.\n\nNot long ago, fair housing groups that uncovered particularly egregious lending discrimination by banks and mortgage companies could count on federal regulators to curb, at least, the worst forms of predation. But with the federal government rolling back enforcement, state attorneys general will need to band together the way they did to fight off predatory for-profit schools that saddled students with crushing debt for useless degrees.", "title": "Opinion | The Race-Based Mortgage Penalty", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "If anything, there may be a stronger connection between school violence and the sort of creative writing educators seek to foster. When the United States Secret Service and the Department of Education studied violence in schools, they found that 37 percent of attackers \u201cexhibited an interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays, or journal entries,\u201d while only 12 percent exhibited an interest in violent video games.\n\nVideo games do not create murderers. With his Thursday meeting, the president was merely engaging in political distraction.\n\nAnd yet Mr. Trump was absolutely right when he said that \u201cbad things\u201d are happening on the internet. Video games do have a big problem, but it is not stylized virtual violence. Rather, it is the bigotry, social abuse, sexism and other toxic behavior to which players too often subject one another when gaming together online.\n\nIn other words: It\u2019s not the content; it\u2019s the culture.\n\nListen to the voice communications of almost any popular online first-person shooter game and you will hear players constantly using racial and homophobic slurs. Make a mistake in just about any team-based combat game and it won\u2019t be long before one of your teammates chastises you with some vile epithet. There is more than one game community where \u201cJew\u201d is used as a verb, meaning to make money. In many games, women who speak up on voice communications are routinely mocked and harassed.\n\nWhile researchers have devoted ample time to studying the emotional and psychological effects of virtual video game violence, the actual social behavior of players has largely escaped academic attention. That should change. The racism, homophobia and misogyny prevalent in many online game precincts can amount to emotional abuse. This is a phenomenon that needs to be better understood and more widely known.", "title": "Opinion | The Real Problem With Video Games", "authors": []}
